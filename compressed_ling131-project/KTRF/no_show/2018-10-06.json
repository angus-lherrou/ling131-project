and South Asian any plane three F. and and when your allergy me here I don't know\nLike the ... sort of a suspense thriller type of thing um it's a strange guy trees book sell the weird stuff go on your head Tony you had to put on paper\nYou know I tell you that where it came from the idea was that was sitting in an analog blind two years ago and I had a a a tarantula hawk fly in\nTo my mind you know what that is I Do not I know my birds to tell if you don't want no no this is a this is a bug all that they are well they they contract will hawks are ... are and they are and I\nThink they're invasive I'm not sure but there are these giant a black walk okay and they're\nThey're all over out on the prairie out there and one of the things that their their life cycle is they will find a tarantula and the thing it and lay and egg inside of it and so it will paralyze the ... that ... hatch and grow and feed on this paralyzed tranche lawn blocked out of it like aliens style and\nI had one of these things fly into my blind and I texted my buddy I said what is this thing he said that the trench or a hawk\nAnd so I Googled it and it has there's there's this thing called the Schmidt pain index for insects some some dude went out and figured out what are the worst things and bites were from insects and other than the ... down in the Amazon this is number two wow they look they look like it\nTony as we've been talking here I Googled this thing I did not know about a piece of the state insect New Mexico where were you when you saw a southern Colorado I Wonder if they're moving up you know climate change if they're making their way and you know more northern climes\nUh I I don't know that I Know that where I was wasn't that far from New Mexico okay alright and pretty intimidating let me ask you for a man so my and that got my wheels turning 'cause I had to had to kill to the suckers that got stuck in my line okay and it was real unnerving and I thought man what would be\nLike if somebody was scared of bugs or he really wanted to torture somebody sure this would be one heck of a good creature to do it with and so I started thinking about why would anybody ever do that to anyone\nWow and that's where the novel came from so it's\nKeep us posted is that uh that unfolds definitely definitely sounds fashion but hey we we have Tony on periodically really to talk about the hunting especially this time of year Tony we had in mind two weeks ago that the opening weekend he got a nice a block or have you been deer hunting anymore on Wisconsin since then\nYep hunting Wisconsin hunting South Dakota had enough to North Dakota here and just a little bit and coming home for a little bit and then I'm going to Nebraska and then Oklahoma oh man I'm going to hang up that Bo and I and I go hunt segments and Quayle and grouse than anything anything I can with my dog so I'm not in a tree stand okay\nI needed some bear hunting to yup in Wisconsin yeah bear hunting I went into bear bear hunting this year with high hopes to where I where I drew over in Wisconsin and it was tough\nI Know here in Minnesota we had a low harvest yeah actually started out real low ... and I knew over there with the acorn crime and then the big mass jar with a big yeah big time and then the math the soft mass when the apples um I knew it was going to be tough\nBut I didn't know it was going to be that tough I mean I I couldn't I couldn't hardly get a barrier to sniff might be ... I mean there is if there was just no competing against the thousands and thousands of pounds of natural food I mean our um so it was it was tough\nOkay yeah well we were do I think for a pretty good match Geron now that probably has helped or maybe some of the season would duck hunting to them and those ... a scarf with the acorn so I think that\nHelps hold the birds are a little longer maybe has helped with what's on the waterfall hunting and the up this part of the country folks out there listening here we're we're in October now Tony hard to believe this is really prime Bomani month for a lot of people any\nAny words of encouragement for folks any words of advice if they're thinking about uh doing some born\nGotta get out there now this early season stuff a lot of very early October I should say um you know a lot of people will skip it saying they're going to save their dear save their their hot spots for later\nBut Minnesota here it comes and goes so quickly yeah you know we have the early gun opener and so you're kind of banking on Halloween to the first couple of days in November\nAnd you can have a really great hot right now I'm not going to be you know it's not going to be the field that thing that it was two weeks ago typically you got to get into the cover a little bit Hudson staging areas and stuff but it can be a lot of fun right now especially\nYou get one of those cold Front's it rolls in you know get some beer on their\nFeet so get out there right now we're talking a couple three weeks all yet in October around Halloween yeah it's just you know everybody now I should say everybody lots of people thinking oh maybe early ... late ... happened the same time every year typically if I'm picking you know five days where it's just going to it's\nAlmost guaranteed to blow up it's like November seventh through the twelve\nAnything leading up to that from the end of October as it can be awesome but really if you want to see things bust open that's usually when it happens you know because we've had a gun season going on for a few days that changes things a lot\nBut any any time you can get out there toward the end of October ... oh yeah beginning you know you\nGot to be in the woods sure an absolutely does outdoor news radio robs resigning and Tony Peterson catching up here\nAbsolutely there's alternative for Iraq to resign and Tony Peterson catching up here\nAs we're getting really the prime time as to the prime bone in months in ah in Minnesota October is here it's on your way Tony I was chatting with a guy from Alabama\nA month or so ago and I recall bowling in Alabama I think it was in November and I I remember being down our thinking wow this is like Minnesota Wisconsin in late September October yeah and it was like you know it's kind of handy high it's like I got to extend my October you know by going down there\nBut that's something you've ever done a lot of the south a little later in the fall\nOf that the only time\nI've learned I've hunted down there a few times not Alabama upon and taxes being alive never had to Mississippi and I found it Oklahoma you know southern Oklahoma and uh that's where I'll be this year will be there in\nNovember I I've I've got some new public plan I Want to go you know give it a try so I've got eight days in southern Oklahoma planned out so it is kind of cool to get down there and\nYou know there might be snow flying here when you're down right exactly come kind of a sudden you're you're comfortable season yeah I Will say I haven't been down to a few of those states when it was really hot\nAnd and I you know I did it earlier this year at the end of July beginning of August I did a hunt\nFor white pills in Florida 'cause they open up in the summer\nIs I think at the earliest white pillow over ... what's that all about um 'cause they don't they're not dependent on the season that for their own you know the life cycle so they don't need their their farms are fun they're they get dropped here when all everything's screening out everywhere and you know it's just timing\nDown there it's like that every day and so there's food it doesn't it's just not seasonally timed it same thing with the acts of the year in taxes can they come from India and Pakistan they know they don't they're not relying on the secret life but I'll tell you what if you want a miserable yeah experience go on to swamp the Florida in the summer is not non\nThat doesn't sound like a recreation to me to go for it to go to Disney World threat or on a cruise or something to do go Hawaii too\nI don't ... to the beach where you can jump in the water and and cool off that sort of thing there's there's lots of other hunting opportunities around the country but um yeah Alabama and Mississippi I had some some good times on their back in the nineties it felt a lot like Wisconsin a just a little later in the air you kind of thing so\nBut we got a couple of minutes left but when you talked about up one bird hunting and are you ready to make are going to make that transition would get the federal and coming up immediately her going yeah we'd be a professional prone you're still going to\nBe a game that you know I'm I've been mixed and in some ducks and gross and woodcock in the mid day when I've been in Wisconsin especially and then my major bird hunting kind of kicks in about ... November on I Love you know I've kind of rediscovered Minnesota pheasants the last few years I grew up doing that when we had a lot of birds in the nineties and are\nJust kind of bought into an audio\nBought into the belief that we didn't have any birds left and a couple of years ago I started hunting [noise] late season in southwestern Minnesota and Marshall in\nThat area down there and realized that we have a lot more birds that I thought yeah and I love you know for me it's maybe zero two and a half hours three hours to get down there but you know the next year the better there's fewer people out\nAnd that a lot of that public land on there is the best cover around threat and so those birds you know it's a different deal on the the opener you know and but when you get some snow flying and it gets cold knows birds they like those cat till germs and bad it can be a lot of fun\nWell and you know so even if there's not a lot of birds down or the birds are there are concentrated in some of that quality of clients cover and yeah and I'm now we certainly don't have the birds we did bought a decade ago twelve years ago mid to thousands I mean what that was a neat thing we had gone that she or he was picking up on I keep hoping we're going to turn it around and do\nYou get that back but so far so it doesn't seem to be happening so like I said we we got a prime month of October any closing thoughts are on on hunting October just get out there and um what's your perfect tree stand for for hunting the rock can any any sort of tip like that you can provide\nListeners telling me that's a broad question I mean anywhere that's anywhere where the train funneled from kind of movement okay you know you're you're you're dealing with pinch points and and finals are still\nA fair amount of crops up you know the crops really come down this month\nYup personally I Would rather be on water on the ... river crossing creek crossing summer and you know 'cause then then you can play off of there's usually only so many pots across the river yeah they love to drink when they're chase and then you can just you can combine a few things they're usually in the cover not a big field edge guy\nFor most of most times of the year and so anything anything you can get out there that's on open movement All right you know\nGood advice will Tony thanks for coming in the present you spend a few minutes with us and good luck here as a as October unfolds or thank you I Am from Tony Peterson read them online at ... dot com what's a break or more of the

to kill in any walls\nAnd they seem to think that it's kind of one of those deals warrior will balance itself I never does I think it actually there's going to have to be some shooting involved here on both sides for it to maintain balance\nI don't have a problem with that especially now that we've kind of altered the dynamic by putting laws into the system and it it's not completely natural

basically canoeing and you're shooting a moose and you're not quarter you you're a thing it or six feet thing it yeah these things\nWell yeah and and your hauling it out and multiple trips yeah and

minutes and hope and one of them ...\nAnd one of the dogs but you know it's it's it could easily be a wilderness hunter thing is is that you know you could bowed out there you can walk up you can

of Audi Murphy\nAlready Murphy was born on June twentieth Nineteen twenty five and he was born in a little town called Kingston, Texas his parents were sharecroppers and um that means that they picked cotton\nIn fields but they didn't own the fields the fields were owned by someone else\nAnd in return for working all they got was a a little shack to live and and a tiny little bit of the money that they are and everything else went to the owner of the field\nThe house they lived in was no more than a little shack it had no running water no bathrooms no electricity they had twelve children altogether and as soon as the kids were old enough\nMaybe four or five years old they went to work in the cotton fields with their parents or the later said that he just worked and that it was a fulltime job just existing in fact when Audi was\nBorn his mother Josie couldn't take\nTime off to take care of the baby so she put them in a baby swing\nAnd took him out in the cotton fields with her father his name was and that and and then\nHe was pretty lazy more interested in in gambling and having a good time and the only time they\nGot any meat to eat was if Audi and his brothers went out and hunted them a neighbor once led Audi his gun and it had eight bullets in it and what he went hunting came back with four rabbits and four bullets still left in the gun that's how good a shot he was\nHere's Audie sister the dean Murphy [noise]\nThe little twenty two I don't know we're seeing this really good at\nMaking killer rabbit on the ... well that's how we that's how we ... days that's

profound way\nTimes we're beginning to unfold on wood shape is destiny forever the country was in the throes of the great depression at one point things got so bad for the Murphy's that they moved into a railroad boxcar\nWhen he was Thirteen Years old father left the family and he never came back so now what he had to step up and be the man of the house and in order to do that he had to quit school\nSo he never got farther than the fifth grade\nBut the person that was hardest hit and the family was his mother Josie and in Nineteen forty one she died of pneumonia and he said early death was not unusual in the story of a share cropper family a particularly when the share cropper himself runs off leaving his wife to take care of their children\n[noise] anyway so what he was only sixteen he had younger sisters and a brother to take care of it and he couldn't take care of them because he had to work\nToday were sent to an orphanage and then everything changed\nHere's Murphy

welcome back to the Senate traveled ... coach quarter program we're going to talk more football now I visit would break Lincoln had goats are probably a football team and you know we've got to be Saturday mornings I keep saying oh I'm old\nThat it's the grind that's for sure but um you know I was um I think it was our effort and the kids fighting battles last night and um last night you know I don't think the score is indicative of how close to a game wants to be honest will\nUltimately and we talked about this when you first came in I talked about it on the post game show last night at this game turned in about five minutes sequence\nIn the latter part of the first quarter early in the second quarter\nDown six nothing you march of all down a football field nice drive really consisted Dr mixing running path I bought things were going very well you get down to the goal to go\nAnd in an effort to make a big play you end up carpet of football\nAnd that was a chance to go in and tied the game up maybe even take the lead and instead of not only do they recover but then burgers establishes they're up front which they hadn't done to that point in the game goes Ninety seven yards and all of a sudden instead of six six or seven six you it's twelve nothing and the game just turns on a dime\nYeah it really did and and you know you you you again you like you mentioned you can't fold the kid for trying to get in the end zone I mean he's\nHe's battling you know on a second down I think it was a second down to say but you got to bubble abs absolutely and and that's you know turnovers I mean really you look at it I think we have three in the first half and I think they scored on each of those dry eyes if I'm right I'm In the end those are big\nAnd you got to you know secure the ball and even that drive you know the Ninety seven near a guy by the time we did some things okay on defense we gave up I think they had to long third downs that they converted and then the forests down a to score and so you know yeah it's it's um\nYou know the the kids get get frustrated obviously that's coaches are frustrated but um we we gotta make plays you know and when we're positioned we've gotta finish\nEarly on he had a big break you at three and I wanted them up to ... you recovered in their territory and on the first play run it turned out the receivers open looked like it was All right in front of you are right on your side my looked like he turned to go up field before he caught the football and ... up his shoulder pad member defend or make the great\n... and I thought he might have been juggling and out of bounds but that was you know it's a bang bang so you you can't complain too much about that but yeah you know that that there's a there's another another situation where we just got to make plays and and I I Do think they either scored on that next possession or or pin this deep I Can't remember and um and then you know right before they have to um\nYou know it's twelve nothing and and um we're driving I think we've got to the the fifty and then we we put ball on the ground again and and they take over with under two minutes and an important one in and you know so to go into the locker room twelve nothing's a lot different than Eighteen nothing especially how we've been struggling to and\nUm but again I you know I'll give it to our kids a lot of credit or ... week competed embattled and um you know we just got to eliminate those mistakes we are too many penalties too you know I'm\nGoing to say I felt like a broken record left you got our ... yeah\nYeah and that and now it's you know ... some of that's on us coaches to you know we we ... and I thought we skiing really well this week and you know when you schemes so much sometimes you take away um\nYou know our our guys I credit I'm you know we moved ... miles to free safety and miles is getting guys lined up and\nUm you know a Rodney King untie Johnson they were running around in the field and I'm I'm sure sometimes you're like what's going on and and they were just adjusting 'cause we because we uh we game plan for their different formations and I thought you know for the most part we did real well I'm\nYou know Robby king ah it wasn't real aggressive early on and and we had to get on them and and um I thought he played a a whale of a game and\nAnd ties been working hard and you know call Miller made some plays inside and and then you know call Johnson as I thought he had the best of all I agree and and both sides of the blank too and I'm In and he's just a competitor and you know um\nAnd you know obviously I'm missing a few guys too but you know our guys just competed and that's what you got to ask you know we were without John Berry last night I garden named Marcel steps in and and and as a nice job and they helped on defense too and\nUm you know we just got to keep coming together and all the seasons winding down but dumb playoffs you know and the kids we know we're going to start focusing on playoffs you know obviously it's one game of the time but\nYou know I'm you know we've got to be ready so people will creep grind and\nI thought the big get in the middle on defense at a knife might do old yeah he\nDid you know and and you know he was really upset with himself to jumping off side once in a while but um yeah he he battled and and he's he's fun to have around and um he's he's going to be a U.S as a staple there for us next year or two and um but yeah we you know he he did really well and um\nYou know I thought defensively we'd probably one of our better games too I just thought you know they had some long drives but um I I counted we had we had ten a tackle for law says you know and they're converting after that that's what we got to eliminate but um yeah we can get things together will be All right and and you know next week we'll all be any easier for\nWe can get things together will be All right and and you know next week we'll all be any easier\nFor the other thing that I saw last night and and for the most part you're defender was there it wasn't like you without a position but boy they dropped the ball over the top three or four times last night I think foreign students especially completed three of them on the sidelines\nAnd just a well throwing ball by the quarterback or a great route and the great route adjustment by the receiver\nAnd the only thing I could think of is say if maybe we didn't turn our heads but but ultimately a part of your kids were right there yeah they were and\nAnd you know I think the one he did during his head and and and just just barely missed the the ball in the Balkans just right and you know and and they made some nice\nPlays on we'll all thrown play absolutely and you know what I think all all of those were third downs too you know and and that's where it comes you know we gotta we gotta make plays and opportunities are there and um unfortunately they made made those and um but yeah you know that's a we're in position we just got to make the play you know\nYeah I'm sure when you get that close to ... play in the middle up at the lego and I might have to kick here in the second yeah you'll all I Know and and\nAnd and and in warm ups he was just money down there and and then uh you know ... is a nice job for us on a fence and ... and filling in on defense and\nI'm I'm sure he was getting ... let's get this and so I can get get my name in the paper with that and then it pointed um but that's you know yeah and you know not having ... you know hopefully he'll be back next week is just out with illness and so\nOn and do you like going around town with around that some\nMiss some miss practices and stuff too and you know that's all part of it and at on the school work which you know we stress too and um you know it's it's kids but what what great opportunity for kids that to handle stress and you know and and they they got to learn that because we all know as adults who are going to have a lot more stress than what they go through in high school\nI thought I thought you're passing game was that was better last night you checked out and in a room wander routes and things like that unfortunately you didn't get the rec yards you were looking for a ferocious close very nicely on your receipt and\nYou know what a yeah I I'd I'd grant grant probably through as well as he has a you know all I mean he through some tough balls to that you know I found a few of them should have been caught and um you know that's all part of it but yeah they they tackled well you know we we had some one on one stuff and and they made the play and a few minutes box on a few too and um\nBut yeah you know we just got to keep working the passing game and and bring along the the run game to cause I I was ... you know I that's what I thought I thought our line played as well as we had and and granted get Zack last night which was was great and they brought some pressure sometimes too so I'm\nAlso ulterior motive for making October parents and on the show is a we have our sixth annual lives as doing next week which is it's basically an alumni duo but we do have some other names that people will have heard of from outside the or from from the area that all making the parents as well\nAnd we were going to actually try something ... this year I don't think it's going to happen now but we were planning on having the event outdoors\nUm where they have the highest pretty ... it's probably not going to happen I think we're looking at they had to be a probably about sixty degrees to really feel safe doing it but if it would have been weather we've had some years in October um we roll to map out where the high jump is our sons and field and um there's bleachers out there and also would have been in\nA nice setting I'm if anybody's trying to get a visual what that would look like at the D. one level just ah\nTo Google Search for grasp on the grid iron I oversaw almost eight twenty Fifteen ... we want to say one thousand people and wouldn't have that kind of draw but but it's still be a nice uh\nIt's becoming more of a trend in college wrestling that have tried to have an outdoor event if you can for us it has to be in October um there's no way we do anything in November it'd be colder\nYeah if ... if you'd have to have a like a tense or something and heaters but\nUltimately I as a as I look at the schedule with the legends dual you have at least three other dates it at home at least on the schedule for now and that's always good to get a few more homey homey ... have been a premium\nYeah they happen and it seems like well we've we've never for for them to meet 'em where we didn't make the trip but it seemed like it doesn't always happen to the other way around they don't like to come this far 'cause they don't come as far as it's apparently further north than it has to go south and tape measure up different you know when it goes north so\nI'm Minnesota west we're actually supposed to have them this year at our place but\nJust looking at future schedules and the fact then we'd have to have all four conference tools on the road next year\nI'm after really thinking about as I figure we could work that do meet into a I'm paired up with another tournament and you get two trips and the one so we're actually going in Minnesota west in January a couple of days before the Bridgewater open soul\nMaximize their travel that way but then we have a task is going to be a home right now it's looking like that will be December sex originally it was set for February seventh and that was the same night as the\nUm ... have been a nice double header however they push the date of our district tournament it was\nNational got moved to a week later this year so originally they schedule but this current weak letter but nobody told our region office\nBut the district tournaments and rise yeah and so then one of the coaches proposed a sticking with the date that they had a region office and we're going to now we'll have basically two weeks off between read or the district a national\nSo and we're going now we'll have basically two weeks off between read or the district to nationals that could be okay to get healthy to be a ... there's pros and cons I think that you know we we can use it wisely and get guys healthy if they're banged up um if they're healthy we can actually train differently maybe have a secondary peek a national so\nOn but we had to move that date for the task of dual from February seventh looking like December six will be the rescheduled\nThat ultimately when when you look at this schedule this goes by in a hurry there's a lot on there but it's going to go by quick and win with the success of football team is having a realistically when do you anticipate that the rest of the guys in the room\nI'm very question last year on a roller joined anywhere you can send a letter and our and our seasons three fourths done when we get to January there's a lot of guys feel like that's the halfway point but for us really being that we were weren't postseason once we get February so we have one month from ... or\nSo away at that point that those guys that are going to join you're a little bit behind the eight ball because we haven't been in the room much that the negative the positive they should be in shape right\nAnd we'll ... last year I think what helped with hunter he he was in decent shape it took them a few about half a week I Would say to get to where you know because he Russell after one week or practice\nUm so took the three days where he was really fast and then by that first tournament he seemed like he had already gotten up to speed\nUm but the other thing is there's maybe a little less wear and tear on he stayed out of some of these bigger tournaments in the pre season that tend to be a grind so you know some some schools have actually gone to a just an wrestling or the one semester sport and\nHe was he was a case where it worked out really well for him to do just one semester I I have told hunter um\nI think there's a chance that if he were wrestled the fall season\nHe could have been all American so I mean there's there's a different side to that too I think he had he may be stayed a little healthier only be be wrestling in a few tournaments but he also lost uh some of the just the repetition that you get um wrestling throughout the pre season throughout the\nThe fall open tournament schedule because of an American to be a little more map time let's\nGo folks get legends dual is next Saturday one week from today three o'clock in the afternoon talk\nIn the afternoon um I Would say Ninety nine percent chance that will be in the north when Jim one percent chance it will be at once and field so well update every body of for some reason we get an extreme event of a sudden they're worth up again yeah if we get some some hot air coming from the south or we might be outside but it's not ... percent chance of being the gym\nUm some of our alumni battle for sure be there at this point Craig Williams Jordan hanging up all Americans that we had in the past\nUh Brett Sherman who was on that first team he's planning on attending and competing a lot of guys from the previous two seasons are coming back\nUm are heavily the two time national Crawford doesn't Bradford is\nUm as an albino returned he said he just started a new job so he might have had to cancel the last minute I'm but I'm hoping he can come back we have a really good with this year and I'd like to see those who get addict as a hundred but go ahead with this year as a state champs from Fargo babies so he's he's really look great in practice so far\nSo they should be a lot of fun and a good way for both get an early look at the pioneers to correct his all next Saturday legend dual three o'clock at north when and if we get to go outside we'll let you know I I'm looking forward to that with the with the numbers you have it should be an exciting here\nYes so I think it has you know you always knock on wood and injuries and staying healthy and academically on the right side of eligibility\nSo it'll be good for Mormon states figured out how cold it if you're not coming back after yeah I don't know if

Alex got better right around three thirty four o'clock\nAnd they were down around five thirty I it it probably kept on going um we ended up playing around seven o'clock there wasn't too bad but it was it was a long day for a girl waiting around\nUltimately though Alexandria the team to buy this you should have played and things worked out just fine\nYeah Alex is a very solid team I got to give them a lot of credit for better than what is it really helped our girls and the center for singles through single\nTwo to three of us know when he came on and off the street that when you all for those spots and I believe in the newspaper talk quite a bit about how um you got those four spots are each group before any of our um top players when I was at one single piece in Logan at one level so we have a\nMac which was a kid and when you want to prefer to eat before he could really got going\nYeah that point to pressure was offered you could just relax and play\nYeah it's either I'm from Gail in over in the civil side this week the pressure 'em knowing that they can just go up there in battle it out and they get exactly that and that one ... one double such era businessman which actually end up in the long run out the CD for individual fat\nI'm yeah everyone played well um he took care of everybody they take care of so\nSpeaking of the individual sided started yesterday you know and again pretty good results for you\nYeah absolutely um on the fate or somehow to force each you walk through both girls actually I'm the first one to play the algae are either New Year's similar results\nUm only gave up a couple of games took her half hour and a crazy part of ... typically crazy hour and a half to two and a half hour master she's conducting a masters or thirty forty five minutes you know\nA ... a Katrina ... from Moorhead and they've had a battle and I know it was just focused\nAnd ready to go and she'll be moving on today and also it's actually pretty much um Brooklyn both at the battle it pretty or a single parent but as well um she hasn't had a whole lot of those but with a ... style um she battled without any ... on the short end of it or teach you did what you do\nAnd then the double sided double whammy played really I was gonna say had been to the double side you played really well\nYeah absolutely the double sided was we were aggressively smart Brannon daily I'm not going to be an athlete and drug pregnancy colored yet they play the ... with the Colorado every year and I'm not the end of the select few years I think is a great ... individually for them\nAnd they went out battling with won't scare and how you can bring to the number on the bay did exactly what they do in order for it but I think they're they walk up their heads held high\nCalling dollar you know like I told you before there are a freight train up to the heart directly with 'em\nThey're coming up pretty late and they took care to really good players in artifacts and I'm so excited to see how far they yelled and Iraqi government\nNow today for Emma and for Chloe and belly really comes down to positioning for next week you start 'til they're in but now it's the positioning portion\nYep yep so now everything from now and I was just is eating a PR next week one will pay for to replace three three or ... or by one hockey brackets you know north and south\nSo I'm going to have to ... keep your ball into the into the house in from the ... who's going to go on to 'em and\n... they're going to have to be exactly what they did yesterday they said some code breaker X ray smart but if I did it yesterday both the girls will be just finding a shooting like workout enough a written\nNext week to things start to get on the twelfth right\nThat's correct yep we play fully was a\nVery solid team that's the key terminology thirty I'm at ... you could call that now or something like that it was the old gold's gym um the girls would be a really good job it's competitive I'm going to expect probably at two to four hour match um just because they have for court but it's going to be a battle all down to it\nAnd then a singles doubles the same day or in in the next day\nBut first important news on the healthcare front this week in Minnesota and surprise surprise more politics in the race from Minnesota attorney general feminine bill Warner updates us on both as he joins us now Scott\nGood news for those who do not have health insurance through their employer and have to buy their coverage on the individual market officials announced this week that for the second year in a rural there will be significant decreases in premiums in two thousand Nineteen ranging from about seven percent nearly twenty eight percent\nCommerce commissioner Jessica looming says Minnesotans will receive health care tax credits their men sure we'll see less of a rate reduction but\nGreatest positive impact will be for minutes at least we're not eligible for tax\nSome are rate reduction but\nThe greatest positive impact will be for minutes at least for not eligible for tax credits and you pay the full cost of their own ... these people should see significantly lower premiums and they'll look at it and when they shop for their health plans\nActual premiums depend on a person's individual situation in what coverage they select miniature as Christina Wessel\nWill have those new rates up and are online than comparison told by mid October cell consumers can kind of do their window shopping before open enrollment starts in November of freshmen\nThere is the issue of access in other words and people keep their doctors lawmakers have been watching that closely after some major HMOs dropped out of the market a few years ago at a time when premiums were also skyrocketing but state health commissioner Jan Malcolm says for two thousand Nineteen known network service areas will be reduced\nMost counties we'll have two or three available provider networks and associated qualified health plans only two counties that are state will have only one available provider network that is like in the woods and make our county\nOfficials say a lot of factors have contributed to this relative stability in Minnesota's healthcare market over the last year or so but the most politically significant is the reinsurance package that the legislature passed and governor Mark Dayton somewhat reluctantly let become law without his signature\nWhile obviously concerned about previous jumps and health insurance premiums governor warned of the impacted reinsurance would have on the state budget reinsurance means the state pays the cost of health coverage for the most seriously ill Minnesotans with their presumed effective holding down everyone else's premiums\nSomething that did happen in two thousand Eighteen and will happen in two thousand Nineteen\nBut the price tag is in the hundreds of millions of dollars and the governor said this week the state quote cannot sustain in Minnesota taxpayers cannot afford\nTo keep footing the bill for big insurance companies dating proposes any Minnesota not just low income residents be able to buy their insurance through Minnesota care of the state run program he argues the pool buying power of the state\nWill mean significantly lower premiums as much as twenty eight percent less than commercial plans\nBut the political reality of this is to be Frank Dayton will have little or no say in what happens next year because he will have left office and Minnesota will have either a democratic or Republican governor in which it is will make a big difference on what happens with healthcare\nSenate Republicans pushed reinsurance through the legislature but they seem to agree with Jane that it's not the way to go a long term for twenty twenty and be on hand like Senator Michelle Benson it the geo peas healthcare point person in the Minnesota Senate\nBut we're going to do is look at\nWhat kind of actually had the if there's a better model and we can really do want to optimize any time on your taking taxpayer money we want to optimize that impact others have had started to its market stabilized until she didn't want to make sure that we are\nAnd continuing the aesthetic wrong legacy as being innovative later in health coverage on healthcare\nMark Dayton will not be governor next year but one of the two people who could be\nIs Democrat Tim Walz he has come out in favor of single payer health care although his campaign stresses it would be phased in over time to buffer the impact on the state budget\nWalls skirted the issue in a statement this week saying his vision for healthcare quote focuses on bringing down the cost of care and expanding coverage from a variety of angles Republican senator Benson says\nUnfortunately a candidate while hasn't had to and that has a lot of scrutiny on this issue is it and they ... it has actually pay for the promises he make\nLet's switch gears now to the race for Minnesota attorney general domestic abuse allegations keep dogging democratic candidate Keith Ellison and top analysts say tactical error is by the Minnesota DFL party probably made that situation worse\nParty officials hired an attorney to do what they termed an independent investigation the attorney concluded the accusations by Karen Monaghan against Ellison were unsubstantiated\nNot surprisingly that report did not convinced many people so party officials asked\nMinneapolis city attorney Susan Segal to review the report presumably trying to improve its credibility Segal refused citing possible conflict of interest because Alison son is on the Minneapolis city council\nSegal asked Dakota county attorney James Baxter to review the case Bactrim responded he would only do so if there was first an investigation by the Minneapolis police department\nThe out party officials asked NPD to review the case they decline again citing a possible conflict of interest handling university professor David ... steak\nThe entire investigation that the state the failed it seems very odd I end up the resulting even more perplexing and what I mean by that is that they say that Keith Ellison the charges are unsubstantiated\nThey're not going to release the report what they want to set it off to some police department to confirm the results before they actually released a report or anything else and that's very odd because generally unless there is a criminal complaint out their police are not going to investigate and they're certainly not going to verify\nOr or double check investigation somebody else did\nI Would assume probably what they're doing is trying to find a a credible source to ah to give them the conclusion that they want which is that Keith Ellison is is innocent or this or or at least that the accusations cannot be substantiated would that be a reasonable assumption\nIt does seem like a reasonable assumption\nThat again it doesn't really look like it was an independent investigation I think many people are suspect for the fact that the DFL did it suspect the guard included actual investigation\nAnd kind of backfired on because now the story seems to be coming out about the Democrats the DFL trying\nTo shop around the report try pretty up in some way it's it really has worked out the way they were hoping\nIt would add on universities David shoals\nGot thank you bill Minnesota matters returns after this\n[noise]\nSo he seized on good manners are very very

concerns are as officials try in reverse the trend\nBecause I'm very close to the work and and what's going on in this area\nUm I also I'm concerned about something that's a little bit more nuanced\nAh which is that uh we are in the midst of um decreasing the amount of prescriptions that we prescribe the amount of\nPrescription opioids that are hitting the market and we categorically of bent the curve on that and I'm a little bit afraid that as we have restricted the amount of prescription opioids going to the market that other people are turning to\nOther ways to get their opioids and those other ways include um less predictable rose um you know they get medications on the street and some are not the amount that they are used to or no and some of them sometimes are laced with

not a negative or since they are black they hold some solar there's some old solar heat game in the brush itself so it does actually\nI'm slow down the process up and I just stay in fact some people that have been stolen that eliminates the problem of having ice dams yeah good point but boy bite your smart guy no it was just after all kinds of just ask questions or that that brings me up to this\n... trees in the summertime trees minimize solar heat gang yeah in our homes because of the shade decree we all know the benefits of standing under the tree on a hot dog is day laws is not lightning to another good point by really on the deck missed so much you're really\nOn the day I'm you've had it and you had a show on about a\nFavor tree and everybody has a different opinion but if somebody wanted a good shade tree\nUm that was real durable I'm\n... and you can't have everything so I'm not going to say in a grows tall and like three years um but you know his decent rate of growth what would be some of your favorites\nYou know and again your show being so spread out across the country you know you really have to look and see your particular zone a year in ... and that's going to make things very little bit but I'll tell you the some of the trees we look at it or are we talking about our show pretty much used a ... lot of the different zones use less you get down into Florida whatever bug\nPray and you know I think today in today's world nobody wants to wait you know you don't planet forward for you you just want I Want some metal realistically you know\nThe forward for you you just want it and I want somebody realistically you know it is amazing how fast trees or how sad time goes around it does you know grow Bush but looking at a tree but if you want a fast growing tree lot of times they are in a very good tree to use All right so there's off to it and then Kennedy or\nRaking or they don't last as long but there's a series of maples ... that was developed probably ten twelve years ago he only has about twelve years ago\nUm called the Freeman series and I think autumn blaze is one of the first ones can now but it's a they're a hybrid between a red maple and the silver maple I Would never recommend silver maples anybody lifespan shorter lifespan fast growing but real weak with it you know just a lot of issues but here we got the best of both worlds red maple was great fall color\nHarder would great branching habit great structure of the tree with a faster growing tree of the silver and then they call them the Freeman's selections and on and blaze is one of the first Sienna Glenn came after that\nFantasy celebration there are several of them out there right now but here's a tree really impressed with and it was the ... the um [noise]\nAh the ... the municipal Arbor society tree of the year about ten years ago when that right after they first came out\nBut they forty five fifty feet high\nForty five feet wide so good sized tree so good for streets stripped celery tree or or\nFor a larger yards but fairly quick pace as far as giving you something a reasonable amount of time so this particular series is called Freeman this particular series of of these hybrid maples really coming on strong and a lot of folks use them in a wide range of zones they do a very good job so\nAh actually three there you know one of my favorites I and I to trees that are my favorites get go was grows about anywhere and baroque which grows about anywhere but they're both very slow growers\nI heard some of your experts talking about baroque um I don't know what a baroque is you know there are so many great oaks event yeah they're baroque when you look at it has a huge relief I was just going to ask that the one with the big Lee yeah looks like a federal a pretty good size they cause you get hit with one you know you got hit with what it is a\nVery masculine very bold very wide horizontal branching tree rounded out crown takes a while to get any size or when they do it's a majestic tree that you'll never forget when you see it because it's absolutely outstanding but gang country great history behind gain go or if the fans shaped Lee's grateful color to re trees there and I'll tell you the other one that's really\nBecoming more under used but becoming more popular and that's dawn redwood now this is a regular redwoods clip destroys just like there are other ... so that I read wills that grow ... yep rewrite or wet so have you got a bargain though actually growing up in a moist area\nBut dawn redwood and it gives you it's a it's a deciduous conifer so he loses the needles at the end of the year\nBut you know here though it doesn't have leaves it's got nice guy needles but a great shape treat great larger growing tree being used more and more all the time and then like I say the needles actually dropped at the end of the season they're not as thick and breakdown faster than pine or a ruse would\nBut that is becoming very very popular and rightfully so\nHow about the speed of growth on that says oh they're fan yeah once they get started there very fast grower so again gives you something I read them out of time and and you think it's an evergreen additives and so on and how did I mention that Ron I don't I don't know I mean are you using that a lot yeah landscape\nAnd yeah I mean you'll see that in ... in Ireland plant things in parking lot just even now as a street tree I'm given a plenty of room to grow because these are big they get they get huge but it's a it's an actual redwood any adjusts so well all different types of soil isn't that great trees so CNN when he used a lot more out there as well\nI guess I gotta quit looking at all the houses in the entry way and start paying that ... I I I Want a new one on me to\nContractors and even some landscaper sometimes you just get locked into a certain palate er trees and they don't look at what else is available out there you really if you if you don't have you have a house that has no trees it'll do your homework do investing visit two or three nurseries visit two or three garden center see what they suggest see what's out there and is what's available\nAnd of course plant that you can go you know right up to the holiday season with no problem well as long as the grounds on for a long time of year right implant anytime during the year so you know you can go you know it's up to you as long as they're available to plant stores workable you can get out their plan and I always tell folks to things when you're looking at a new home\nGet the turf established wherever your lawn is going to be ... that you want to get that's your base\nAnd plant trees and evergreens first forget about the ... the foundation forget about the patio planting\nPlant trees and evergreens first they take the longest amount of time to develop and do anything for you know five years minimum they start to get any effect on him so plant those first come back to your patio planting send your foundation planting later because you know two years your foundation prize filled in may fill in the mail is likely to do the trees and do my evergreens\nFirst and then you go to our screen plant they get those in right away turf obviously very important to Burr Oak and wrote on red engaged or my two favorites were bigger trees but Don

west will get the football is starting to second half of play as a pioneer has got to start the ball game and not them with a couple of things to kind of freaked out here at the half of this contest diverse it's got to figure out their special teams they have given time and time and time again\nMinnesota west just outstanding feel position Minnesota west will take a look at their fuel position in the first half the worst fuel position they had was their very first Dr when they started their own forty five and then they were last drive which they did scored a touchdown on started throwing forty eat\nEverything else started pioneer territory as a pioneer forty five at the pioneer thirty seven as a pioneer thirty five at the pioneer forty seven and then write it made the fields of great fuel position all day\nFor Minnesota west and they've been able to parlay that into twenty three points in the first half of this contest you got drafted pioneers of started Minnesota west territory just one time that is it thirty eight yard line and they went on a one play thirty eight yard touchdown pass and made that one pay other than that\nThe best position for the pioneers of their own thirty nine on the opening driver the game\nThey did have the last possession of their own thirty three just before half time everything else was at the twenty or thirty yard line in in for the pioneer so they've had to go on some extended drives they've been able to chew up your average and big chunks\nBut they've also struggled bit\nWas slowing down in Minnesota weather events they got to take limburg early but as of late have gotten better protection from his office on the line and because of Minnesota west in this game of twenty six twenty three\nAt the hassle figuring out the field position problem of getting that I've being able to flip the feel of the pioneers is a big factor in this one the other big factor in the second half for North one\nIs that they've got to just be able to keep the bottom Minnesota west handled a little bit\nAnd some of that is by being able to go on some extended drives of their own they need to stop this first possession for Minnesota west and then go down and scoring open the back up to a to score ballgame to open up some options here for the pioneers\nPioneers of not played poorly Minnesota West is certainly come to play they've settled down after last their quarterback a couple of weeks ago and think limburg you've played very well for them in the office of bacterial also Minnesota\nWhere after the north west pioneers dark only to get out the half by a margin of twenty six twenty three they have led throughout have never trailed would've never totally had the gaming control either\nNever more than two scores and read really more like one and a half scores that they have to go by think limburg on the second possession for Minnesota west blue jays a battle they have dug north one has had too many penalties by far\nAnd that his factory in as well they've got to keep the yellow flag to a minimum and they've got to try and improve improve feel position in the second half of their ... for the pioneers if they're going to walk out the fifth one of the year here and set themselves up for a big match up with north to go to college in science next week\nI remember a windy today but then all of the pioneers guarantee them a first round game and the outburst on home game in the playoffs\nAnd sets them up to get first round throughout the playoffs if they get a win this week and then also when next week down at Minnesota state\nOr North Dakota state College of science in Washington but you can't possibly have that happen if you don't win today so it's a very very big game today for the buying ears and they've approached it a little bit nonchalant and the first half about some of that could be having had two weeks off with the forfeit when last\nWeek so let's see if they can't that right the ship and

I was going to say all three of their losses one of them was a tie\nWow so they want they they they beat the jets\nThey lost the saints and raiders both on the road in overtime and tied the Steelers there like a breath away from being undefeated they realize that you can and to me they are still going to beat the saints missed it they had a bill go to beat the Steelers missed it\nLast of the raiders except for the NFL's already come out and said we messed it up on officiating\n... they could be they can be for no I mean easily could be for do you believe or a Baker\nI think he recent juice I think they continue to build it around and they started doing some quick rhythm stuff yeah yeah I think you can wind up being went to ... ah\nThey ... they are different TV product out so I Will say that that's what that's what I noticed so far I have no idea yet\nOr what kind of long term winter or whatnot is going to be I mean how can you because played six quarters of football yeah but it is a different TV product that works that's the only decision I can make so far as as a TV product\nThe browns suddenly work they're better product ... oh my gosh I mean the Thursday night game which nobody could turn off and then imagine the browns playing at a football game where a there was a total uh let me do quick math here I'm\nEighty seven points scored in the game\nI mean look if it's a good product and people like the the point score didn't want to see people put it into pain you want to see quarterbacks to it all over the yard all of this\nWell I listen I uh I talked about this little bit with you last week um you know when you talk for a moment ago about what Richard Sherman has had to say and uh unfortunately for him this works\nAnd it does I mean ... there are two things are in an entertainment world I Would say it's okay\nTo be not fair as long as it's fun yeah because that's that's where we are in ... and ... and what people are acting like what's happening in the NFL is some news thing\nAnd it's not it's gone on in every sport except for baseball oh you're baseball's the only one that hasn't quite gotten the memo yet they're about to them but they are about to you're a hundred percent right\nNor wants to go to a game and see just shift\nWell I'll tell you what you want to know when the visceral forever in my mind be the moment the moment the baseball realize did did you see the play off from\nYou know he's a playoff from a with Ken griffey junior or Mr you you missed it All right obviously on radio we can't share the video but we can't show the audio which will do coming up in a little bit 'cause guys will send it to you and you can put it in the system and you can play it for everybody you can hear the major league baseball playoff promo\nWhere Ken griffey junior or not only appears in it but if he does the voice over for it and he's essentially saying to everybody who's criticizing whether it'd be bat flipping weather all the personality to comes out of these players and they're always announcer\nAnd writers\nAnd even fans in some cases and the players themselves and we'll throw a ball at their head on the next either way they're there to squash that personality and Ken griffey junior like let's talk or let them play\nThat was the moment the minute baseball green let that ... they don't let me know that they know they know\nIn ... that ... a young let me know that they know they know and it took a freaking decade but ... baseball so OK you find Leno\nOkay so here's where I got 'em when they do the world Baseball Classic yes\nThat is an exciting renovation as it is when you watch the teams playing for their country you watch the\nPlayers it's a little more a little more juice the more energy more bad flipping a little more you can you can see the players in their\nElement yes for me I'm like okay I can watch that I can watch this it reminds me of soccer\nAnd what did he intend came out and said why did he come out and say after all Baseball Classic this was disrespectful to the game what these guys do another country's based racism go away [laughter] baseball is way way better with personality\nWay better way better it is it like people like that except for the traditional and old school like they don't like is that part of it but yeah like that to me that is one when was it was nice to hit a home run a couple of years ago\nOr ... oh I Love that I loved it amazes me through a take your time because to me\nIf I can do one thing if I could do one thing and athletic\nI Would love to hit a
