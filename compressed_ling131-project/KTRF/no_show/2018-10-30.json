by radio program without them right of course a producer\nRob gene he's on the other side of the glass along with Alex ... engineer Deb Carson the anchor she'll keep us updated and Sean the intern we

the program and you'll have a chance to trust anyone or anything of the world of sports will do that so we're getting ready for that part of the show and ah your guy LeBron James\nWell speaking of ah getting your butt kicked yes the Lakers have been doing plenty of that I mean they've been close in these games with the bottom line is they're two and five\nThey just lost last night to Minnesota Minnesota timber\nWolves team that is with out\nAndrew Wiggins or was without Angelica when they're not light in the world on fire you they're three and four\nThey had lost their blown up by thirty points to previous\nYeah I don't think they're not well we know they've got all types of drama with is among butler like call Anthony town hasn't been playing up to his normal standards\nBut they had enough to be LeBron and the Lakers and bronze said already we're only seven games in there too in five but it seems like his patients may be wearing thin here's what brown after the game\nFor pointing that patients one out instance which he looked like a leader when\nYou probably don't want to be around ... [noise] ...\n[laughter] any city series because people started laughing yeah\nAnd he I think he cracked the smile afterwards as well but what do you make it as Rob like already seven games and I think this is how most people expected it to start if you go back to his you know\nFirst month in Miami actually longer first two months in Miami first couple of months in Cleveland they started slowly and those things that a lot more talent and they were playing in the week eastern conference\nGlad you mentioned that that point about the ... yeah ... ... which is actually getting stronger now why why why why are we going to concerts and that's the problem but this is the only thing I have to say\nThis is still a brawn James ... why are you mad talking about you don't want to see me when my patrons runs out you or the docket Dr Frankenstein and his team\nThis is your you put this together you signed off on you wanted some tough guys to be able to go up against the war is so there's a cast off that they brought in land Stephen ...\n... it wasn't even there yesterday for personal reasons why I Wonder what that is right and we go out and get much playing time while yeah so Beasley and\nAnd ah all these guys and then there's the kids so you knew what you signed up for I don't know in the world how you you better have patience because this is the concoction you put together in the tougher western conference and basically you're looking at\nAnd then people say well rounded overreacting you know they were in every game that could have wanted to get no that's why you bought LeBron here you can't you can't go in lose to these teams that they lost to last year without the bronze and then act like it's okay to lose\nRight because uh you know they're young no little bronze here now this is supposed to be the difference maker and the other parties\nAnd people should be really really honest with themselves could you\nCan't dig yourself that big of a whole I Know it's early but you can\nThat western conference which jumbled up last year right were to get some games out of the playoffs right now I mean and and and do you want to be a seventh or eighth seat and then have to play the warriors in in round one on MBR row team\nDo you think you're getting out of the first round even if you make the the first round you got to be like a a top four team in the western conference to get a little brought a chance at there being a second round them making real movement\nSports radio some football [laughter]\nWe've got them back\nPre game shows in America [noise]\nLast film kick off

want to weigh in on LeBron and miss slow start with the Lakers do you blame him do you blame loop the blame the front office the young players whoever let's start with max in Florida max welcome to the odd couple\nOr going on guys now Rob yes want to say congratulations to you for leaving the dark side officially joint LeBron James or those six teams I saw on Instagram so bravo my man\nAutos sweet they'll come on they live in these arrests looking bronze yeah there's a lot of them\nDon't live in Grand in fairness about half of the Georgians were ugly too\nYeah yeah so there's a lot of great but then you either so comfortable I got him when I was in New York this past I might have to go out and make a call and try to look at them as well\nI just want to say welcome to the little bar club we welcome everybody\n... so that you got anything to say about the Lakers\nYes I Do okay so back to you again Rob your professor I Know that I listen to Fox Sports all the time yes very professor by the way you guys don't get the credit you deserve so congratulations to you thank you but I'm All right when I get a test I look at a test and I wouldn't judge it off the first couple of questions\nOh look at the whole past before I panic if I get a question twenty and I still don't know\nThen I panic don't panic after the first couple of questions that LeBron James he's not panicking right now it's two and five is that the thirty watch no but he's not panicking is the first couple of questions on the test Rob you got to give it the whole season the whole time\nI hear what you're saying well a barrage you'd be making a ... a a difference max even early indices and he hasn't really played up to par and then\nUh they've had games that are ... I'm not saying that they are games have been I'm not saying they should be five and two but they should be all their games winnable they should be better to five and I just think LeBron has an added anything yet to hey Tommy in Florida you on the odd couple of Fox Sports radio what's up Tommy\nAnd Chris hey Robin first of all Rob I Would take that as an insult being compared to skip Bayliss\nGives our man it's all about it and I know I'm telling you anytime\nI tell you they were the original odd couple and you guys are ten times better skipping that other guy\nAnd sharp a you know the guy before him even yeah there you go a long\nAnyway guys three points here and basketball's that my first sport but I tell you what there's a lot of intangibles here I think three things the first thing is playing with a bunch of kids right now so he's got to show them basically the little brown game and ... a big enough veteran here and he's been to everything you know he's been to the finals one the final\nSo that's number one number two the western Koch them it's a different game in the afternoon\nAnd so that's number one number two the western conference it's a different game in the afternoon Cal since its run and gun\nOn and then I think the biggest thing I think we're all abroad is in a place where his brand is not number one the Lakers with the history and all that that's a bigger brand worldwide then or brown James I think so I think he's got to follow his ... and understand that that's where he's at I think he does but I don't think it sunk in yet\nWell you brought up some interest employees wanted their their defenses atrocious okay they're given up a hundred and twenty two points a game let that thinking I Know this is the three point era and everybody's going a lot of points\nBut one hundred and twenty two points a game only the Washington Wizards are given up more points than they're terrible eyes so defensive leader not playing the deepest but here's the child is Rob ...\nIt's going to be difficult for LeBron James to lecture these young kids and tell them how to defend when he's not doing it and you and I ... I've been covering NBA for almost twenty five years we can look at it and say look\nHe's in a sixteen year he's thirty three years old soon to be thirty four it's certainly not going to try to fit it's just not true and I are the twenty year olds the Twenty one year old's the twenty two year olds on the Lakers\nAre they looking at it that way are they saying abroad those you get back to bite you talking about you not doing this you're not doing that so it could be a challenge for him\nTo get them to play the defense that they need to play because he's just incapable of doing it at this advantage was\nCareer was we saw that last year right before the trades were brought up like the worst uh a defensive waiting in the league at one point member that stretch in December where he had just stopped playing defensively and and people do look at the leader if he ain't gonna do it\nWhy should I tell you I've been on your own kids they might not like we see it having to watch the NBA for so long you're right and they should be good defense because they got young athletic guys long guy they shouldn't be a much\nBetter team defense with Scott and Pennsylvania you're up on the odd couple\nOr it's a guard how you doing man how would you grade today\nGr good to hear from the garden or my current last week or happy birthday Chris\nThank you thank you and a ... a key Peter strong burger\nYou know it always know where you are you you just let your ah your your your side that you're going to be known was so you're you another little brown hater go ahead and share your point\nNo no no no the Berlin a trust me I Know I'm ... I'm actually respect what burn but here's here's the question I Want to pose\nTo give you guys you guys could discuss this I mean to give you three blocks from the NBA or to bring in El ... besides what they already have\nAnd tell me if they're still good enough to win an NBA trip by heart love you guys\nKnow telling you you you want us to name three\nOkay yeah I'm not going to name three you you guys live birthday if they got okay next year Kevin ... they're going to have money if they got Kevin do but that's not happening not just I'm just one it's a possibility I don't think it happened in either but it is a ... there were just saying if they got Kevin Duran\nThey would be favored to win the NBA title because that will weaken Golden State and then you put the greatest score in the league with the guide is the greatest player in the league we're still going to give that title deliberate so\nI think that that would be the guy if he gets ... Leonard and there are people are around with brown if that will tell you we get into why if he gets caught why lizard I think then they would have a tremendous chance obviously Golden State was there'll be strong if the rats days but the Lakers would be right there with\nThem so yeah there are the ... and Anthony Davis you know he he just signed with the bronze age it rich Paul that's a possible so yeah you can get guys in here to help LeBron to win a championship so now he's the but that's the key Rob if they don't get a big time free agent\nOrange ... Davis doesn't force the trade to the Lakers\nThey're not winning anything no on this little brown and his crew not winning and you know\nThey he definitely needs another player and if you don't see that I think you're crazy to think that they could compete in the western conference without another player\nThis isn't even a choice anymore like this is not like some this is instinctive to them like why why wouldn't you come out and speak to you know what's important to you they're not this is not like even the Bronx generation those are choices that they kind of made in every generation before them\nToday you're starting to see like and this is not just because of the players it's because of the coaches because the commissioner you know and one of the things Adam Silver said to me and say look as long as our guys know what they're talking about and they're educated than we absolutely\nLook at long as our guys know what they're talking about and they're educated than we absolutely want them to speak and you know look it came up kind of\nUm spontaneously and every interview I did because we did most of these guys are proud to speak to this and and they would point you're going to happen and they can say hey look what's happening over there that's never going to happen over here\nNot in this year because it it did happen in prior years right but um you know I think there's a real pride and what what what the weekend where I\nGot to give them give me a sense of is there anything negative about abroad or is this just loves the greatest and he did everything right now I'm just serious you know like\nI mean no I mean look at it like in the we talk about ... everyone objectively right sort of\nBe critical of that um you know some of the early ... I mean he's probably the most critical about the fashion choices earlier on all yeah good but yeah no there's definitely like you know I mean look at it it is a celebration\nI get it I don't expect it to ripple abroad or anything but I'm just saying like you know people when they watch stuff sometimes if it's over the top where it's just so savvy and everything's great it's hard to watch without there being some some rough\nYou know there there's some role but I Would also say like it's not disproportionately focused on the ... I mean the brunt of great he is the greatest generation and probably the most outspoken but you know Ninety five percent of the series focuses on you know uh other whereas other certainly other eras I mean we go back to start a bill\nOr a or an Emmy talk about a guy who did you guys are saying you know not only was arguably the most dominant player any generation when he died championships and eleven years but ... says the same time with the civil rights act was probably one of the most important\nIn this country's history and the when you think of like what he was dealing with off the court while also dominating on the court it's it's pretty you know inspiring and impressive and that's kinda where like I said the shut up and revoke part we got this great title you know in
