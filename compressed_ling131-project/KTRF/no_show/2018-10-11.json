studios [noise]\nFifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on your car insurance guy go back home for a free re quote and ally going on in life or in basketball you got the first ever meeting\nBetween the two time defending world champion Golden State warriors\nAnd LeBron James ... their their their normal common phones in the NBA Finals but he was always doing it for Cleveland now they get the phase him for the first time in uh Los Angeles Lakers uniform that's coming up later tonight a forest does a preseason game but still\nThere's a lot of hype and a lot of interest in this one and then\nSome other news around the NBA Jimmy Butler who has been on hold out I guess you'd call it a while he's demanded a trade from the Minnesota timber wolves practice with the timber wolves today for the first time and apparently it was ... he reportedly\nWent off on teammates coaches a front office executives at GM Scott Laden and a really took it to him and had a great practice and trash talked guys up and down the roster and the organization\nAnd ah then went on ESPN were Rachel Nichols and said this is not fixed and the people might think it's big but it's not fake so in other words he still wants I Will get to all of that later but first Rob\nColon cabernet is making a little bit of news did you see that he has filed a he wants to trademark and image of is himself it's a black and white image of his face and his hair and they're saying\nThat the intention is to use that image on everything from shampoo\nTo hairspray two jewelry to lamp shade did I learn we'll see it on a lot of T shirts are but what do you what do you think about\nThat yeah I'll buy my uh Colin Kaepernick coffee mugs so when I'm drinking coffee in the morning [noise] hot seat because I don't drink coffee but yeah why not I mean uh his image\nWhat he stands for is what people are attracted to whether the NFL believed it or not ah there are a lot of people who are who are all about Colin Kaepernick for people who want to make change for in a positive way\nIt's hard to not look at that guy and admire him or the NFL's got it wrong they will be on the wrong side of this uh what history tells a story about what went down and I think a lot of ... average Joes and regular people get it and understand and respect him a lot\nFor uh being able and willing to to give for others his window in his life is good Chris you had to like going\nRight right there's no question Rob and here's the thing if Pete any objective observer\nIf you just cut through the noise and all the emotion and look at what he's doing this for he's not doing it for himself he's doing it for other innocent American citizens period that's the only doing it for very how can you not like that\nAnd for those that might say oh this is he's just trying to make money while yeah we all need money especially if the NFL gone black ball him and not let him do what he's capable of doing which is playing quarterback in the national football league he this is a way for him along with his Nike deal\nTo make money so that he can continue to be an activist and I'll tell you this\nCorporations have been making money and still do off the images of athletes musicians actors whoever for since time immemorial you know why can't an athlete make money off his image himself\nI could always remember arguing with the guy on the radio in Detroit and I think uh I think it was the uh Jose can say go book and his his argument Chris was he's just trying to sell books and I said that's why people write book\nRight what are you talking about it wouldn't make\nIt like it was something\nLike crazy that he wanted people to buy this like\nDude that's why people white books yeah and there's nothing wrong with that if you don't like it you don't buy the book that we don't like Colin Kaepernick you won't bother likeness on something a T shirt or a cap or a coffee mug or whatever and if you do you will but I I I applaud him for taking his own\nImage and and and not letting other people capitalize and make money on them I I think it's the right thing for him to do\nNow when you hear that that image could be on shampoo hairspray jewelry lamp shade of it it it it it first it's like wow that commercialization of this\nYou know his his message and the impact these trying to have socially that's strange but let's face it Americans commercialized everything Christmas has been commercialized to the nth degree\nYou know people don't even look at the real meaning of that holiday anymore I'll give you know what to do that hey in America everything can be commercialized than you could make money off of it\nThey had they asked them five year old kid you ready for this five year old kids in kindergarten they showed them two pictures\nAnd they showed them up they showed a picture of George Washington\nAnd Abraham Lincoln\nAnd they said who who who are these guys and you know the answer was over\nAnd they said who who who are these guys and you know the answer was over overwhelming\nBuilt those guys sell cars on television 'cause that that that's what they use their image gentleman I likely are sail up four Presidents Day you know hit your head\nThey sell they sell cars on television wow wow all said is that we like to talk to those teachers were horrible going on with them now I Know but give us a call a seven\nSeven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine if you want to chime in on the cob and cabinet situation I Want to bring in our producer Rob gee you had an interesting thought on a cabernet when you saw this develop\nYeah I mean I agree that he has every right to make money and just like I think that uh he has every right to protest that's fine\nWhat I think though is that this kind of moved trademark in your image to put it on shampoo and jewelry and things like that that tells me that he knows that he is\nNot coming back to football because\nThe thing about him that's being spread throughout the league whether it's fair or unfair same thing that happened with jazz Brian and Tim ... that he is a distraction that if you asked him on your roster you're going to Fifteen minutes talking about it will be exactly who will being not related to football and\nIf your guy is hawking product with his face on it outside of football it tells me that that\nHe is not going to be able to do that as a quarterback in the NFL\nWell I I don't know well he could ... proud of what I mean why do you look at her I said well Yeah Tom Brady has that and you write Iraq was would you like ... ... and you know you get home shirt I Would be the distraction is not the proud and let me let me clarify let me go to like the ...\nI think he's the quarter back I think he's better than at least a third of the started the NFL unfortunately most NFL coaches\nDon't see him that way and we Chris and I always had this conversation off the air they feel like his talent does not warranted distraction that he is so therefore if you only see him as a backup quarterback you do not want your backup quarterback generating that kind of attention\n\nSee I got both\nChris Broussard and Rob Parker so woman crush Wednesday and over the course of the sounds of McDonalds too big Madonna fans EJ I sure\nWhat uh what gave you that when you when they were white and it's like five songs on every\nWhen women crush wins this so maybe I have a woman crush on him I guess though I guess so you like room on now is she now is your grandma's to be my ground you know old enough to be one of these issues or grandma yet but I Know she's been as you look good enough\nTo see the anyway let me tell ya both about car shop it can be confusing I'm selling terms I deal with pride lift price in voice will chew card gives you what you really need to know when you do hard shopping what did other people pay for the car that I Want\nThat way you can recognize was a good price and with the ... trust me when you're ready to buy a new or even a used car go the true car to enjoy more confident car buying experience around a lot of people I Believe want to\nComment on the ... situation he's trade marking his images face in his hair or to put on shampoo and jewelry and lamp shade and I'm sure there'll be an afro picking all types of stuff so uh I say good for him let's see what the caller said\nNo doubt about eight seven seven Ninety nine or ... to start with Jerry in New York you're on the odd couple and Fox Sports radio what's up Derek\nOh what's up uh uh yeah I'm In a\nFirst time caller you can't though\nWe shared it don't just relax Derek man you just hanging out with me Chris just relax\nGotcha um yeah basically they're saying that the yeah they agree that he should be able to trademark has stuff because everyone else is using his name as it is very now like you know he's got his name on shirts and stuff so why not get paid for it so that's pretty much been a kid when you got stuff\nHard preacher to Derrick and I write because there are people selling T shirts with kept all over the place all all over\nYeah ... I mean you see 'em all your other people are already making money off of it\nYou know people got the ... out there too and I'm not getting any money the other one\nRather that better not be a drum roll [laughter] our standards were getting awfully low would do\nA lot of the lucky as host of all do you go to the hold them to go through this whole kind of all the really good Rob gee I like to refer yell at Ohio you're on the odd\nOf Fox Sports radio was up ... how ya doing brother\nAnd the odd couple of Fox Sports radio was up ...\nHow ya doing brother man would do a\nGood good eight one thing that yeah I don't have an issue\nWith uh kept going this route the trademark his uh image and and the pro in everything but I mean it only in America can a brother who stay that the country this country the United states oppressive black people and people of color\nAnd so he's applying for a trademark I tell you where else could that happen but the United states [laughter]\n[noise] that's the contradiction well but that's what they called me a bump zone it has been the contradiction for people of color for ages since this country was ... years old and even before how about the the the black people once in a military and Ford and was separate armies and came back couldn't get jobs\nCouldn't get houses couldn't get a meal at the world wars counter come on man and they fought for the country\nAte a route they did do that but I Know you're not one that's going to ah pay that past negative discriminatory racist baggage and bring it along with you now are you\nKnow I'm just telling you sign on I'm Talking about ... system doesn't exist to talking about history\nNo no I'm a history Rob ... we understand we know our history some people do live in the past\nUm now I had to do but I'm not living in the pan ... let me let me tell you what\nKind of African Americans protesting and stuff this happened now you're not protest is not living in the habit of eighties\nNo no no let me tell you what cap is done cap has found his blackness okay he decided that he was gone and brave brightness in and of course it towards and get that you'd love that's what kept has\nDone that area and what I disagree I disagree I I don't believe that\nCourse for one minute I Believe that what was going on with all the unarmed black men because we talked about on undisputed Chris you know it over and over\nThere was a topic uh what was going on in this country and it was not like some uh one day he woke up at his hair was logging nappy and he said oh wait a minute I'm half black so I'm a I'm a joined the black movement I Do believe that that's how Copernicus rolling on\nThe ... heard I've heard that argument before that oh he discovered his blackness now he's going overboard trying to be two black\nLook I Do believe this ... was raised by white parents we know that and he probably did have some type of identity issues you know and he read I Know this is a fact 'cause I wrote a story on it\nHe read the autobiography of Malcolm X he began reading a lot of other black literature and black history and he did get awakened\nTo the black experience now that\nDoesn't mean he's insincere the same thing happened to mount their savings happened to many blind\nAnd go to college and for the first time but you know reading black history they're exposed to a black professors they begin looking at the plight of black people critically and not just the fact that we can sing and dance Iraq and play sports\nAnd they start looking at it from a serious mindset and then they want to do something about it there's nothing wrong with\nMe you're just because you may have\nCome into it a little later doesn't matter how did you come and sincere Lulu the lowly\nSincere he gave up his Franken football career that he probably worked his whole life for to do this so you can call that instance\nThey're not at all hey Anthony and Michigan you're on the odd couple and Fox Sports radio what's up Anthony\nHey guys how you doing ... ...\nOh I just had two points I remember when the movie Malcolm X came out and you couldn't walk across the street without seeing an ex or the image of Malcolm on somebody so I I blog ... for trying to\nCapitalize on who he is and what he's trying to bring to light my other point is is that uh people keep on the other side keep saying he's not patriotic and I wonder when when the orange man in the White House goes he's Riley south of the Mason Dixon Line and people are wearing Confederate belt buckles and hats and T shirts and stuff\nAre they patriotic or no\nOf course they can't be captured Nick is acting instance sheer patriotism 'cause he's looking out for American citizens who are less fortunate to him that's what he's only he's trying to get America to live up to its proclamations that's all that's what he's doing that's patriotic\nHey what about Steven Detroit you're on the odd couple of Fox Sports radio what's up Steve\nWas up fellows for instance I last saw Robert Parker T shirt was in the clear as being murdered\nAudit [laughter] he got to be coming over here getting drum roll I Know it would be a marshal or no that's right to look good usually\nNow that just a little Detroit humor are very good estimate of ...\nA ... cat predicts absolutely trademark his name that's way he can get some paintings in his pocket into collusion lawsuit money coming in and then I'll say for the guy ... capture that is seeking law\nLaw if properly I guess he could or they're not as what black man of seeking and the basic nothing because cats are they just simply saw issue and he stood up and fought for it\nAbsolutely name will bowls are one hundred percent something triggered inside you saw what was going on and decided I have to do something about this absolutely right\nOff the metal metal Capra that gave up his career for fight for social justice you can't even get parents will take off a couple of hours for parents teacher\nCalled ... and ... and the kids are failing in school and they won't even show up\nRob I remember when we cabernet began his protest I actually thought it was more courageous of him\nBecause he was the second stringer right remember he was coming up to me the forty niners could've cut him immediately nope and nobody would have thought twice about it and for him to do it when he was vulnerable when he was expendable\nThat was more courageous to me if then if they don't see Wilson or Patrick my homes or summer air Rogers does is it\nGetting cut right you're not getting black ball you're in that we give people love used to\nFor if he did it when they were going to the NFC championship game three times in a row do you know what I mean in the Seattle at one time it would be different he did it at a vulnerable point in his life and I so I Do nothing but salute him because most people don't act and that's why bad things continue to happen\nRight right well Robyn brown is as great as they say nope um so how come as you say no other stars wanting to play with them will ask is former teammate the one the only ... house next is the couple of Fox Sports radio\nI'm On the opinion they should go for Seventy four wins and obviously win the championship too but if they want us this might be their last time together\nSolidify yourselves as you know the greatest team of all time if you want to be viewed is that over Jordan's bulls do something you never did win Seventy four and a championship I think they should go for it I don't think they will what do you think\nWell you know be tough for them to go for that God's gonna be law get so many minutes some games uh unless they could just get they go away in the third quarter where it got it out and I and then you know the game they're not putting so many minutes because they said that a lot of work or what they have\nBeen doing could do I\nI just don't think that it if it's a goal that they want to achieve I'm not looking for that I don't really care about the regular season we've stayed as do many times got a record that he gave that record setting regular season that fall short of the Japanese ship I much rather see a team that that's going to go out there hey if we get the record good but we're not taking it\nLike to hear they chase that Seventy three\nThen faded don't or did they fell short\nYup they fell short in and said it at the end of the last three to one lead in the finals\nI agree with you a lasting we've got about a minute or so what about the Jimmy butler a situation if you were GM and the guy says I don't want to be here do you just hold on to him despite that or or do you move on because I'm the one who believe if you don't want to be here I don't want you\nI'm I'm with you I'm with you right there if you don't want to be here that guy's not going to be a hundred percent in invested in it what we are at the same 'cause he's already have one foot out the door so I Would try to find somewhere where we could get maximum a maximum return for him\nUm [noise] but again I mean he was right there you go in without him so that the gym I don't want to be that Jim I don't want to be that means in a tough situation there though you don't have to get rid of Jimmy and\nAnd I don't I don't know if you can get another player to replace them the help that they get when so they're in a tough situation over there I like the fact of what he said he's just competing and he had the players so long and all that just overflowed and came out\nUh so I I Love the in that I Love competitors and competition though\nThey they gotta they gotta task ahead of them as well what are they going to do with it and what can they get more\nRight why Eddie it's a great Eddie House Joanna Hi couple\nHe'll be doing it every week during the season we can't wait when my when LA\nAs soon as I get that call you know I'm waiting I Need to get up here oh my God or in Arizona so what

but I wouldn't Rob on that when they're here for us to say you got to have the bones so on that one\nBut but of course the answer to your mom and Alex so that's why I Love your credit is what it costs to answer your question I still don't believe the rent and the bronze going to team up\nAnd claim Thompson's gone out of his way to say I want to stay with the warriors are made him he could have played the\nWe'll see what happens down the road you know I Can't really say anything and\nWho knows you know what I mean everybody else on the teams gotten paid I Want to get paid to he could have played card yup he didn't would have been justified would have been just your body and stuff I was making forty million right I mean he could easily say I want to get paid too\nSo I Want my rings I could move on and do something else or whatever but he went out of his way to say you would love to stay with the warriors and this is where he wants to be\nAnd I and I'm just not convinced that\nA ... going to be able to uh attract somebody even in Los Angeles 'cause what are you going to have Jimmy Butler and\nCollide limit as well free agent\nYes there's so many people have a I have of just decided that they don't want to part they don't want to be a part of the script\nA and and the script is\nWe've seen over and over will abroad and when it's because of the bond is the greatest ... grain and when they lose the brawn doesn't have anybody what do you expect him to do how do you like LeBron to win when he didn't have anybody and he has no help this was the the narrative Christ that we've heard for years now\nThe one guy and I agree with you I play definitely I think just stay in and goes day and I love that about him I loved it I Know you disagree if he takes a little bit last a couple of million\nLast to stay in Golden State I'm always demand you're happy where you're at your mega rich no matter what and you're winning championships like he's going to go down there is a great hall of famer\nAll time champion I Love the players doing it they never found the rent\nI wouldn't do the Lakers to help with brown way more rings if I ran I Want to win more rings ...\nYou know so and he's obviously if you said and go and said he would do that or could do that but maybe you can go somewhere else and win a ring like LeBron did when he went back to Cleveland from Miami but I don't think I agree with you I don't think either one of them goes there with ... with the Lakers what I Will say this Rob\nI and you you're right for the most part it's if they win a championship it's all about LeBron and you're right when he doesn't win it's disappointing ... then there's some truth to that usually my but it's still it is tough\nIt don't one player who could go play with all the brine and change that narrative I'm Talking about the positive one where if he wanted it will be all about LeBron wouldn't be the rent like if there were to go to the Lakers next year\nAnd they wanted I don't think it would be all about them around\nI think obviously he get a lot of love but I think you can get love is the older you know elder\nStatesmen kinda do might get the most loving I'm not sure about that I ... I mean maybe not the most but it wouldn't be as lopsided as it's been in the past you know what I mean like\nI didn't want to give the Lakers win forty five games this year you may win re Durango there\nAnd they win a championship you know be able to just give it All right\nWell that's a different narrative if if they're the seven seed and get knocked out in the first round and they went forty some odd games that's a different totally different narrative and you're right I Would I Would believe that the rare especially if people want to get them say was the MVP\nHe do what I made a envy ... yeah that's the interesting thing to and that's what liberal like how we handle that if if the ram went to the Lakers and was the finals MVP\nI don't think the brawn would care from the standpoint of anything that can help his legacy cause I think he would be down with the sixteen Seventeen years in the league I Do right yeah I\nI don't necessarily disagree but you know I I think that you know it's going to be difficult I think the guy that he may end up getting is Anthony Davis\nA from you know now he's playing with New Orleans he just signed with the bronze age it rich Paul\nA couple of weeks ago so I'm not saying it's a done deal a rich as players all over the league been Simmons in Philadelphia but I Do think the fact that Davis chose to side with rich\nThey he knows the narrative that's out there that he thinks he's going to end up you know he\nHe may want to go to the Lakers we'll see see how the New Orleans does this year but that may be the one guy they get\n[noise] but you you think guys don't want to play with ... all the callers thing hit us up at age seven seven Ninety nine on Fox have seven seven nine nine six\nSix three six nine Kyrie Irving came out today in a story in bleacher report with our back and he said the best thing for his career that he's done was to leave the bride here's a direct quote I think it was the best move in my career honestly\nBecause it wasn't about any particular person or anything like that it was just time it was just time it may not have looked time for everyone else but for me it was time do you think Kyrie leaving LeBron was the best thing for his career\nAmerica's veterans are on the most important towards\nAnd da Vinci were on a mission to help veterans get the benefits they\nI'm a veteran and my victory was finishing my education\n... offers veterans of all generations a lifetime of support for victory great and small\nMy previous disability limiting\nMy dream was getting my service or any\nMore than a million veterans every year they face some conquered the challenges my victory is being able to be there for my\nWhen Americans veterans when we all went to help support more victories for veterans go to\n... or about Seventy percent of us adults age sixty five are older have high blood pressure and only about half have it under control blood pressure medicine can protect the heart brain and kidneys but many people aren't taking it as directed this means they may skip doses were stopped taking it altogether\nTo help patients healthcare systems can involve the entire health care team to ensure patients are taking medicine is directed simple by blood pressure treatment by prescribing Ninety they refills in combination medicines\nCoordinate pill rebuild and prescribe generic medicines encourage the use of home blood pressure monitors and address financial barrier such as high co pays and deductibles\nPatients follow your healthcare teams instructions on how much medicine to take how often and how long to take it\nAsks questions about how to correctly take your medicine and why you need them use weekly pill boxes or a reminder system to keep track of when to take medicine\nTo learn more visit C.

and they make a sea of\nIraq that I've gotten to where you were doing without ... you don't got two daughters when they wanted something when you took up to the store course back out in the store my

told you I worked in a children's shoe store and the\nKids used to just make a C\nUm make us see and it was going to rank no no no doubt about it there and discuss with him\nBut any way Jimmy ... here's what he said he's saying he wants out of\nMinnesota because he wants to win everybody wants to win and he can't win with what they have in Minnesota I got to be honest and I I'm a Jimmy Butler fan he's a great player\nI got a cry ... that's that they that ain't true\nNumber one I'm getting into that you want to ... deal and you saw the Wiggins Andrew we can recall every time I was getting the ... and you like I'm Better to know what's going on which I get that makes sense but don't tell me when you want to leave\nOne of the top three young big men in basketball\nCall Abby town hall is softening of you'd think he'd soft or whatever and you wouldn't guess who's a very good third option and some good role whereas Jeff tea\nOf that they could be a factor in the way they couldn't win it\nThey could be a factor in the west to convert don't tell you about winning when you leave that to do to Brooklyn he just wants them to you from New York so don't\nCome to my\nMind about that is all about winning when you want to go to most of those brands I live in Miami which is a good franchise you'll be first round second round\nMiami which\nIs a good franchise you'll be first round second round it out the rest of your career well your prime\nLet's let's listen to some sound where Wiggins even went as far as the call and now I mean a lot of the cold out yeah towns in Wiggins uh let's see what he said\nEverybody has to have a winning or the ... is our number one priority winning is all that we're worried about you feel that that wasn't the case and\nIt was it is and I think that's the the the part that everybody doesn't see but I Want me I'm going to be on it I'm not going to say no names but I'm going to be honest if your number one party isn't winning and people can tell that the battle now there's a problem between people because that guy's number one priority is winning that guy's in it\nOf course they're going to class like I'm doing it for the team are you\nExactly so that's that's what it is connected\nI repeat Brooklyn New York LA Clippers am I wrong you\nKnow I get it but maybe he believes that there's something else and it's good to be somebody else said he'd rather team up with and beat a better situation and he looked at those teams that you just mentioned and Chris what do they all have in common other than being the major cities\nThey ... they got carrying them Miami Miami doesn't he go to Miami he'd be stuck there and with what they got you\nWhat I'm Talking about the other three of his first three dimension\nThat's a crap shoot Brooklyn is not getting any big time free agent\nThey got money you know craving had\nMoney they got money this year the guys had money they've had Jay Z they've had a new arena\nYeah but it didn't work and they got into\nNow ... staying or leagues talking like you staying in Boston\nWell that's what he said he didn't he didn't say for sure he said the plans or two we saw the clippers are the plans exactly like I'm going I'm signing today I don't know about that\nHe's talking all fleas talking a lot about Boston is saying\nIf if is all about winning don't bring me these teams All right let's go to school and then you won't play when LeBron James\nWas all about winning a huge you got to make a great point hey Dwight in Kentucky you on the odd couple and Fox Sports radio which you got white\nWas a good lawyer Dorner man doing great grandma\nA good looking okay this I wanted to talk about ... you know how they were you I was a kind of agree with the state which are made earlier about a lot of players not wanting to play with him but at the same time I think like you say these players\nThey remind me of the of our kids these days they they they don't like discipline you know what I'm saying they don't like structure through for instance the bronze like you say it as an old school type player you know what I'm saying and I am a bronze star players is that it's going to be disciplined on his team and it's going to be disappearing from the coast these players these days only like we just plain buddy\n... okay let me ... I hear you let me say one thing let's go back to Isaiah Thomas remember one one of the complaints about Cleveland you remember\nOf course the number one is with links to today's either you're not allowed Zeke right okay I said Thomas\nYou remember the one thing that it was it was too little he goes before him\nKnows where the other but his thing was that they don't practice ... broad doesn't like the practice don't you remember that\nYou understand what I'm Talking about in game situations also well if we're going to bring up I was there I got we got to remember\nAs there was it he could have been traded to Boston Celtics would read our back of the coach and he was going to if it if it wasn't Boston or anything much to say like um he could have been a traitor to the pistons would um uh what was what was the name ...\nEarly ... and ... so he clearly\nHe could have been traded to um the Lakers with pat Riley he wanted to stay involved there so he wasn't going to be happy anyway he's going to have complaints about anything he got traded to agree with\nOur Dwyer guy he was mixing up decades now and I was talking about ... found out all the ... they may we can squeeze one more and how 'bout Damien him in western Kentucky that what that is you're on the odd couple Fox\nI'm not talking to a guy I mean I used to live in Kentucky\n[noise] yeah and I hope you got your wings from ... from Shannon\nThere they were alive and watch it strike zones all over the place as well so you know it's part of the human element and I like that you can have a feeling in the game as opposed to a robot\nAnd if it's calibrated just slightly off that we're going to talk about millimeters and problems I mean everybody wants to live and die by the yellow line in football where have you that baseball now to a oh a\nCourse we've seen even with the instant replay in the NFL let get it wrong Mike how many times have you seen them get it wrong even with the instant ... well it's sometimes they don't even bother to go to the instant replay any other holy defend the other part Chris that does the human it makes no sense you say you want to put the strike zone but you don't want to that first base\nThat the robots are going to be the one to get it right every time what what what's the difference why if you want to get a correct why when you go robots all the way because you don't have the technology to yes they do they could easily have a robot\nThe technology for balls and strikes are they getting close they don't have it for calls at first\nThe technology for balls and strikes are they getting close they don't have it for\nCalls at first base and things like that all we're six million dollar home ...

memorization yes\nThat's entirely true in the primary way in which we teach students history\nHere too and most of our text books are written it's the way most estate exams or it's most state exams tests for and it's the kind of knowledge grade students might have for the test\nBut it's real hard to think of it interesting ... for the industrial revolution matches Columbus selling the ocean below so that um students really don't gain that kind of understanding\nAnd it's a real issue in February we're going to we demon foundation\nWas going to recruit new way to teach American history\nBased on providing students are more interactive here are deeper problem days\nMore understanding of the field more story covering less ratification\nBut that was certainly seem to be aboard that perhaps a greater context uh I I must admit that I've always been something of a history nerd and I find this sort of thing a compelling the the various issues interacted or the personalities who\nAh who interacted and how history would have changed by a difference in the identity of the certain key people at a certain time for example had Abraham Lincoln not been elected president and they deemed sixty or our history would have been dramatically changed in all likelihood so\nThese are important things that it doesn't strike me as an advanced impossible to to teach this way as it\nIs and they're already programs around the country that are doing this a very simulation fair game for the last three years but foundation in teaching history teachers in schools\nHow to teach using game ... games but more importantly let's go back to your Lincoln example so Lincoln arrives in Washington\nHave had to sneak into Washington to avoid the assassination comes he arrives at the White House\nAnd we can could think of all of history as a negative all\nWe tend to think of the people who had the jobs ... figures out of ... historic gone Lincoln arrives he's a flesh and blood man who comes from the mid west\nTo Washington DC and he's running and three other people\nAnd certainly doesn't have the support of many many American colleagues Lincoln has a real choice\nBecause he wanted to go to war or go to the want him to go shoot your way out of this\nIf we can set up the conditions that allow students to role playing\nGame or a grandmother document at the ways that we don't permit field studies how real can we make Lincoln and this decision how hard could make it for them to make the decision because richer wars for Lincoln\nAbsolutely one can certainly a a command

Fifteen\n[laughter] will the town of eight really came about when I tried to scale this down remember I was doing these big experiments I wanted to know what happens if we put people in groups\nOf you know groups small groups in my workshop you know will will they heel and so this is just another experiment in my own mind and I was sitting there trying to figure out how to do this in a workshop because this is back in two thousand and eight and then I wasn't I hadn't really\nDone many workshops before you know I'm an investigative reporter by training that's what I used to bust baby selling rings when I was you know young so um\nSo I I Will kiss around this with my husband and I'm sort of saying well I don't know maybe I'll just put people in groups of eight and or so and\nHave them send healing intention to each other and he's a good headline writer and he said yeah I Love it the power of eight so it came about totally by accident we put people in groups of eight in our workshop\nThe first one we ran in Chicago\nI I was kind of I I knew how to do intention I studied it within tension masters I'd put together a program I'd looked at what we're doing scientific in the scientific lab but I wasn't sure about these small groups should they hold hands when Jimmy do so I'm I'm kind of making it up as I go along\nAnd the next day I figured\nI'd I have him come back the next day and tell us what happened and I had all the groups and intention to somebody in the group with some sort of health challenge and when they came back I assume they were going to tell me it's\nIt's kind of like having a facial or getting back rub do you know nice little feel good effect that isn't what happened\nWhat happened is stuff like this they lined up I gave them the Mike in turn and they said things\nLike I have cataracts and their eighty percent better I'm due for a new replacement my knees completely messed up and I'm walking normally today\nAnd I can do deep squats I have terrible insomnia and I slept like a baby last night you know and on and on it went like that\nTotal instant healing and I was completely shocked because as I said I'm you know I I look at things as a journalist I look at things I Try to look at the science of things that are trying to prove things\nAnd this was completely out of my realm so I didn't believe it I like to be honest George I thought it was a placebo effect but then it started happening over and over and over I mean I've run hundreds of these things\nAnd I've had people where their their arm is dislocated and its slots back into place during the intention or somebody who had couldn't see well because she had a stroke and her eyes went back to normal\nSomebody with school yo says who went completely out of pain and we then you know a month or so were daughter wrote me just say that her back straight in so much they had to change the rearview mirror of her car\nStories like this over and over again and the same thing going on with some of the Sanders too and that was the thing that really was amazing\nTo me all told me about the shelters or how how powerful must be and then what was happening to them\nWill their ordinary people this is the amazing thing of it George we all have this power this is our birthright it's just we don't know this we don't know how to use it and we don't realize it amplifies in a group [noise]\nLet me tell you about the story of Wes I mean with when I met him I put together a couple of groups at the mile high church in Denver just this kind of\nJust as a test this was last last so I'm\nLess muscle and um I ... I wanted to put himself forward he was one of the the initial groups\nUm because he suffered from terrible depression but\nThere was a woman there was staged for cancer\nLinda and so we we decided to go with her but Wes had a terrible life he had been a really bright guy in college studying biochemistry wanting to be a doctor and he got a he got called in he had a low lottery number in the very last years of the Vietnam War\nAnd they'd done away with a draft deferments for college um college students so he had to go in the last horrible chaotic years of the war\nAnd it was so traumatic for him he came back was really depressed and that continued in his life even even lost the love of his life to fast growing cancer it was just terrible story so by the time he\nHe got to meeting me he had gotten to a point of feeling like what's the use and he was living in a senior facility\nYou barely able to get up and make themselves breakfast in the morning really depressed so he does his intention for Linda\n[noise] and then that the next day he told me he woke up and everything had really changed it was almost like he had this amazing heightened to sensory awareness\nAnd everything had really changed it was almost like he had this amazing heightened sensory awareness you know the grass is greener than it ever been\nHe drank a cup of herbal tea and it knocked his socks off he says\nUm but even more amazing was the next night he had this extraordinary vision on a dream almost like a vision where he was back in college and he met his Nineteen year old self\nAnd the the Nineteen year Old West communicated to him in some way it's all going to be okay there's still plenty of time and that\nExperience to him was so life transforming he's a completely different guy now he is\nPower walking Ninety minutes the lifting weights he's running group says it's at his church is writing is trying to write again\nHe's doing all kinds of stuff and he had completely given up and that is only one time from being a cinder um and this is a story I hear over and over again where that active being part of this group of being kind of a higher consciousness is life transforming\nWindows the sender need to have any special abilities\n[noise] well here's the really interesting thing of it you know I again did not believe this I was looking at it from every angle um it took me ten years to even get the courage to write this book\nWorld could we say you were the skeptic of all skeptics\nI was I was the ultimate doubting Thomas because as I said I I started the intention experiment because I wasn't I wasn't really sure about all of this manifestation law of attraction\nI didn't I wasn't sure I believed it and I wanted to find out how far can you take it you know are we talking about the shifting a quantum particle are we talking about curing cancer here so um that's when I set up the intention experiments but I never\nI never thought these little groups would have the power but the thing that's so interesting is I had a life university is the largest chiropractic university I'm In the world and they offered to do studies of the power to let their nerves science department look at this\nSo we set up a group of students\nAnd we put a eat Jake kept to measure the brain waves of each one person one sender in each of the groups and what we found was so amazing that within a few minutes they\nWould have this completely different brainwaves signature it would turn off all the part of the power of a group would have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate and also the parts of the brain that make us\nHave worried doubt negativity so these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling\nA sense of ecstatic one this and when we compared these signatures when the nearest scientists who work at the doctors said Stephanie Sullivan um we looked at\nOther things like the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monks any static prayer they had an identical brainwave signature but the only difference was\nI had you know it takes years to become a Buddhist monk or a sci fi master sure my guys were total novices they were students who never even done meditation and all they had was uh twelve minute video for me\nTo do when we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and just a moment to talk more about your work\nThe power of age and some of the incredible things that can be done with the power of intention truly remarkable

amazing how it works and doesn't take much effort to make things happen\nWe'll soon that was the interesting thing about this no it doesn't I think what it takes is meeting regularly it it takes some techniques and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow to become a really good in tender\nAnd also to intend well a new group but for me the thing the real key element is creating a little group of eight or so and you asked before they have to be eight no five all work\nEleven to work you know eight is kind of a Goldilocks figure\nYou know it's like the not too big not too little um but what's really important is meeting week after week after week and I found that after\nI'm putting people in groups in twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment because I wanted to see if everything in their lives would begin to heal not just their health\nSo I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and have them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year and\nIt was extraordinary of the\nPeople who continued to meet regularly you know every week and that was about a hundred and fifty of them pretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is\nSo it wasn't just their health you know they got financial windfall\nOr they got amazing new careers or they made up with this strange relatives or you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted um just came out of nowhere or they found a new life purpose but it pretty much everybody had extraordinary stories to tell\nOur our ... are you sure that this works uh primarily from the ... or ... or science behind\n[noise] well I think there's a science in the sense that um we did that brainwaves study and we found that you know there are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of\nIn a group called ... group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer\nBecause you have these major changes\nWhich are really very\nVery much similar\nTo somebody having a mystical state you know somebody having a mystical experience people get changed during those kinds of experiences\nAnd they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities or they suddenly\nFeel you know something major has changed all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future and so in a way that starts to pave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual\nThat paved the way for major changes\nAnd and possibilities but there's something more there's a bigger piece of this George that\nAnd believe me I'm trying to figure out what is it is a group of fact you know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism\nUm that was the big surprise for me because remember this Sanders we're having amazing effects to healing effects and when I started looking into um\nThe science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people\nNo matter how small live longer are happier are healthier in every regard and nuts what we found in a lot of our intention groups I mean when I talk about that group in twenty Fifteen and I was studying for a whole year\nI'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere you know one of them was a woman called Andy and Andy was going through a divorce\nAnd she had two small kids she needed a new job and she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know young woman just couldn't get anything and she was just trying everything and\nWe talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with her and finally I was a bit frustrated by it and I just said oh Andy get off of yourself start intending for someone else\nAnd she was one of the people who was intending for that young boy Luke\nAnd the moment she did that she gets a coal out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job so can I tell you any everything about how this works\nYou're absolutely not [laughter] there's a complete X factor\nHere I don't understand but there is something about that power of getting off of yourself and doing for someone else that seems to get\nA reward for you but you're convinced that works aren't you\nI Am convinced it works I watch it as I say I sort of look at it almost like a scientist I've looked at it\nSteady in groups over years um you know I run I run these year long mastered classes and I'm I'm actually evaluating what's happening to people they're filling out forms every month to say what's changed in their lives and\nYou know we've done the brain studies were going to do immune systems studies um and just see what happens\nIn groups right in front of me you know I Know it works\nOr the other ... don't get results in the group\nWill I think it's the people who don't come regularly um sometimes it's nothing to do with skepticism that's the interesting thing too I gave a talk once in in Denver last last year\nAnd there was a woman who had really bad arthritis and she was a total skeptic and she got healed right away but there and um you know we've had people like that\nWho haven't who were a little skeptical really didn't you know thought to themselves yeah right and they had some healing doesn't mean everybody in an audience gets healed\nBut a lot of them you know there's enough\nTo say something really interesting is going on here\nAnd are you interested in the healing because it's easier to track in terms of the ... the ...\nOh you mean a physical healing well yeah because it is it's easy to ... you know somebody had a condition they don't have the conditions growing up we\nHad a woman with stage four cancer I talked about earlier and she's now you know down to normal numbers now she was doing other stuff too but the intention pushed it right along somebody else\nIt was doing other stuff too but the intention pushed it right along somebody else with T. M. J. problems those temporary ... joint problems in your jaw and uh that she was\nSort of suffering where the pain of eight or nine out of ten and it went immediately down to two\nAnd then the pain was gone over days so this kind of thing you know it's kind of this healed in an instant or soon after\nIs the thing that you can as you say really track but then you've got other things we're amazing synchronous a cheese happen you know another woman who was trying to write a book she was a body work\nUm expert Lisa\nAnd she was in one of these year long groups and she was trying to write a book about\nShe figured out a way to treat\nTrauma victims with body work and she wanted to write this book about it she'd never written a book and she was getting no where she had three different editors and just nothing was happening and and the group was intending for nothing was happening\nAnd finally once again I simply say get off of yourself and she started\nIntending to another member of the group who had some ... serious health issues and again the next week she has she feels compelled to go into a store and she didn't even need anything at the store and when she gets in there she meets somebody she vaguely\nBeen introduced to before and as they got chatting it turns out this woman was a former publisher and is now a book coach and when she hears what Lisa wants to do she offers to coach or through the whole thing\nEnd of the story Lisa gets her book done and it becomes an Amazon best seller so I've seen this over and over enough just to have the doubting Thomas in me start getting pretty persuaded that something amazing is going on here\nThe new ... ... am George Nouri set of course Lynn Mick Jagger is with us we're going to take your calls this hour you\nQuestions and

reporters have to learn is when they write a leader of a story they write in an intro they have to do\nWho what when where and why and how\nAnd and that's not a bad thing to do when you're formulating an intention\nAnd if a story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want\nYou know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I Want to be rich\nAnd you know they don't really want to be rich what they want is usually you know in the sense of having loads and loads of money and more stuff\nWhat they want is they don't want the job there in what they want is not to worry so much anymore they need a certain amount of money they may not necessarily need to be rich um what they want is more time\nTo spend with their children or grandchildren and so\nWhat you have to do is try to figure out first what you want what is that you really want and then tell the universe exactly what you want and\nThe other thing I noticed George is often times the universe gives us what we need not necessarily what we're trying to say we need like um I have one group one master class\nA intention group of eight and they said well we're intending for all of us to win the lottery\nAnd I said to them why what do you need and they said well\nGene needs twelve thousand dollars I'm for child and Joe needs another Fifteen thousand dollars to get a car and so and so needs this and that and I said well why do you intend for the meat individually and ask for what exactly they need because that's probably what the universe is going to give you\nYou know so\nIt's it's really about\nFirst of all figuring out what you want exactly and then telling\n... yeah exactly well here's an opportunity for you to talk with Lou Mick Jagger and about intention let's start by going to Thomas a mobile you California Tom go ahead\nGeorge thank you for taking my call lamb\nThat's really a pleasure of comment and then a question um I ... just you know your audio watch\nHer programs one called loving the fields and the other one called living with\nIntention and boy those audio compact desks are in constant rotation on my CD player I just want you to know that they're just have so much information now you think about\nRetro causality\nRetro in ... and you cite a number of experiments that appear to prove that\nWe can not only in ... for the president but we can chat and for the past that the past is not fixed and stone so to speak that there appears to be\nFixed and stone so to speak that there appears to be with experimental proof you cite a lot of researchers there appears to be a robust cross talk between the past and the future\nAnd you cite ... how much mapped a job of the peer group in Princeton and each of the experiments that they did that appear to show\nThat you can influence the past that the past is not fixed my question for you can you utilize retro intention retro causality for healing [noise]\nThat's such a great question thank you um yes the answer is the short answer is yes now I Do this all the time in my master classes and workshop semi just rented retreat in Italy last week and we were doing a lot of retro intention one I tend to do though is\nYou can't change the past of what of what happened in the sense of it happened what you can do though is changed your response to it and going forward and in a way that is\nPart of this whole thing of time being really elastic time being one big smeared out now and that's what the studies you're talking about demonstrate is that you know we what they really show is that and this is a weird thing um\nWe don't change the past we changed the present as it unfolds the future affects the present as it unfolds all those studies show but just to answer your question when I tend to do is ask people to go back to a seed moment\nTo moment in their health just when something\nJust started before it blew up to full blown disease a moment where they first\nArgument argued with somebody in a relationship and it then deteriorated afterwards just that moment when it started or a moment when somebody told you you weren't good enough as a child or you were\nTerrible at some things we\nJust just did something like that and to go back and change your response to that teacher and you say no I'm not used to set math I just don't understand this now I Will later something like that or imagine that that\nHealing that that illness\nDoesn't blow up into full blown

shocking to me cases like this she was one of the receivers in a power of a group and she wanted her intention to be that her family business expand in all directions and be prosperous and always\nAnd she and her husband had a computer support in business but it had been built on just two major clients and they were you know they ... they had just heard that\nOne of their clients was about to take their business elsewhere and they were really worried because they had lost money from a Ponzi scheme about\nA decade before and they had to file for bankruptcy and so she was really frightened that

suddenly their business received a steady stream of smaller clients and within a few months she\nThey learn not only did that major client decide to stay with them but they completely diversified their client list\nAnd she and her husband had other big opportunities to um she had kind of a certain offers she paints as a hobby and she was a given offers to do her painting and mark was trying to do a sideline business training full\nProgram that took off and it was just amazing for her she thought that something about the power of aid group\nNot only performed magic but helped her and her

as driving back from a meeting of it in in Saint cloud and I tell you it was not right traveling whether and that but like um you know started a Halloween movie\nAnd author that combine left in the

definitely some significant pounding I'm so that can put those lower pods that risk mhm I'm you know\nOne positive I'm trying to look for in the last half fall and you know we're really dry for a while there and you know there is a shattering risk yeah um\nYou know so at least right now in that but\nUm you know for corn dot quality is really a concern I went out and did a survey and it you know our stocks aren't looking at right now I'm at that only a certain as well so I'm at this point it's kind of you know\n... so figuring out what you feel they need to come out first which crap and what you feel the need yeah I'm a first at at most risk and so we share folks have a handle on that\nAs it is interesting is as messy and and the sloppy and and bad as the weather was if the wind would've blown even harder though in a good portion of the region it would really caused some problems with a similar stocks and and soybeans stance too I mean it would just lay down a lot of that crap\nOh your ear exactly right yeah um so I thought what we recommend that folks go out and and either ... or ... their their corn if his team what what that stock integrity like so I I tend to push

we do to to uh build their stock integrity or just happened to be the the a series of events the summer\n[laughter] so yeah there's there's a lot that's really just kind of winning the opposite of the

Nineteen ram another ... around as well so some great deals and do what's your what started rubbers along with all of the deal that we have for an hour days that you mentioned is just\nExactly we're not going to give up on us either that or put them in a very small very kennel on 'til they really have to go and they won't go in there and then\nJust ... quick and so they get done and they've proved that they'll do it then they can have some freedoms and and\nWhat I did last night as I got home I shoveled out an area of grass so they still have the grass 'cause my ... well not very often and my dad way but I thought we had like six eight inches of snow on a figure to bury him if he tried to go up there and it would never happen so I cleared away of an area of\nGreen grass so that they still had but I'm going to be tough for the little dogs can me but I'm not even your use of having a heart so don't don't even think about\nWanting rumors and we're not OK when he got on your list let's get started well\nThe first was um because of the ice and snow you know there's a lot of salt being used already and so you got to really watch the dogs paws make sure that they don't get that salt on there they start getting dried out pads then they start getting crack they all this stuff so\nIf your dog goes out and you know that you've taken him on a walk down the sidewalk and you know and that they've come across solved whether you've cross the street that had it on or whatever\nAs soon as you get home just take a worm wet rag and just\nRub off most of the salt that they're you know you'll see a bunch of salt on the chest and abdomen also just from splashing I'm but make sure you get that off so that that first of all they're not looking at and then drinking more water and then having potty problems again back to that or\nThat they don't get dried out pads on their feet and stuff like that there is a bomb that you can put on it that's like a musher washers secret or something like that\nThey have different kinds of bombs that you can actually put on there and before you take them out to help but then the salt is going to be stuck in there too so you always want to wipe them off when they come back and okay obviously the country dogs don't see in near the salt that you know a pound dogs do but right right um\nSo um you rinse them off or just wipe them off as good just wipe\nThem off with the damn brag you know ... warm rag and um so you get most of that off and that can that\nAh other than them licking it and it was so dangerous drying it outdoor just is it the the licking of the salt that the ingesting it as the the ... most worried\nWell they're both issues for me I Would consider them both issues because I've had a dog that has had too much salt intake and it's no fun and you know\nThey they get sick you know you they can't make it outside their urinating all over the can stop it because they are drinking more water and that's and that [noise] um but the salt will dry it out that's the biggest thing you know it'll dry out the it'll get crack you know how it is\nIt out that's the biggest thing you know it'll dry out there it'll get crack you know how it is when you have a thing or that's all wrapped them tap lives for the camera and it hurts a very very big on the bottom of the pause and then they got to walk on it you can keep your lips ... most people can\nBuy out all of us not all you but you know when they have to walk on that continuously and\nCan you if you can you put your wipe them off should do if if it looks like they're getting story put Vaseline or something\nYeah the coconut oil or something like that and you know an oil may be some kind of oil or Canada Adam\nOkay okay if need be but if you you just keep an eye on it it shouldn't be a ...\nYou know as long as you're using air wiper at let's say you're going somewhere and you're going in when you get there than just carry a rag with you and take 'em in the bathroom when you get there and you know\nWipe off their little ... they have these really cool little things that you can stick their whole foot down you know that you have water and and you just stick one foot all the way down in there and it washes it off and then you pull it back out but yeah I\n... [laughter] a rag will do just fine yeah and it's cheaper okay but if you're worried about water intake when you're kind of going back and forth on an average day\nI dog needs one ounce of water per pound a body late so if you have an eighty pound dog he's got to have eighty ... of water a day okay but I notice in the winter my dog's drink a lot more because the air's drier\nThe furnaces going you know it's drying out their skin and they got a drink even more to reestablish that fluid in their body and they self regulate really well so\nIf you're thinking well my dog is drinking an awful lot of water as long as you're not having problems with the other side the urine and stuff like that area\nThey're doing fine you know he shouldn't have to cut back on their water unless they're a puppy and you want to cut them off at like six o'clock in the evening so that and they aren't going all night long but I'm just kind of remember that rule of ... per pound for pound body weight get when I was proposed a body weight for a\nFor water intake and that's that's on average on average you know I'm not talking a dog that's out hunting\nAll day or anyway I had my circumstance right a ... different things but that's that's actually a surrogate guideline for people to hold food can you can do the same thing with food and with one on bravo water ... can you look at food and say so much for food and for some\nVery too much I guess I haven't really looked that up if there is a guideline because every dog food you know when you look at the back of a bag at the suggestion it is not is not cut and do their own gestures and the bags they do has\nNever looked at as close enough because you throw food and once a week and call how could I jump in there and eat all you want yeah\nYeah and if they don't over eat that's fine I'm at a too little to overeat but ah I've never had a problem with that we we just fill up\nI've never measured for these dogs and there's a lot of dogs that come to the count on you know that are severely overweight and that they're doing things like this but\nUm it does not matter what breed of dog you have even if you have a bulldog or or whatever there should still be at talk up in front of the back leg so if the guy Doesn't Suck up and it's not tight and its sagging\nThey got extra weight they're so sagging belly yes it doesn't have to be sagging farther than the rib cage it just it has to actually go from the rib cage up to the back like\nAnd in a little bit so you know a lot of people have dogs that are very hairy they don't see that unless you start feeling down their sides and well if you're not feeling your dog and pending it every once in a while you don't know what's going on in there so\nEspecially this time of year everybody's letting their dog hair girl on girl cousin who do their freaking out a\nIs growing is growing rapidly to get them and now this was kind of throwing them off a little bit in this country because it's like whoa I didn't expect winter this soon\nYeah and my daughter they're looking at me like I'm is that all the food I get I Need at least three times more because it's cold outside and I can stay warm so but they are not that long any difference\nBetween the heart of who you always talked to a number of times about different foods or whether it's hard food or soft food doesn't really matter as a\nMatter of the ... the gradients that is kind of where I was going with the dog food and the amounts because um\nSome dog foods are higher in protein they don't need as much or\nUm let's say you're hunting with your dog he might be it three times more food you know during hunting season and not put on a pound you know you just got to regulate that with what your dog is but it's not going to be like\nOkay well I only gave them two cups today and usually it's three cups so that's how many should be ... no it doesn't happen that fast it's like over a month so\nYou want to slowly wean off or slowly add you don't want to\nBe just you know one day to come crashing the eyes you know [laughter]\nBut those people that say well I couldn't feeding my dog scraps and now he ... and like five days well a dog can live sixty three days without eating what I've been told\nI don't think I Would push it in sixty three holy cow at so if your dog doesn't eat for five days and he's throwing a fit because he doesn't get his favorite treats and doesn't want to live off of his favorite treats\nHe Ninety nine percent of the dogs will not starve themselves to them they may cause some problems around the house digging into things you know hunting outside whatever but they're not going to start themselves to them\nSo eventually they'll switch over from the goodies to regular food yes can you just said to be persistent again exactly okay sixty one twelve thirty it's eleven twenty eight are going to get David\nByrnes in from the newsroom here and just a moment and then they will continue

I'm Deborah\nTo candies out I got the cutest cost them for my dog I'll have to show you is just so cute everybody just loves it uh [laughter]\nBut ah yeah you don't want you don't want the dogs and the candy and when there's candy sitting all over the place we all know how that works um know chocolate know grapes and raisins um\nNothing was ... and I'm so no fake sugars oh God\nYou know there's so many things at the art schools have if you want to give them a treat you they can have a piece of an Applebee's and the carrot piece of watermelon piece of pineapple and all those like humans are the good food is a good food right and the bad food is is not so good not so good so far to mind I don't\nKnow [laughter] yeah I'm I'm okay with it too with the\nIt's the fast food gr for me but um yeah no you just have to use commonsense make sure that you um have all your center on you have your candy put up and you know especially if kids are coming to the house and their dress a little\nScary you might want to keep the dog and the other room just to avoid confrontation um it's kinda scary for a dog not to be able to see somebody's face they read a lot of the biggest concern and you'll just see the yeah\nIf they can see your face they can read your emotions they can read your intention they can read all sorts of things so\nThat's the number one thing the dog to look for is for eye contact so if you have any of that stuff covered up kind of freaks them out especially if you have these big guys that look evil [laughter] you know and then pretty soon the dog's just yeah\nOkay I Can't reduce oh here for I'm just going to get defensive because I don't know what to do because I'm scared I could be you know\nScared or just trying to protect my own property or whatever you know you just try to minimize all that not only that but as your opening and closing the door you don't want your dog screaming out even if he's not afraid to you don't want him to be running out the door when you open it and then yeah last dog on your hands so\nIt was maybe just to find a room quiet room and board um uh in the quiet room for a while yeah or when they put them in a kennel 'em up\nYeah out of the way so not seeing the front door because then you're going to cause barking issues that are going to start barking more and more all the time just because they dogs build their self esteem by people leaving so if they start barking and the kids get their candy turn around and walk out\nAnd they're like oh you're allowing a way to the next time yeah exactly\nUm and keep the chocolate out of the way are there any candy and you can either they're okay like fruit snacks with is is I'm just I'm just trying to think of it for the dog gets in ... or any candidates could worm or a necessarily good for him but I sat\nAnd for them maybe yeah maybe it doesn't have chocolate violet taller grapes in it then you're usually pretty good I mean I don't know what that would be like taffy or ... why would you feed a dog tag I'm Carmel\n[noise] see I'm trying to buy into the ... yeah and I could see a lot of people laughing about that thinking that was funny but then you're going to have taffy everywhere in the whiskers of the dog and skip the taffy yeah OK\nI'm watching chocolate because it can be serious\nAnd we we talk about this each year but it's ah it's no laughing matter a if a dog gets sick no because they also throw up on during bird they're they're trying to get through our window this morning I read a lot of them in a couple of them sitting out here they keep trying to go to the window weird they're\nThey don't know what to eat what not to eat [laughter] maybe eating fermented\nBerries to yes All right I'm a oh we need to get to earlier

diagnosed with bipolar disorder but then met he was misdiagnosed and was simply sleep deprived we could empower the pharmaceuticals in it and make more money the rapper said\nWest did touch on criminal justice reform the\nPrimary topic he came to the White House to address Mr Trump earlier in the week said Chicago should strongly consider implement any stop and frisk program like the one New York city had\nBut West said many people told them the most important thing is to make sure the curb the to curb any stop and frisk policies west said the focus needs to be on love instead I don't know I Love is going to solve Chicago's mass\nMurder problem no they will you know and those guys are driving down roads and pulling the machine the machine gun on just spraying the entire crowd I

thought was okay how can we fix that and\nOur doctor several you need to go see a parent and tall adjust a specialist to see if you know to to for him to look at it further when we went to the doctor and he checked everything out and confirmed that our son did not have kidney and what we learned was that\nKid needs help actually produce the lungs or or develop the lungs because basically the baby will drink the em the audit fluid and then he'll be it out in the\nDrinking and not actually develop the lungs\nAnd so the issue wasn't necessarily is lack of kidneys the but the fact that his lungs would not develop\nWe were told that we you know that he would probably come middle aged thirty weeks gestation and so uh we're just continue the pregnancy and uh just try to enjoy every moment that we ... that we had with him just sometimes he would\nMove he couldn't move a lot because there was no fluid by we would just to play music for him at night and just try to spend whatever time we could with him for about a thirty four weeks in the pregnancy I started to having contractions and went into labor\nAnd so we went to the hospital\nTo deliver David now how this whole this whole time you know I\nAt that point it's been a couple of months that we knew that David would outlive I also learned about an organization called now let me down to sleep in that organization provides\nRemembrance portraits two parents suffering the death of a baby when a friend first told me about it I was a little hesitant I thought is that appropriate to be taking pictures of a baby\nIn the situation but I went to the website and I saw how beautiful photographs were and I realized that we would never have this opportunity again\nTo be able to photograph our son and so I decided to\nHave the photographs of our son\nSibling when we went in to deliver David out his heart was still beating and when it was time for me to to push they pulled the part one are often him because they knew that you could possibly die during the delivery process so they took to hurt monitor off\nAnd the thing I was hoping for the most was that he will be born alive and so when he was born and they said that he did not have a heart heartbeat he was not breathing and they had to him to me and I was\nI was so crushed that\nOur son was important alive but then at the same time I remember looking at him and thinking\nWow he this baby was in his beautiful and just like any first time mom would feel about a baby there their first baby just how beautiful and I cannot believe that I was carrying this baby\nWithin the reality struck again that he was not alive [noise]\nWe we set the time with him and then our photographer came in and she photographed\nDavid and just you know documenting or time with him we gave him a bath we helped him she weighed them we have pictures of him on the scale of\nEach of us holding him of us of the family of him alone and ah we you know we just cherish those moments that we had with him [noise]\nAbout six hours after she was born we just we knew it was time that we needed to let him go and it was the hardest things I ever did [noise]\nTo give him over to a nurse and know that I Would never hold him again [noise]\nSo at that at that point he uh\nYou know I was being discharged from the hospital and we now needed to make funeral arrangements and because we knew ahead of time we were able to speak some of those things through there's\nMany many other families who who's a baby and it's set in and they don't have that time to prepare but we knew where we were we would bury him and\nSo I remember going home that night and trying to go to bed but then I realized where where is David as you get the hospitals funeral home pick him up and I called the nurse at the hospital\nShe was back on your shift again and she assured me that he was still there and I was just wanting to know where my baby was so we went a so a few days later we had a memorial service and we buried our son David\nWe were told that we could go on and have other children that this was a fluke occurrence then I have seen on line other stories with babies who had what it's called ... syndrome a where the the parents go on and have healthy children and his chromosomes ... uh turned up okay and\nLet's go on and have healthy children and his ... turned up okay and all the other tests were fine so we were clear to have another baby and we got pregnant a couple of months later\nWe we're cautiously optimistic and um we went in for a number of ultrasound that is still considered an ... a high risk pregnancy because of our situation but we still would need to wait until the sixteen week ultrasound to see if\nOur baby had kidneys [noise] so at the sixteen ... found we went in and the doctor but then there with the ultrasound technician and I'm laying there\nAnd he just pause and he said wait a minute let me step in and so he stepped in for the ultrasound technician and he was looking and I kept asking what what's wrong what's going on and he wouldn't tell us they just kept looking and I said that the kidneys and he said he does and I said okay then what's\nWhat's going on because they knew something had to have been wrong [noise]\nHe had a U.S go into another room and my husband and I just we waited for it seemed like forever and then the doctor and he came in and he said\nHow your baby has us is around the neck and severe fluid buildup\nAnd what we later learned was that it's ... hydra high drops of the fluid and following around all of his organs\nAnd at that point they were unsure of the gender of our baby because of all the spelling and then the doctor said that his heart could stop beating at any time and so\nUm he said he can't move and I didn't feel a move at all that I Need to come in every week to see it as hard as is still leading every weekend we went in and I started getting more hope because I thought maybe\nThis is our miracle maybe this is what we had to go through to have to have our miracle and and nothing has ever been too easy for me throughout my life so I thought maybe this is a miracle every week we went in and then by twenty four weeks since the pregnancy and [noise]\nWe learned that our baby's heart stopped\nAnd so the doctor said you can you know you can\nStill carrying a baby for a while and you'll probably going to National Labor if you don't buy a certain period of time I can't remember how long that was then we would have to do or you can go ahead and do and I looked at him I said what am I supposed to do is I'm Still caring and and knowing that he died so my husband and I went\nTo the hospital that night and they enthused labor [noise] and we had a little boy that we named Ethan\nAnd that I had a camera in my bag [noise]\nAnd I remember thinking you know let's get some pictures because when his when he was born and his condition was extremely severe\nA lot of ... we're not identifiable he could see his hand at his feet but the spelling was selling was pretty severe and I knew it wasn't a situation that we would bring now down to the ... too and I remember thinking about the camera in my bag that maybe with him covered in a blanket\nAnd my husband and I holding him we could have a picture of him but I just didn't have the courage to it and I didn't have any one encouraging me to say you know go ahead and take some pictures and um so we never photographed eat them and that's one of the biggest regrets in my life\nAnd one of the story Gina's story and more of

V. it say snow really do this or music you know what I mean everything turns table it's it's amazing it's everything's so you won't\nBe regret it I I think I might go out and you know to go ahead you

about your phone you know dead\n[laughter] and you were like I I'm not the most technologically advanced guy I'm\nNot either I always need help from people to Robert my stuff but anyway uh yeah we got a great show Thursday Night Football let's let's welcome in the odd couple of cruel as always Chris because you know what\nWe wouldn't be able to do this five radio show without I'm Rob GR producer Iowa Sam is a engineer today filling in for Alex of course our anger Depp Carson\nWho keep you updated or with the show and I interned Daniel today so we got a we're in full effect and of course the crew is behind the other side of the glass so Chris Broussard let's kick some ass and get started\nAll right All right well look no\nPlace to start but with the NFL and you've got a big game tonight I look I'm with the players when they talk about just how the Thursday night game\nIs really not great for players you know you get a short rest in many cases and you don't always see the best football and it's tough on their bodies and all that but I Will say this when Thursday rolls around\nAnd there is a great game\nOn the schedule I'm hyped um hype\nI mean I I'm I'm torn because I'm with the players in that there shouldn't be Thursday games but then the fan and me is like I Need my Thursday game especially when you have one like you do tonight and that's the New York giants\nAgainst the Philadelphia Eagles and my question to you Robert Parker and to everyone else out there listening is who needs this when\nMore the giants are the eagles and you look at the records the giants come in one in four or they just got their hearts broken in Carolina right with the Ninety three or field goal or whatever was as Todd expired\nAnd the eagles lost to the to Minnesota at home and the eagles now or\nTwo and three but the the the good news is that the eastern uh that the er and I mean he is not\nA out of reach for anybody really a nice way to put it out loud ages based piss poor high piss poor stinky whatever but I'll tell you right now I think it's the eagles who need this when much more and I'll tell you why\nThe eagles are the defending champ they got their quarterback of back he's getting you know culture and better every week\nAnd I think that the giants are the ones who will wallow in one and four\nAnd if you're the eagles and you lose to them and basically become\nA two and four just like the giants that's a bad look for you and and you're you're going the other way if you beat the giants\nYou're three and three and probably sit atop right tied for the uh Rob gee wouldn't they be\nTied for the top of the NFC East so they would because why would you want to be and still have ten games to play for the giants will be buried at one in five so it's a huge game the difference between being at the top of the division and and having a chance to get back to where you want\nWhich is another one at the super bowl or\nFor you to be one or two and four with the New York giants in the basement I think this is a huge game for the eagles\nIt's huge for the eagles there's no question but it's bigger it's more of a must win for the giants I mean you say to yourself they will be buried\nIf they their their season with essentially be over if they go one in five not true for Philadelphia Philadelphia to inform in the division where Washington leads you that to into you still have plenty of time to get back to the top of this division yeah but\nThe only thing is you're losing to a one in four team and I know it's a road game and it's in Jersey\nBut if you're the eagles and you got something you got to stop on the giants the only way that they they just ... just said they have no heart he's working on the team ripping on a play called and all the other stuff that's going on this team is is wounded there's blood in the water\nThat's my point so I mean look I'm not trying to say if not a big game for Philadelphia it is as I said from the start both of these teams need this game\nBut if you're Philadelphia you can recover if the giants ... number one you'll be one in five in the win last column but beyond that as you said that his transpired in the last\nWeek I mean oh now backed them calling out the the officers schemes calling out his quarterback you know we don't know how their teammates bill but some people have said the locker rooms divided\nHow do people feel about he lie little Wayne going that he lie\nWell um what what's your pointed any like what you're making my my my point all\nRight into it I think you're already burying snow and you know really the designs already done they are done and that's that's all I have no expectations no because this is not what it was supposed\nTo be once they got back come back\nHe was supposed to have a running back now when they went and and they drafted um say Guam Barclay white all that stuff was supposed to make it better than we did the offensive line\nSo here they are with all of that stuff done and there's still one in four precisely so that's what I'm telling you is that if you're the eagles you can't afford to lose his team now\nGet I'm all for you to write\nGraham get no all he did was gay sixty three yard field goal ever since I was a kid of there's always been able to kick\nA ball long ways his Fox Sports radio\nCollege football is on and that's why don't men don't West Virginia mountain near snake I followed by us the valley Colorado College football I that's why it all begins Saturday at twelve either [laughter]\n\nCan Rob park and we are brought to you by discover card because discover card treat you like you would treat\nYou [noise] ... know ever since [noise]\nI'm not even going to call it out I'm going to give you the pleasure of calling out\nLines those first shot [noise]\nLast night in the exhibition game against the Golden State warriors in Las Vegas his first game playing alongside LeBron James and I know ever since he took that fateful shot you I've been waiting to get behind the microphone\nAnd say something we're going to get there just can you give me we'd go to get there 'cause I Want to you\nYou okay we got we got we got a couple of calls okay Thursday Night Football will get there so that's our next thing we're going to talk about for sure and uh I'm just I I Want them to do it as being an observer an honest reporter and not on my happy miss that I'm a\nPet ... cheerful when he makes it it is what it is you seem cheer\nThough I'm not a material you come off as very cheerful top it off here we go let's go to the phones Chris start to show with a Nick in New York you're\nOn the odd couple of Fox Sports radio what's up next\nNow much hey guys doing got to say I love the show I think you to work well together here that a lot thank you buddy man no problem uh I I think this is that for the giants tonight I think they're done I'm going to go out and say you like it back five times and I'm going to say that this is that where this whole entire locker room crumble wow\nThey could be that kind of nice yeah look I Do I Am picking the eagles I Do think that he was going to win because as we were talking earlier\nThey they both teams it's really a must win for both teams and I just think the eagles are better they've lost two straight he would be very disheartening for them to lose three straight especially to these poor giant exactly and costs and once his back right this is this is what do I do that hadn't really mattered\nNo but I Know but I'm a I mean he's played All right they could be two in three with Nicole who know what I mean I'll stop they could they want us to talk with Nick let's squeeze one more before we get to a ... a breakfast in New York you're on the odd couple and Fox Sports radio so France has\nA right that I look at it they they are or or doesn't ruin like if he happened to look at three or four days after that I hear the ram awful\nOn on on the wetlands there while they obviously they just\nWon the super bowl will reshape the call ... hang over into super hanging over this state let me tell you some\nNow they're not they know they're your pick so I Know they're going to be it'll be a loss of life I mean they didn't get play now they just it was the last fall\nIs that it you know I mean we're not raving about the giants playing Carolina close no is it you know the YMCA where you get points for me it grows everybody gets the trophy they're not that good\nI hate to break into the ... you're going to you're going to rule you're going to rue the day you you ordered that remember they are an outrage tall are you talking about the Lakers are you talking about the eagles and we got the\nE because when you say they're not geared up the Lakers you talk I've already guaranteed you that the eagles will not reached the super\nBowl OK let's hear and see that's a very easy pick but anyway the Lakers so long so ball last night\nChris Broussard you're fifty fifty three when\nTeam and I saw I'm Glad he corrected that fix the shot right over the off season right he's he's shooting a little different right [laughter] so his first shot last night wide open three let me see logical balls shot twenty nine percent\nWith the open three and with an open three last year which was worse in the national Basketball Association twenty nine percent\nAnd what do you do Chris that shot was straight on\nHe had nothing bear bowl and I know people want to go\nWell what do you play well yeah for yeah for a steel then he had what else for rebound and\nAnd after\nA slow start yeah what do you do what he didn't play well with LeBron James was in a game and that's the problem\nThey don't have a problem yes it is a problem no it's not gonna do\nThey don't have a problem yes it is a problem\nKnown as good as long as we're talking about lines though we he's a role player at this point he was the face of the franchise what do you mean role play it well it's a franchise digital got LeBron James so long as the ball\nHas no bearing going forward at least for the ... not the number two guy everybody needs a Batman and Robin because you've landed up there on a ... what it shouldn't Brandon anger is better than mine go by he was the number to predict as well so how was he ... he was the face\nOf the franchise I didn't hear magic say a\nMagic just old miss the boat and he knows it I imagine you know magic magic got caught up magic got excited magic guy hyped\nUp what he used to own votes for granted ... low I mean what what we rented a room was drafted no I Know what I mean he didn't see\nThe talent and think that that guy was going to be the face of the French ...\nWarren going way overboard you know it and everybody knows the sad truth\nWe're not going to be talking about lines Obama very much to see them no because he has no bearing whatsoever on what's going to happen with the Los Angeles Lakers he I think he's going to have a decent season\nI think he's got he's got a lot he's a good defender he can push the ball his vision is gray and he can rebound and with the attention on the burn and brand name groom and some other guy that they have coups when he's going to get a share point see my average nine eight nine point the game\nAnd he'll be a contributor but he's no longer a key cog if it's going to be a duo that we talked about with the Lakers this year you know it's gonna be it's gonna be LeBron James and Brandon Ingram\nYeah but the thing is\nHe's got to be able to work well with the Bronx I mean that's I I mean why are the other white on the floor so he shouldn't be on the floor shouldn't even be thinking about being on a formula bronze I don't really ought to be so so liberal he won't play will abroad basically\nThinking well here's the thing and you saw it last night LeBron James is going to play differently this year he's gonna try last night even he was off the ball a great amount liberal is going to be off the ball more than you've ever seen\nNow about the only way I'll believe it when I see it 'cause I saw some of it last night another preseason game we did see it\nYou don't teach you can't teach an old dog new tricks and I I Believe it they'll abroad is going to give up the basketball to somebody else I don't care who it is he he's played with the basketball his whole life and I just I I don't see and he's still playing well so why would you change up anything and depending on somebody\nElse's team is bill and he helped build it\nAnd the other part is what you're saying that laws was coming off the bench and all the other stuff you're talking about so you could officially I Want you to admitted right here on Fox Sports radio for three hundred and thirty stations around this great country and admit Alonzo balls the bus 'cause you don't drop the guy the second overall pick\nFor him to come off the bench and play ten or twelve minute ride Parker abdominal\nWho is one of your favorite NBA players of the last\nTwenty years who's one of my leg or your ... office up saying\nNo who who who's dropped its second he was a lottery pick who you don't want to\nSee Billups yes sure those first five years he was regarded as a bust\nHe went to Detroit resurrected his career and now may be a hall of famer certainly an NBA champion so I Know the thing here and not even into his second year of play called ... ball who really shouldn't be a junior in college above\nIt should have but you you you should have looked at it when they got LeBron and the whole idea is what is going to be awesome we got this young hot shot a\nDiehard ... no ...\nIt's it's a ... law do supposed to be the the the flavor of the month it's about ...\nNo it's not [laughter] is that why is that even the ...\nIs not even talking about lines but when you\nLook liberal knows what\nTime it is no one to have any real released a second or sneakers ... to ... they live what happened all I've got to say is well hopper Lucy they haven't put out another speaker you miss the saying you missed the whine whine whine\nPrinting money up there but that you were ready to Silicon Valley and all of all the ... of of the companies they have a better are coming on board of the TV Pakistan ... they're going to sign up for this one expires at the party billions of dollars and they could afford\nTo have you done ran ...
