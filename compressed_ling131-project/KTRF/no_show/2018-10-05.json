the table and it's going to be false seemed I Believe\nAnd that's coming up next Tuesday already October ninth and we're going to go from six to eight at the high school cost is only ten dollars to register and then you're going to pay the instructor supply fee of ten dollars\nToo and you'll be making a runner you're going to make a runner but what a great way to introduce sewing to your child or to wherever you're bringing to the class and just do a project together so little to learn how to show that I was at the same time yes they should without knowing they sex 'cause they're going to keep it real simple but it's more about getting together doing the project together\nAnd I'm guessing full theme on those runners\nI Would believe so yes or maybe a winter theme who knows [laughter] depends which she chooses later right\nOkay it'll shut down for the class in Denver the supplies yes okay All right and that but that's next Tuesday so you want to get involve your call here and get light up when I click\nYes and the reason we said get called up quick because classes do fill up\nFor instance if next class when we talk about it's called cooking with an instant pot pressure cooker it's kind of all the rage right now cooking with we all like a crock pots so but something if you want a little bit faster if you're not familiar with the instant pot\nWe're having a class on that and it's on Tuesday October twenty third\nAnd twelve people have already signed up so full oh it is but we've added another class of disappointed mark you still can register okay\nSo we have another date it's not till November but it's November first so by the time I come back that data already have passed so I wanted to tell you about it today right and you have room and now when we do have room and that one we had a three already registered for that so yeah for nine more\nFor going from five thirty to eight November first\nFive or did OK cost on the class\nCost and that is twenty nine dollars and that's going to include all your food for the night because we're going to do when we're going to talk about breakfast lunch and dinner we're going to talk about desserts appetizers taught by your very own they called him oh really\nYeah but I I used to be a teacher marked on it and I did not know that I taught high school math for twelve years really yes\nSo sometimes I get that at least you know ... or ... I did but basically it was mainly and Fergus Falls Fergus okay yep right before he moved up her them yes but I also shot and Steven arco did you ... really Waco teaching all over the boys I Am so sometimes I still have that age to teach so that can aged comedienne class\nThat's good that's good okay so um you would you say what do you call the instant instant pot instant ... where there's a different than like a crock butter is that a crisis a pressure cooker those pro cooker those were not handled so not the old\nSouth pressure cooker even those those still work great and if you don't have an instant pop per se that brand you still can come\nBut we're just going to be using instant pot that night but it's like a pressure cooker in other words it is a pressure would have been pressuring yeah OK\nAnd it'll cooked for instance if you don't know what it is it'll cooker roast in thirty minutes wow and tender like files and that one little thing on top to go to ... it does have the other thing the goal is to make that zone does even louder than that I won't makes us all going to make a good it does have an annoying sound unless you\nHave to fund though I remember my mom used to do the the old pressure cooker [laughter] that's the big show her one of the big thing on top and yelled at the end to go you know\nI don't think there's any way around that because that's how a cook so fast I suppose got relieve the pressure yes okay so great class November first just open up a new one to people out there um it's a Thursday and it's from five thirty to eight\nO'clock but it will fill up ... and the other classes already full so this was the second class on November the first um call as soon as possible is going to get ...\nGet register on line got it all set up on there to get\nWhat's next so we love our instinct pots and we love our crock pots our freezer meals filled up already but now we're going to have a freezer soup class and last I look there was only five openings left\nSo and this one we're going to not just do meals but I'm specified just on soup and the different soups that we're going to make are going to do a cheeseburger soup olive Vanya soup\nA white chicken chili French stew and chicken cheddar bacon ranch soup\nThat sound good day like today they really also oh yum plus I'm hungry maybe that\nThat will help and and the abuse like a crock pot what we do is we get together\nYou split up the recipes you usually work in pairs of two and you prepare the soup that night you put them in freezer bags and you go home put it in your freezer so you wake up in the morning throw your soup and the crock pot it hit home to work or do you go out to work come home and you have fresh soup already for you and the crock\nPot the effort on low pretty much all day right pretty much on low a cool yeah that one's coming up Monday October fifteenth or ankles some six to eight and the costs on that one eighty nine dollars but that is for five meals for your whole family\nThat's pretty good pretty down five five meals it is and that's for you know typically a family of four so now they're saying that some people do when they come to class let's say it's just you and your wife smart that's at home but you don't want to have\nA recipe for for for it so instead of putting one bag they put it into okay so you actually had a cat and meals and yeah that's that's a good and that's easy to do so if you're one that just or even a single person to have you at home either way we can make it work for you guys to okay\nAgain these are filling up fast to they are dealing with food and fills fast\nThese are the most popular cloud of we just like to eat here in northern Minnesota\nRight on our second half of open line this morning on KNPR rap a promise to visit the about Minnesota\nTim rules as they get ready to get the ... rolling in the voice of the timber wolves Alan Horn joining us on the phone this morning Alan good morning mark how are you good and yourself\nI'm excellent excellent we've got a preseason game tonight here at targets that are the only one of the previews and I'm so a transfer fantasy this close and personal and then the you know the season over as you mentioned just a twelve days away and the next Wednesday the seventeenth in San Antonio\nMan I Can't believe it came that the quick here we go again with the seasons come and go pretty quick last year was a was a fun season Allen the things change we saw some people come in and and uh kinda spruce up this team a little bit we started getting more hope\nAnd now during the off season or or just before this started this season of course um we we lose butler he decided evidently to move on and that that may hurt is a little bit so tell us a little update from last year's team to this year's team that's taking the court\nYeah and that's a big big subtraction I mean Jimmy ... there was a huge part of the timber wolves in that playoff drought and and coming up with forty seven when than reaching the post season would that thrilling are playing a game against Denver and the final game of the regular season but\nNow things are still in a little bit of flux because I'm Jimmy ... still on the roster but he is not practicing were playing with his teammates and I don't know that we have any clear idea of of when things might change whether he comes back to the team or if you sprayed it and some new pieces\nCome in to join the team it's sort of um like I said kind of a time of flux right now\nI thought that there was talk of Jimmy was going to Miami\nWell that's certainly been one of the teams that has um ... there has to garner the most interest and there's been the most talk that there was some other rumors that letter the LA Clippers or Houston might be involved but certainly from all reports that it sounds like Miami is the most interesting but I don't do that if\nYou know they're they're willing to give up one set of um you know one thing and the and the temples were asking for another and not does not seem like they've been able to meet in the middle so far\nWhat what happens Valentine's Day of let's say they don't or no other team wants to pull the trigger on this what what happens is the Jimmy set or does I mean what kind of sense of what kind of feeling you're getting\nYeah it's a great question then as we get closer and closer to the regular season that that question needs to be answered at some point I don't think we're still there yet but um it's unclear how how the timber wolves would a\nWould proceed if if it got to that point so um again you're kind of in a state of flux than you and you wonder how that affects the guys in the locker room how they perform on the floor um I don't think we can read too much into the two previous games on the west coast um they picked up a winning Golden State they lost badly to the LA Clippers the other night\nUm so I guess we'll just have to kind of wait and see\nHow you've been around the game long enough to ah to to tell you can get some people like do a ... Wiggins example I'm eating cat again with the sense I hear I hear him talking and press conferences we hear some of the ... the audio cuts you guys send us\nWe hear similar things sound like a for for wagons he'd probably be okay to see him go because I think that would increase his role what isn't it\n[noise] well yeah and it's but it's always interesting to me if if that's the case with it not just ... but any\nUm any player if you're if you're prioritizing your role in your shot at them um and and your you're not a team Blair\nWell yeah I mean you're coming off you know the answer is now entering what is it is and and uh they haven't sniff the playoffs the only one year they did was when you add more talent and Jimmy Butler yeah if if if your prioritizing individual over the team then I just don't think it's ever going to work I don't know that that's the case with Andrew I don't think it is\nBut it there's no doubt it was it was um it was a challenge facing towns butler ... to ... this last year into buying their role within a game because it you know first three years Andrew is very used to\nKnow getting his shot attempts that those were down last year but we're currently but he found the same what you'd be butler or what should be of paramount importance is when he's forty seven game\nYeah no one no doubt and we from the outside look at that and and it's easier for us to say that I'm I'm guessing it's a little tougher for them on the courage to do that\nBut let's talk about the cat and the uh the nice um um contract he sign a does that you know how how did you you see big contract signed with some players in in other sports and it's it's really weird because sometimes they'll come off a contract and played terrible some come off a contract and play good to see anything with the contract that affects us play\nI don't think so I think um I think this was sort of a fate accompli I think\nThe town's knew that this contract was coming on as long as he played well I think the organization new I think the fans knew as well so I think it's just a part for the course and I don't think Carly towns will change\nUm you know his mindset going forward he wants to be great he wants to be\nAn all around player in this league in one of the upper echelon players and you know his trajectory over as the first three years if you were put on a graph park is it had to get the right direction but it's a guideline straight up words um especially at the office of an where he's become one of the most dynamic players in the league right now\nUm there's still a ways to go on the defensive end of the or and to do some of the things I think he and ... if it's those two leading this team this year\nThey have to find some of the little things I'm do some of the little things to help you with basketball games because we saw this script a couple of years ago and yet they were both younger and there are different now but it only resulted in twenty six wins two years ago you know I mean you can put up all the numbers\nBut it only resulted in twenty six wins two years ago you know I mean you can put up all the numbers you want you can have all the highlight reel dunks but if you're giving up the same thing at the other end um it's all for not it cancels itself out so there has to be an attention to detail there has to be a willingness to do the little things to help you win games because um\nThat that's the next step for these guys if those two are going to be the focal point of this team um you know it it it's not good enough to win twenty five or thirty game especially in the west um the walls are really going to be challenge I think this year to find their way\nYou know and again it it we don't know what the final roster is going to look like I ... with Jimmy or without Jimmy ... is coming in\nA battle effect things greatly but those\nTwo guys have to find ways to translate their big numbers that they caught up into winning basketball\nAnd that was kinda bummed out when I when they are wild back when I heard Jimmy Buffett probably not going to be a part of the generals can I thought last year was a funnier I think he brought a little more excitement back because of you as you mentioned he added he added that make sure that they needed okay let's let's just say Jimmy he's gone or let's say he ... I think that's kind of way it looks right now\nWho's ... who's going to have to pick it up because they're not the same team without Jimmy\n[noise] no they're not and they need to um you you know you need to adapt to I mean I I think if you don't have Jimmy Butler and and again we don't know the pieces coming back so you would hope that you know they're going to get a wing player in return maybe even starting lean to replace Jimmy I'm In his spot\nUm so so that that person all obviously is going to be a big part of\nUm of how things go and you hope to get another rotation player out of the trade as well um\nThey ... you know you've got a redesign I think you're off a little bit to you've got to take advantage of Carl Lee Anthony town I mean\nYou look at players last year mark that shot a thousand shop over the course of the season and of those players there are about thirty nine of them who shot over a thousand shot slash they're currently at the house was number one ensure shooting percentage which is a metric that incorporates two points shooting three points shooting and getting to the free throw line\nI'm ... and and cat was ... you know the only player in late last year the average twenty points to rebound she's fifty percent forty percent from deep and eighty percent of the free throw line in fact the only one other player an MBA history has done that Larry Bird so you're talking\nAbout wow that's pretty good company [laughter] credible\nIt's incredible the numbers that this guy continues to put up every single season it seems like I'm writing down these notes that say oh it's the person in history to do this he joined Larry Bird is the only player to do this it's really incredible so I think you could afford to even give him more touchy was I think you could run more often for him\nI think cats are tremendous pastor and you know you really never been able to showcase that\nHe's average about to assist the game over his first three years\nUm you know there's no reason to think if you ran off and that was similar when Kevin Love was here and they ran the ball through him in the high post Kevin average four or five assists the game I think hacking go up there as well so I think um I think it's imperative that if Jimmy is not here um you've got to find a way to be more dynamic off actually take advantage of your of your best players\nNot so with that being said who won the team right now it's going to have to establish somebody's gotta who's got the potential you look at the liability showing the players who's got a step their game up to be able to to make this the more successful\nWell it's going to have to be everybody I think it's got to be by committee I just don't think ah you know Jimmy Butler currently after these towns arrange awakens can just all of a sudden\nI'm take Jimmy shots and everything's fine uh Jeff Teague has got to play solid at the point there's has to be um but I think the bench has been a quietly we made this year um is this rookie Joshua ... out of Georgia Tech is just relentless in his effort um I think it's going to be a struggle for him at the fence event but\nHe gets after it both offensively defensively and I think we can all appreciate the guy who just hustled out there on the floor all the time\nUm and Josh Cody is certainly shown that through summer league\nTo practice his ear and training camp and the first to pre season games I'm Anthony ... going to be a welcome addition ah no more hesitation from beyond the arc I thought that was a big\nUm you know kind of red flag with them and you'd be at least for the last couple of years who just was a little hesitant and an eight she is not he when he says he's going to get when he gets the ball and he's got an OPEN LOOK he's going to take and I think we saw that against Golden State\nWhen he shot you know five of ten of them beyond the arc a that was just you know refreshing to see because the wolves have struggled\nNews

noticed that\nThe Senate voted today to vote again on tomorrow to ask what it was okay I I was confused direction um it's the Senate's going to vote tomorrow so devoted and he was simply fifty one forty nine that voting borrow ... and we wonder why we're so slow to get things done author\nSo why do they do to a vote today just to set up for the vote tomorrow because you get more airtime during the last [laughter] seriously though why why you see drill yeah I'm sure the ... and ... in any other normal case I'm sure it's a pretty simple vote and then they can vote again right away\nBut they have to stretch this on their stretching because one they want that Republican now to Montana to come home the guy who left for his daughter's wedding oh yeah yeah they want him to come back and and you know help to get the book past and how do they have fifty one forty nine if he was gone\nI don't know if it doesn't seem possible does the only only have a hundred a hundred oh she cast his vote than hopped a plane\n[noise] can you do that I don't you know I think you have to be present to cast your vote but there's I thought you said there's a timeline for voting though I mean it's not like it happens in like thirty seconds I mean there's a timeline for there's a period of time during which you can vote I don't know how long it is but he voted then left ...\nSo if there is the vote was today though the vote was today and he's gone for his daughter's wedding was the way that maybe it's not till tomorrow or a voting tomorrow though well then I don't know how did that work grant to I don't know all I Know is the ... travel\nAll morning in the news I was ... been listening that the uh the the Republican from Montana is a way because it's his daughter's birth or his daughter's wedding but he's coming back tomorrow to vote so who voted in his place today if it's forty nine fifty one\n\n\nTwelve thirty Katie are athletes over falls in Ninety three point three of them came to

have to be one so when they say turn la's yeah I'm going to ah I only gonna you know run once maybe they should say I'm all in the run twice but I knew that the longer you can make a germ on it\nThe less expensive it gets because you you are all of a sudden you're senators aren't campaigning every other year or every you know for years you're\n... congressmen aren't campaigning every other year to get back in office they're actually working perhaps yeah but the other side of that asks what if you are elected a really bad senator and your gas ... that's that's why you have to have somewhere in there where the people can say wait a minute yeah and you're talking about recalls I say for senators\nAnd again why did the first of all the paper that we all follow you supposed to be blew it\nSupposed to be assigned and then dated and put away forever it's supposed to be a living and breathing document\nSo we had the opportunity to make changes where we feel it's necessary and as a country grows and expand and things change\nWe shouldn't do that you're ... yeah you're talking about actual changes are voted on not just interpretations of right yeah okay so if you were talking about six years for senator which I agree with mark I think that's why it's it's long and it also it feel like the ... short\nShort sighted they're resorting to or do you do that too for your a four year term with limited two or three or six year term but after three years you have a vote and you can vote him out if there if he doesn't get the majority I like that I like that idea and what I Want to step one more thing on top of this\nNo more campaigning for money everybody gets a certain amount of money and that's it I mean seriously that's what you get to Iran and that same butterfly gets dry because otherwise they spent a high percentage of their time trying to get money to create a war chest for the next time around [noise]\nYeah but how okay how can you possibly Institute that when you've got people that you know don't have anybody\nWhat do you mean well like you know there there might be some brilliant candidates out there that just don't have the money the funds to go against somebody else\nYeah but this would this would be set I mean but if you're living in is that you're going to limit it to five million dollars yeah whatever yeah and the other guy you know he can't possibly get that unless he's you know yeah you're going to hit me for saying this but this this amount would be something that comes from the government everybody has a lot of this much money\nThat's what you campaign with get to work so anybody out there that wants to run for office and\nThey I mean they'd have to be when we would have to be I'm I have a flush the yeah I guess they haven't thought that there are no good primary primary process where I Am not would limit you to have you ... ...\nYou'd have to spend your own money up to the primary I Know I see and that once you've got to that point I can see the and this is where I feel like a\n... there should be some type of cat when it comes to this because you will get billionaires who just can spend you know twenty five million

November for sexual misconduct the former Fox News host brought one time\nToday production assistant ... on her show discussing the relationship the new one he had with lower when she was twenty four when asked journey sit down with the U.S weekly if she thought\nHer former today co host could come back in the public eye after his fall from Grace Kelly forty seven that she would not comment and only added I Know too much that others don't know\nWhy would you say they're just constantly looking for tensions that arrogance\nBut those wondering if the outspoken mom of three had ever received internal pushback for doing the segment that might rock the boat too much she said\nShe replied with a no comment she previously had spoken out about harassment she endured wild employed by former box boss Roger ales then explain that she thinks some men who commit sexual misconduct could potentially have second chances in the public eye\n[noise] I don't think that's true [noise] pretty hard\nYou know you all day not now ... but\nShe's saying they potentially have a second chance yeah like a Denny's\nAnd work in a third shift order out huh\nThird shift is nice it's quiet she said it I feel the case by case basis I don't think we need to see Harvey Weinstein in in a polite society ever again but I don't think that's true of everyone I think for some of these guys\nThere's a way forward I happen to believe it starts with a full throated apology and not just this paper statement of I did some things wrong story the\nFormer host of the Kelly ... continued I think that women want to see uh what what women want to see actual learning and evolution the actual taking responsibility and a real reckoning with what they did and how it affected women's lives I think Americans are very forgiving and I'm very very forgiving\nLike these guys you want to completely screwed around and just reappear and reemerge and they're all the rules are kidding themselves women are feeling too in powder or to empower these days\nThey don't want to just cheap punishment they want to see that you get it and the ones that we've covered publicly and had immense positions of power so that absolutely should not be allowed to return to those okay so basically\nUm she's staying there are some people that might have the option of coming back and then there's a lot of them that don't but it just depends on what the ladies decide\n... yeah ... what am I getting out of this ... she's not saying America she's not seeing the country should not seeing the world women yeah she didn't have a defining this is because I think guys can be outraged by this to genetic code oh yeah absolutely\nWhy on her daughters and every now and yeah of course would it would be you know\nOh yeah absolutely you got wider daughters and every now and yeah of course would it would be you know I I but I Do agree I mean we're a culture I mean I'm not I'm not saying everybody's religious or anything like that but\nUh were built and redemption we we believe in redemption and if you if you made a mistake that was even a bad mistake I think you can be redeemed I think you can find your way through it there are some people out there who are just absolute predators and they're dangerous and if they didn't if they weren't preying on women they'd be praying on something else\nSo those are the kind of people I don't know what you do it\nThat way we get we get them all boiled in the same ... man you've got and we'll talk probably about Frank and here in a moment what we have there's a picture of Al Franken when he was a comedian before he was a politician\nAnd doing something funny in front of a camera that came back to bite him he ended up resigning you got Harvey ... bean or Stein who has a list and the wider they're lined up with\nStories about what ... ... Cosby yep built their ... their different people you know in Europe is far from east and west and the spectrum but they're all put under the same umbrella and all face the same public scrutiny\nSo as is Frank and read the mole oh I think he should never have been yeah out maybe you should never been out just you know certainly there but but they're all covered under the same umbrella\nSo I think it's fair to what she's saying here are some people are to you know if they're if they're going to convert all of the same umbrella some people are close to ... will never get out from underneath\nBut what she doesn't do it she comes out there and you know and of course she is a huge hashtag me too movement you know person she's behind a hundred percent and she has devoted many many many shows to this\nBut she comes into the story talking about how she knows way too much about mail our you know suspiciously to way too much about Matt Lauer like you know there's there's something going on that you know only she knows and then she talks about how um you know there are certain people out there that are reasonable that have the ability to come back from this\nBut why does she also mentioned\nThere is a good chance that has to take me too movement\nWent a little too far too fast to where there are some pretty decent innocent or um you know people that are accountable for certain things that had nothing to even close to do with how Bill Cosby or with winds dean\nAnd and they got lumped into it in a big old bag and everybody just threw them out with the dirty laundry jet and that was way too big she can't do that though she can't come out in a statement like that because then it sounds like she's going against the education around\nNo she ... she said there there are certain people that could be but what you should also does go a step further and say has been done there have there have been guys who have been lumped it basically she said oh yeah they won in ... they want an apology they want all this blah blah blah\n... women right but Al Franken did do that he did an apology you didn't the apology\nHe said I Am a apologize to anybody who is offended he and he explained he was a comedian and he took the ... us it was really bad taste you know and and but he didn't do anything physical he didn't rate than he but he didn't you know it wasn't if he's not a sexual predator by any means\nBut yet he bowed out real fast ...\nAl Franken was picture shows up on another point in history when if he has never US Senator nobody would have thought to each other comedian or ... who\nWas doing this you know like right now has anybody in the news and and correct me if I'm wrong but have you seen in the news anywhere where Andrew dice clay is being brought up on you know from all the different things that he said during his community if no ... no it hasn't but if he was running for governor tomorrow O L\nThat they will be all the news that only thing you would see in the news is remember Andrew dice clay now and what he's saying in a movie this weekend [laughter] he is election your stuff stars weren't [laughter]\nIt was really the ... is is that that are\nNot in that movie movie starring I mean he's one of the supporting actors owned by the way I heard nothing but great things about that but I can hardly wait my wife and I are we're going we're going to hit that one hard\nOr does she have to go can I go with me because I'm just saying you're gonna be ... by you and say heroes back into the left yeah we are in the back to the throat and the popcorn area no\nCondemns them frown on it when I sit in the back of the from the or the ... vaccine sixty one twelve thirty election your stuff to bring out one sided stories there are a that are indefensible unfortunately this is the way that both sides of the aisle react trying to get attention ugly human errors agree with that\n... portals sides of the aisle do and they bring it up from time to review in fact a veil set on it for five years\nOr longer can save and knowing that it's their line that they all have when I Need it you know and I wonder how much back room how many how many decent candidates for people who could help I never made it never made it because before they\n... they were throwing their hand in the ring somebody said hey I've got this on you and you did this Fifteen Twenty years ago and your family will be embarrassing how you'll be humiliated and you'll never get a vote now well OK then again I'm\nGoing to do it I mean like for instance Warren Buffett we don't know what his history watch but he's always the first guy to call when you're talking about financial stuff him right now what do we found out that in his past there was something that he did was you know not respectable but yet not violent or you know rape or sexually abused anybody\nBasically there were a senator or they were elected by the entire state of well you know the percentage of the state of Minnesota to that position and they just going to walk out because there is no real truth to it then yeah you're kind of given up on your own stamp too and I was just tired of being a senator was just a good time to\nGo or was there still something in there that we don't know about and we'll never no no no so but I Do and let's see tries to run again then it'll be right back up again if there's a deeper but what happened and where do you go\nTo heaven or nobody cares anymore because he's out of the political I sure am he's on many newscast but I Know of or anything like that or writing for anybody I haven't\nHeard anything I don't either I didn't hear the getting back to the original come into your I don't know why I often shake my head and all the president's comments made no sense from we're not a portable at all to campaign stop in Rochester\nIn fact the only reason he can see that as he was in Minnesota ... you know I don't I don't even know why Senate\nBecause as President Trump is\nYeah I had to use that as well because it's a Democrat now he's in a he's in a democratic state and he would like to win that state and the\nAmount to a prank and representative was going to he's going to try and rally the people who support him and he's kind of try and ... people who don't support them and that's a that's what he's trying to do but I agree I think when you when you own the high ground already sometimes you need to be a lot more statesman like Joel ... will be math and everybody always\nBrings us up if you if you support Trump you were just the same year that same type of person you're just disgusting you're miserable person and I understand that there are people that don't like ... or ...\nI didn't like Clinton you know I didn't either but as long as Clinton was doing a good job as a president I was okay with it because he did do some good stuff there was some stuff that was done that I I agree to it\nBut just just say everybody that supported Clinton was a sexual deviant that's wrong right so when it comes to this President Trump\nI'm constantly disappointed in what his tweed now what he's saying you constantly have to swallow hard going yes but the the the unemployment's down [laughter] you know through the other thing\nYou know at the same time though people voted Trump and because of who he\nIs he's not changing for people does not hold\nSome credibility the fact that you're not going to change his 'cause you're the president or audition and eating the same I I mean I was always been boisterous like this he's going to send them to be another example and and this might be a\nLittle bit of a an old example but if you're going to war you want ... he was a jerk\nPat and we have a measurable first of all my own miserable now but you wanted him in there\nYeah Eisenhower's a nice guy very cool guy right very diplomatic very statesman like good manager he was a really good yeah yeah he was viewed exactly he's a good general manager meanwhile on the field do you want back coach like Bill ... people don't really like the only checks just kind of arrogant and me\nBut he got the job done and so and pat was rolling those tanks across you knew that you know there was serious business\nThat's kind of what Trump is Trump's an arrogant jerk and nobody really likes him and he says stupid stuff and that's why pat and got fired I don't know maybe because of the things that he had ... you know he talked too much and finally they just said that get them out of here\nHe was a guy that you needed for the job and again it's the guy on the wall that you don't you know you ... the um the movie um oh you are with Jack Nicholson yes you want me on that wall you write need me on that\nWas really bad now and then that's the type of guy that he's the Jack\nNicholas of Nicholas Nicholson Nicholson he's the author of the\nPresident [laughter] he's [laughter] he's a Jack Nicholson over old affair\nHe see the sweaters he wears that right I Love those drinks have have but he's a guy that's Palmer [laughter] but he's the guy that\nNobody really cares about but if he's getting the job done why do we argue it over and over again and and nobody who agrees with them should be made to feel like oh I'm a disgusting person because I think the president's doing a good job\nI think well known a couple of years when the runs again that's when it isn't that what the whole election process was about to everything else is just flavor to err on yeah I mean just we're just during the during the pot and making a big stink\nBut until we vote again\nAnd then when they said that they said that this time when he before he got elected that he'll never get elected he's a joke is that the Democrats are just going to just you know they're going to win everything and when it didn't happen why wasn't that kind of a magnifying glass ... both parties must be just sending are scratching their head right who do we have\nWho can be president yeah\nYour right now everything's so polarized who can you bring to the front who's going to be a moderate one way or the other and maybe garner some items it nobody on the on the major political what are you right now we're whose stack stand you know somebody in the next two years\nIn is going to make a difference some that's going to bring them ... and you say that the next two years it starts right out on a selection yeah right after this election so they don't have somebody there that's starting to make speeches that's\nOn the campaign ... he didn't become somebody until right the last ... years a year and a half was really all there was a presidential speech the before on the two years after was a senator who do whether it was going to be him or Hillary right until the very end and then that's when he remain than they were like okay we got to take this guy for serious 'cause this is happening\nWell again come November when the elections over the next cycle starts now so if they don't have somebody there waiting in the wings already it's not going to get any better you see anybody\nKnow but there are certain there are celebrities are
