... chapter to\nWhere the apostle Paul says through the law I die to the law so that I might live to God I've been crucified Christ\nIs no longer I live with Christ who lives in me and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the son of God who love me and gave himself for me\n\nPaper haven't received a call and a promise from\nGod\nGod said to him go from your country from your kindred your father's house that I Will make you a great nation Sarah with other son stabbed mission everlasting covenant with you and with him and with his descendants after him this was very\nSpecial for Abraham\nEveryone though has a unique calling then includes\nBlessings and sacrifices Abraham made sacrifices you had to go from his country's kindred his father's house in San you had to leave all of that high\nBut there were great promises and blessings that came to him too and everyone has a calling that includes blessings and sacrifices and everyone must\nWalk his own past\nThe path that God has called him to walk what is right for someone else may not be what God chose for you what God chose for Abraham was right for Abraham\n\nBut it's not what he chose for me it's not the ... the life that he called me to live each one must live his own life and you can compare yourselves with others you can compare your sacrifices with their sacrifices or your blessings with their blessings\nBut [noise] I encourage you to do that\nI encourage you to think about the calling that came to you and to celebrate the blessings that God bestowed upon you and to bear the burdens to God calls upon you to bear and to thank God for the blessings and and and perhaps even thank him for the burdens because there's a reason\nWhy God has sent them serve God and the way he chose\nHomelessness was a part of Abrahams calling\nIn because he was homeless everywhere he went he was a stranger in ... and and alien there was an element of fear\nHe did not have the rights of a citizen in the countries in which he lived he did not have the protections of the law that were granted to citizens he was a stranger and an alien and there was an element of fear that manifest itself\nIn Abrahams life and behavior particularly\nWith regard to his wife we see in a couple of occasions that he was afraid for his own life because he had a beautiful wife and he thought first the Egyptians would kill him to get his wife away from him and then later on he was afraid of the people of ...\nThe wife away from him and then later on he was afraid of the people of gr are into them elect the king of gr are and in those instances he lied and said she's not my wife she's my sister\nFrom God dealt with him and dealt with the people of Egypt and a pharaoh and dealt with a ... and the king of gr are\nEmbroiled delivering statement but Abraham was aware of his vulnerabilities that's the point that I'm a traveling toward he was aware of his weakness he was aware of his dependence he needed God's help and care and no matter who we are\nWe need God's help and care our lives are in God's hands\n\nGod used Abrahams vulnerabilities as homelessness his status as an alien and a foreigner to teach him that lesson\nFrom God will teach us those of us who are his children and walk in his ways and believe in him as our redeem earn savior God will teach us to\nThat we need to be dependent on him and God will teach us to pray give us this day our daily bread I Hope you will I Hope we will learn the lessons certainly God will present it people present the lesson hopefully we will learn the lesson\nAnd learn to pray give us this day our daily bread recognizing that it isn't our money in the bank that guarantees are daily bread\nBut it is God who gives it to us day by day\nEven though Abraham ... lived in in a certain element of fear\nThat\nHe he possess wealth and power and they were among the blessings that he received\nAbraham had within his household three hundred and Eighteen men who were trained for war train for for battle that's pretty impressive for the household of a nomad\nThat's a pretty good sized household to include three hundred and Eighteen man this is something we read about in genesis chapter fourteen\n\nAnd he took his three hundred and Eighteen our men and went to rescue the kings of Saddam and Gomorrah when they were attacked and conquered by an uh an alliance of enemy kings and they were being carried away as prisoners of war\nAbraham was concerned I suppose primarily for his nephew law too was living in the city of Saddam and was being carried away with the other prisoners of war but\nWhatever his motivation he took his men and went and liberated the people of Saddam and the people have been more from the army that had captured them and that was taking them away as prisoners of war\nOn the kingdom Saddam was naturally grateful and wanted to reward Abraham but Abraham refused his gift because Abraham said uh I don't want you to be telling people I made Abraham rich I gave him great gift\nAbraham wanted God to get the credit for the fact that he was rich which he\nWas God gave Abraham wealth and power\nAnd he gave Abraham those gifts for his own pleasure and to use for the benefit of others with every gift comes responsibility no matter who you are you must do the right thing with the gifts that God has given you\nIs it inconsistent to say on the one hand that Abraham was dependent upon God and uh his life was entirely in God's hands and then to say on the other hand that he was a man of wealth and power\nNot at all men of wealth and power are always dependent on God\nWe see in Abrahams life that he learned patients and face the hard way he learned by waiting\n\nAnd as he waited waiting is hard it was hard for him just like it's hard for us he did things he shouldn't have done\nHis wife Sarah was also waiting for the sun to be born the guarded promised or for any child to be born into her home and she said ... go into my mate\nShe offered her servant Hagar\nHurt Egyptian servant girl to Abraham said we will will have children this way and Abraham yielded to them when he was eighty six years old hegar bore Ishmael\nTo him and Abraham loved him and he prayed to God oh that Ishmael my living you're safe but God said no that's not the way of it later on Sarah\nAh when I was born she saw that there was competition between Ishmael and her son Isaac and she didn't want that she said ... get rid of this slave woman and her son and had displeased Abraham 'cause he loved the son\n\nOf God so did her hand this is the way it must be you must do this thing but gun had compassion on on Abraham and on the sun that Abraham love and God was with the lab we read in genesis Twenty one and he grew and grew out in the wilderness and became an archer\nAnd he'd go out in the land of pay around his mother took him away from the land of Egypt and so on God looked out first male\nAnd took care of him because rides a love for Abraham then eventually\nA brand was Ninety nine years old guard came and said now's the time in the spring cerebral Verizon so on and it was hard for him to believe that but the lord visited Sara Sara conceived and when ... was a hundred years old\nI Isaac was born what a miracle that was\nAnd when Abraham saw the power of God demonstrated in that miracle Abraham knew\nThat going to do anything and he learned patients by waiting and he learned to trust by seeing God do what couldn't be done a brown said there is no way that a hundred year old man and a nine year old woman can have a son that just can't happen\nBut it did\nAnd when Abraham saw that then he knew and believe that God could do anything and that God always fulfilled his promise even when it can't be done and Abrahams faith became an example\nMath we'll ever recall\nThat I'll watch the\nNow now I'm\nDa\nDa\nDa da\nLa la\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\nGet away with anything\n\nRain [laughter]\nWere ... ... ...

Democratic leader how do you do that\nSo uh what's your thinking and I were standing Nunberg well on Monday or Tuesday coming up next to David re\nThere's been a lot of reporting and now CNN stop reporting it because it's good for Trump about tens of thousands coming here from\nUh El Salvador Nicaragua and a hunt doors and the health concerns think about the health concerns when thousands of human beings are not inoculated numerous dozens of different diseases there not\nBeen checked and they're living in squalid conditions for weeks walking through heating jungles and what's the medical risk might be ...\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats all of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so bad and according to CBS News about eighty percent\nOf the so called the migrants are young males between the ages of Fifteen and thirty it's impressive oh for a woman with a baby to walk two thousand miles\nThrough jungles in the heat and sand in desert that ain't gonna happen somebody's organizing on this much like the boat live from Juba there are lumped as politicians who hate Trump and want to destroy America and they want to flood the southern border right now there is Fifteen and twenty thousand why not Fifteen or twenty million\nWell you know there are forty one million people in Central American I bet a good deal of them have their eyes on what's happening here and how we handle it the problem is that we have gaping loopholes in our asylum laws and if anyone in this caravan no matter what even if they said on national television ten times\nThat they're coming here for a job as you've heard people say all I wanted a job in Los Angeles when they put one toe in the United states they say the words political asylum\nAnd they are in like Flynn they are here they're going to be released into the country and they're going to be on a backlog of probably as long as three to four years\nNever showing up for their cases eighty percent of these folks who exploited the asylum loopholes never show up for their cases and simply disappear into the United states this is a gimmick they're using our own policies twice this year the Republican Congress has tried to close these loopholes\nAnd they have not had a single democratic vote\nTo uh to do so and you asked to ask yourself why who really benefits in the long run for Massey illegal immigration\nWhen you look at studies of immigrants as they become citizens and how they vote sixty five percent of them end up registering as democratic\nColors I forgot to government assistance but\nYeah I mean you're barely making it you're going to vote for the party that hand you the most goodies\nAnd ah you know twenty five percent a vote Republican but if you think about you know twelve million illegal aliens a sixty five percent of them would end up becoming citizens and voting Democrat that would that would that have thrown every American election to the Democrats in the last Twenty years and every one for probably the next forty\n... and the other issue you read and democratic literature is that if and when Texas flipped to the Democratic party and becomes a deep blue state\nThe way the politics will be fashion for the next twenty to fifty years there'll be no chance for a Republican ever to win the presidency again in Texas is a blue state and you might throw in Florida because California for most of its history was a deep red thing Ronald Reagan heritage easily Nixon Gehring raised like\nCalifornia flip it goes with illegal migration\nTerrorized as the next target Texas flips and it's over but David Wray affair here here's a question Trump is talking in the way I Would like him to talk he's normal he reflects Midwestern values conservative values\nHe's saying the army or the national guard will not let them cross in America\nHow do you physically stop maybe twenty or thirty thousand people in mass from getting one toe into American soil then blaming political refugee status how physically we're not going to shoot them there's well ... how do you actually stop 'em\nThat's the million dollar question without going into Mexico because I'm really ...\n... that that is the question and I don't know that anybody has the answer to that I'll tell you how you would stop them if it existed Trump's border wall if you had a border wall there they wouldn't be walking in the United states except through legal ports of entry or they would have to walk way out into the desert in Arizona or to come over\nThat's why we need the border wall and some of these heavy crossing points but that's all it takes\nIs one ... in the United states and we're done and you and you're done and orange on the long list vote yeah and all we need to do is\nAnd so fair has called called we believe this is the beginning of a national emergency just like the Mariel boatlift was we've asked that Congress the president calls Congress back to Washington\nThis week to close these asylum loopholes if we could close these asylum loopholes or if we could put asylum courts with detention centers right on the border so as they came over\nSet ask for political asylum they had their hearing and they were immediately sent home because Ninety nine percent of these folks would not qualify ... for political asylum their economic migrants than we would have an end of this nonsense we can't get those loopholes closed now Congress failed twice\nThey're going to we think they should come back and close these loopholes anything short of that\nAnd and it's kind of a a you know a cat and mouse game we have to try to keep them from getting in the United\nThe ears are probably very for takes ten Democrats United States Senate to move legislation\nRight now there's fifty one there might be fifty four fifty five after the election whatever the number is unique numerous Democrats\nTo switch party line vote with the Republicans in order to say that much like Mexicans of Mexicans come here and they get one foot and the taxes they're thrown back immediately into Mexico and you're done we ever a loophole in the law that says you're from\nYou made it late in Mexico and you're done we ever a loophole in the law that says your ... from Central America Asia Africa and you're making do America no matter how you get her legally or illegally and you claim refugee status for political purposes that then you begin in the hearing process that takes three to ten years\nSo unless the Democrats agree to do this\nNo changing the law will happen I mean Trump God Bless him I Love him or he can tough tough only once\nBut you cannot stop twenty thousand people or twenty million people from flooding our southern border from Central America claiming refugee status they have no shots they have no medical Clarence them no financial support\nThey have no work skills that we need most less than a third grade education and there's nothing we can do to stop them unless the Democratic party agrees and what makes you think they're ever going to agree\nWell I mean at some point maybe they're going to put the national interest of their own political interests is that my pipe dream yeah\nNo it won't happen that that's why I feel bad I feel terrible yeah\n[noise] yeah I mean the president really is extremely limited in what he can do in his best bet is to try to get the Mexican stopped them in Mexico\nBecause once they get to the U.S border they're going to walk you know five miles outside of the port of entry and they're going to step right over a fence and they're going to be in the United states hoping that they get apprehended in fact if they see the border patrol they'll run towards them\nTo ask for political asylum and then it's all over and until we get these detention facilities on the border with these asylum courts as we did in the late Nineteen nineties when Central Americans were pulling this\nA stick with us till we get that back in turn these cases around and get these asylum loopholes or a close we are going to be stuck with this mess\nWell I I I don't know I'm filled with hope all the time but I\nYeah I Love Mexico says to the Trump bring the United States Army one or two or three miles into Mexico and politically that would be the death knell of the Mexican president if he allowed American Soldiers on the Mexican territory that ain't gonna happen and you know I think there's not going to happen\nIs the Mexican president was elected\nAnd I just recently under an open borders policy and what she wants free flow of information I don't know what we can do other than bitch complain and moan at the end of the day the Democrats aren't going to agree to this and so unless they get hammered at the at the ballot box and Nancy plus it goes down hard a week from Tuesday and\nDemocrats get hurt in the Senate ... ... ... we don't need we need about ten Democrats the United states senators\nTo get the same treatment as Central Americans that we get the Mexicans ... which means that view here illegally immediately or send back they'll have to go through a hearing process the liberal activists attorneys are there\nAre the news media is their Kamala Harris and all

today's show Jeremy wonder how much what the department of natural resources the CEO is going to be joining us and we'll talk\nOr any new laws out there and um what is a trespassing what is in a taco and take your questions certainly sixty one twelve thirty all of that is coming up on the show today a and of course or something we've added sense you know last year ... one of our more popular shows\nSo they have to all be using I'm the same implement in order to cross paper tape for somebody else\nAren't a six day one to all dirty and you have a question sixty one twelve thirty call in if you want it back to your question and you can do that to six day one one two three here on texting okay dean our question is as Ken anything be done to limit or detour road hunting in my area\nAnd it doesn't say where his area as well let's just talk about it in general and rode hunting\nOkay a road hunting is for the lazy hunters um they don't want to get cold they don't want to sit out in you know the stand and wait for the year to come or maybe they don't know anything about scouting and and your trails and work at it you know intercept the animals and things like that I'm usually when you wrote hunting you're doing a couple of violations one shooting from the roadway at a big game animal into ...\nUm it's not very safe because you're shooting and probably towards the woods where there could be folks inside that you don't know what's beyond your target\nUm as far as eliminating it or make sure that you have you're landlocked we posted that helped me out of time 'cause that's another violation and get to the folks\nThe land isn't legally posted um we don't get to prosecute and I remember a cultural land does not need to be posted and nice to have permission in order to go on to or shoot on people so if you have your agricultural land um\nThey can't legally shoot on to that or go on to your property without your permission other than to retrieve even on a lawfully shot at him [noise] so if you do have issues in your area and you have an awful lot of road hunting get a hold of myself get a hold of Ben human or get a hold somebody else and let us know the area at times that are the most frequent\nWhat types of vehicles you're seeing you know the same way pick up comes by six eight time\nI'll let us know or we can use utilize some of our other tools um maybe we can utilize the decor and maybe we can utilize I'm just sitting in one area and waiting for life you were to come out\nUm so there are some things we can use to deter it unfortunately a folk stress like myself are few and far between for a pretty big area right now and we will after this year season beginning one more person to the area to help us out a little bit but if you do have problems with that persistent wrote hunting\nOne make sure he lands lawfully posted and find well so they can see that in to\nUh get a hold on myself or another contribution after we can see what we can do as far as I'm trying to eliminate that issue for you\nKnow and sometimes they're not ruin hunting sometimes they're just doing lunch\nSometimes oh for sure because I Know that's one of our rituals ... after we've done in the morning on a bus mid day I'm hungry enough us so we are up in the vehicle we drive around just looking at a hunters the area and and eat our lunch so not always ruined hunting when you're driving around\nSure and and that's true and I'm renting has actually I I Would like to think of as myself but his corrupted a little bit but I don't know if that's actually the issue um I think it's more along the lines of how people are hunting is well we used to have the big parties that would go out and do a lot of dear Dr pushing to Europe running left and right here and there\nOh yeah that's true yeah and what made it way more um easy for the the road hunters have the deer kicked out running around in a shootout that a lot more folks are sitting in the stands\nHunters have the deer kicked out running around and jump off shoot out that a lot more folks are sitting in the stands utilizing food lots things like that so we have we left you are running out willy nilly for one would to the other but it's a lemonade a little bit of a road hunting but not all of it and like you said there are certain folks just drive around and that's what they do for their lunch or their mid day just to see a you know who else is out maybe your next book\nUh companies pick up and talk a little bit but if I'm assuming this guy is complaining about folks that are coming you know that last half hour of shooting time yeah the same vehicle going up and down three or four or five times along certain roadways and stuff\nSure All right so it has\nGone down quite a bit my trespassing she wrote complaints have went down um [noise] dramatically since I first started here\nWell that's good that is a good thing must be on the ... it's an open mind\nYeah so that's got to be at people or [laughter] you know there's a learning is alright\nWe had another caller on the line from Galen on the line now you're on the line with Jeremy when a rummage go ahead\nI'm Sorry uh yeah I kept a you know a mine is a bad guy or a\n... a ...\nShirt on the\nUm do you have the permit them Galen have you uh down through the application process I'm gotten the permit to shoot first any motor vehicle right\nThat you have that you already have gotten that taking care yeah\nOkay so you have that then so basically you cannot transport and loaded firearm loaded firearms are not allowed to be transported even if you have that handicap a permit you got to unload your fire and before you transport it and you must be out of the road right of way\nBut you can't be sitting on the road and shooting out of the vehicle the vehicle must be out of the road right away in order to lots of issue that big it other than that it's basically if you've already got that handicapped permit for the perfect issue for standing motor vehicle\nUm that should be your only basic limitation while the other things it's nice for you and it doesn't benefit you this much or is that much this year is it when you have that permit to shoot from standing motor vehicle you don't have to apply for a do prevent\nThat permit to shoot from standing motor vehicle allows you to shoot either an analyst or an outward dear I'm no matter what does ignition the uh [noise] uh\nUh that uh if if the weather's lottery or not whether or not you know do come at\nHome I guess I didn't know that yet so I have that truth from standing motor vehicle permit now up here we don't have any lottery I've got a hunters choice whereas it use it or that the one year\nAnd then manages a tutor limit and intensive is a preview or limit so up here we don't have to worry about lottery but if there is years in the future um you can harvest an outlet us here without a permit as long as you're the one that harbors that you can't party hunt with somebody else and we can choose to do that and put your take on it but you could do it yourself as long as\nYou have to shoot from motor vehicle from\nYeah thank you very much I guess I rarely joke girl but uh yeah I guess are are under ...\nAnd the only other thing I ever see usually as an issue with the folks with that permit is that the transport their gun laws they forget to unload them before they drive way more there were sitting there and I got you got unloaded and out of that road right away and you're\nGoing to go do do they have but Jeremy do they have like a you know like a handicap still going to hang on their mirror then to so you you were to get a little\nA little blue ... they should have just looks like one of our licenses that they carry with them as well in addition to their license it's a little blue tang that they should have that\nAnd they all they don't have to replace it as a black or anywhere anywhere on it just when I Would come to see him um if I watch them from the vehicle to your produce that may be good to go\nPick up okay All right well thanks for the call appreciate it a\nSix day one twelve thirty were visiting Jeremy went around much with the ah department of natural resources on we're going to get a news headline here and just a few minutes but we have another call insults go back to the phones Wayne is on a year with Jeremy went around between go ahead\n[noise] hey Derek I'm first you're talking about a ... ... what about your ... and then Trump ordering afterward um you know like ... for the person still need to be retired here even after a season or schools or\nExcellent question though if you do have that here already registered then you can put on a piece of paper could be anything from a map into a tablet paper or whatever\nUm that that uh this person that is ... here for you have your permission because right on there that a mark Allen is going for transport my ear for me from and to something like that but once it registered the license he does not need to a company and uh they just have to have some piece of paper showing who for three transporting it where they are going\nAnd then find by the ... on dirt during season also then or\nYeah as long as it's registered for though it has to if you have to register for and then at the license the is not where they have to have that piece of paper showing with life in the ... given that perfect permission to transport it from\nThis place to that place oh primary harm to the locker plan or something like that here also nope just has to be with him because actually okay\nAnd then second question um I Know it's somebody's got a food bought the gruesome corn and this year and I got rather tall and they were talking about ... shooting lands what that would go down as Beijing then doesn't it\nCorrect unfortunately um but we have in our baiting a lot of that you cannot be out or any of the things that have been grown but if you go there with your brush hog and your crop and on all your corner scattering all that corn all around I understand the Koran got kind of high and they should remember for next year the cheap laughs the open road or something like that you can see in there\nUm what other option would be is if you remove all the cops from a couple of ... I don't know how big a food but we are talking\nWith you remove all the cob and got them out of there then you could cut down on the um the\nStocks and remove it 'cause then you're not scattering the bait\nBut I mean depending on the size of their corn or their food but if it's too big and it's just not going to be feasible but as long as you're not are gathering or exposing or anything like that so people sometimes want to fill up their sugar beet or brush ride on you can't do either of those options says or in the book right under our baiting lot pocketbook scattering exposing things like that\nOr for ... great\nThank you I think when I go to Jim\nYep sixty one twelve thirty is our number if you want to call in or text us on our a Pizza Hut text line six eight one one two three zero sixty one twelve thirty is the phone number to call I Jeremy hang on the lines of just a minute we're going to get a news update and we'll come back with more questions for Jeremy winner homage\nAh again conservation officer joining us to answer any questions about the Iran coming up\nThis weekend the season get started but first or before you back to Jeremy let's get a news headline up data and there's\nSome news Bernstein good morning\nAmerica and landing on his face Stearns county authorities are searching for a missing team couple in their infant son anyone was information on Seventeen year old Morgan steak Nineteen year old James spans and they are six month old son Bobby is ask all the weight park police departments\nAlso deer stands are going up all across Minnesota which means deer stand deaths are not far behind the loose police department asked to help the public in identifying to people caught stealing donate trailed him near observation road\nAnd the portion of highway two in Polk County will be closed this week for bears to the railroad crossing crews will be replacing concrete between Fifth Avenue northeast and county road Seventeen and these Grand Forks little details on those stories more coming up at noon for twelve thirty ... radio news someday burns\nAs long as they don't have an open license and the president for president so or I seen it violated sometimes as folks will build their leg and then they want to go back out hunting for the buy one for a wife or grandma or daughter or son or somebody else and then they're not out and president actively hunting\nThat's not a lawful party huh so in order to lawfully party you can do just like you said though once you harvest that you're here you can go and still helped down by pushing would want it as long as you're you know a field with the person with a a ... day and treat the deer and as long as they're there to take it you're going to go okay well thank\nYou well you answered my question I think David appreciate it so I yeah six one\nTwelve thirty Jeremy wonder how much is our guest with the department of natural resources you have a question give us call we have GPS on the line gp you're on a Jeremy go ahead\nMorning Jeremy thanks very much more to get pretty good job I'm just a couple of questions to clarify the previous two questions that were asked I'm just like bears he's in a leap stands on WMA land do doctors now for deer she still need to have their being our number on the on the stand\nAnd my second question is\nUm if you are with they tend to Fifteen year old I'm a competing them as if your license punter can you still bring your fire in\nExcellent questions and I'm Glad you brought that up because it is a good point I'm just like for bear hunting if you do leave your stand in the WMA it must be identified so you got to have either you or do you and our number or your name and address on it just like you would for bear on the very good point there the other part is if you have a valid license um\nAnd and and like I guess I should clarify is this during the season or during the regular part I'm\nGonna hang up and hug him I must hung up I guess okay so um\nDuring the regular farm season the metric hunt or excuse me during the youth season the metro country cannot carry a firearm and cannot on during the regular firearms season if you have a ten or eleven year old with you use and you have a valid license you still can have your fire I'm with you and you still going on\nThey just have to still be within arm's reach a view so there is no limitations during the\nRegular firearms season to bring youth with so you can still be able to hunt moms are dads can still hunt with juveniles we're um we're in the UCs when they could not their license wasn't ballot yet\nSo but yes you can if you have about license or you can carry a firearm and still hunt even if you have a juvenile with ya\nOkay and I think a gp is back on the line with us again ... story\nI got disconnected but that answers both but in\nA very good either I married three sheets\nTo appreciate your clarifying that from ... to put that in there but yet they stand damages left really the only they have to be left with your identification on a very good\nYes yes and thanks for the call I'm sixty one twelve thirty call or text and we do have a couple of text or questions coming in and let's get to that well one of the comments says just seen as small bug chasing a dull [laughter]\nSomebody out there and here's the wind and says can a person Honda waterfall on a field that was never harvested\nYes as long as it's not manipulated now that's a federal regulation of bigger federal regulations will talk about natural farming practices and manipulation like if the field wasn't harvest it and then they burned it off\nIt's not a normal farming practice and that would be considered a bated by federal law but if you're saying the cornfield that wasn't harvest it or soy beans or something else that um the birds are utilizing if it wasn't harvest it it's okay they can feel really haunted as long as the field has not been manipulated and they use that word in federal law\nSo it can be um [noise] you know burned out with the main thing is that it's too wet to harvest and they burn it\nUm that's not a normal farming practice in there would leave all the green out there that would be considered made it but if it's just stay standing field that hasn't been harvested that can be hard to\nSay what about a field that has been harvested that is that okay to\nThat legal don't that's legal to that small farming practice but they you harvest arbiter field\nRight okay legal to already six he went to all thirty a got a question says is it\nIs it legal for a game warden to walk into your house and check your freezer without a warrant\nNo absolutely not okay\nSo we don't violate both constitutional rights that's where the constitutional rights that when the other part about going onto somebody's property is like an open field doctrine um you really don't have that expectation of privacy to be out in the field where someone with an airplane or something like that would be able to see you anyway\nBut we don't go into people's houses we don't you don't get indoors without warrants and go looking freezers and things like that so same constitutional rights you had from any other police officer\nOr a another question says how many inches to the horn have to be see how many inches or the horn have to beat a claim it as a book um are here even if they're just\nA little [noise] [noise] ... ... it's still called the buck\nOkay so definition of a buck state statute says one time of at least three inches at one time at least three at least\nThree inches despite fucking one was broken off or to look through one if it's three inches in link or more has has to be considered an outlet deer\nIf it's less than three inches unlike it's considered and little is\nAll right um what are the shooting times this weekend due to the time changes on Saturday and Sunday\n\nBut the shooting hours never changes that was half hour before sunrise to ... hour after sunset or get on your smartphone and they'll tell you what times they are um I can look in the book and you tell you what we have\nYou know I was going to say it's it's random in the book there words are listed on on time so\nYeah so if you go back to pay if they want to look and page one twenty nine and one thirty\nThey'll have all the sunrise and sunset tables in there to make sure that you\nAnd since then able to go in there to make sure that you add your or you know put half hour before sunrise but then remember the world is round so the sun doesn't rise of\nExactly the same all over Minnesota right um it has that\nOn page one thirty and has that little diagram up on the top of the page that shows how many minutes you need to add to the heart and make it the right ah sunrise and sunset\nI very good uh and again it's half hour before sunrise to half hour after sunset\nCorrect hearing it for big game and a lot of folks don't realize that it's half hour before sunrise to sunset or small game let's say wrote hunting a grouse or migratory birds like waterfall ... you have to stop at sunset a lot of people still think they get that extra half hour like\nHer big game it's not the case so it's half hour before sunrise Tucson set for small ... and then here\nUm or big game is half hour before to half hour after\nOkay I'm Lucy or just a question can I can I hunter fish in South Dakota or North Dakota and I have a South Dakota and Minnesota limit in freezer\n[noise] as long as you do not have as long as it didn't come from the same body of water so like our border water let's say the red river in or if you have to go to fishing licence and Minnesota fishing licence\nOr you can have three Minnesota fish from the red river and three North Dakota fish from the red river\nSame as the would if you have your Canadian license and fish up there you can have your Manitoba limit at a buffalo bait Andrew Minnesota limit because it came from the same body of water if you have a mental a license and you are somewhere else other than like the word you could have that limit\nAnd your limit from uh Minnesota um or if you went to devils lake you can have in North Dakota limit and you're in Minnesota limit or in your freezer or but you cannot have\nA both limit if it's from the same body of water and that usually comes from our border waters of course Red River like the words you know the Mississippi down in the southeast things like that\nOr a next question during use can you have your side arm if you have a concealed carry\nA concealed carry you can have that with you a pretty much anything in our gimme fish rules except for shining activity\nSo while you're both hunting and you really are you're not supposed to have a fire I'm with you while you go on for dear if you have your concealed carry permit you can have your fire I'm with you that\nWe have a concealed carry permit you can have it with you while you're mentoring the youth um so you can have they're the only time that that concealed carry permit doesn't supersedes some game and fish laws as during shining activity so if you're out recreationally shining you know within two hours of sunset without the spot are located game with artificial light\nYou cannot have any firearm with you in the vehicle and that\nAlso includes your concealed carry permits to remember that if you folks have your concealed carry if you're going to go out and do some recreational shining and have you done with you while you're doing recreational trying\nTime Jeremy when Robert is with us or we're running out of time quicker but I still have more questions here are sixty one twelve thirty it's uh I'll open my here's one does the DNR steel feed the deer in the winter\nNo uh that's usually one of those things they really frowned upon um\nIt's it gets expensive uh and that's mainly ... more of a wildlife issue a rather than force meant but um it has to give you an extremely severe winter and I guess maybe up in the uh\nUm boundary waters area they maybe had put some feet out for him as a rule of thumb are you in our will not feed the deer during winter unless it's an extreme hardship and it would have decimated population I guess but that would be more of a ... a biological biological question to ask her while as manager instead of myself\nId and our question my neighbor put out a pile of sugar beets within eyesight of my dearest stand can I still use that stand\nAs long as you OK so two things have to take place that has to be on the other person property not on your property and as long as you did not a big part of or into the ... say hey buddy go put the beast on your side of the line next to me and I'll go put some meat semi sided\nLines you over [laughter] and I and I won't be looking at them you won't be looking at some basically\nWhat this locking them into a play was is there was a guy that on some land in his neighbors that are surrounded him didn't like him and didn't want to be able to hunt there so they would go put corn and sugar beets all around his property on their land\nClaim it as a beta area and the guy couldn't legally hunters on property wow it's not on your land and you're not akin to what you did not participate in it you're not say hey go do that for my benefit ah it's still a legal in lawful for you to hunter\nI absolutely right it is

join us for for the mouth watering Frank tonight at the river walk public out with the river falls radio\n[noise]\nOr he hit a brand Peterson numbers freaking on the right side and uh he throws a sixty three a a yard touchdown pass to Peterson to make it eight to six they would add on to point conversion and that would make it eight eight and that's you know that's the way we ended the for his staff but\nAfter these teams playing to the first half you can tell you know you could tell even from a with all the rain and everything that had fell that uh it was going to be a one of those games where ah\nIf you don't get to break or you don't jump on a a formal or something like that or the season for I'm going to be over\n[laughter] now did they did it rainy entire game and you had it so it was constantly raining so keeping the ball dry was it was horrible right I Am sure they had the ... out there and they're trying to keep it dry but but if it's constantly raining the grounds already soaking wet is pretty tough to keep\nThem seven I say is that the officials that a referee the game or one of them I Know him throughout his whole uniform after getting [laughter] yeah I mean you\nYou just said no but uh you know they are towels out there that are continuing it made a big difference I mean there's standing water\nIn how many how many how many ... if you\nCount the fund those from the center snap yeah never Seventy\nOkay how many turnovers were there and there were eight eight and a journalist so\nAnd that would be a big part of the game late in the game okay well let's get there then I go to the second half and uh of course the scores eight eight and kill your ... and they will put him in nice dry and together and they lose all are in bend Jordan Jordan again or would score from ... this time and\nOn that Dr he had Seventy three yards rushing he had every carry for a ... a failure north Holleman that a third quarter on that one drive\nYou finish it off with free yard run they would be a to point conversion once again it would make it sixty eight and a van as we got on the way into the fourth quarter and we'd get about seven minutes left\nTill you're north alone would pick up the kitchen county central formal they have the ball at the kitchen county's central I Believe twenty three yard line they were able to get all the way down inside the five and when they do they form old\nActually no I'm Sorry on that I cried I correct big cuts in county central held them on down a was a formal the possession before that but they held on downs\nI did say you know with six minutes to go into football game and they've got Ninety six yards to go\nI said boy gets in Comedy Central's not put a drive together tonight uh that would would be able to cover that Ninety six yards so what do they do first play from scrimmage\nAgain a they're running back a trend parents for years and now the signing ago Ninety six yards Ninety six yards is is a reverse play\nThe way you can join the backfield so\nHe got to the outside and you know everybody can get sucked in because most of the planes are in the middle of the thing yeah you know everybody's going to be any went around the right side and went down to the sidelines and uh\nThey had a couple of minutes tackles around midfield but after that he was own free awesome though it was awesome it was great the uh\nBring us up though it was awesome it was great the fans from ... north ... couldn't believe it or you know open the box there they they couldn't believe that that happened because they said oh sure so\nNinety six yard touchdown now okay so he scores but they still need the\nThey still need the a to point conversion gay and it would be the quarterback Josh running that would likely boy\nI tell you something to hundreds and he's six foot three two hundred and twenty five pounds again and I tell you that he had so little um more center snapped that he just went right and barrel right through the line now and you know the actually that was some of their biggest gains of the other night as\nHe finished off with the a to point through version there this time actually it rolls out to the right it wasn't going right through holiday so against you blanket version or Thai or type ... how much time on the clock uh when they scored\nThere was a ... for Seventeen\nLeft I Believe in regulation okay and that's the way in the regulation edit and that's the way I'm ready to go to overtime\nWe'd go to ... and when you get to overtime each team gets a possession and you're starting from the ... yard line\nOkay so gets in county central was lucky enough they won the toss and uh they got the ball first draft Peterson goes nine yards gets down to the one yard line on the first downplay ... and it took them a\nCouple of more downs but then again uh they were able to push it in again it was a Josh running though would push right through the metal gun in the end zone they missed the a to point conversion\nAnd a as a result they would take a twenty to sixty and lead\nInto jelly or north loans possession and killing or ... or they would come back and then we go to Bren Jordan a and bend Jordan and uh uh two plays he was getting now to the three are lying\nOn the third downplay they were able to get it to the one in Jordan looked like he was going to get to the end zone but a great defensive play in the far side but get some counties central mhm and they stop and at the one yard line so here we go\nIt's pointing to sixteen [laughter] for over our goal is the one he has to get even now they have to get in so what do they do they call a timeout a shower I alright ... about it they're going to end\nTo the time with some other time outs and uh their quarterback a billings or can't a was a gene Waldo is their quarterback and\nUh they decided to pitch it out and they're going to pitch it to the near side uh Jordan fumbled it yeah and he had by the time he got on the football or gets in Comedy Central is their tackled him back at the five yard line and our game\nWas over and over came over and over time it was a it was a it was a really entertaining football game and they take away the rain and everything and got brought a little bit more excited\nKelly was one of those teams are unknown because a way like we've we've talked to a number ties is one of the teams in section eight we don't get a chance ...\nYeah they they only play one section game all year he had some very difficult read on them or their schedule and they're curious had them in the two spots but there are a whole lot of questions about whether they belong there but if they took three team get to the federal the overtime they belonged to spy on them yeah I'm\nThe weather obviously was a made they made it interesting I guarantee one thing whether it will not be a factor on Thursday will not me [laughter] well not not the fertile\nLand you in that in mind doing the game it was it was a fun game is a very uh uh entertaining driving cars back when I was a kid we used to go fishing and wash Gish and we used to take\nThat road all Africa and they turned around and charisma or on the road and stuff when it's or note\nAnd you're driving but uh uh getting to the game once again I got to put a take my hand or to get some counties central\nWhen defense a colony or\nThey were there and they die and they deserve to go to the uh championships\nOr I Will say for Kelly or north all they've got a great running back coming back in and bend Jordan a carry the ball forty seven times for for\nA killer north all for how many hours I think he had a hundred and thirty seven yards I work we use the workhorse from yes and ah you know and it's too bad one team had to lose you know\nWell as I say it was okay because they are in that we've all back in the end it was alright ... I think ultimately we know we're going to the quarterfinals that that's true and ...\nAll right drew get basically appreciate it we let All right that's the other game that took place over the weekend so that does set up this week the a section titled game which is as we mentioned twelve thirty on Thursday\nSteven are galley kitchens central and again we'll be at the Fargo dome if at twelve thirty the first day game of the day's want coverage on the ...

L. V. network you can follow him on Twitter at ... at Chris Rose Chris welcome to the eye of the\nGood guy\nWe're great man we're great we look we both picked the Dodgers so we're not we we felt or were yeah we found on paper the red Sox best\nTo no doubt about it what did you know but you know where's the best team doesn't always ... ball\nRight we thought you know they might were AB their team of destiny in and they'll pull it out but and and we readily admit the Dodgers are armed sorry the red Sox are better but we were just talking about it I feel like the Dodgers\nAre hurt them like took themselves out of a chance to make it a series\nWith some of the moves they did based on the analytics you know taking rich still out I was taking Walker buell or out the game before\nYou know and and obviously that became an Eighteen any games like if we don't have to go into the batting lined up you know taking out their home run hitter like are we just dinosaurs and wrong or\nDo you think this is a situation where a lot of people might look at them versus the red Sox and how they use analytics and there could be a little bit of a sea change in major league baseball\n[noise] All right well let's let's be our first and foremost which is all thirty teams use adult let it\nRight and we're not saying don't use them into a different\nVarying degrees and you know I think some of the Roberts decisions were organizational meaning that way to go out and play it at the all if them scenario if the ACA that will be there\nAre also believe that some of it was cut and and the rest of the those are I think the rich heal thing was watch word got than analytics\nYou can say it was the wrong move and it actually it was\nBut I think that that was a managerial move and I do believe it state by ... am or tied much like a lot of bad actors are because they're getting the light of added by getting the if then scenario orange down there without\nAnd we're losing the touch and feel and the ability to look into a guy's eyes are I think that Alex ... actually made a bunch of brilliant moves\nAnd people will say well those were old school and if you're a little move\nMaybe but man I loved it that he brought in of all the dates wanted to write it with ... slammed the door shut\nA you know against the ... that he did it with David Price I mean the the price pitch starting games to buy came out of the opening game three of warmed up in game or\nI don't know how many teams are taking that chance right but he did it and it worked and it was a thing of beauty for Red Sox and read ...\n... what about the Clinton ... who are of course has an option to opt out ah the Dodgers could offer um you know a little bit more money ah a couple more years maybe four years\nA hundred million ... sixty five million do you expect him to opt out and a test the waters or stick around LA I Know a lot of Dodger fans don't want 'em right now but I Would give them up or do what do you think's gonna happen with him in Los Angeles\nSo he's got three days to do this um I Believe he will opt out I Believe he also will stay and I think he'll get a modest extension on top of the money that he's already old okay so\nIt's not going to be the Kobe Bryant let's just pile on thank you for everything you've got the ... because we know what that did the Lakers and hamstrung them for several years right um so the Dodgers have to be careful when I talk to people with great sit down interview with Ken Rosenthal during the\nCareful wife are crucial do great sit down interview with Ken Rosenthal during the ... she asked him about that one\nAnd Kuwait and we very proud\nAnd works extremely hard believes that he can regain ... off the off season\nWhere they fall off season of training to answer I Hope you can for his sake the author's sake if he remains LA\nAh I'm somewhat skeptical but he can because I just don't think guys get healthier and better at the age of thirty but there's a possibility and if so then the deal will work out fine because I think\nYou know some guys who have to re create um fly into looking terrible back in the eighties you went for our guy to Ninety eight I was growing up in the last few years it worked out for years we just had a crush on which we will\nFor the most ... power to have a ... to be an adult so we'll see how ...\n... on on a managerial sought if if you're the Dodgers okay you'd you'd expect ... to come back\nThey Roberts I mean some people say it's hard to blame the manager when he makes seven hundred thousand and Friedman a general manager make seven million who's making the calls here and if it's coming from upstairs a lot of good to know how can you blame\nRoberts ah I Know he's gone back to back World Series and his first three years you know he's been the one that division six years in a row it's not like they haven't competed and haven't had a chance or you see him as safe and just a business as usual as their chance that they could make a move\n[noise] well I got an option to pick up for a little more than a ... and we heard rumblings today to their own stature and\nDo the good that we are we we got back to that I don't know if we can ... you can call back when we could call you back real quick yeah we'll try try your back 'cause it's just we can't hear you yeah Charlotte's charm back\nReal quick but um I look I think with Dave Roberts he's got is a team option right they hadn't picked up you know they haven't picked up yet so obviously they were looking at this year as a tryout\nRob the way I see it as is only the Dodgers front office really seems to know how much making the decision on Thursday Robert's call right are we doing this and he's the far right so if if they're making the call\nOh and not starting your for top homerun hitters against lefty okay let's try the reactors back\nYet but not the guy that I think the Dodgers sabotage my own life but they didn't [laughter]\nI Do that when I Love the drop that knowledge day Roberts what this future with LA\nI think that I think he's okay but here's what I'd like to see in the future with\nWith so many teams focusing on on analytics and not taking the manager out of the equation but utilizing them at a totally different world than we had seen the previews fired you know now we haven't seen this five or ten years ago right right I Would like to see management come down and answer questions posed game as well I really want to\nThat is a great ... has a good point because they're planning\nI mean depending on how they use the analytics but if there are strictly analytic they are right there that manages the he's the one that takes the shots 'cause everybody's Ruben day Robert we saw him get boom by the fan I've said this is these are his decisions in my opinion my humble opinion\nHe should be fired right I'm Sorry like don't bring him back if he's making these decisions\nBut if it's Andrew Freedman in and the rest of the front office then I don't see how you can blame day Robert\nI'm with you your you know and here's the other point\nThat the term is called manager he's not a head coach okay so he's a manager people write for a hundred sixty two games\nYou after massage egos have you have to take care of personalities playing time guys that have instead of causes all that seemingly when you get the October that's when you start managing baseball games and it becomes the weirdest thing it really does because\nYou're ... and in the analytics world sometimes what works over a hundred and sixty two games this not work over seven game series right you have you have to look you have to have a gut you have to have a feel you have to use your eyes more frequently\nSometimes leaving a guy like Cody Belcher even though you're going to get the left he doesn't make sense because rap yoked Evers was elected editor for the red Sox was against quake Kirsch off thank you what like what's the difference your ballot your was your best defensive outfielder he's your best bass writer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNa ve for one the falls well we're glad one of\nBad a ball of\nIs down there you're paying to be way oh man
