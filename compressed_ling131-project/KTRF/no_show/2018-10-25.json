Martinez one of the guys that didn't focus cars come friday we'll see where he shows up in the red Sox wind up when they had the Dodgers stadium\nBut for for David Price yeah it was he was cruising along and then a rough ending and if it really goes to hell he can slam on tables and go oh David ... Dale for you about data\nOn David Price probably bosley in his last thing in ... Hitchens last getting yeah he's up to eighty seven and the Dodgers batting with two outs in the top of the sixth inning looks like price is going to get out of the inning and he does so maybe one more\nAt the most for David Price who is going to acquit himself with another good party postseason start that is if he has done after this ending so long it's been a good night for David Price not so much David says\nNo no no no ... and now I'm ready for the next to just suck now they're just now they're taking begins I went from the next they're going to go to the play offs to boy they're just can barely gave up that fast the Knicks were\nTrailing the heat at half time forty seven forty five is a to point game the Nixon made nine freezing the first half right this is it All right and they go next to the gas that final score the Miami Heat won ten the New York\nKnicks eighty seven yeah no not good for anybody\nElse get for heat fans now know next not good for you came in on all the you know and hateful now or not that's not exactly what you anticipate a trait Burke uh one of ten from the field tonight in sixty minutes\nYeah not a it wasn't a wasn't a wasn't good now wasn't good so we're getting ready get ready for the news on ya in roaring Fifteen\nOn Williams ... money matters in the NBA now as it up it gets so we'll keep you updated everything going on big in the NBA right now what is probably a must win game for the Lakers their own three and they're playing at Phoenix\nAnd they leave the son's Eighteen Seventeen\nRight now LeBron James so far tonight for the Lakers has seven points\nTo a five shooting Alonzo ball no points he's over to from the floor or again early in this one and now the sons of just taking the twenty eighth team lead over the Lakers just under five minutes to go in the first quarter Devin Booker now has nine for the sons\nI did I did like the Kobe Bryant or interview a Jimmy Kimmel last night where he joked about if they go on\nFive that perhaps I come back that would include this last ditch\nLet's go whereas we we're excited about the Phoenix Suns we're excited about some of the young players and they're going to run you up and\nDown the court and make it work but they're not expected to win many games but here a given the for the first week in the struggles of the Lakers and granted they played some top\nTop notch teams along the way I but you still have to when\nThey everybody wants to make excuses other odor and there's been no they're not supposed to lose all the games on the road yes there's no way they have\nEverything is fine I expected them to struggle the first twelve or Fifteen games everything is fine well I say the same thing if they lose to the sun's tonight the how did Jason Smith show with my Carmen on Fox\nI ... I mean look what normally get fined Fifteen thousand dollar kind of felt I don't think anybody's going more aggressively had officials say no we got fired is they just feel bad for the guy like let him keep his money we got to give you a Fifteen grand I'm Sorry but it's a list the littlest we can give you say I think that normally I have your bank\nA meanwhile\nSlacks is on the moon snack the giants trade defensive tackle Damon Harrison to the lines in exchange for a fifth round pick Damon Harrison who was one of the most sought after defensive\nLineman couple of years ago in free agency and played very well with the jets part of their sons of anarchy\nA line that's the second segment really got sons have we gotten pretty happy with that uh but the giants obviously sucking you need to rebuild they send snacks to the lions the lions run defenses awful he will help bought here the giants now and they've gained the fifth round pick\nTaking is now forever out of the bottle in the NFL and it's never going back in the writers have showed us we can do this we started taking before the season trading ... that was a huge trade that's going to go down as\nOne of those moments that we look back and go boy that moment really changed the NFL because now teams are just going to take rate is make another trade trading I'm Ari Cooper as Jason lock and forward told us last week on the show CBS NFL insider the raiders have everybody available Jay Glazer says this trade deadline is going to be the most\nNuts incredibly outta control deadline he's ever seen and now the giants trade Damon Harrison this is part of the giants taking and we mentioned very briefly last night but the next guy to go traders back um junior\nYou do not need to pay a wide receiver Ninety million dollars in this National Football league wide receivers are good they're valuable but you can get them\nIt's not quite the devaluation of the running back position but you don't need one guy getting Ninety million dollars to succeed\nAs the giants are seen taking back homes antics off the field out of it for a second you see what you can do when the guy plays well they can still lose he can have a hundred and fifty yards receiving say ... you have a hundred yards total in the touchdown and still the giants scored twenty points and lose a football game\nMike the bottom line is that they made it they gave her first pick for them and [noise] they're expecting him to make an impact rather quickly so the way that they're gonna set this up is basically will still be slot receiver\nGroup or be one outside receiver Michael Gallup should be the other guy and they'll go from there are no Gallup as a kid out of Colorado State there's been a little bit of good system but it had some good plays recently they really like him but they wanted someone\nLike calculus younger and mark Cooper is that I don't talk on the waiters or they just felt that Omari just was way too up and down with his performance\nAnd they were not can extend its contract and he needed moving look now the question was what the keeper of the only got a second round pick a lot of teams would have been in ... there there are definitely teams that I Know of eagles being one a couple of other teams are willing to give up too but to give up one\nThe only thing that was going to do it with the cowboys and the cat was made a decision that they think the kids were thrown around still very young you know you look let's not forget\nMark Cooper does not turn twenty five till June and he's a guy that they think they could build around and ... they could they could find some consistency what the he just needs to play like the number one picky he's been he's never been able to do a good system when I was told that by tempo scout at him for for for the ... deadline\nThat they watch the one game of baseball was unbelievable that fits in with the uh the Thursday night gets came through the trees were had two hundred yards status the blueprint of what mark Cooper could be looked at the challenges of getting more consistent and that's just not happened yet\nYou know all last week I Know he did the goal burst podcasts and I can check him out on Twitter there Adam ... had go birds pot or the eagles seem to be the one team the defending champ Saddam had an uneven start they may be a team right to make a trade in a big move do you see them going after in trying to make a splash\nIt's Jason they're not trying to make a splash what they're trying to do it fine players although I think Patrick Peterson within a guy that they would have loved to have had I had a chance to get but they never got a chance really because no one they get what they were not going to trade the courts with like a train them they have a lot of needs and probably more than they really thought start the season\nI'll give you just lost our net I'm told it's actually the injury the children who was actually torn rotator cuff try puts him out till sometime around June they just have way more needs and they thought they lost their their one of their safety is riding McLeod for the season with a pretty bad knee injury\nOr they just have a lot of nature and you can't get them all done in trade deadline I I Would expect them to make one or two moves but talking to them they're not going to hurt their football team for the future that they they they've got their super star quarterback and of course of the ones who want to still ... to ... to build around them\nOne thing they love to do if they could do it it's got a deep breath because Mike Wallace there's one in the reserve is supposed to be that guy\nBut that's not really what else on Jeopardy does and certainly not what you what Matthew is does so if they do anything I think it would be for the threat they love to get a safety they like to get another pass Rauscher like the corner like to get a running back but you can't get them\nAll in a lot of good wishes that sounds like the jets all season long by the way that's why they forget\nOr they have way more than that I think probably a anyone thought starts to\nFall by ...

ah their Secret Service detail or was presumably they go through packages that the Clintons received my guess is that the Obama Secret Service detailed does the same of why the others would have been suspicious I don't know\nThat that's a good question uh and and again I'm not clear to me whether they they were open but didn't explode or they just weren't open in some cases they just weren't opened apparently\nThat's what you know that's what I was wondering too that you know not open and but I just you know just out there what made these other people say you know high this package is suspicious they just didn't feel right doesn't look right\nNow ... ... ... ... ... you know what what's out there that made them think that way but uh that's my comment and I'm just enjoy your show him uh keep up the good work\nWell you're very ... thank you very much and I must say that you make a very intelligent comments there it deed of what stood out about these packages a good question uh

me what how passionate about\nAnd I thought to myself you know I'm busy I don't have time for this suggest sounded so ridiculous to me and I was ready to just delete that video and move on I was annoyed and\nI I felt that God just stopped me right in my tracks and just said watch this and I watched the video and I said okay I'm going to prove this wrong right now\nI have for King James Bible one is in my travel bag that's Twenty years old it goes everywhere that I go over the country and another one\nIs a hundred and fifty seven years old and it is in the top of my closet in my office and I pulled them all out late I'm On my desk\nAnd the first thing on the video said that Isaiah eleven six have been changed now Isaiah eleven six is one of the most popular scriptures in the Bible it statues are made of it paintings uh songs Elvis sang about it\nI it is the scripture that says on the line and she'll lay down with the lamb you remember that\nGeorge Bush did I Do are classic\nFor anyone out there right now if you're listening in and if you think what I'm about to say is talk of a madman term or go on line to King James Bible dot com or Bible Gateway whatever it is and and punch up Isaiah eleven six and now it says\nThe real low rules that\nNo longer says the lion she'll lay down with the lamb it says the ...\n... ... it's in writing it says the wolf I've never heard of that\nOr at George when I saw that and I saw that in my bibles I nearly fell off of my chair I spent three years in Syria biblical studies I Know the scriptures\nAnd when I saw that I'm telling you right now I couldn't reconcile that I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and there it is and again don't take my word for it if if you're out there listening or get a hold of a King James Bible or punch it up on line and you'll see for yourself\nYou if you go and look at your own Bible a hundred and fifty seven year old one yeah we'll we'll let's say the wolves\nAbsolutely and I've taken pictures of it and it's there that is what it\nIs bizarre George it's I have no ax the only explanation and I still don't understand and I have it in the in the new book the only thing that I can take over this perhaps this is linked to CERN which is the Large Hadron collider\nWhich was French are bored out\nOf the work they're doing I Believe they're opening up portals she dimensional doorways\nI mean I I remember as a kid the lion lays down what's the lamb\nYeah then if you can get Tom on somebody to shop for you and show you on screen what I'm saying and you'll see for yourself and it's shocking it's really shocking to see it because anybody\nWho is heard that scripture you know it by heart it's one of the most popular scriptures in the entire Bible and now it's a little\nCan you find it anywhere where it says the lion lays down with the lamb or is it just is it the wolf all over the place\nIt is the wolf in every Bible now however\nA friend of mine uh he has a YouTube channel ah\nUm his name is Chris and I thank you very much for finding this for me he actually found him and his YouTube channel is a become one vacancy he actually found something for me I like old encyclopedia of biblical encyclopedia\nAnd he found the passage with the lion and I am that is the only place\nThat you will see it as something and it will be in my new book stranger than fiction\n[noise] and that's it everything else George says the wolf\nI Wonder if it's going to change if he doesn't look at it every day for example if one day it's going to change to the wolf some uh\nOh it wouldn't surprise me one bit and furthermore the Lord's Prayer is now change what happens is that\nOkay the Lord's Prayer is our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name like getting caught in that it will be done on earth as it is going to have and give us as their daily bread and forgive us for Trump after as we forgive those who trust pounds against us but leaders nodded to temptation delivers from evil\nFor the kingdom and the power and the glory forever more right you've heard that are making\nA course of course they it's changed now so now with our father which are in having\nI never heard it like that\nYeah how come I Will be done in the earth\nIn or near where we live in earth now you live in earth do is there some\nThing that changes these things\nYes and I do believe without really knowing the answer and even if I saw it in front of my face I don't know what\nWell without really knowing the answer and even if I thought from my face I don't know I wouldn't know what I was looking at a but I Do believe that it is CERN and the heat wave walk them computers that are working in concert and I think that it's earned it opens up the portal and see the way computers\nSomehow some way whether it is some way as crazy as all of this sounds I assure you it's true that they have this ability to go back whether it's going back in time and changing that's I don't know but I can assure you of this for anyone out there who would say oh\nThis is the Bible or make these changes coming off the printing presses and all that I'm Sorry I'm Talking about a hundred and fifty seven year old Bible that has changes in at a Bible that's been in my possession for years\nThat adds changes in it now so that can't be resolved we be in human understanding we can't resolve that\nAnd another thing that I find very interesting is that the Lord's Prayer I have it on paper and a frame on my wall that was changed to what I just told you\nAre but yet I have Lord's Prayer carved in a stone in my home and that is not changed and it has not been changed so it's interesting to note\nThat what ever this technology is apparently it cannot make changes on something that is in stone war of some type of metallic substance or something like that another bizarre thing George\nOr do you have any Roman numeral clocks in your home or do you have a watch with Roman numerals\nI think I Do I think I have a couple of watching what that\nOkay well I Want you to look at the of the Roman numeral they're old and I turned upside down to\n... what is what has happened to them\nThis effect has now turned them opposite so they're upside down now for where you would see a in the five o'clock position you know that would look like a a V. that's now turned upside down to where it looks like an\nEgg that's weird\nAnd again for anyone who thinks that this is crazy talk just look at your watches or your clocks and and and another ... and I take your photographs of this as well and people from all over the world are noticing death\nAnd and other interesting thing I have some watches with Roman numerals that have been affected and changed yet I have a clock a Roman numeral clock on my wall it might have living\n... that have like metal pen for the Roman numerals and that has not been changed\n... ... you know we're going to have our ends to pull back on our website as we get some new software and I'll be able to pull people instantly bill\nAnd I would love to pull people on the lion lays down with the lamb and see how many people say that they agree that's what it was and then compare it to the statistics uh yeah I've been to show the overwhelming people would say that it that it was a little lion lays down with the lamb\nNo question about it I mean the wolf is ridiculous it doesn't fit there's no way when you say that it just it makes no sense odd George when you look at it it just looks so odd it's not right now let me ask you this\nThat the e bay you're familiar with the DEA correct drug Enforcement Administration\nWell it's interesting that you say that because it was known as the drug enforcement agency that's why they were ... agents and now it is the drug Enforcement Administration\nWhile I bought see I've always thought of it is that we're gonna come back with more built in a moment on coast to coast day

consider her a gift tax psychic and she said at the board and the message came through and it said they asked what should we call you wish we call this tool to for this device it's spelled out we job\nThey they decided let's go we just so ... so they needed to get it patented so in Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S patent and trademark office allies rub on the attorney for this group went along with miss Helen Peters they sat down at the board because they had to prove\nTo the patent officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do this no I'm not going to

little sparks come read offered and screams she heard screams coming out of the board you believe up\nWell okay so I have the story is right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions belief\nOn how we view the world her own fears our own desires and so our mind is a powerful thing it can create many things that we have and\nTruly measure and understand and we don't fully understand awareness or consciousness and how we might even affect our world's through creating are manifest yet\nI'm going to say that the story but what I Will comment

com\nAs well during you had mentioned that the using the board\nIs somewhat like a permission explain that\nWell we have the ability to interact and reach into the unseen dimensions if from when we came up where we go again I've definitely believe in an afterlife with it for life and in between lives\nAnd so I I came into this world as a very young child scenes they're having imaginary playmate having positive experiences with them as well and I knew there was something so much more and for me the wage war became kind of my lifeline to have those connections nicotine throughout my whole life [noise]\nUm so it becomes just that permission allows me because my allowance becomes my a gateway or becomes just a channel I use to do what I actually can do I mean I did this as a child\nThat sounds we put that stuff away as we get older and grow up and were told not to do that not to talk to beans that aren't there imaginary playmate and go to school and I was told those things\nAnd so I found myself putting in a way that this is the one tool that worked really well for me to be able to have those communications and to this day I'm I have communications that I used to have the child but and I could do it on the board in off the board and I know it's not the board that lets me do this\nIt's myself with my ... my beliefs about the abilities my allowance of abilities to come through and this again just becomes that kind of a door that threshold that left me moving around and interact with them\nHow often do you use the board\nNot as much as I used to I'm doing a lot of work George direct channeling\nUh with my voice or writing off the board more often than I mean he's the board but I use the board would say about once every two weeks maybe twice a month I might go as much as an only doing it once a month\nBut I I prefer to work with a partner at ... at the very busy travel schedule himself so when we do get together we'll do a session on my last anywhere from three to five five enough hours\nHaving said that I Do a lot of ... a sessions for my YouTube channel where I Will do answer people's questions and let them have readings\nUm and I do live shows like that like I'm doing one on Halloween evening as well um so I I I really try to interact with people with the tool and when I'm not you that I'm most of the time talking about writing about it or answer people's questions about it\nWhen you travel with the ... board does anybody freak out\nWell yes [laughter] yes they do I do it\nYeah you know you can always hide them um and I do to help my boards I always have a traveling for with me and if I don't have one forgot one which has happened all you've got to do is get a piece of paper right the letters down but the numbers down yes and no in a way you go with the coin\nWhile the rest of the several hours going to fly by so let's get some calls in for your Karen Angie in Ohio welcome to the program high energy\nI think you taking my call but we want to go right right ...\nBack when I was a teenager I had a boy and I think that he could do out of body experiences and failing it really religious and they didn't like the things you practicing they put him in a home\nFor a while while and me if I had a we keep word and I had the ... actually\nI Do he said well if if you taught me I can leave my body and I can come visit you so one night me and my girlfriend our ... president that's her [noise]\nAnd after they went to that we decided to try it and it was a really calm quiet night it was warm and the windows open the front or a phone you know it was early eighties we really nothing to be afraid\nMhm [noise] and we're trying to talk to him next thing we know we\nHeard a weird noise and the front door the screen door open\nAnd there was no way an open so we jumped up and when the when the doors are locked it and just started cutting all the windows because we were like oh my gosh somebody tried to come in well the next day he called me cause for good behavior he was allowed to make calls so he called me and he says\nWhy just shut the door on me so what are you talking about he gives you tried to talk to me last night I came down and shut and all around me at that that that I get rid of that we\nLook at things Angie grudge throws\nYou Andy that's uh I I Love when she stared at what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people's higher so\nAnd that's what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people's higher self\nYou can talk to people that are still alive you can talk to animals that are alive or deceased so it's an it's what it is it's really you're communicating with their consciousness you communicate with that part of themselves that exist like the higher self that exist beyond their corporate ... existence or experience\nAnd these are these other dimensions of a person so I don't one bit doubt that you can do that as I have done that myself\nAnd that one didn't have a real bad ending to it\nKnow and I think she spoke yourself because it is kind of weird at first we started doing this and you go how can I talk to that person is still alive\nIsn't a board to be used with the deceased person will no I learned that this board can become your costs make the phone I I use it as a cosmic phone like I Would have wireless phone I dial on the frequency through my intentions\nThrough my thoughts through my feelings and then I can tap into connect because I've trained myself over these years to all these

board is things that are coming out of you and you but I really can't buy that because you're talking about their ... you know that people who never met the man\nWe're able to board the board shoulders man these people have no idea who was really there was more jobs you being coming through the board\nOr are they ever got there and you know were warned not to have\nCommunication work better it because it is that people will want and the living will die but no not anything I really believe that you're going to an end you've been with the spirit and they will continue to do that\nGo ahead of journalists to react to the thank you\nYeah I think it in um so you listened and when I'm Talking about abilities we all have a six sensibility we have the ability to be intuitive and path to gut feelings your heart feeling we'll talk about we feel it in your gut or he had\nYou had sneaking suspicion something was right or wrong\nThat's the abilities and how that turns out and humans life we often have will have dreams of prophecy will have sought of like something just doesn't feel right here or gosh I've known this person for years\nIt's those things I'm Talking about when I was born

you're you're friendly you care about people absolutely no how did this all started for you how did you get involved in witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with Sean and and she's also happens to be at of I I consider to be a very powerful which end and he introduced me to not jak and instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her healing um\nAnd like I I feel like whatever she does with just so amazing that instead of doing the work for me she empowered me who taught me how to do with my health [laughter] show I ... you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest is history\nI feel very very confident with with what I Do you know with the spouse that I've been executed\nWith what I Do you know with the spells that I've been executing so that's how I got started it was it was more\nAbout healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like well I probably don't need a healer because I'm I'm using magic as a form of killing\nHave you ever ...\nNever and I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] it's not what\n... what what what good are spells the if you can't win any\nYou know I think that the power\nOf our minds because I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic is that in my mind is more powerful\nThan I realized so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels that we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual abundance\nSo I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up on my knee spell and work that but right now I've just been focused on doing the\nUm healing and an crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic what do you what are we talking about we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something else are we\nAbsolutely and it can be used by anyone I think people you know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic I'm simply chanting uh spell and when I work my rituals I chat between anywhere between one

every single month to keep out the entities in any you know opportunists that happened to be sure\nCrossing by and I will say on negative beans leave this house never to return I cast you out I test you out I test you out so I Will do that while I'm\nThrowing charge salt water and the candle and every single corner of my home and it really really works and then I'll ward all the windows\nYou know the the feelings and the floors and everything else so um that's fun it's really really fun and then when I when I chat spelled like when I Do want crossing rituals which I think everyone should learn how to do and and do it very often\nAnd I'm a real capable of learning\n[noise] absolutely I think that we are we have become very lazy and we are we I mean we have given our power away\nTo not only our friends and family but to the government and it\nYou know we're just we don't want to do anything else I feel also that we we feel very entitled we feel like everything should be given to us and so this is one of the reasons why I'm extremely grateful that my sharman didn't do the work for me\nWhile I got to tell you it is it is indeed magical when it works is\nIt really is and I have not only felt results but I have seen results that actually creeps me out [laughter]\n[noise] well I got to tell your courage or ... demons adventure I have I have um you fight them off or do you do with it\n[laughter] yeah I Do I have a story to Maya demons later [laughter] well it's it's not as tragic as that but\nI have had one experience and I I Will share that with you I Would say about Nineteen Twenty years ago and this was my first experience with a real\nLive demon men this wasn't like a portal it was in my house and it came out and you know wanted to play it was actually a demon that was summing up by a very evil some federal and he sent it my way\nWhat's or something I said I said is ... is a religion and um they need to be good or bad I don't know much about this on the idea of religion but I Do know that there are some powerful sunset\nOr some sort of you yes on ... it's a religion or check\nAnd so they work with magic and they work with the ... which are different spirits [noise] um so this\nSon that'll had sent a intentionally of course the sent a demon my way and this was after I had had her reading with them a psychic reading and of course I was so naive and I

know what it was because I didn't know anything about demons and um\nIt was\nJust like I couldn't move so my first reaction was to pray the Lord's Prayer out loud and it didn't work so I you know

bed and then all of a sudden what it felt like hours of course all of a sudden I fell on my ear going up and down I don't know if there's a pall over a half foot\nBut it was going up and down on my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I was ten down so this wave of courage\nJust came over me and I just thought you know I I ... I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just thought and as soon as I I made that adjustment in my mind right I I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just\nPeeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just hung up [laughter] when I went up and I'm not kidding George I felt a hairy\nLeg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone\nBut it just like it flew away obviously\nThat's freaky it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't and believe me but I did go back to that psychic woman was like what happened but yeah it's so freaking and I will say it never happen again after\nThat time so I Know that this man is something that even and sent it my way but I did not sleep without the light off for about three months after that it totally terrified me it was\n... who is susceptible to demonic possession and in situations like that\nWell you know I'm not going to list did they say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail or drunk\nOr shine yeah we're we're going to the ... the cemetery at you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um there is one reason I think that\nMany other were you ever to laugh you don't have a chemical which uh which should have a capital you\nKnow a which is actually a wise woman so [laughter] that's the definition of a witch but yeah I think you [laughter] I'm\nA ton of one of the ... [laughter] I Can't do it even if I tried and so one of the reasons\nThat I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand I'm considering we've all lived thousands of lifetimes I'm and I'm Glad I haven't remembered any of them\nUm some of these lifetimes we were not the best of people and um it's very possible and this is my theory that could be wrong but\nI have proof from ... who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this and it's very possible that some of these people these victims or experiencing what is known as karma so they can be you know harassed and molested in this lifetime with the demon the\nDanger with in in a previous lifetime now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in this lifetime and the demon the pay is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of the demon die unless you like\n... you cast them all but the they don't want by exactly\nThere's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we read incarnate and the demon is going to probably harassed them and molest him now that's\nOne one theory and I can say I'm with confirmation that it it it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days has a lot of cases\nOf of people who are being molested harassed and just you know possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a shower Monica journey into their past lives and nail it\nAnd nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just breaks that agreement that they can finally\nShe just breaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demons or not bothering your neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she wants to ... ... what do they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity\nDuty we'd also\nAbsolutely and I'm sadly a lot of black magicians will\nCast spells against people who they feel they can steal light from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and they look into us however they do it and what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent so\nThis is what it is extremely important especially right now um to to really really really really\nClear ourselves on a daily basis and do managing rituals prayers and and he'll our our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases of a demon intrusions\nAnd people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um\nManipulate our thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know jumping in Redding, California together started I just go ahead\nHi George how are you are good thank you hike at I'm losing my voice so I Hope you can hear me far so good\nOkay Hi Curtis Hi\nUm my husband and I both believe that I have been cursed by his ex girlfriend\nOh boy [laughter]\nAnd it wasn't but a year\nAfter he and I had gotten together [laughter]\nThat an accident occurred with me and I brought it up to him a couple months later and said you know do you think that this person is\nBecause I I mean just fucking out or device for her she was ... but not a good wage no and I mean she might even have to do but\nI told him I said do you think that it's possible that this person could have put a curse on me and he looked to me is set up so early\nWhile she obviously when they broke up did not go peacefully did shoot\nNo and actually she helped him move into his apartment and it was like God open the door for me to leave my ex husband before God you know in a permit became available was perfect timing I got in there\nAnd in part right for maintenance Kevin ... vote for him later down the road it was it was totally like doors opening\nAnd you think Kathy this ... along you\nYes I Do George I fell down the fight is there room\nFor morning while I was going for morning walks every morning before well this particular morning I was battling with myself\nPart of me said don't go and the stubbornness and when you said I was doing it to lose weight or had already lost a hundred pounds [laughter]\nAsks questions about how to correctly take your medicine and why you need them use weekly pill boxes or a reminder system to keep track of when to take medicine to learn more visit C.

with mayor Brian home or go ahead\nYeah I Know what I tried that that the fact\nThat it's not far I met him and still you'll get your at least half in foreign aid because they ended up leading mind\nYeah because I think that configuration arm I don't think reaches out as far as they want you to get them is close to the curb as you possibly can no\nSo you know growth there\nOkay All right thanks for the call appreciate it All right is there a and I don't and I I all members when he was a we had it on they keep the city and then we saw a video on that that's the only time I've really looked at it um is there any possibility put an extension on it\nOr you know really the key to handle and I don't know what to configuration and never run out maybe the marriage you know they're run in the area\nI think that the whole house I'm\nOK six eight one twelve thirty here's wanted says I'm a what's the\nPolicy on paintings street lines parking painting et cetera policy on paintings street lines parking et cetera\nUm I Know that are we paying them or at least once a year and I know in contract to as far as a city streets and stuff they are the DOT coming from a transportation contract with them to him I guess I don't know which are streets it'd be talking about\nOkay so I'm I'm yeah I'm guessing that their policy and painted Sri Lanka is once a year\nUm and if you know I don't know not really sure what else it\nBut you you do\nA paint everything ... repeat everything once a year that we try to get everything the knitting having everything last year\nParking I'm not sure the parking lots maybe\nAnd the parking lot nicer than get done once a year or two as well because the ... in the parking ounce I guess I'm really now because there's a\nDay and the first thing in some of them that I Know I when I pull in there you the lenders out\nHow 'bout curbs maybe curbs painting on curbs\nHow low in the blue handicapping the yellow most most of them are out and I know that uh fifty nine going out to\nUm holiday uh they never came back and painted them at this year um because of new construction where they're replaced him so I don't know if they were going to finish shut up or wait until next spring\nOkay I'm All right and if you have any other questions six day one one two three zeroes a sixty one twelve thirty\nYou can call in your question or you can ... your question would be happy to pass it along or and I did get the address thank you all pass it along to the mayor or as well uh we have a news you're just a moment would have one more thing before before we get to the news ah I just wanted to check guide you you work with Michele Landsburg\nWith that and I don't remember the name of the company said lands were good of insulting signing up um and she works with the is it the city jobs ... jobs out on for John jobs in contract out\nIsn't it in a county and the city kind of a three way\nAnd you pay part of that to be to be part of it the right you have to pay anything new in and going on right there with with it right now\nAs far as the position or we're faced throughout this year and we're just currently looking at a budgeting and how much a ... a contribution and stuff to city means what it was what are you hoping\nTo get out of this and we were there anything I mean they're looking in particular right now housing is housing is one thing well housing\nIs is it that housing is one of the things that are the cities are really needs to start with that and finished with it because anytime housing comes up right away you know it could start off with buildings from at zoning all that is we do that right now currently uh any new developers coming in the first thing they're going to do is uh\nWhere do you have the area that we can put up a apartment building and stuff and\nRight now we currently have that I Can't remember the names but uh uh um apartments going up by Wal Mart are going up and\nI think we got to the building better neighborhoods got a good girl to happening down there and we're doing improvements down there and are coming in the near future um there'll be some other ideas and stuff released on ah some others that it'll be building up in our community that\nYou know I Know you've you've done a lot of apartments has learned a lot of apartments and stuff in town here or we okay now with apartments we've got enough apartments\nNow is [noise] ... ah it can anybody answer that question I really love to see that crystal ball come up because it is it apartments you want is a town house as you want is that a\nTwo bedroom a ... a single family homes or on that one out of it should do do we look at it is there enough apartments do we want more homes now question and I brought this up at the last uh housing meaning that are we really have to take a look at that because where is the balance going to be\nWhat you know what I'm looking for might be totally different than what the new generation coming into town sure sure and what what is really needed and uh\nI think it's up to not only um some of the deed developers to look at uh I hate the word study but to take a look at it and evaluate what it is but also I think it is uh\nSome of the manufacturers in town and have to kind of you know maybe internally pull some of the new people coming into their not a bad idea to get them in and he gets out and get some of the input from the\nPeople that are actually moving in that I'm looking at our new highways or what\nWhat are they looking for looking for and everybody says well they'd like to move into a apartment well lets him apartments are filled up sooner or later that employees that you should be asking them again well now that you've been in an apartment for six months or you're going to keep this job and want to live in a\nFar right and then on the laser with apartment I mean not everybody's\nEverybody's different but a lot of people and they they get an apartment to start maybe they moved to that they're looking to say okay now I like this and I like this community I Want to stay or not want to buy a home\nAnd I'm actually culture and a of a economic development on the coalition greater Minnesota cities and one of the things that come up about that is a we have an older generation that is retiring and getting a moving out of their homes but then not necessarily want to move into a so called retirement center ... but the more\nMore maybe fit into ... assisted living to ... or ... and type of things and a wet that there should be other hoses opening up they might be older houses but what what what is needed to be done to rehab dumped so that people will be a first time home owner\nI I Know uh I Know some of the amounts that are in there and I\nGuess for their about sailing them I don't know maybe there are a little high I don't know\nI ... for the or the or the population um what it calls for a you know something the each one I think they're all pretty similar\nHere's one question for you what's affordable housing it's affordable the home you know ... if that's a question that's out there\nAnd that's a that's a good question to six eight one twelve thirty I'm is in the city trying to recruit another grocery store\nI guess as far as grocery stores go and everything else that has provided by market and are right now in the last study that came on as far as grocery store that I Know about is that everybody considers we have two grocery stores and nobody's really ready to pull the trigger on the third because they consider the Walmart grocery store and then we also I think\nThat we have Hugo is which is a fantastic grocery store in my opinion\nI'm a six eight months while dirty well can we get a caller on the lives let's go to the phones thanks for waiting you're on the line with mayor home or go ahead\nYou're during the last ... ... ... ... it made a\nHuge mess on most of the alley where you can go back to having a greater do that there are more even leveling ...\nI I Know John has been out with the greeter dressing up bally's down they wanted a shaved down some of them get get rid of some of the dirt was because of the ... the problem is that isn't always just putting more dirt in there sometimes it's just getting a belated and getting the drainage out of there but uh\nDo you have a particular alley between what street or they can ah pointing my finger at\nYour ... or ... so we're we're in a very great murder of Dr on a cream cream on Carly\nOn forever or or ... or so okay\nI'll check on that area creators of the motor or a blind man with a troubled [laughter]\nOh well let's see what a what they got there for you All right thanks for the call on 'em\nAnd uh you know what you are ... people wouldn't we wouldn't have the show and thank you for the calls and and that's what this show is about two to pass along the information but\nI I got to say I think you you get some pretty good employees working for the for the city they end up doing the job and you got a lot of experience there which is really helpful\nOnly out um we I Swear by it or not true and uh some of the issues that happen they just they don't drive around every street and every ... to find out every issue so unless something's brought to our attention uh it's hard for me to direct him on what\nAnd it's okay to bring something to your attention when you look at it and I mean it's a ... a big city for as many people and you know it helps to the to get a a a ... to look at\nToo and there's a you know you can call it a suggestion box or what but uh I can drop a suggestion box and normally gets followed up pretty fast\nOkay [noise] um here's a I think it's the comment I said it says on a pizza attacked find six they went to all dirty I think with a painting on the streets the city has been doing a good job considering all the construction that's been going on in town and dealing with the weather well thank you for that comment\nUm here's one is as eighth street was not finished this year do you anticipate problems this winter with not having to find a lift done\nDo I or does it\nA friendly as your as predation hat yeah they say there's you in general I think they say there's\nGoing to be no issues and me living in this climate all my life and know within a hazard we have in the wintertime I think there's going to be some ... issues I narrowed but that's my own opinion is not subject to anybody else's but the my own\nFilm why would there be more snow one ... do you think you know one of the dreams for\nThe water a street yeah there are two inches fires and where the oh\nThat's true yes I have heard that night kitchen on the site and this is just yeah one of the common sense you issues that I Am all that's possible I see what you're saying and ... and stuff like that there's not going to be proper drainage and\nBlah and I'm I'm guessing you've already addressed us with a city crew or the city gr already know out as so he'll keep an eye on and on the road for us now you guys don't do anything there no that's a department of transportation has also in this meeting next Tuesday and when he brought up then I'm guessing it when it has been brought I'd had already bought up already okay yeah All right\nI'm thanks for the uh for the question they didn't even think about that but that's a nice here says nine hundred dollars a month\nIsn't affordable rent day so evidently somewhere it's nine hundred a month and I suppose it depends on the side of the apartment I come back to the apartments I'm guessing here um because I think if it's a single whether it's a double the I mean there's different prices obviously 'cause I Know some of the uh my daughter was looking for places I I was looking and there was like\nI think was that they were like six hundred are six fifty I think that was for basically a let's say one or two bedroom or not something on that order\nI didn't think that was terrible but eventually this person has nine hundred or so maybe there's somewhere that says nine hundred a month but again I think you marry you mentioned it what is affordable\nNow so far double and to home and you know the other part is that these are private people I Can't go and say hey you're charging too much for your services you're under and I just I Can't go to Hugh goes and tell them how much they can charge for a loaf of bread either\nNot even as Mary you can't do that and it was already a probably throw a suggestion Adam has just like they're throwing suggestions right now you know\nHere's another one says are they going to plow the roads this winter when it snows or wait three weeks till it's all packed down again\nI think that issue has already been addressed but a lot of those that mess that we're on top\nOf it we have a ... we have a better equipment than we've ever had in the past and uh other than the first ... when a thing that everybody remembers they always remember the one in\nBut first the one thing that everybody remembers they always remember the one incident last year where we\nGot a ... it was the one the remember that's for\nSure how it was early and it got frozen and it was a pain all year so hopefully this year and I have a plan of attack and uh if we have anything in the forefront I Will call a snow emergency and we're going to start calendar parking and if everybody lives by it and\nThe one last year because it was such a mess for anybody who either wasn't here doesn't really matter I think if you're here you remember but if you weren't here\nIt was a it was it was a snow fall but then it was it melted and early ... really wet role is hard at it and for ... you know that's obviously that's that's a concern but if it's addressed right away and had this year if if it were before the counter parking it'd be in this would be an example of a snow emergency\nWhere you are married into it and like I said we have better equipment we have the ability to put down some liquid solved a pre solving a treatments and stuff ... prior to having to you know with our sand trucks and stuff after the incident so I'm hoping we're up on the game\nA um a couple of other quick ones that came in on our pizza text line of sixty one twelve thirty one says I agree with the a terrible job on grading the alleys watched him use a box paper and it wasn't good at all [noise]\nUm I don't know who use the box paper and they're trying to evidently takes them down you'd mentioned is um but it's something to address again you\nCan call the the city tell them your address or the location the thinking they could probably look at it again or is it something that the ... river and we went down in the greater is going to come back later\nUm I don't know their whole plan but it I Would hope they had it in their system and if they don't uh I think they are probably I'll listen to this ready so\nI ... well really the message again\nI I'm here's another one a talking about the plowing it won't matter if they don't plow when it gets warmer\n\nIt won't matter if they don't plow when it gets warm not really sure exactly what that\nI guess if it comes to springtime reason why we don't call it off as just because we don't want to plug up the storm drains so that we haven't even even melt and we're not notes steaming the storm drains because they're all pushed over with slush and re frozen but I'm not sure how that\n[noise] yeah I'm I'm not a sure another one uh get ice off the road to get us off the road um at the end again this is the policy we've talked about again he is a snow is there a than like two inch three inch\nUsing common sense or some of that too and stuff and it's it goes falls back on that uh we do have the authority to send the ... when we need to falls out at all\nWhich I think it was the biggest concern because it was easy for ... years on the half your ticket tape measure out and they measure it and stuff like or at least ... days that you did it now is not as if they need\nTo be done and we're going to invest the money and get it done because ah I myself I don't like by phone ringing out of ... [laughter] but no your word has been hurt and uh the sheer should be of a lot better on otherwise feel free to give me a call\nRight right um ... it's something you guys did address and I think that's a that's what that's what they're here for there are here to address it\nSix eight one twelve thirty were run out of time here um I had done was going to see oh I Know the other thing I was just gonna ask about the airport because we haven't talked to the airport for a long time everything's going fine there are any ups down to new things and what's going on everything's going pretty good there's been a few delays\nNot like they used to be um and I just continues to hopefully support it um [noise]\nWe're not have to point for allocation of extra money through the FAA but I heard there was a reauthorization issued a at a thousand past year mark surfing get to a thousand passengers to use that airport or they'll get us an extra million dollars I Believe it is or use of er facility would be nice\nAnd I said all help solve a we're plugging along and we're looking for a future um and ah\nTeach them pretty good for us You're out in the ass boutiques been really good and a racer and bad and then also uh that's just one part of that whole airport out there and they're part is the freight that leaves at an airport every day and it's a vital\nVital part of a disk in uh their sustainability and that was all part of the whole plan and why they stayed here because he did have an airport that or they could play their packages directly out of\nIs sooner Bahrain real fast burner in town downtown on second street people were false stopping today more ... fourteen out orders that sixty one forty five on what is\nToday's word daily definition it is rare and who is best Jared Jared how you doing good how are you good to put you down but the burger basket from the scooters devastation pick it up\nQuick caller is absolutely right it is rare not thoroughly cooked is rare and that's your daily definition from the scooter bar and grill stone or a bar and grill the forever falls twelve noon cloudy at forty nine degrees team twelve thirty ... thirty Katie Iraq the fervor falls Minnesota\nUp for their facility in the Bronx where they can now investigating and figure out if there are signatures that matching if there is any evidence on that package or on a device that might lead them to whoever is doing this\nTo other devices were discovered in Delaware that had been sent to former vice president Joe Biden law enforcement officials says the packages addressed abiding where it is\nThe Joe Biden law enforcement official says the packages addressed abiding were intercepted the Delaware male facilities in New castle unwilling to in a total of ten devices have been discovered in recent days I might ...\nIllinois Republican congressman Rodney Davis says whoever's behind the package bombs does not represent mainstream America\nYes misled a ticket is targeting individuals who are opposed to President Trump and opposed to other issues um and it's not right uh he's got to stop we got to make sure that the American people know that we agree on more than we disagree in this country and we've got to come together as Americans\nDemocratic congresswoman Maxine Waters of California says she will not be intimidated even though she was the intended recipient of too suspicious packages intercepted yesterday\nIn response to a request from the president defense secretary Mattis could announces early as today he's calling up at least eight Hubbard troops to help protect the southern border from a caravan of migrants now in southern Mexico on Wall street the Dow was up\nThree hundred and forty five minutes and forty five minutes to govern one Seventy eight I'm Mike moss\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former foreign Lincoln and mercury owners or less the skin receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective to comment airbags in their vehicles\nTo see if your vehicle is included and to file a claim to auto airbags settlement dot com or call one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six that's auto airbags settlement dot com or one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six\nIf you are behind on your bills than this messages\nWhere you how would you like to have a large portion of your credit card debt or medical bills forgiven national credit card relief would like to give you free information on a proven debt forgiveness program it's not bankruptcy it's not consolidation this special program actually wiped clean the portion of your debt that is forgiven Gulf\nOr your free forgiveness information now eight hundred to like one six six ... that's eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh don't wait call eight hundred to nine one six six seven oh not available in North Dakota\nCIA director Gina Haspel is set to break President Trump on the investigation into the death of ...

O. J. for you yesterday told the Supreme Court that it is lawful to discriminate against transgender employees based on their gender identity\nIn a brief to the Supreme Court to the OJ wrote the federal civil rights law banning sex discrimination in the workplace does not extend to transgender people\nFinally come to the Supreme Court ways whether to take on a case in which you lower court ruled the Nineteen sixty four civil rights act can be interpreted to protect transgender workers against bias and discrimination ministry chin is not a friend of the el ... community says Greg Norman's and attorney for London legal\nThey can see what they're going to say but the courts will have the final word well you know we just added another very conservative justice to it to write the sixth circuit court of appeals and marched on that\nA Detroit funeral home violated title seven anti discrimination laws when it fired its general director after she came out as a transgender\nThe presiding judge wrote at the time that the discrimination on the basis of transgender and transitioning status is ... necessary or is this is necessarily discriminatory on the basis of sex\nThat I think what the funeral home I mean if it just ... you have to his give and take for\nYour fellow employee you got to get along but if they're if they're causing problems with the people who are coming in there and recently had a death in the family or something like that that would be a different thing like if the if they can't reach out emotionally to these people they're shutting them off or they're making them feel even worse ...\nOkay that's one thing but if you know if you just kind of creep out your fellow employees well you know what get used to it we all have to get along well let me take that one more step\nFurther what if you have a transgender person working here again I I don't mean prompt I used to work with a consultant who was transgender transgender from a O'Malley running out of the consultants used to be a dude and then decided to become a girl\nAnd there are consulting for frog in Ninety nine point nine in the park so when he was J when it was J he would always come by and we'd all go to lunch and have a great time and they won one year he decided he was going to change and become a female gr so now\nIt's still Jay but it's with the any or something it's you know no anyway very big consultant across the country a lot of people will one day and the and the scotch read this radio convention in Vegas and we were sitting there in a chair I'm you know during the conference you know probably like two three hundred people in this conference\nAnd Jay had been the one sitting like right next to me I had no idea I hadn't seen him yet has a girl and so scotch looks over to me he goes he century recovering now\nAnd then a few minutes later Jay goes hey how you scratch doing all my God it was weird because I had no idea they he looked she looks so much different but it didn't bother me 'cause I already knew Jay for you know how many years as J. it just felt a little weird it was like\nYou're a girl you know is that what you said yes I did honestly you know it was I Know that sounds kind of weird but because I Know ... different yeah it was like oh you're a girl he's like yeah finally made it to its official now and wow [laughter] so after this meeting you know little\n... when he said well how do you follow that you say graduation or do you say is a weird or I did I said as I said\nIt's going to take a little time to get used to and then after this conference we all went out to lunch or we talked and I was like it just so weird you know it's like\nYou're still Jay right yeah I'm Still you know but but it was different like long hair now and you know glasses and all this but he was\nAnd I've seen her since a couple of different times of different media thanks and has no no big deal now but saying that you know 'cause I had no had no idea of sitting right next door you you don't know if somebody is transgender would there be a problem\nIf I didn't know what yeah I guess if I didn't know what it would it wouldn't matter I mean sure how would you know exactly but ... and and here's here's one of the sticking point so so you you hire a a one to do a job yeah\nAnd then later that woman decides she wants to be a man you can't hire

attention in the wall Street Journal and the title was the Franklin house divided and here's how it started\nOn the fourth of July Seventeen Seventy six Benjamin Franklin was in Philadelphia\nHaving helped to draft the declaration of independence while his son the governor of New Jersey was under arrest in Connecticut having been branded an enemy of his country for pre existing in his royal duties and opposing the revolution in less than a year William\nWe'll duties and opposing the revolution in less than a year William Franklin we'd be taken to the notorious\nWhich we'll go a destination for among others traders who abuse their privileges and lighter incarceration and that led us to the gas the joins us now the book review was for the loyal son the war in Ben Franklin's house\nAnd Daniel mark Epstein joins us now thanks for joining us then it's a pleasure to be with you and Daniel tell us what drew you this book\nWhile I was always interested in Benjamin Franklin from the time I was a kid you know it was the one of the most first of all Americans man who was a great inventor [noise]\nUh [noise] and probably the ... the first great scientist in terms of electricity and of course everybody knows the story about been flying the kite\nAnd I remember seeing that would cut of a Benjamin Franklin followed flying with tight with his little boy\nAnd I wondered what would it be like to have Benjamin Franklin as a father I mean a man who was not only a great inventor but um [noise] created the militia in Pennsylvania and order to defend the frontier against the Indians and then you know created the first postal system in Pennsylvania and [noise]\nThe University of Pennsylvania and then of course became one of the greatest American patriots during the revolution but what if you like to be that man's son oh and then of course I found out that I'm Benjamin Franklin's only son was illegitimate a bastard\nBut that he was raised just as if they're legitimate sun and the two of them were partners in politics and in military affairs and a later in diplomacy [noise] um so it was an extraordinary father son relationship and the fact that they went different ways during the revolution\nAnd the William Franklin I'm became the governor the governor of New Jersey while his father of course was the greatest patriot drove them apart and I thought what a tragedy what a great story so actually wrote a poem about this in the Nineteen nineties\nAnd do you have that problem with me right now [laughter] no no I mean it's it was published long ago and as often happens because I I was a\nAnd in England and his son rose very quickly he went to the bar a and got his law his law degree in his mid twenties and shortly after that was appointed to be the governor of New Jersey so at that point in his life he was in his late twenties\nOr his father was a fifty in his mid fifties he was even more powerful in the uh in the government than his father was so he had an extraordinary\nAnd so let's get down to this conflict I mean by the time we get to this day impact as we indicated before\nOr the country was in pretty much open rebellion in the civil war was brewing\nAnd William took the stand ... bend took a stand and talk about their final meeting in particular was remarkable before we get to that build up to that if we can set up that I I think almost just tragic scene between the father and son\nWell it's really extraordinary the extent to which the two men were living in different worlds because by Seventeen Seventy five [noise]\nTwo years before the actual a declaration of independence oh we had been living in America he was the governor of New Jersey and he had been the governor of New Jersey for more than a decade\nOr in trying to represent the king's interests in America and try and prevent this revolution which he knew would be a disaster and a lot of people even Benjamin Franklin up until suddenly and Seventy five [noise]\nFelt that would be a big mistake\nFor America to separate from the mother country meanwhile his father is in England and his father is still working on behalf of the colonies representing the call his interest in uh in England or against parliament and he's seeing more and more corruption\nIn ah in England and in the meantime the the the English government is sending troops to Boston\nAnd the rest of America in order to enforce these uh taxation laws and he's growing more and more bitter against the of the English government so that the two of them were living in different worlds\nAnd [noise] when it finally came down to the ah Seventeen Seventy six\nAnd the declaration of independence of William was literally on the side of the king of the crown\nAnd his father at that point was confirmed American patriot revolutionary so they just want different ways even before that I think it was a certain amount of jealousy between fathers and sons as sometimes happens tragically\nUm [noise] and um his dad I think it was a little bit jealous of William\nSo let's talk next about this father and son there at loggerheads what happens to\nIt's talk next about this father and son there at loggerheads what happens to William next as he takes his stand the country is moving to war it's clearly ready for war Williams not\nWell first of all his father came home in time to try to talk his son over to the side that eight believe would be safe is that is the side of\nThe revolutionaries and the two had some very very strongly confrontations I'm In Pennsylvania and in New Jersey oh where where his father visited him and he did everything he could to try to get him to come over to the side of the revolutionaries\nBecause that was his side and the family side and William refused\nAnd William I ended up being the last um the last governor to do the kings business in America [noise]\nA stubbornly refused to leave the governor's mansion and had to be taken away bottle am was put into the worst prison in America the ... field jail\nWhere he was in solitary confinement a with bread and water for Eighteen months a suffered terribly during that time I'm finally was released prisoners exchange his father had very little to do with that and eventually went back to England\nAnd they said they're really hurt Ben Franklin I mean hey it's his son and no matter what kind of jealousies might have existed to watch this before this kind of play before your son had to be difficult moreover he's a very public figure and it wasn't as if his son was some wallflower he was a governor who is now in jail how did he handled that\nWell Franklin said nothing I'd ever heard him so bad in this entire life and you have to believe that [noise] and there was a lot of public criticism of him for not for not helping his son out but remember he was the minister clinic potentially to France\nAnd could not be seen as being in collusion with a you know with Atari and so he was a horrible ... it's really a tragic situation a which really is kind of like the um [noise] uh the revolutionary war in microcosm\nAnd do you think he really understood the sun's hardship\nI don't know I don't really think I think that part of the tragedy of the book and what I finally ended up saying in the end is that\nThese were two men who could never reconcile although the son wanted to weigh in on it to more than his father that they could never reconcile because they they just did not understand each other and these are two very intelligent man\nSo it shows you just how extreme of this break between father and son can be bought it happens\nIn in in the end of the father didn't understand the sun but the son didn't understand the daddies [noise]\nI don't think so I don't [noise] part of what a what we haven't spoken about is that at the end of the war we became a counter revolutionary violent counter revolutionary and this his father could not could not ever forgive\nAnd indeed he couldn't end by the way fathers sons stories\nWell they're rebutting always drawing everyone in I mean this is how Arthur Miller made his living selling fathers sons toys packets and tell Bruce Springsteen's made his\nAnd this is as good and his herring and father son story as I've ever read Daniel market obscene loyal son the war in Franklin's house thanks so much for joining us\nIt was ...\nYou know we love to do these stories about history and there's always so often we bring you this days in the history by Hillsdale College but stories like this are always brought to us by the find folks in Hillsdale too and my goodness one of the things I had forgotten to ask\nA Daniel was what the similarities word today to then uh in large measure that populist movement of the revolutionaries well it came about because they'd been felt like they'd been governed by foreign and for a power and that's of course the British Crown\nAnd in large measure today a lot of the populist movement\nMany people believe is because it's a foreign power called Washington DC and many people in this country feel like\nThat foreign power or that far away power isn't responsive to their needs and to their lives again as always these stories the stories about American history\nAre brought to us by the great folks and Hillsdale College and if you can't get the Hillsdale Hillsdale can get to you go to Hillsdale dot edu and folks they're terrific\nTerrific online courses they're on everything and the one eyed most highly recommend distort things out he's the constitution one on

don't have a lot of opinions here in the show we just tell stories and one of the stories coming up we'll be doing a long form a series on the constitution\nAnd how it seemed to be totally Hillsdale dot edu or that's Hillsdale dot edu and again the loyal son is the book\nThe war in Franklin's house and we learn in this story and there was a civil war in this country long before the civil war and it started off\nWhich is a small minority of Americans wanting to fight the revolution but ultimately many more joined many resisted and again many well they just hid hoping it'll pass\nAnd the story of Ben Franklin and his son and his son being and imagine\nThe solitary confinement for Eighteen months with bread and water the most famous of the founding fathers but the George Washington and his son rotting in jail but a story Ben Franklin story his son's story here on our American story [noise]\n\n\nYou hear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American stories it's a special place were

storytelling is always going by the way to the next time anyone talks to you about\nThe constitution or the founders and it seems so ephemeral to you a discussion about remember it was Benjamin

and see how they have to admit he was a great running right everybody you know and it was a great idea because the fantastic and spin off\nGoing oh yeah yeah yeah I mean so route alright ...\nThat was eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox if you want to chime in\nAll right so we we left the last segment saying that the Boston Red Sox are the Golden State warriors of major league baseball\nAnd of course the warriors are the most dominant team and NBA won three of the last four championships the last two heavily favored to win the next one and only they can stop themselves from when and really the next\nTwo or three titles so\nUh they're the most dominant NBA team maybe the best in history and Boston looks like it's on its way we'll see robs right it's not over yet but they look to be on their way to a championship in major league baseball\nAnd their manager Alex core tweeted this out for a little say now this could come back to haunt him even though he's right you got to be careful like you know to hide you got to be careful with talking trash before it's over but he said this on Twitter we live in an era\nWhere suits in batting average to thin with thirty home runs and Seventy RBI is acceptable it's a good season we the Boston Red Sox don't believe\nThat because they they hit us better over three hundred they got they got three hundred hitter I couldn't agree\nMore with him now they don't ignore analytics they use analytics in what we believe correctly it's a part of the equation\nBut they also used baseball instincts and they've shown at this post your would ah brought All right I have the Yankees shouldn't have been playing a coordinate analytics those in a hit the cycle where that happened in in in the playoffs in baseball\nAnd so and even during the regular season they had they score runs they hit their share of homers obviously but they also manufacture runs right\nThey stole bases ... thirty bases yeah hard pressed to find anybody on any team with ... thinking about that right I remember the running around with Lou Brock still over a hundred or used Ricky how interesting they should still a hundred bell my gosh I mean but thirty but nowadays that's a lot\nTheir starting pitching 'cause they don't tell you the grilled on bases\nYeah yeah you know so they they\nCoat traditionally with a a a a you know their eyes on analytics and here's the thing about the Golden State warriors 'cause all the analytic writers\nLove the warriors we I Love the what used to but for maybe for different reasons but they have revolutionized the NBA they have highlighted the importance of the three point shot and now it's a huge part of the game but here's what\nMost NBA people don't recognize we think of the war is that this three points shooting team that just throws up a ton of threes every game guess what rock I Want you to guess\nWhere did this with Golden State warriors rank in terms of three pointers attempted last season\nI'm going to say the bottom half say Fifteen ... very close sixteenth wow\nSixteen suddenly they were actually tied for sixteen\nFifteen teams attempt at more three pointers per game then the team that has Steph Curry clay Thompson and Kevin Durant three of probably the best\nTens three point shooters in the NBA right now\nAnd here's the thing the ... were first in three point percentage but I'm only sixteen thousand attempts that's where they write this year I Know it's early but guess where they rank this year the lower on even lower twenty first wow twenty first in the league in three pointers attempted\nAnd they're clearly the best team and they get a ton of back door lay up off the air movement and they still and I love this they still shoot the mid range jumper mainly Kevin de ... times it throws up his share too But Kevin Iran is a mid range of facts in\nWell let me let me give you this to last year what did it in the a rocket they miss twenty seven straight report right twenty
