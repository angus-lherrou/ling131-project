of Israel did they disregarded God's warning God said they're going to be us nearer to you they're going to turn your hearts away and apparently they thought or it's not so dangerous it's not so bad\nA guide gets worked up about nothing and so they went ahead and ignored God's word and got involved with the chain tonight's who were in the promised land before Israel got there\nAnd again and I did just as God said they would they turned the hearts of the people of Israel the way they became more and more immoral or more and more ... more and more\nOf the then and eventually a godsend okay it's got to stop and the Israelites were\nConquered by the Babylonians the the the people that Judah Jerusalem were they were carried away to Babylon they were slaves and exiles for Seventy years and then they come back and that's where we you know that's where ... comes into the story\nAnd the the people have come back and what did they do the first thing they do is they begin to get mixed up with the Canaan nights again\nUh it says in as rich chapter nine verse won the people of Israel the priest and to leave I had not separated themselves\nFrom the people's ... with their ... nations have taken some of their daughters to be wives for themselves and for their sons\nAnd when as or heard this he was appalled he said as soon as I heard this I tore my garment and Mike cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and sat appalled\nHe couldn't believe it after all we've been to the the conquest of the exiled to the slavery the whole thing we're finally said free from that\nAnd the first thing you do is go back to the sin that caused all of that in the first place and so the people said let us make a covenant with regard to put away all these wives and their children\nSo some of the chain tonight wives or that the Israelites are married had already born children for them they'd been married long enough for that\nBut they said we're going to put the way that is they sent back to their fathers to their families they send them away they sent their children away [noise]\n[noise] well Moses said if a if a man find some in decency in her well these are religious abominable religious practices apparently were and in decency\nA God said they're going to turn your hearts away and there was a spiritual danger there they sent them back to their families\nThat's maybe the the most prominent example it comes to mind of the application in the Old Testament\nAnd it's the mind of the application in the Old Testament of the words of Moses if she find the favorite aside because he's found some and decency in or register certificate censor way that's what that was about\n[noise]\nA Jesus said to them [noise] that is to the ... because of your hardness of heart the Moses wrote you this amendment or gone wrong to discriminate because people have hardness of heart because sometimes there is a\nA spiritual dangerous when God said to the Israelites in the Old Testament they will turn your hearts away they will cause you to send 'em\nThey have heart hearts because you're apart arts\nGod gave you this command Moses their God gave it through Moses ah\nSometimes it just doesn't work sometimes there is\nConstant animosity sometimes there is abuse sometimes it just doesn't work a marriage doesn't work because people have hard hard says God want people to have\nOur dark you know a guard hopes for better things God intended better things and Jesus said from the beginning of creation and God made the male and female and therefore a man show leave his father and mother hold fast to his wife and the two she'll become one flash so there are no longer too\nBut one flash what they're for God has joined together\n... not man separate\nSee this was God's intention when ... when the story of creation stalled in the book of genesis gone looked at the things that you've done at the end of the day and he said this is good this is good but finally guide came to a place where he said oh this is not good what was he talking about he says not good for a man to be alone [noise]\nGod did not want man to be lonely\nAnd so God set about to solve the problem of man's loneliness\nAnd to solve that problem he created a helper suitable to fit for corresponding to complementary to man he created woman and he created a relationship that we call marriage and the complimentary character\nOf the two parties in the marriage the male and female and the nature of the marriage is designed to solve the problem of loneliness or in a way nothing else Ken God didn't create a softball league when he said oh it's not good for men to be alone he needs some buddies all get 'em to softball he\nNo he didn't give them a hunting partner of fishing partner all good relationships all important relationship but God did something even more than that he created marriage and in marriage they are no longer to that's the mystery of the Bible on what could be the Asians says yeah that's a mystery\nThey're no longer to God has joined them together down one flash\n[noise] there is no other relationship in human experience like the relationship of husband and wife\nAt least that's the way God intended it to be that's how it is when people do it right\nWhen people do it to the way a God intended but people don't always do it that way because sometimes they have a hard hearts and sometimes there is faced listen to us that's what is addressed in Malik I chapter too where are the people were complaining and saying why doesn't got answer our prayers\nAnd God says to them that I Am a witness between you and the wife of your youth to whom you have been faceless\nThose shoes your companion and your wife by covered\nLet none of you'd be faceless to the wife of your use for the man who\nDoes not love his wife was divorces versus the lord the God of Israel covers his garment with violence so\nGod said sometimes husbands are faceless to their wives that is they made a pledge they made a commitment that we're joined together they became one flesh but then the husband starts to look around and he sees somebody else who is a younger or\nOr prettier or something\nAnd he thinks a man I'm going to trade up and so he dumps the wife up his use or to get himself a trophy wife\nAnd God's or hate that I hate that baseless and as you made a pledge she has been your companion bike covenant and you'd dumped her to get some trophy wife God says I\nHate that so the command given to Moses\nThat sometimes it has to end that's not a license to be baseless and that's not an endorsement of people having hard hearts\nGod's intention for marriage\nIs that it would be the best solution in this world\nTo the problem of loneliness that would be a relationship companionship [noise] a a union unlike any other in human experience only because people have hard hearts and people are sometimes faithful is that\nA marriage has to end it was never God's intention but\nSometimes it has to be\nAnyway God's intention is that marriage would be a blessing\nTo all\nOur father who art in heaven hallowed be thy kingdom come I Will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread for give us our trust passes as we forgive those who trespass against us\nAnd lead is not into temptation but deliver us from evil for China's the kingdom power and the glory forever and ever amen\nThank you for listening this evening to the Trump the truth please listen again next week at seven PM\nConservative decisions that are a lotta times allow your

quarterback and first round draft pick Brady quit\n[noise]\nSo it's something that you knew had that happen at some point you knew it had to happen at some point\nYou you couldn't believe that it hasn't happened yet almost that it convinced you it was never going to happen at all and it involves an NFL quarterback ... and I will tell you who that is coming up here momentarily here on Fox Sports radio as we can be alive you are from the guy go Fox Sports\nRadio studios were Fifteen minutes could they be Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance visit guy go dot com for a free rate quote\nBrady you have you ever had a buddy of yours who's in a relationship that all you guys are you guys have conversation amongst yourselves and he's not there and even sometimes when he is there and you guys have been having a few beers and uh you you keep telling him why are you still with her [laughter]\nI mean ... like are you guys all you guys do\nIs fight why do you know I actually ah had a good buddy in college and he lived with us for I Want to see we made it two weeks and they would fight so much and it would be all these like late night argument yeah that I guess he was basically staying in the room like across from mine\nAnd so I just walked over when I say there you go to get the ... you you got to get back out I like I often use different verbiage but said you did to leave and he said what do you mean I was like I don't know what tomorrow they'll get a hotel your family's rich go figure it out you can't stay here anymore okay I've got six than workouts\nI'm taking seven hours of class I Can't take this anymore okay figure it out like like cut it off or move forward if you actually ended up\n... wow I didn't ... you're actually going to call a ... like that on the air that is a little bit more calling us from college I kept it was not just um so uh\nAnd and the reason I bring this up is because they'll be situations and maybe they'll break up for a little while but I guarantee you been around somebody where they say a now man this time I mean it it's for good and you kind of roll your eyes aren't sure man 'cause you know two days later they going to get back together\nUm I Am stunned that it actually happened in the NFL\nThat Blake morals actually got benched I didn't think\nIt was going to ever happen I Swear to God you know what happened last preseason right did you have been slashed ... well but I'm like nine days later they started him for the opener\nYet but I didn't think that they would actually have the guts to pull it off I didn't think that they would actually bench Blake portals but there I was watching the Jacksonville Jaguars game which is never a good time and I'm watching Cody cancer and I'm thinking to myself\nWhat happened here like did you really go through with this like he actually went through that they actually decided to part ways mid game was played bottles and ... took over what did you make of the ... or ...\nHe didn't say well I mean look he he you know twelve pass at Sam's put that sign that he was an importer that was it wasn't that wasn't as if there was that much pressure there was some\n... but she just started taking off and try to run I mean he really got out of even just trying to throw the ball down the field at all\nAnd he had a couple of ... and I think the than you'll Hackett they're off as a coordinator was probably frustrated I I'm sure Doug aromas frustrated officer Tom ... has been frustrated where they invest that money into this guy even though they were going to have to pay in many ways that picked up his fifth year option\nUm they invested money and this guy for this year and then the two years after but as you and I talked about not deal went down\nIt was really a one year deal after this year there's no guarantees wrapped up the team could cut him and not oh um anything under the dead cap\nAnd it's a much more tradable contract so essentially what they did was they extended his contract still with basically being a one year deal but the ability to the trade him and get back compensation for him or if they want to have things don't work out after this year that's essentially what they did\nBut he was bad bad I mean and I don't think\nYou like you have you ever watch the Jacksonville Jaguars then you've missed out on him hitting his office of women in the helmet a him making some Aaron throw\nEnvironmental and by the way he's six five All right we're like yeah we're not we're not talking about Peter ... of game of Thrones playing quarterback who's ... is often to fly him and he's six five and hitting is often some limited back in the helmet\nHim um you know everyone throws bad decisions\nUm you know lead against human rushing because he just thinks that every drop back passes supposed to be a draw um that's that's actually what it's been it's been frustrating to watch because the defense they've got a defects that should be able to win you a Super Bowl but he's so inspiring now those guys who can spin\nAnd other fighting post game boy that they're right they were going after each other post game apparently\nOf course because the Audrey Hopkins was won't put up on jail labs like as soon as ... as a planet high level you've really got some issues because he is by far and away their best player on defense that's saying something because\nCalvin Smith is a stood AJ boy is not bad shot Gibson's good with Campbell ... they've got to do and you know ... she was getting beat by Dodgers Hopkins bad today\nI'm a ... by the way I think we did play the game a couple of weeks ago I guess the melt down by the ... defense here on Fox Sports radio I'm almost positive and I think we got that one correct to we did that I think we got ... correct to end the jags defensive meltdown correct so everyone has said it\nWas going to be before the their the Thursday night primetime game I said it would happen before the\nWhile it can run a plus rating when he does it again folks I mean there's nothing this man can't do there is nothing you can't let me just\nLet me run down the list of things the

particular incident that Ronda jammed to proceed aggravated over really really well God but\nThey are getting good snap at the end of the job or some video does it does appear that he may it's battling it was on Chris Paul can can I just said this I think it's good for the NBA of course it is [noise] they need to actually\nGet in fights because they kind of seemed like the ... where you know like they're all going to talk and get really close to each other like they're almost which brings three nothing's each other's ear and then finally find that we actually had some guys land a punch and yell Rondo looks like he knows how to fight a little bit so even more respect to raise Ron\nRon Angela and you know what I said this and and I got destroyed for it but I'm the use an athlete can even speak to this Brandon Ingram has always had this knock on him that he's soft and that he doesn't have that dog in him and you may not like the idea that he pops Chris Paul well Chris Paul was engaged in another fight but the fact that he actually did throw a punch\nPlayers are going to remember that around the league and I actually think it changed the narrative on if you don't have to like the punch you'd have to like the tactics but at the same thing with ... perfect yeah may maybe dirty player he may hit guys when they're not looking or take cheap shots\nBut tell me how many times that hasn't paid dividends when a guy goes over the middle of the ... ... is there that guy's not thinking about oh well don't worry I'll take the hit 'cause he's gonna get fined sixty Kay\nHe's thinking I don't want to get my head ripped off so I actually think it's it's going to end up benefiting Brandon Ingram and it's going to change the way guys play him moving forward I really do\nWhether or not you think it's a a bad tactical disrespectful or classless it's irrelevant because when it comes down to the war of sport um you know class and sportsmanship is is usually spoken of more for when people lose\nYou know it was let's just be honest when when people when they're regarded as winners and whether they are classier not that's not the first thing you think of\nIt the way people lose I think is when people talk about that more so to that point\nYou know people are going to do in that arena whatever they can do to win even if that means playing those sort of mental head games where yeah it might be a fight or an old circulation or it could be something like that but in college football when you got Jeb Bush\nWho's walking through this this team um tradition that Michigan State does before every game she knows it he knows they're going to be out there doing their walk\nAny standards grad and tries to walk right through him to pick a fight if you don't think that that if fire Michigan State up of course but if you didn't think that it didn't fire up his team she may players often stick in this dude is gonna be talking trash the whole time you buy cheap shot me of course that's in the back of your mind\nYeah no I I I think it's going to benefit Brandon Ingram and I think and I was saying that in a weird way if you if you get in trouble like guys getting in trouble together\nGuys are weird man it's like this built in camaraderie you know like if you ever like getting a fight with a group of dude Z or you're you're on the field of play and and you stick up for a lineman you guys are sort of linked and that's a story you're going to be sharing for the rest of your lives they were that one time we got in trouble at one time we did this bill to certain camaraderie\nPeople can knock raised on Rondo for potentially spending on Chris Paul or brand in anger for maybe taking a cheap shot I actually think it's going to bring those guys together cause that's going to be a story there'll be talking about and goofing around about in the locker room for a long time so I didn't think it was that bad\nOff what a what a black guy for the NBA can you believe these guys are fighting they ruined what\nWas a great opening weekend in the NBA shut up man it's or it's people are going to fight stop being so over dramatic\nOkay so did you find it odd that Lubrano grabbed Chris Paul and not as if\nThat's the thing to watch because that's the one that's not going to play well in the locker room not not Brandon Ingram getting suspended for games or or is on Rhonda spinning the fact that LeBron defended Chris Paul and that those other guys is the one that I think it's going to have a\nI don't I don't know that it's defending but I Would just think that it it at all or ... or a fight right your natural instinct right if you're at a bar\nAnd this actually [laughter] so what actually started to give it to ... what are the guys from our crew this past week and and I was thinking the back of my mind um you know if if somebody wants to happen like how would I react in that scenario because you're you're in the spotlight you know there's really no upside down side right\nBut you're you're first enclosure instinct is like that's my dad's my boy he's on my team I've got to protect them and defend him right\nBut that wasn't the case you know it was like the broad first went to protect Chris Paul the pull him out of it was so I don't know if he thought that would diffuse\nThis scenario faster or is it it just it is true colors show through and he's like yeah dude we go on vacations together you know our our family our friends and I don't want to burn disparate so where were you guys pioneer square\n[noise] uh no we're some some sports for like down the gun away from our own up\nMan pioneer square is fun man I'm over\nThere yeah where you're tired or square guy absolutely by the way it did so who is trying to fight Joe Davis who was that I wasn't Joe Louis guy with one of our crew would some random guy got some I I I only got ... again ... ... there was a story and then it was\nPassed along and I was thinking like All right what would have happened if I was there and like there was an altercation you know you ought to be really careful notice\nNow let's go live now to our violence on the streets of Inglewood insider bubble with the latest\nCenter actually okay um I Want to talk about the fact that no one's talking about the elephant in the fight I should say that when this all jumpy ... no [laughter]\n\nI said all of it and I'm thinking MBA player a giant sorry [laughter]\nIs talking about the fact that when it's all went down Lynch the\nWas the one who grab brand name ... voice how she was always the reason this entire scenario\nI Love I Love Carmelo Anthony afterwards also saying you know that that that stuff that doesn't even happen on the streets and you're right and you know it doesn't happen on the gun industry to use weapons okay you know nobody's speeding or throwing jabs they use tire irons and beer bottles\nI mean ... those places probably only come once it's random and then one in the defense is doing allow you the sack you the next time you try to do that 'cause they figure out different ways of rushing you but uh I I think when it's in your DNA like that you know you become and who've I always compare it into right now\nWhat older guy if I could ... to\nOh Joe Montana [noise] no I'm not quite so ... yeah\nAnd so so that's kind of who I see um his cop is and that's where I potentially see this going\nI'm the only difference being that I figured out a better team than Blake was when he first got the Jacksonville and he's got way more weapons and he's got an offensive by the coach who's you know really there to help him succeed so you know if he doesn't make this work\nHe's got no one to blame but himself because he's been giving the keys to all that\nA mat nag eighty coach for the Chicago Bears a step to the podium after the game and you would have thought that they actually won the game heroes coach ...\nThey look close and I just don't go up and I saw um catch the ball and uh I just couldn't tell exactly where he was how he came down with the extra effort was and then you can see on tape or just a little short\nAnd I just got done saying everything that happened to us everything that I just said we we were a yard away from time to a game take that and think about that for a little bit\nNow he's talking about the hell married at the end where Kevin White caught the ball and they got stopped at the one yard line I wasn't able to score doesn't it seem like New England always on the right end of every single play that that is sort of like that\nBecause there are better for those who wish it's amazing I mean the bottom line they're better prepared for every situation than every single other team and they have they been bodied that quota more teams you know lose games than when games they force more teams to lose game and\nThe patriots lost the turnover battle\nThey um they were more penalize them the bears are coming into the game they were one of the day I think last week the patriots I Believe weren't penalize and didn't pump the ball if I'm not mistaken that was that was an actual stats and the patriots a week ago and they lost both of those battles and they still won the game and the score may be seven points\nBut that was not a seven point came down the stretch my knowing them was a much better football team\nThey couldn't get consistent pressure on Brady and he just called them up down the field and by the way\nFor all the talk about Brady not having weapons and and wait to see I don't know what the update is on Sony Michel but it looked like a a pretty significant injury\nBut you could do a lot worse than Josh Gordon Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski to throat who didn't quite a bit yeah you could do a lot worse or the ... I think a Gordon's actually played a lot better than I thought this early in his in his time doing\nWhat he's been good they've got other guys to step up and Chris Hogan I think is underrated but um you're right that they've got some talent but at the same time you know Sony Michel really brought kind of a burst of the backfield has got some speed is a good runner they could really miss him 'cause as good as James what is\nYou know he's really who they like to use and catching the football is the fact that I'm not sure he could take a take on that number one role or the cowbell running back that we saw on Sony Michel like that could that could be an injury that if it's as bad as it looked\nAnd he's out for the season it really could impact them down the stretch\nOr he's ready to go and I'm just not so says Fox Sports radio as we come to your life and the guy go Fox Sports radio studios batten down the hatches whatever that means and that get prepared because live that Jesus is on his way that's next year on Fox Sports radio\nTwenty eight teams theories\nOut changing marching Boston Red Sox running now\nDodgers on new champion sheep coming [noise] we're all over at\nFox Sports radio\nOkay Ben Mallory here this is a thirty second commercial and I'm going to throw a lot of numbers that you would please stay with me and just Fifteen minutes you could say Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance this company has been offering great rates and great service rovers Seventy five years\nAnd any time you need help you can speak to one of their training specialist twenty four seven the company is guy go go to guy code dot com today\nSorry for all the numbers in five four three two one I Am out of time\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side is helping you see veterans rights they knew Michelin premium ...\nDesigned with exclusive smart milk ...

Ninety seven article one they said the founding fathers said and we believe that the Congress the house in the Senate or the most powerful instrument talent is a government because of the best reflects the will of the people\nIn reality at least for the past two years it was perceived Congress AS number one\nIt was perceived the president's number two and they and the court system is number three in reality number one is not the Congress one might say it's the President's Day is the most powerful\nNumber two is the current number three is the Congress the Congress is feckless foolish any relevant and and so what would the founding fathers day if they were transported from Seventeen Ninety seven to twenty Eighteen and October twenty Eighteen and they looked at the situation today what when the Congress is foolish and cyclists\n[laughter] I think it would be amazed amazed but when they studied it for a while I think they would understand why this happened and I think the reason is that the courts have given administrative agency is not the president and actually it's administrative agency which even the president doesn't control given administrative agencies\nSo much authority by passing laws that are very very general that are sort of goals oriented laws and that gives the agency's tremendous authority to make the major decisions that they should not be making Congress should make the major decisions the agencies should only be filling in\nThe details and owned unfortunately overtime because Congress has because the courts have not stepped in to stop this\nCongress has been encouraged to pass these very general laws then they go home to their constituents and they say you see I solve this problem for you and when the constituent complains about some new regulation that's come out the congressman says oh well I didn't vote for that\nThat's the administrative agency and what the what the constituent unfortunately doesn't recognize is that the congressman has to take responsibility has to be accountable for that because the congressman did not vote for legislation that restricted\nThe independent agency in what it was able to what he was able to produce the laws with just two general and what will happen now if the court access I Hope it will add you know\nIs that they will begin to look carefully at the underlying statutes and say this you did not have this authority you know you were not given this authority by Congress so you cannot make this rule that goes beyond what Congress intended\nAnd of course one of the things came up during the um during the hearings and the confirmation\nBrent Kavanaugh a couple of weeks ago was the fact that uh the United States Congress is exceedingly weak and not really a because they're so weak the liberals the progressive want to use the court system do impose like legislation\nOn way the American people because they're so unpopular whether it's gay marriage or abortion or whether it's immigration whatever it is there are certain things that are so unpopular in America and the Congress or foolish in fact was therefore they look toward the court system to be a second legislature\nAnd that was never intended by anybody in fact one might argue to go back to your original point\nAdministrators state is more powerful than the United States Congress\nAnd might be more powerful the most powerful branch of government isn't it is the administrative state something called the deep state that have been in existence for years if not decades and what they want to do is simply outlast as president and outlast the court and continue to exist so it is the administrator state right now more powerful than the Congress\nYeah I think undoubtedly it is it is making the rules that uh we live under and Congress was supposed to do that [noise] um and there is a way to address that and as I say and I think it's the courts where to step in\nAnd uh read the statute as they were written by Congress that would be able to say to administrative agencies you have gone too far and to the extent that they do that\nWe have some control over the administrative agencies and the effect that will be to force Congress to begin to act because if what the administrative agency has done is something that the American people would like\nAnd the courts have said no you weren't given that authority by Congress the American people will then go to Congress and say we want\nLegislation that does this um if it's something they didn't like then Congress won't be pressured and the agencies\nUm will will not be able to make the rule anyway but the point is we're a democracy\nAnd in a democracy the people's views should prevail and that's not what's happening and the under the current law system\nAnd give me an example and the four or five years ago\nObama was saying look I'm the president I'm not the grand potent than I Am not the dictator I cannot give dreamers certain rights to be in this country because the laws against that by by the time a president or run away president in my view Obama was a runaway president when he came to legal immigration\nAnd it just created new laws out of a ... that had nothing to do with the Congress and by the time that gets up to\nThe laws out of a salad there that had nothing to do with the Congress have all the time that gets up to the United States Supreme court and takes one to three years to even get there\nAnd in the meantime the dreamers have done what the dreamers are going to do and you may like or dislike what Obama is doing but at the president is set that through the eyes or ins\nThe president can do anything you once why why can't the next president doing anything he wants in other words it into substance it it's a rule making ability of the administrators state that ... that have been they've usurped the power that Congress\n[noise] yeah well you're you're correct as long as the courts and I'm here speaking principally the Supreme Court\nDoes not act one this is the Supreme Court lays down the rule yes I'm a that says this is the we are going to be reading\nStatutes as they were written a then it gives all kinds of people who are who would like to challenge administrative rules or even presidential decisions an opportunity to go right into the district court and get a ruling and what we've seen in the last\nYear many times is district courts have been making rulings against the Trump Administration and the reason they are able to do that is that the Supreme Court has not has not\nPlaced any kinds of strict limitations on what the court can do in fact what the what the Supreme Court has done in this so called Chevron case the central he said to the to the court you should defer to what the administrative agency\nAnd interpreting their own law yeah and that of course has given them license to do whatever they want\nYou know it has to stop I took home your book last night to read a ... page Ninety four\nI don't you have a chart beginning in Nineteen Ninety three which was not a long time ago I made like twenty five years Clinton was in the White House doing what Clinton do the White House but uh Nineteen Ninety three there were four thousand three hundred and sixty nine or rules forty ... rules which you know\nNow is a lot well and twenty Seventeen\nAnd the cumulative final rules publishing the federal register as a hundred and one thousand three hundred and eighty so it goes from forty three hundred under Clinton\nDo one on one thousand three hundred and eighty and it's like ... at the right at three to four thousand new rules every year and by the time and other ten years go by it'll be two hundred thousand rules\n[noise] well that's entirely possible the way things are going right now of course the hundred thousand a hundred and one thousand to kill me and that that number since ... since Nineteen Ninety three right um but yes it will continue to go on three thousand four thousand rules in any year\nBecause there is no discipline on the agencies right now because of this Chevron decision will Nineteen eighty four and because there isn't any a ruling from the Supreme Court\nThat says Congress cannot pass to the agencies its own legislative power that's a violation of the separation out of power in our country\nI Want to share of the American people on on the thought on page Ninety five you say one recent study found that the cumulative cost of regulations between Nineteen eighty and twenty twelve which is what a a thirty two year period reduced American economic growth by over twenty five percent\nWhich amounts to annually Thirteen thousand\nPer person in America annually and so this is gigantic it's huge it's growing and the only entity that can really stop it and the president can't stop it that Congress could stop it but there are photos and feckless individuals the only entity in the world that can stop it is not a state Supreme Court\nBecause can you imagine our economy twenty five percent larger because the ridiculous rules and regulations Jim another fact one one thousand three hundred and eighty it's now October twenty Eighteen I assume another three thousand rules going to go into effect\nSo unless Brett Kavanaugh and other four justices said this is unconstitutional it will continue well we got her on\nAnd Peter Jay well as in the book judicial fortitude the last chance to rein in the administrators state and Peter thanks for coming on the bill Cunningham show and you're a great American\n[laughter] that fact

River Falls parlors you a way last week picked up a huge when it gets world to get some started that home\nThey do get them started home they don't play until Thursday that went to a gets underway and other problems will be at home and they will get a team they beat relatively early in the air match I was able to get a chance to do down in crooks and that and I probably will get the pirates and that'll be Thursday evening seven o'clock at Lincoln high school brick house\nAnd a nice opportunity for the problem is seniors get to play at least one more match at home this season the or the winner of that game will travel on friday night\nOf this week to plainly rosel rams the number one seed in rosel\nUnless of course Begley were to upset them they'll play roe\nI guess that's a you don't think Begley can have a win at all and Rosa okay\nIt just for a technicality though on Thursday the host would be high seed so badly were to win it would be in the river falls if the for faulty cooks than for that matter of crooks and be the verb falls it'd be engrossed in a bag Libby rosel but the odds are you're saying Begley is not going to win\nI I think the earth might open up\nA let's just say it's a long shot a long shot Enron was was pretty good you write so I'm more likely if people were falls wins Thursday they would probably travel the road and he said friday night friday night seven o'clock yeah uh when they're would put them to seven o'clock game on Tuesday night at a sight to be determined at this point I don't think we know that size I don't\nKnow because they say it depends upon who's still alive\nAnd on the other side or the bracket wouldn't be a either like number two Holly number three D. G. F.\nUm couldn't be coming out of their uh otherwise world\nOr east Grand Forks the other teams like [noise] so ... in action on Thursday night in volleyball so there you go that's the volleyball set up ... said turn our attention to what we are very busy\nNight coming up tomorrow night in a football action we're going to carry it\nNight coming up tomorrow night in\nA football election we're going to carry that out of the teams that we follow in our immediate area on on the air we there's six ... six games that we would like to try to carry we can get at least five of those in\nWild at the time change for several of these games help 'cause a lot as far as coverage goes because we were able to get a few more games in than we probably would have been able to get in had some of the\nTimes not changed okay let's start with nine men then sorry and eight nine ... number one Steven our gal to Kelly north on three kids who got a central for his ... northern free seven like in the woods aid is one Alberta lost all yes how does that set for tomorrow\nOr I don't put the how to sex for tomorrow one plays eight to ... nine or two police evidence on and so forth Steven our guy will be at home tomorrow against the war in our law so that is one of the game\nTime changes as a that game will be a\nNow eight five o'clock game tomorrow evening a genius or it's a memorial field which means that they will be the early contests are kick off in our pre game coverage on the river falls radio sports then we'll come your way early with game time said for five it'd be bought for thirty five maybe even ... before that for a pretty in\nWayne will be rolling by four thirty Eli guaranteed it maybe new and we'll start at noon tomorrow marks or anything you want to make sure we get everything in along ... we'll all five o'clock games even our gal worn over the last ... in our guy and that\nGame will be on North Country Ninety nine three and we'll follow that on Ninety nine three with another game from that same a section eight nine man has kids have got any federal northern freeze will go out and head to head and ... and we'll have that game for you as well coming up but in action on sort of on Tuesday evening hail\nAnd and that's three versus six three the bear cats are in in how luck hosting the six team northern phrase freedom more competitive this year when they have 'em and kitchen kind of an up and down story they they started the year real rocky they settled in and started playing well they get that'd be towards the end a really kind of an up and down whoever shows up on his team\nType while the loss of being really cost him um or or or they had a chance to battle for that to see\nAll I don't I I think so too I Believe so to a shot at it but nonetheless they are three and they will host the northern freeze a also good range curricula Wayne or at seven o'clock will be hosting corporate conduct\nAnd they will have that game for you I Believe on twelve thirty Katie arrests\nAnd uh that game will be in good ridge are the chargers elites season loss also that affected their final seeds or or they were in a battle possibly for that number two seed to\nUh but that is the other half of the bracket the winner of that one will get Stephen are guile\nOr worn out would also be most probably Steven on Saturday I did talk with a with Kevin ... you know the activities director up at a Stephen ... moose morning just to let them know we're coming to the game and so on and so forth and he said that they have opted for the two o'clock game on Saturday if they went\nSo the number one seed gets their choice of the two o'clock in the six o'clock game and they have opted for the two o'clock game on Saturday afternoon\nWhich they have a number of years\nThat traditional and I told them we kind of expected that but that but that is what's what they've opted for so that's been confirmed and then the other half of the racket wouldn't be the case of the northern freeze winter against ... you're always homeland of the woods in a game that we played in Keller tomorrow evening\nAll right um and and again the winners move onto a Saturday or the afternoon as you just mentioned the evening a guess depends on high C doesn't it\nWell it'll be the second game will be at six o'clock right but we just don't know where it regardless if the seeds hold up it'd be a killer it would be a jet Kelly\nOr if the seeds don't hold up and the reason I just throw that in there because we don't have any but Kelly or we don't see them all year we don't get a really a chance to to gauge this team\nAlthough leg of the woods I think as struggled this year had they not do they have all Joe I'm there to insects going in so it would be at at a tough one\nMore than likely than Keller but that'd be and then of course the winters will be the Fargo to all twelve thirty in the first of November right yes that's correct okay so that's nine men action and the coverage we have as well on nine men in a a eight eight Wayne we're going to follow red lake county the rebels\nYeah would have been nice to have been able to cover to cover both rebels and badgering little river but a red lake county ended up winning the three way tie breaker Whipple county west and uh\nAnd also with ... yeah a really kind of in the best record at seven and one of the three but the three hit all beating each other and during the regular season so it came down to the tie breaker formula and and red lake God he wins a director formula so they claim the number two seed they will be at home that game will be an ugly\nAs they host red land they will host red lake\nSix o'clock start right in the the indications are that a\nBad game will happen AOL always some concerns air because much earlier in the year this year when red lake opted to forfeit the bedroom with little river\nA stranger things have happened ah with the ... but they were\nAmenable to the changing game time from seven o'clock to six o'clock\nSo that for all intents and purposes indicates that they have every plan an intention of playing that contest and and being a part of the action coming up on this tomorrow tomorrow evening\nGay and ... by the way the number one seed and and have been for a number of years a very strong team and that so everybody's got to go through with the building\nA year and the vet and could be a monumental\nTask effort like county does when a tomorrow they would play a Saturday Night at six o'clock at high speed I Believe right\nYes so which you've really got he wins would be that would be able to to\nSee how would they switched to read like falls go from all I Am wide rally falls I Am not asked\n... but I Believe that's correct yeah\n[noise] um and and if they were to win too then on the first of November like we mentioned with the nine man\nOr the championship ... played at the ... is that the last game eight o'clock eight o'clock is always the last game now gay so they would play in the last game they're All right a load on land in playoffs that let's go to a three foot ball and that is a deep river falls ... living in an extremely tough year this year\nHere early in the year so we say it's all kind of happening pretty quickly alright I go on on the road for most of most of November and most of December they don't play a lot at home in the in that sequence of time\nRight moving on to talk about the Vikings here a little bit and the ... the NFL but first I wanted to know to say I didn't bring up a uh the pioneers north of pioneers ended their football season since our last sports muggy show I was a scoring fast it was a turnover trashy turnover dating game I guess what the coach say on Saturday\nHe was frustrated with the lack of focus more than anything else but like she and I talked about on the year um [noise] the trick for coaching staff and and sometimes you can figure it out sometimes you can't even how to get your kid to focus in a game that means nothing 'cause the game and zero\nBoth teams were already locked in their playoff spots both to Africa and the and north when uh the game had nothing more than than bragging rights\nOr if they were to meet again they would end up meeting again in the state final which would be on a neutral neutral field because of pioneers or at home for both of their western division games in the opening round so in the opening two rounds of the western conference champions\nSo uh they were locked in to play at home for the first two weeks as long as they keep winning I'd Africa was locked into their situation as well as ... as far as position goes for the post season and it was just one of those kind of ugly floppy games too many penalties too many turnovers all things that will be addressed between\nNow and next Sunday when they play okay that's this coming Sunday right and wrong on from one week from yesterday okay so they place Sunday what time one thirty and they at least that's what I've been told so far okay so scheduled right now for one thirty game this coming Sunday and who did they play\nA Minnesota west again the team maybe just few weeks ago okay in a wild one that was fifty five or fifty six thirty six something like that and the wind means that come back again the following Sunday afternoon all the games are Sundays and uh and when they're put in like the is it like this kind of like the state the championship championship then and then\nEven when they're ... could possibly means some damage to the ballgame most probably yes All right\nSo they still got a few games they certainly could play yes which is pretty awesome ice ... said twelve forty two Katie are if if you have a question comment that you can text us on a piece at ten mark ... is our number while you're on north one stuff mhm uh the volleyball team plays at home this Friday and Saturday\nBut game times there have been adjusted a little bit\nBecause on friday night they're hosting section volleyball tournaments at north London mhm so are the game on friday of the three o'clock in the afternoon contest K instead of an originally scheduled six thirty game because they want to give room to given up on people in and out before\nThe high school people started showing up camp and then on Sunday they play a new or Saturday I mean they play then okay so us a friday afternoon and Saturday afternoon yes and they'll ... they'll play and their season they've still got a those are the Lionel secular was or their final conference games that right now they fit in to spot\nIt's more likely we're going to end up well depending on what happens with the final two conference games yeah I mean if they weren't leneghan both of them it would create a different situation for thought when they when the two what should we be way up and the two spot okay that's kind of what we're thinking there ... which means the following week they would go to central lakes the regional ...\nAll right I'm very good pioneers of we talked to a high school to talk to college or not we move on to the ah the pros at solve forty three Katie I read the Vikings played yesterday in the NFL or they pick up a when a and I'm feeling exceeded a hundred yards for the seventh yep straight game\nAnd as you know good for Adam Adam's having a great year and that's a that's a good thing a kid that was pretty much a\nNonchalant it out of high school and maybe even more so out of college\nEnded up by going to the Vikings and open an open tryout making the team and now a if not their number one receiver certainly than than their top two things this year he's been the number one you know I think ... I I I think he's the number one anyway because I think you can do more things and stuff on biggest can\nMean big say primarily use the euro long guy\nWhere the Lincoln do a lot more possession type things and so on and so forth which I think makes them more value in my opinion but a good for him I mean good for out\n... I'd like to be honest the two of the the better there's a a a good\nOne to combination here whether whether whoever you want to look AS number one where there's the letter digs there are two receivers on the same team they've got to be one in the top five in the NFL I've\nNot looked at the overall statistics but that we get pretty close they are I I Would think coast there I mean they're certainly got him\nTo run and do you use used your Smith who did the Pittsburgh I better doing quite well you've got the two guys out in the in Los Angeles for the rams lash\nThe undefeated team at like seven and all I think\nYou know and they got it done without one of their top two guys this weekend Cooper ... out but they were able to win again without him\nThey picked up another when um the uh here's on the saints are only one loss on the air and they beat the the ravens yesterday by one\nBecause the extra point was missed at the end of the game yeah I did I fly out of it is a Tucker\nTucker who according to the numbers had never missed the point attempt never until\nThis game and it came down to tying the game at the end it was either the final seconds right a regulation well yeah but even if even if he ties it um then you run the risk of the saints wanting to toss and Drew Brees throwing another touchdown pass so certainly but I mean because he ... he threw his five hundred ...\nHis first time he's ever Mr point attempt yeah you know couldn't have been during when they're up to you know leading and my three touchdowns couldn't it have been earlier in the game is anything but\nThe ... the game or the game played in London yesterday was decided by one because Tennessee one for two and the when instead of wanting to tie and didn't get it\nCharges one that gap or who are also doing very well I think they only have one last one or two hundred to last a they played all you're a Chicago Bears\nAlso they one or two hundred two laws are they played all your ah Chicago Bears or it could have done anything on special teams after they beat New England they didn't came close but did not be doing\n... killed them they they gave up by a kick returned protects down to the former Viking ordeal Patterson and then they also knocked the ball out of better since hand and end up scoring did they not bad but then they all ... let me finish in but don't they didn't they they they did cause a fumble yeah but then he Patterson okay and I'm not that one\nRight [noise] such wash\nYeah they did eventually went off at ... but I'm Talking about special teams stuff now my life you will ... will start talking about how this law so fighting schedule at all especially if you just said special teams that but I I was saying the score on a special teams play so I had\nTo come back on the score core Darryl took the ball back for a touchdown okay and then the other time they blocked opponent picked up the ... block ... so to special teams ... but\nYou don't even like the ... yeah yeah and they and they picked it up and walked in and scored the wasn't the ... coming back on the score and they leave scored on those special teams plays in both occasions if a if Chicago stops either one of those it's a tie\nAnd as it turned out that they came close anyway they've completely left Hail Mary pass the little one the guy just couldn't get the ball extend the cross the line or to to send a thing to do overtime or it might have\nBut ah Chicago I if I did some things and we'll begin to get some things well I kind of went back and forth between that game and the Viking game or throughout the afternoon\nA New England or I thought played very well especially when you consider that their top running back guy got hurt right away Sony Michel got hurt early in the game and it's and neither is the question is whether he'll be back or not\nHe certainly Mr remainder of that game that was a big blow for them\nOr injuries right now are starting to stack up for a whole lot of teams\nAnd his late ... and that is say that is changing the way some of these teams approach games ah you you look at the you have to for the Vikings and the jets I think the jets were missing three of their top five defensive backs\nSomething like that now I don't know if they beat Minnesota anyway even those guys are in the game I was the better team they were but it does affect the way your game plan\nAnd it does affect the way the opponent game plans against you or depending upon your injuries my bigger question would Minnesota is a wheel a TV as Murray has been playing although he did not have a great day yesterday I\nHad a couple of good ones he scored a touchdown on it was a thirty some yard touchdown\nBut he only had like sixty yards a whole game and you have thirty out on the one ... ... um the they did not run the ball merely as efficiently as they did the week before against Arizona of course has more though of course it varies on it so that's part of the reason and again I think their game plan change with the with the New York having three D backs loud\nAnd three new faces and their defensive backfield how that changes how your game plan but what I was going to say use\nAs well as ... has played if and when delving cookie is given the okay does he get the football or do you live ... but cook did play yesterday he was out for the game according to everything I saw\nA thought he ran double according\nTo what I saw and what is now before the game was his number because it came up as a fantasy football announce but that he was in\nA side to side too but I I

down there at staples Centre Saturday against Washington and the bench and but\nThat wasn't me or\nThe la Braun obey shouldn't when they first announced him at the game was big there wasn't any bowling because it wasn't as loud and boisterous as I thought it would be\nIt was the but would you agree well it yeah I Would agree with that but here's the thing remember during the national anthem\nLike toward no they show it on the end they showed him on the big screen and that was allowed to that was bigger than this year he got when he was introduced I thought it was so big that he drowned out the singer but but\nThey did did you agree that that was bigger than the introduction it sound like it but I was surprised when they find the way that he was the last ... or just trying to find out\nThat you can I Do I Need ... crazy during the national\nFrom asking you that's why I asked you I didn't just take it for me and I do that all of our of first things you can stand on there so that's what you guys when I came away didn't run much version of ... well\nAlso scored twenty four points one twenty two shots but we'll get to that I Would say\nHe has not played that will not you know I play by Brian James he can play well play well now and he's averaging twenty four I ain't going to have an ... it's All right he's playing well but by his he has not been the best player in the world\nNow for not at all how not by a long shot All right let's kick it off we got so much of a first as welcoming the odd couple crew as we always do because you know what Chris we wouldn't be able to do this fine radio program without him of course Rob GR producer\nAlix our engineer of course anchor Deb cautious who keep you updated throughout the show and I in turn Sean bail all on the other side of the glass Chris Broussard so let's kick some ass than this one day it is the odd couple and a large our men\nAre with the camera also in here with us or hanging out and we'll see stuff on a YouTube YouTube periscope not periscope Facebook all\n... everywhere where you can catch video the odd couple will be there so you definitely want to check that out and Rob I Want to get\nYour reaction the Dallas Cowboys lose again yesterday on the far west three and four I've that division obviously is still very much\n... or ... yeah I was up ... and I know the red skins are leading it but it's they don't have like the eagles are struggling gave up Twenty one points at home ... up in the fourth quarter\nYeah nah I hear you I mean Dallas obviously had a chance to win that game but they still clearly think they can win the division and they're clearly in when now mode otherwise why do you give up a first round pick desperate\nFor receiver a mark Cooper desperate now you know he's okay that looked ... does it become a probably because they're best receiver didn't stay in a whole lot\nIn saying what's on the plane he doesn't get you to another level in my opinion\nBut but this is as before we get there Chris if you're the cowboys and you'll run in the organization when they decided that they didn't want does Bryant and when they decided that written that once they realized Britain's retiring due date they knew they had to replace that position\nCome on seriously or whatever they didn't they didn't know they were kidding themselves ... whole way through so now you get desperate now the raiders or having a fire sale and you go oh my God he's available or what it will take and and of course if you're John ...\nAnd um [noise] uh the waiters GM um McKinsey regimen can take that you'll take an emerging hello pay what you say a first round pick a he's on his way\nInto her that that should have been a third round pit I'm\nPacking his stuff right now as we speak that much McKinley agree that's what I Would have said so so I think the cowboys are desperate they just keep looking at it saying what are we missing what don't we have we need a receiver they they they just uh they they botched this whole thing this whole season was botched\nWhen they lost two receivers that they counted on whether or not they still thought does was an ... number one or not and then when who as old as he was ready to retire to go to the broadcast booth which still productive player that that you got that that you lost\nSo you lost two guys and you born in a couple of guys who seven eleven and it didn't work out I mean seriously Rob I was saying he might get you a big gulp but they're not getting in touch down\nI said during the spring when the talk came out that they might get rid of the day they might cut him I said look\nUnless you replace them if you replace him because he's not a number one I said look offer him less money trying to bring him back on less money and see how that works but it never I never thought that they would just cut him and not replacing\nCut he may not replace them that they made no sense to me he's still if you were there today he\nWill be your best receiver plain and simple\nAnd you you now you give up a first mapping 'cause he was the gears\nAnd that's what's so bad about it when you say that\nIs you know they were dog and him saying how how he was and this was in that\nBut there's nobody else who stepped up on the cowboys no a methodology let's just be honest not at all of our fence they had the big blow\nAnd and obviously we saw a wood Jacksonville that or if it wasn't just the cowboys that you know anybody can score numb and beat them now yeah so so it wasn't that they didn't they didn't fix anything they come back the next\nNext week against Washington a struggle offensively\nThey all go eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox eight seven seven nine nine six sixty three sixty nine give us a call\nIf you want to join the odd couple and share your opinion on this trade\nBy the Dallas Cowboys was it a move of desperation they got to you like it did they get robbed should've been they offered last a lower pick do you like what John ... is doing with the raiders or or what he's clearly I mean he can talk all he wants to about I'm not saying now is he going out there\nThere are so many things that go was to give you some information who\nAre you and what are you doing these numbers twenty four seven three sixty five\nWe trusted voice that make you smarter feels like you've never met with you're

matters is October [noise]\nThe world series begins tomorrow on TALK of streaming on Fox Sports\n[noise]\nYou're listening\nTo the ... roofs are ... you buy discover card discover treat you like you were ... we saw\nThe show talking about the cowboys and they gave up a first round is twenty nine theme to hopefully for a Mari Cooper wide receiver who they hope can strengthen they're receiving corps\nAnd even also Rob give them\nAn idea of what jak Prescott can do I think they feel like he doesn't have any weapons as far as receivers so let's see what he can do with a decent receiver and see if you use the guy that we want to\nKeep I think some of it is now it's starting to look at okay is that a guy we want to keep going forward with the are franchised quarterback or do we have to start looking for somebody and that right\nBecause you can use the excuse of not having any body you know what I mean he's a wise not doing it the real quick my nephew Albert his listen or serious okay in New York\nRead the top three lawns you just ticks me off the top three law by here\nSeven eleven joke was funny so he might not have you thought it was more than that of course he's going to
