I'm a big fan of combat sports so I'm very intrigued and excited about your first fight now that I saw something that say it might not happen is supposed to have been November ninth in Casper, Wyoming is it all set is definitely going to happen\nIt's looking like it's going to happen then but we still got a couple of\nThings to find the lives um you know I'm I'm hopeful you know I Know that a lot of people it already afford to pay per view on the fight has been promoted already people bought tickets to see that come and they'll look at people wanna see we get busy you know if he wants to get down so uh you know and I want to put on a show where people are just what is the thing to have\nHeart now you're fighting former him in may athlete Mike Burke and um look I got a bare knuckle fight the man that sounds treacherous like what may why bare knuckle fighting instead of boxing or even him in may\nWell it is I'm not going to feel it ... it's a little it's\nA little more brutal but you know I'm I'm trained with a big eyes you know because the last several years man and I'm just getting in there my first one with\nSomeone loses a better ... better brown games um you know I feel like I'll struggle especially when you've got somebody that's been doing it since they were care for that that's the thing different divide black by the grab a fair show the past Melton and let's do a lot of I Will do\nThe right thing going to be in trouble\nSo bearing not go is it just striking or is it also any you know the other ours wrestling things like that\nIs just it's just like you may have just a box of rule with no kids no need for all falls on the ground so\nOdd the learning curve mayor for me was was a lot faster on the other box and on and off for for a long time and getting a trained for that so it was a it was really just picking up to the technique that man and the and in the face and I'm having some great far harder than some of my coach's job or a train I Would um\nWould just fortunate who was also a matter of fact I was trained her so that's why I've been up for um a bearing on very cool and LA for my uh uh last eight weeks of for FICA\nSo Sean please help me I just got one question\nWhy you had a great football career you're on some of religion you got a good look you're a handsome bravo y to put yourself through this why are you doing this\nWhat you gotta look bad if you look at the last\nThree years it's always been out there for me taking the fight that was that was going to happen um gossiping about you have two thousand Fifteen is when a when I when I wanted to say goodbye and that kind of put it out there was um it was public banned um a couple of things fell through with some other league\nAnd nobody really steps of the play like I thought it was and you know there are no co pay morale and I said man let me let me let me do this because this is something that um I've been wanting to\nDo since I retired and they're quite frankly man I mean you know if what advantage you know being a at my side in this race and and me being able to have a trainer partners are have over the last few months\nThis um look now I'm looking to put on the show I Know that people want to see what I got to offer and in the fight game that you know I'm going out of business what\nDo you remember Johnny Morton a former a wide receiver for the alliance he got into the ring other former football players have gotten to the ring and gotten knocked out none her God does yeah you got destroyed in a in a fight oh you are you ready to live with that if if it doesn't work out\nYeah I I Can't you know that half of the man that is total an experience I mean if you look at more of your money that we want to be talking about a football player transitioning into a five game this there are the festival guys right now but we don't talk about the oil it's talk of the guys got what\nWho tell me give me successful guys I Would like to know who your\nPersonal Walker foreign ballot for in a I Believe prize Herschel Walker had you know three or four no I'm a bunch of us who said you know they got who got right now I'm a former linebacker to play the Alabama\nWho's going astray with ... and you know what the people like ray cardio not look like a hell of a fighter fall but that that's also Pfizer that's if that predicts that opportunity I'll definitely weren't very hardy as well so uh I I look at the Knight or going to be a big night is pay per view\nOr my first fight on to go to the type of youth and act for them but I Know I got you know ... ... because you got that around for a long time he's knocked out kids sandbox you'd be some people also um you know I I noticed fight as well because I Know you know I'm happy born handle had him up as soon as I got to do\n... are there any plans to move from vis some boxing or I think you're smart women may I mean I think John anymore and that's what happened to ... ... if I just wouldn't recommend any box or eat\nI've been ... ... it's I just wouldn't recommend any box or even or or certainly a a football player anybody who hasn't been trained in wrestling in jujitsu and all those different arc that are part of him in may to get in the ... the guy but do you have plans to move on\nTo boxing or him in may or you just want to stick with bare knuckle finding\nWell most of the land I mean look I'm you know I always do the opportunity presented themselves that I was going to take the fight\nAnd that's you know I've been out there the last three years um and you know just a learning curve of doing that is my youngest Southern California man this is the mecca for him and may guys in you know just I've been around these fighters in may some of the best fighters in the world\nFor the last you know Thirteen Years of my life um yeah I've been in fight cancer for a I work with you guys just don't work for them and I would say it's not something you try to do the right people like oh you're trying to fight and I'll let you go ... or you don't fight\nSo all you know when I made up my mind about six months ago\nThat this is going to happen on the last three three and

I just love our NBA network I'm always\nLike that's not for you to say I'm an I'm ... I'm I'm kinda with you I Am and I'm this greatness all the people determined that it's not look brought and you're glad you don't have to say I should be up there\nThe people who determined that enough people watched you they come up with that that just should should never be the hours\nNow the one exception that we we all know and love is Mohammed Ali\nNo but that was different Floyd Mayweather is actually the ability to what I what I thought that that was like a part of the the selling of boxing\nI'm the greatest you know what I mean like I never knew what part of a stick in a lot of people didn't like you know before that we didn't like like my father\nDo a lot of problems in life by most blacks want him to get his black not to have you talked to any bragged any posted you right let's see back that up especially once he stood up against the Vietnam War that's when\nPeople started love right but you see what I'm saying I looked at that more of a shtick rather than\nA on the greatest boxer and I should be you should put my picture up what you should put me on Mount Rushmore\n... brought up and get too carried away with that you don't have to say it when you're that good Chris you don't have to say it all the people will say for you it just looks cheesy that that you're at you're trying to convince somebody no one should have to convince you should have to convince anybody on my\nTurn around and I'm kind of surprised that he where no matter how you feel about him saying he's great essentially I'm just ... like by tweeting that out he puts himself above Kareem above Colby above shack\nAbove magic above ... now like you said I think he's the second best player of all time and I believe you do to why don't we have done that but for him to come out like Michael Jordan I don't believe has ever say he's the go out I talked with Mike about it I never as hard\nTo determine why this is off the right like he did that for a story he's just told me you can't it's hard to compare errors like you have to come out like you know yeah I'm the guy what\nDon't you appreciate that that even Michael Jordan and all his greatness ... ate out there like yo you know I'm the best\nPlayer and you know what I'm saying you let other ... other people say that\nIt is I Wonder how a cause Coby Coby ... we we deal with the name of his name in there I don't think he went this far\nBut he did put his name out there give us a call eight seven seven Ninety nine or Fox eight seven seven nine nine six sixty three sixty nine [noise] what do you think about this you know the bronze basically throwing himself in the conversation if you want to defend the ... I guess you could say\nHeck that's what everybody's talking about\nHere and just like everybody else they're always talking about me versus enjoy so that's why I'm responding to\nWhat it doesn't mean that you have to put yourself up there I just think that's for other people when you great it's it's an unspoken you don't have to say anything people will recognize talent and put you in the proper place you know what I'm saying\nI'm with you that's certainly you know what is more polite but I I I'm not gonna kill me because I don't kill Mohammed Ali\nBut I just I don't have to I may well I think all these different what you're saying now but I in reality it was the ... I think that's one of the box in like you know but I'm not saying he\nWould put showmanship like you know like he was he was different with the with the ... Howard Cosell and putting himself out on ... street to get noticed but\nIt will remember where it is I I'm pretty one already I mean he only ... what what I think yeah I mean I don't know if you end up as a kid I watch I watch I watch him so\nWe all love him by the time you and I were really watching him people that accepted the shtick no like I don't know what I mean I got it right I I ... at the ... the bottom line is is not that much different\nI think there's a little difference\nI let's let's go to Neiman in Montana welcome to the a couple of naming\nWith the guys that love your show I listen to it all the time that is your um the only dude from Montana that\nOh he gets a ways now she'll by calling in and lift that we we love Montana mess right\nYeah heck yeah so really quick about that LeBron LA thing and I want to ask the question wrong\nI think being a Laker you got a lot of expectations with the Lakers have had and being with Ron he's got a lot of expectations right now it's not living up to it it's all\nMaybe is it the Lakers fall maybe but he's trying to live up to these expectations immediate fire and out um so yeah he might get a good view now my question about the brunt of the cut off topic but if you take the brunt of them born and raised in the game\nYeah 'cause the commercial was basically making fun of the conversation on didn't initiate that discussion and I was\nAt different interests or somewhere 'cause obviously like you couldn't say well Jordan could have been talking about Coby or Kareem ... because he said the numbers are the same so I feel you on that definitely legit point that's what was your point\nYeah so like you said you know if if you wouldn't have twenty three maybe by air represent twenty three that's clearly a job with Ron day on the same thing in the comment I think ... or said that uh our our ... years ago you know so\nYou know I ... I was just saying that you shouldn't have to put yourself or talk about yourself and not like when you're great other people will do if we does make a fair point though 'cause you\nYou go again we can't make it vague and say well my could have been talking about any of the great players because he did say and I know he didn't we know he didn't write the script now I Know this say they have the same number that can only mean ...

there [noise] [noise] yes [noise] okay we'll do a little more homework is yeah there you go now who comes up\nWith the tricks I mean was it Houdini does that make him a genius for being able to come up with this or did he have somebody on staff like you who would say here's this trick\nAnd let you do this and we can make this and that how did they do this easy same what's called puck Copperfield to I assume ... people on staff like you right\nExactly exactly um James Collins when the guy that Houdini the built all of them for them but Houdini would say I want to do this and then he would put it in the ball in their court and then they would have to come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the human genome they walked in Allison out everybody sees this thing lumbering in ... and then they shrouded in er cloaked in or something and then the trick began I it's absolutely amazing wasn't the queen there at the time\n[noise] uh well he probably the same queen that's there and

years of his life got a letter from him just before he died off seeing bishop pike on a ledge when he was trying to go over to comb Ron in Israel and that's where they found him\nA question for you or what we what year did archer forward bring back the code to Mrs Houdini\nThis was in Nineteen twenty nine\nIt was a three part code or the code was the middle section first word was Rosa dollar rose and then he had a code for the nine or words spelled out believe\nAnd then she had Dr words in French which mean I pull the curtain back like this and that's what she told him so he was a shirt that his code I'd gotten through now didn't he she later denied that later on\nA after she loses her friends she loses all her money a man a called Edward fate\nComes into her life and says he's er manager but they live together\nHe fell in love again yeah so he didn't like that and that's why you wanted to come back\nRight she meet women the same kind of way that there's a lot of things going on here but he's like Twenty years younger than her [noise] ... you\nPromise to her that she can make a movie and she'll make a million dollars\nOkay go ahead\nOh what year than they cheat\nDeny that the the code was correct well the first time she never denies the code was correct uh she says she was full\nBut she never denies that the code was correct but she first about a year and a half after um she they're given the Houdini messages she having lunch with some ladies in Miami and she she said she was hesitant about a\nHoudini coming back because why didn't he favor from the depression\nSo she was she thought that Houdini would somehow favor from this math depression that what's happening or that somehow he was going to come back and not breakfast with her every morning or something I don't know what she was thinking but she wasn't happy about the fact that\nUh Arthur Ford was on tour somewhere so she had no way to contact him and so she was you know\nShowing your just pleasure for that then Edward St comes in later promises or a million dollars and then they go on and about eight years later they make a movie called a a religious racket chairs\nYeah he made a ... a a couple of movies at least to me\nWell Houdini made four or five movies\nYeah but they also all they do they do well\nUh they did fine but he was he was the star of of every movie\nWas he like an actor or were they more like documentaries\nThey he was an actor and he always had like a really really good looking co star\nHis real name Eric Weiss yes\nHe was he was a pretty good looking guy too\nI just kind of a sudden muffin guy he was only\nA and everything kind of a smooth sleuth talker could really give a a ... compliments really well but he wasn't the greatest actor but he used it to promote his escape so we had a bunch of escapes in ... all the movies\nReal name Eric white some\nHank yes and that's Eric turned into Harry and then who dating he got from Don\nAnd he had it and I called in Houdini and er so to this day they call them Harry Houdini but I don't think he ever a switch his name and he was born in Europe and he wasn't born here and he was\nHe was born in Hungary\nYeah he was

A. M. H. A. I. N. but\nIt's pronounced saw when someone and who's who did that um there who who who celebrated that well there is it's a it's a Christian holiday of Halloween because the Celtic people are had an oral rather than a written tradition and does so much about the life of dirt roads and traditions of the Celtic people had been last Halloween\nThe evil ... we do know that all saints day was moved from a thirteenth coincide with cell in which was held\nAround October thirty first to November first do it started off that anybody takes Mansour I'm a ...\nOkay okay I ... I I'm I'm Still there okay rose zero next one\nUm what is how low\nElements holy doesn't it a holy person yeah say that about the only person one day or all the person you're good you that a boy graph leads you already that you've you're on your way\nAll right okay I'm In this can be tough but but you take a shot at it um the last\nLowered expectations are Saudi lowering the expectations are made last Halloween that had a full moon was two thousand one in what year will the next full moon occurred during Halloween\nTwo thousand twenty seven mark\nWe'll never know if I had gotten to write I was so confident when I said that I and I thought you did but you didn't stop\nYou kept going it was two thousand twenty that's what I meant I feel a little two thousand twenty dashed says I've been on the seventh time I sat down and that's what I was saying and it's all about communication you're I mean do you do hear earls trivia this morning normally do okay then I can use is on you [laughter]\nWhat item and this is funny what item is banned only during Halloween from twelve am October thirty first to twelve pm November first in Hollywood, California\nWhat item is banned for Halloween in Hollywood, California area there's even signed up 'cause I looked at the science says I'm I'm a thousand dollar fine thousand dollar fine\nFor use of this item between twelve and looked over thirty first at twelve pm\nNovember first what is Carmel apple [noise] that is so close ... what ... what is popcorn ball ... I'm ... I'm expanding my answer you are just not even right but how silly string silly string\nOh it's mostly don't want prank and they're they're well evidently the horses would slip on it the people would slip on it and then people throw the cans and use them as weapons and it hit people and then at Cannes would go floating down into the bay\nWhat is wrong with people on believable so and it's it just it was actually incorporate it I was reading two thousand for two thousand four is when the law went into effect in Hollywood, California and in ah\nHollywood, California for at least at least during\nI didn't even think there was silly string anymore really well you have grown up all over you need to grasp all as a kid routes again I Need to be a good point [noise]\nOkay let me in a and go down just a little bit here um 'cause that's real tough one and and what do you want to go on to the kids questions or something like ... it's not really fair settlement ... says Jews from the five and under search here say the guessing when you do in what two countries was ... the tradition of dressing up in costumes\nAnd going door for our door to door for food or coins for Halloween most popular and what to countries that have become most popular going door to door to for food or coins recalled guiding\nI'm going to say like Ireland and Great Britain\nOh and Wales and ah Scotland\nAs you did see there's no question I Can't get right if just given time and enough opportunity I'll get it all you do it I'd\nScotland and Ireland or the top to the other as a you mentioned were right there too so\nOh okay I'm In what country was the first written account of children using the phrase trick or treat on Halloween and what country\nWhat country was the first written account of children using the phrase trick or treat on Halloween ... got to be America and in the United states wonder ... if you'd get this one\nOh a Norway Mm oh a not thinking ...\nCanada what what do you say Canada I mean\nHe's an awesome you were very good I was going to start with Canada I always thinking North America which is why I started out with United States but I I was just my thought process central part of it yeah and then you will find right can is absolutely right or the youthful tour mentors we're uh at back door and front door demanding edible plundered by the word\nTrick or treat to which the inmates gladly responded and sent the robbers away rejoicing they gave me a term Olsen here you\nGo get outta here [laughter] outta here you had said to the most in it\n[noise] um okay uh let's see in in what decade in what decade I'll give you had there was a Nineteen hundreds\nIn what decade did trick or treating as we know it today started gaining popularity in America of marijuana to insurance here [laughter] uh I you know honestly I'm going to think it's around the depression so I'm going to say post depression Nineteen thirties you are so\nRight oh ding ... good what is that grant for everybody else and zero tech wind nothing else right while there were mentions of Seoul Lincoln guys going to USA earlier than the thirties it wasn't until\nThe mid to late thirties and we're starting to see the phrase trick or treat being used in print and usa and and the kids going out trick or treating controlling\nYeah good ah actually funding informative somebody did get twenty twenty though somebody did have the twenty Twenty one okay that can have the one out and drink [laughter] well let's see if I did well here's a case of this isn't serious serious one how many children have been seriously injured or killed from plays into candy\nGiven to them by strangers during Halloween\nHow many children have been seriously injured or killed from poison the candy given to them by strangers during Halloween the new food not include Walt Disney movies right zero\nI'm ... and the evil part I don't like the evil part I don't either so I'm not into the whole thing yeah I'm I'm One of those that I don't believe in the in the ghosts and the the people to talk about the paranormal and I don't believe that yet at the same time\nThere's probably something evil out there and I don't that ... eerie to me to watch these evil shows\nI think you're right I don't think you should mess with that kind of stuff like the ...\nWe're right on the same thing I I feel the exact\nSame way you don't invite that kind of stuff into your life if you don't put out the you know if you don't put up the freak flag nobody's gonna know under the freaks are going to show up but that's what it what it is you know and you don't invite that kind of stuff into your life and I so I don't like the extras as I've seen The Exorcist once and I thought after I was I thought that's not right for me to do that anymore and\nThat's that's one of the ones I'm thinking of when you're asked about what I was thinking the actress is just it's kind of wanted all the grew up in the seventies eighties or whatever it's kinda one of your first films that you thought holy cow yes is this is scary I was awful that was awful\nAnd of course you you have the Halloween and the friday the thirteenth movies series and the saw movies and whatever I never got into and those are really at all but those were I think it was it was it didn't have to be Gori and all this like ... yeah the guys was\nA just a scary Amityville Horror yeah somebody's evil things they did did a scary\nAmityville horrors based on some of the writing of the same people who the movie the con dream and the ... and all those were based on\nBut those you know I like suspense I mean I don't even ... us okay I don't want the Gore I got no interest in that but the suspense free like going [noise]\nAnd then all of a sudden they show up I mean like the the Halloween the original Halloween and seventies when Michael Meyers steps forward into the light and you can see his mask and then goes back into the darkness knew a\nGuy tell you something about Halloween yes plays Jamie Lee Curtis does the same thing step sons that second she well she kind of like she she kind of strikes back at Michael Meyers on ... and she she eats you see Michael Meyers standing there\nAnd all of a sudden you see Jamie Lee Curtis come out of the dark and see your face and then boom you see your face go back and it's like a turn on that and they have one or two of those turns\nNot Jamie Lee Curtis she was in the original I Believe that she was Nineteen Seventy eight and then she was in one it was a little glass or a couple of ... all one or two ago yeah it'd be her third one the shoes and Ryan Leaf so she was in the second one too because there was a remake okay there was a remake right away and Donald plans was in that one too\nI Can't really remember the story behind that one ... though I don't know if I don't know that was a long I mean I watch those shows originally\nWhen they came out probably like at a drive in you know in the early eighties right right okay\nUm six eight one twelve thirty and you want to share a favorite Halloween movie or a favorite scary movie that we should have mentioned to people because some people their tradition as maybe watching a scary movie and maybe they need a little hint tonight and on what movie they should watch tonight\nTo celebrate Halloween as a family or ... or whatever I got a hint yesterday uh for one of my friends who said the conjuring was probably the\nThe scariest the best suspense of that whole group of movies\nThat came about like the ... gone during there's like four or five of them is that the ... really funny or is really really scary\nBut I was going to say how Barnabas Collins on dark shadows remember that that was like a soap opera a scary soap opera ... didn't wash dark shadow very often but I remember the show I just didn't watch them very often Darrell did my older brother Darrell did so I'd have to watch it to or else I'd be like standing on the side\nAnd I'd like to get a little bit of it and that's enough of that and I go out into the other room and come back and ... there's a Barnabas again easier creeping meal may ... some some some like a I'm a ... um\n[noise] the early uh actors that we're a ... but them oh or or or if not\nMore as Carl off work ... hours Carlos was one of those early actors there was always one of those creepy actors they could play a great creepy part you know now I was one of them\nAre one of the one of the movies that just thinking as I pulled up the song the worlds of London yeah the the movie where walls of London was crazy scary was ah and that's one of those that I I don't wear ... I don't do that as much evil as it is where we'll share you know so\nThose ones are scary at that that would that one was on the the one of the better ones I could think of in the past couple of decades\nPlus the um the special effects in where rules of London and I remember when that came out there talking to ... everybody's mind because there was so wild I mean there was just I mean when when they faced threats coming out of the guy's face the nose\nAnd everything but I don't know I just get out ahead of me says and if you and you always wonder why don't get it why are people I was standing there watching you know like okay this guy is turning into a wolf you know ... why would you sit and watch it when you come and gone now you could have got a great jump on him\nIf he would have taken up right away yeah and why run towards the cemetery and you know when you could have run into the car or something and I'm getting my shirt and that\nI think a lot of times the characters and scary movies don't realize that they don't have to run faster than the vampire or the werewolf they just have to run faster than their friend\n[laughter] he did with them that's right and make sure that you have a good pair of tennis shoes on France yeah we're going to wrap up our Halloween talk with Graham Allison and just a moment Mrs are all the lunch program on TV or\nBut my program on keeping\nShop locally back this is your chance to win one of two big monthly prizes or cash on this vote if we see you out shopping\nSmoke you'll have a chance to win a sixty five inch for K. smart TV from budget in December we're giving away a large author ... pro resort fish out from under do hardware Hank to enter dressed up by one of our shop vocal sponsors legend sporting goods store oh engrossed candy store\nNorth lens chiropractic pause letters and hurting shoe store\nShop political and everybody when president by the river falls radio\nFootball's on TV I watch it\nWhen I'm watching there's only two things they will get mad at my recliner and one of those trip to the buffet table ... always includes grill bras and hot dogs on village hard fought at halftime we bring up a huge platter coca sandwiches made on country hearts multi grain breath right here in the Midwest\nCountry ... charts bread and butter always fresh and delicious\n\nPleased to hear Carmen ... once you to relax now you have any reaching automatic water which manufacture the complete mine of course in lifetime watering products to the highest against industry\nRecently water systems very long term investment which will pay dividends nobody dumping inscribed saying why are you paying for replacing the phone call them ... running water without the APA\nIn the back by reaching can you\nTell your farm minimum headquarters in one night when the phone\nThis is congressman column Peterson spend my great honor to serve you in Congress the constitution says my job as you listen to you the people of West from Minnesota and make sure that your voice is heard in Washington\nAnd that's exactly what I've done what our party was moving too far left I helped create the blue dogs and we passed important laws like welfare reform that requires people to work at a saves you the taxpayers money now the Democrats are moving left Republicans are moving right\nLeadership so both parties aren't listening to the people\nSo I'm asking for your more to do what I've always done work with like minded folks to cut accessed regulations underpass commonsense laws that helped Minnesota families by doing this with veterans health care new opiate law and I'll keep doing it\nBecause I refused to be dragged down into these ridiculous partisan fights so I'll always be a blue dog and do what's best for west from Minnesota\nCongressman Collin Peterson as independent as whacking Minnesota I'm calling Peterson and I approve this ad paid for by appears in Congress [noise]\n\nDirect mini storage and the ... says many family owned and operated business for over Thirty years providing personal business end commercials storage we operate shape insecure storage facility with access to your items twenty four hours a day\nOr online options allow you to manage your personal account from the comfort of your home twenty four hours a day seven days a week\nWe offer a variety of different units sizes to comedy your needs whether it's to rid the yard of seasonal items buying or selling a home or maybe your home or businesses expanding we have the variety to sue your needs\nWith competitive rates in long term discounts available you are sure to find something that is a bit for you\nGive us a call ... to one eight six six twenty six so poor poor visit T.

time I thought hey kids here I'm going to guess it was probably we're right in the early on the immigrant and yeah we didn't do\nRight yeah and maybe oh ... maybe even because of the the immigrants who are trying to escape or you know some some bad countries in case they have a baby here and then they the baby wouldn't have to be sent back if they had to be sent back for some reason\nWas making like World War one area or something like that well one was the one who was the amendment added yeah that's what I'm not a lot of historians here huh I'm ...

Eighteen sixty eight sixty how OK yeah there's quite a ways away\nSo ah quite a bit before that this is a civil war thing basically as well as [noise] but um oh yeah ... this bond out of the civil war you know um and and having to do with a whole group of people that was not considered\nA citizen of war and now they work and how to deal with that but now people\nAre using this as a way to just get their kids into the country you know you come in and have your\nBaby here that baby now becomes a citizen that's easy way to get 'em in\nYeah and then the of course people are like we can separate the parent you know now that the the parents there we got to come up with a new way of allowing them to stay here because the baby is naturalized yeah\nDo the easy way sure as they're just not a to take that away\nSo then what would the but there's an easy process to get there but the easy solution in theories is don't allow all day and the baby if they're born in America to become a US citizen\nTo take that out and you didn't you run you take out all the callers on the line\nOkay feel free to just talk you don't have to bring in the no [laughter]\nCallers said over thirty other countries have birthright citizenship [noise] so I'm not a guy who they are out according to wonder what I've found either you know according to the story which\nIs from uh the ... news service um it's a\nIt's is that this country's the only one so what do ... here's here's what it means a according to the Pew Research center\nThat's about seven and a half percent of all births wow three hundred thousand or naturalized ... become us citizens because we're born in the United states and their parents or not\nThat's a bunch of babies yeah and that's a yearly that then yeah yeah and so three hundred thousand birds per year now out of that though there's probably some people that had like working visas who are either yes or E.

concerned\nWe don't have to spend millions and millions of the hundreds of millions of dollars go on the record and doing all this we just need to come up with a better way of keeping people from coming in the country illegally\nAnd then we can have the spin this as well and that but that takes care of a lot of the the underlying issues such as we as yeah if you actually protect your border control the border and you don't have to ...\nYears in court and tied up and try to get a casual was it a three quarters of the states in America would have to ratify it as well yeah it was three quarters of the ... states yeah so ... you know he introduced this into in the was it the Senate or the house a seven yeah in the Senate\nAnd the proposed legislation to amend the constitution he's gonna have to win over two thirds majority of Congress and then three quarters of the states yeah so you're gonna spend a lot of money a lot of time you know that can be used for something else just

the glass Chris Broussard let's kick some ass on this so Wednesday afternoon or funds for\nRadio yes indeed it's so much to talk about but Rob it's obviously the beginning of the NBA season and no surprise that the Golden State warriors are lighting it\nUp everybody we we all say they're going to win the championship and went before the season started what do we say Chris that they probably\nWouldn't need like a two players get hurt not want to or not to be a law that's how good that he may not ... not that long it without coverage you know what I'm saying not so long he\nGot hurt you certainly would give him a shot and if staff or clay or ... and got her yeah you'd have to give him a shot right and I'm just a handful you right to do with our jobs yeah we'll see well that's what I'm saying right um but yeah so they're off to a great star in three of their their three top players are three\nTop stars have turned in already historic performances clay times in just a few nights ago hits an MBA record fourteen three pointers in a game I Believe you score fifty two points didn't really even play the fourth quarter\nAnd um he broke his teammates Steph Curry is record for three pointers I think it was Thirteen staff of course for fifty one points a week or two before that maybe a week week and a half before that\nAnd Kevin Iran in the garden where they're recruiting him to New York good luck with that uh he out scored the Knicks by himself all it was the fourth quarter within a twenty five to Eighteen or something it was a close game going into the ... it was right and we might even been time but it might have been hard right\nOf going into the fourth and then uh all of a sudden I remember asking Jason Smith on the way out what's what's the score what's\nGoing on as he's in New York fan the camera wire bragging about why remember\nAnd then he goes a he said if you had the warriors a modest twenty you're in good shape [laughter] and that's why that being a liberal\nTurn them they are just toying with teams and ah\nIt led to this\nDiscussion because ESPN dot com our former colleague Brian ... wrote an article today on the website\nThat talks about Steph Curry and his greatness uh it's called Steph Curry is the ultimate one off and that was a quote direct quotes from two time and VP Steve Nash at one of the things that when wars brings up in the article Rob and this'll\nMay shock you they're only eight players in NBA history whoever won two MVP awards or I should say at least two MVP awards and at least three MBA titles I'm not ...

what's the thing is they didn't win some sort of me but look at the list\nEverybody on that list is a certified top ten player of all time and Steph Curry is on that list I mean the other seven are certified top ten players of all time and Steph Curry\nIs it but he's on that list and I'm telling you and this one thing the article brings up too is there's a reluctance I've heard this for years there's this real luck since the gifts Steph Curry his do I believe staff is the best\nSmall or below the rams player of all time my whole\nLife I've said it was either they or they have any ideas as he goes to you gonna get you give your points and I'm going to shoot them down like I got a news the up here I is going to be simple Steph Curry is the best\nSmall below the real player of all time no
