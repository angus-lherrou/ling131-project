one I got\nA he was afraid of heights and his wife didn't know it [laughter]\nSo the [laughter] ... they came one day when a to meet up with this balloon is out in the field\nAnd ah he was scared out of his which split the he fought through it and they went for a ride and here's the guy or to try to keep the balloon as low as possible and the guy kind of went to them and said\nYou let me know when you get really uncomfortable and he said there were about five hundred feet drifting over this farmland and more land\nBut\nHere's what happens which is really a unusual they got to a point in their flight there were other people in the gum Dole or with them by the way it wasn't like just him and his wife there were probably a five or six people in their [noise] they got to a point\nWhere the pilot of the balloon lowered the balloon over a wooded area\nSo that the ... was scraping the branches\nAnd they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know trying to grab belief off the tree and all of this\nThen he'd lifted it back up again as they made it across the next field\nHe did it once again he lowered it down and they just moving slowly along scraping the tree top and they all started cheering now he said you'd think they won the lottery the way the people who are carrying on and it's gone Bola [noise] but\nHere in with their big foot comes in when asked scraping over the second series of trees that was bordering a field\nBusting out at the tree line as the balloon is guided along gliding along comes this big foot he starts out walking quickly looking over his shoulder\nAnd the guy said I Swear he was looking directly at me everybody said look at that and one lady snapped a picture of the thing\nThey kept quiet and you can't control the balloon this fellow said that after this thing think took several you know very long and fast strides walking it hit the deck on all fours and took off he hid it looked like a racehorse at the Belmont\nRace you see that's unusual isn't it\n[noise] well I I mean you know I've heard of this I I have a story in one of the books that cold along came a spider where these guys were hog hunting so here we go back I told you I had some accounts of ah feral hog on\nThese guys were hog hunting\nAnd they were sitting in a field or coming up on dusk waiting for the songs to come down out of the trees that were already some out in the field\nThey were in the tall grass and the grass was sporadically patch in other words there were clear areas and areas of high glass of grass working away around the field they saw what he described as a furry\nArmy how might sticking above the grass that's what they were looking at all these shows like this\nDome of black for they were watching this thing\nMoving through the grass in spurts similar to like a spider wanted most quickly and stops\nMoved quickly and stopped finally they catch this thing\nCoursing and opening between two patches and it's heading towards the hogs that they were looking at which was still far away\nWhen this thing came into the opening he said it looked like a ten or twelve foot long spider on four legs with the head sticking up what they saw was the head\nIt's scurried into the bushes or the or the grass on the other side making its way towards the Hodge and as they were watching this thing it's going up\nAnd one that stood up they knew it was a big foot and this thing made a lunging leap like Superman dive\nOn to one of the horns some type of quick movement on the ground and left the field with

weapons they have well\nHere's an answer your first question no I'm unfamiliar with the uh two big foot in Pennsylvania [noise]\nUh but I have a number of historical accounts one of them was quite an ... interesting uh that came from a photograph taken from a a a grandparents' house after the ... final grandparents had died\nIn which was depicted a work camp in Virginia at the time uh that was set up a\nAfter Roosevelt pet established the uh the protection of the parks are they needed to start making eat grass and access to these parks and structures so people could go in there and stay\nIn a bathroom facilities in ranger stations so they had assembled\nThis civilian core\nOf workers and these guys were in ... basically roughing it in the wilderness in these newly protected uh a wooded areas that were to become a national parks and they were regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men\nAre in fact the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men one of these things came into the camp and tried dragging wanted demand off of is caught and the other men attacked it throwing a handout taxes\nAnd grabbing guns shooting at the thing as it ran a out of their uh encampment now but\nThe odd thing is about these things [noise]\nIt seems that shot gun fire\nHas almost no effect on them are in fact in one account called the pheasant hunters this guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards so we're both barrels of a seven and a half lead\nShot and he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch or in answer to your second question\nAbout a big puts being shot or in my account called the bullet this guy was hunting and um I think was Idaho\nAt any rate he came to an area or in the woods where he was confronted with a mountains in a ridge line on three sides in front of him\nAnd he ran across what he described as a ... made out of stick he said this thing did not randomly formed and in fact there was nothing about this pine forests that lent itself to having this quantity of sticks in branch bows oh bows and branches formed in this\nType of thing any inside had about a two foot deep layer of branches as well as well forming what he thought was like betting so this'll thought was that\nHunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was shown that change on this line that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing a dark figure standing at the ridge which\nAnd the place he was now seeing a dark figure standing at the ridge which started to charge in his direction down the hill\nNow he estimated that this rich line was about a Fifteen hundred feet above the valley that he was standing in and he said that the ... that this thing was running down the hill was impossible for a man to do\nOne thing broke to the base of the ridge\nHe estimated now that it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at that time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage am one car being\nAs it got closer he leveled the fight on it and pumped around over its head\nThinking it would scare it it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movies when that\nThat the cyborg or whatever the heck they called the Terminator robot was\nPosing as the police officer and how he was running relentlessly with the arms pumping and like nothing could stop them even load is gone fired a second round added he sure\nHe hid it it had no effect on them and they kept running he fired a third and fourth round and if things kept coming at him now was closing in squeeze the trigger on the fifth bullet which is why it named the stories of the bullet and it finally drop\nAnd when he walked up on it he got closer we shot it with another round he got even closer to and he realized the thing was was not moving in that it was gone and he left it\nWhere it was now here's the thing George first of all this guy shooting this thing in self defense he's in\nImminent danger or\nThis things coming at him like a bat outta hell he's shooting at this thing and the bullet seem to be having having no effect on them and yet when he saw it lying on the ground he conceded that had been wanting to do was multiple blood patches where these bullets had actually hit it but why\nThese things can go now we all know if you go hunting if\nYou don't have a moon shot or in Al Gore deer if you don't get a good long shot or heart shot some type of solid organs shot these things can run\nAnd hunters to lose their a quarry not being able to find it because they can go for miles or you know they can just disappear on you if you don't get a good shot\nBut these creatures\nIt seems like to me if you going to take one of these things down it's gotta be a head shot it's got to be in the neck or the ... or something ...\nMuch sadly then you have to take them now well I mean what are you going to do George

thing for the veterans alright\nLove and twenty nine of Casey are if that is a our first part of the show coming up and just a few minutes we're going to be visiting with the actually an air who's

this morning ... good morning Dave\nI'm market burning\nWith our news [laughter] that's what I did I catch you napping or where I where you have any intention to a news story\nMake spears and all rich Ryan while says and Michelle Westerman [noise]\nAll right I'm big school board races in that a lot of\nIt is it's interesting because the last time I did the debate um I don't think there was there was only those running for the positions and and no more things are all\nOn opposed I Believe yeah that's right\nYep so a lot of interest in the school board and certainly for the city council ward three which of course was uh what Josh egg in a blue as the war in three\nYeah he of course resigned here uh just recently and uh so he was so he's not running so it's wide open and that's a for a new candidates and for that position yeah that'll be interesting [laughter] now the order that you just told us to is that kind of the order they're going to be starting tonight uh as far as a a addressing in the debate\nThe order that I listed as far as um where you just to do this and yes that will be right but the candidates will be mixed up a little bit so there'll be\nDrawing rights and I kind of draw straws to see who goes first and whatnot yeah which is always interesting but so it'll it'll start from the top and the the national uh through the state the county the city and then the school board that's right okay\nAll right now I'm limited times and it's it's it's try we try to keep it under strict timeline do it because there's the because of so many candidates\nOr we want to be able to give a each a lot of time but at the same time we don't want to give them any more and and keep things moving right yeah\nExactly so I'm mayor Homer is going to be our time keep her tonight and\nDistrict ... yes [laughter] and we need that to clip along [laughter]\nFor the most part I think uh I I've been to a number of these debates we've had him a few times or that the er at the Carnegie\nAnd uh most of the time the locals are pretty pretty good uh watching the uh the time and they are good it's the guys on the national or state level but kind of ... and you can tell their tuition polish because they try to stretch the time on it [laughter] yeah and that's probably true\nAll right again that so she was going to be live on K T R F on AM twelve thirty Ninety three point three of them will have it live on the air and uh and and Jake is going to be a videotaping it so we will be playing it back on or you can check it on our to our Facebook page I don't know if he'll get it done tonight after the debate\nOr if it will be tomorrow morning but a chance for those it either can't here tonight or be there tonight they can always catch later that our Facebook page and yeah that's going to be a great opportunity will definitely share that that's awesome okay now um as far as people if they want to come to the debate is open to the public correct\nYes it definitely is um so it starts tonight at six o'clock and it's at the Carnegie upstairs\nThat uh you have a nice comfortable chair to sit in a there's limited space I think there's room for eighty\n... eighty ... is is about right okay\nUm now if you come there and every seat has taken the stand in the back or you can again goal is another radio or watch later ah but if you want to get there it's is it starts of sex and we would like everybody if you're going to be there to try to be there before six rate\nYeah we'd really like to start right on time just because we have so many candidates going tonight\nAnd would not like to see any disruptions either so I Hope that they can be there in ... in your seats be before six o'clock right yeah exactly you know if there's time give can will they take questions if there is time a lot of their war what\nWe argue and I plan to have an area in the back where people can write down a question for a candidate and then if we do have time at the end um ... the moderator will decide if if they want to ask any of those questions but if time is limited we won't be able to\nSee and that's the thing with so many candidates I Know there's people that want to want answers to some questions and and sometimes it just there's there's so many so many candidates and not enough time to get to those questions so we when we won't be able to get to all of them obvious got last year was ... I think if I remember a lot of people turned in questions in the\nYeah it was quite a few people on the moderator just had to go through them and maybe pick a couple and that's\nKind of all we had time for last year so the grand Nelson will be moderating this year and a grand has moderated a debates before uh he'll do nice job as a his questions just walked finalized to looks like some good information I think the big thing is just to you get a feel for the candidates don't you when you hear about\n... you know no matter what they say in their answer\nYou can kind of gauge uh a candidate with the with the responses catch you\nYeah I definitely think so it's it's really interesting and um it's extremely educational and like you said just listening to them you really get a feel for who they are as a person and and how you feel about that\nThat aren't um again or if you if you're going to come that I Do a come try to be there before six going because we are shooting to get underway at six o'clock exactly and and uh I I Do think that this was going to be something\nThat we don't get started six um and ah it'll roll very next and there's one little lunar mission I think there's like a five minute individual intermission or something yeah\nWe have done that in the past so there probably nice to do that again just\nIn case it goes well like you mentioned Ashley there there's so many candidates which is a good thing um but it could get a little long so they may do take just a little break a chance to uh to break it up a opportunity somebody else to get up and go to the bathroom or go get a cookie or coffee or yeah or you haven't ...\nYep I just went out and bought the cookies right before I came here\nA little bit of my dessert for the night so [laughter] um and it's and it's such a beautiful setting too at the Carnegie they're\nA very nice shutting 'em it's let's say cozy a quaint very nice um and and I think the years we've had a glass or two years ago was probably about\nAnd and I think the years we've had a I think last er two years ago was probably about the fullest we've had it it's it's been just about full every year but I think last year was almost standing room only I think wasn't it\nYeah I think it was there was a few people that stood in the back and wait until the cut open\nNow and we we toyed with the idea about maybe moving into a different venue but a talking amongst us we just kinda felt this was the way to go and and and I like I like your decision to to keep it here because I think you have a full house um you pack as many as you can and if if somebody can't say they can you stand in the back or they can they can turn on the radio but\nI'm really provides a nice setting there I mean in the room that you have at the Carnegie is very nice setting for this type of a debate yeah it really is a beautiful um building and and it's nice to have it there at the fresh air and I'm up sound system and who's taking care of your your son you guys have a sound system there I think does help to before in the past are\nWe doing this sound system but I'm working out with ...\n[laughter] ... and we're working\nIt through so that we have a best sound we can at the Carnegie and on the radio\nAnd for our Facebook viewers afterwards too so I'm either way you will be able to hear on that's the thing I mean it's nice to have the microphone because for those that are little hard of hearing something can hear better with the microphone but you can almost it's almost to a point where you can sum it allowed people who speak louder you can almost hear without a microphone so yeah it's that's another reason the nice setting mhm\nWhere we're at orange is tonight and it starts at six o'clock sharp please do not be late if you are planning on showing up for the debate find a seat and being your seat before six o'clock because we'd like to uh\nWell we're going to get going at six o'clock sharp and are they at least that's the plan right now and we don't want any interruptions so try to be they don't come walking at ten after ... six or something like that would we'd appreciate if he didn't because if somebody's talking um they've got enough to concentrate on on mayor Homer who's telling them thirty seconds or minutes or whatever\nTo be able to keep it in a time limit that we don't want to have to pay attention to people coming in and out of the building if possible so tired or anything else actually\nYeah I wanted to add one more thing so this year or something new for the event is that we have candidate profiles on our website so if you go to ... chamber dot com slash can that debate\nYou can see all of the the candidates and their photos as well as the answers to some questions that we asked them\nA little bit about themselves and then some of the issues that they are most passionate about something other really good way to get\nTo know the candidates a little bit better K. so again to find out this information they go to your Web site and they are F. chamber dot com slash candidate debate okay and\nEach one of the candidates or on all levels or did you give everybody an opportunity more what is is everybody did it ... I should say or did some not\nSo everybody is on there except for the U.S house of representatives Detrick seven\nOkay everybody else though was that did give some information if they did that's that's great I think that's a great opportunity for those at the ... meter can't be there can't listen right away or whatever maybe later but when another opportunity to get information on the candidates right\nYeah exactly and we'll keep that up until the election so people can do that later to\nOkay great uh check it out on a a ... chamber dot com forward slash candidates debate and you'll get information there that's awesome and you know what ... if if you are planning on going to the event and and the EU printed that that might help\nYou to follow along if you don't know the candidates I think a lot of people know the candidates but I Know there are some people that will be showing up that uh won't know who\nAre who is who so if you bring they bring the paper with you it might help you in a kind of getting acquainted\nWith the the different candidates and yeah exactly All right very good well you have the heat turned up 'cause might be a little cool\nI Know I hire fire [laughter] we can turn that on and then it gets too hot for the candidate so I figured turn the heat up all the candidates make them sweat a little bit [laughter]\nAh it's a it's a great opportunity to meet the candidates I I actually have so much and we'll ... we'll see this afternoon we'll get all set up this evidence that they were ready for a great event and I appreciate it\nAll right sounds good next Ashley\nAshley now hosts were they the ...

[noise]\nCelebrated for his brave exploits and favored by the gods\nAudi was all these things\nBut as to the part of ancestry it was far from divine\nHere's Joanne matter and author of Audi Murphy\nAudi Murphy was born on June twentieth Nineteen twenty five and he was born in a little town called Kingston, Texas his parents were sharecroppers and um that means that they picked cotton\nIn fields but they didn't own the fields of fields were owned by someone else\nAnd in return for working all day got was a a little shack to live in\nAn a tiny little bit of the money that they are and everything else went to the owner of the field the house they lived in ... no more than a little shack it had no running water no bathrooms no electricity they had twelve children altogether and as soon as the kids were\nOld enough maybe four or five years old they went to work in the cotton fields with their parents or the later said that he just worked and that it was a fulltime job just existing in fact\nWhen Audi was born his mother Josie couldn't take time off to take care of the baby so she put them in a baby swing\nAnd took him out in the cotton fields with her father his name was and that and and that\nHe was pretty lazy more interested in in gambling and having a good time and the only time they\nGot any meat to eat was is already and his brothers went out and hunted them

now one point things got so bad for the Murphy's that they moved into a railroad boxcar\nWhen he was Thirteen Years old sided with the family and he never came back so now what he had to step up and be the man of the house and in order to do that he had to quit school so he never got farther than the fifth grade\nBut the person that was hardest hit and the family was his mother Josie and in Nineteen forty one she died of pneumonia and he said early death is not unusual in the story of a share cropper family a particularly when the share cropper himself runs off leaving his wife to take care of their children\n[noise] anyway so what he was only sixteen he had younger sisters and a brother to take care of it and he couldn't take care of them because he had to work\nToday were sent to

always wants to become a teacher [noise]\nWe want to become a teacher [noise]\nI was very fortunate um and it was by and city I met a woman here at Marietta College I had moved here from Washington DC with my husband and I just had a new baby and I had previously worked on Capitol Hill and loved it so I was moving from being a full time professional to a full time mom and a small\nTown and I was in ... friend and I are struggling to find my identity and when I met her she was the new head of the department of modern languages at Marietta College so what\nShe after talking to me and finding out that I had travelled studied abroad and my dad was in the foreign service and I but then to lay in Argentina and I live in Brazil and Central America and the guy that while on duty as how to do and then in Africa and in Spain\nOkay so she said you you can you teach an adjunct class Richard Donner per class base as\nI said to her I I I didn't go to school to be a teacher and she said you know many people who go to school to be a teacher or not the teachers [noise] she said you have all this life experience when you just try\nAnd Dr Jay did teaching in college while she was getting her master's degree in teaching and jade has continued to bring all of her amazing experiences right into the classroom [noise]\nAlthough it hasn't always exactly been what she was expecting many of her

good mood I Try to not\nNot entertained my kids because I can be hard on them but I Try to get them interested in oh wow oh I could do this or oh Mr Thompson and they'll come and say did you see the soccer player or did you see this music this thing and that came out in this song [noise]\nWho's paying for this magazine I Am I'm paying the propaganda that comes my way and it's a split Mack okay so I don't want to pay for that I don't mind paying for collective bargaining\nAnd then one day all these political activities became all too personal\nI'd never really got involved but I didn't make a standard they were saying and I didn't like it at all but then what happened was my husband was a city councilman he decided to run for state representative when he ran for state representative [noise] um\n[noise] what the union started doing was\nSending all these ads\nOut against my husband that\nWere very mocking and political in nature and um they were going to my mom's house hold my mom like a light at the time and you know and the return box paid for by the campaign for moderate majority\nAnd then in parentheses only a\nFBI you okay wait the LA and Columbus [noise]\nThe union that she was part of was taking her money and using it\nTo oppose and mock for Barry own husband [noise] and of course with out her permission to spend her hard earned money [noise]\nIt was like in a Pakistani of\nAre you kidding me this that's like a major slap in the\nShade husband was running as a Republican but her that should have made no difference\nAt all [noise]\nUm I wouldn't want a democratic trend I wouldn't want anyone to have to go through what I had to go through and um it it's just not right it's not right for them to use your money you're forced to in that manner [noise]\nIf the union opposes a spouse of one of the Democratic members there risking doing so on behalf of a minority of their members Republicans only make up about twenty five percent of union membership and if\nA union opposes a Republican members of his spouse they're all real\nRisk being doing so on behalf of a minority Boston forty five percent of\nUnion members identify as Democrats the union\nIs speaking for all in a way that they don't speak\nThe union is speaking for all in a way that they don't speak for most\nMembership organizations you stick to the issues were the vast majority of their members agree for this reason\nFor the union their way of doing business could be untenable for them\nAnd exposes them for the diminishing their membership has already dropped in half from twenty percent of American workers ten percent\nIn just over Thirty years and it doesn't help when you don't respond\nTo your members\nSo I actually called the L E a president her name was Patricia\n... at the time she of course wouldn't take my call and I tried to complain I said\nYou know really this is yeah this is ridiculous I I have seen the union and you know the area is doing something I just ridiculous so\n[noise] um [noise] it was a critical moment for me though because before I kind of didn't have a voice I didn't want to distinguish myself in any a pejorative way [noise] so then I started getting\nYou know angry you won't take my call\nI thought okay that's fine that's fine I'm fighting back now so I I did feel alone for a time and I decided to write a couple of letters to the editor which got picked up by the Columbus dispatch barely nerve wracking plenty that I thought to myself\nIf I'm quiet all these people speak for me and my husband is a really good man and he does not deserve this and this is wrong I was so worried\nOh I'm going to have repercussions at school you know what I thought to myself if you're my friend and and you know who we are then your support me [noise]\nAnd because reunion stops supporting her she decided to stop supporting it\nI decided then to be a a feat pair and now I changed my status so I'm not I'm not I have to pay still to be in the ... going to have my collective bargaining\nBut they give you a certain amount back\nOhio is not a right to work state so what's your workplaces unionized and you don't want to be a member of a union it kinda sorta still have to be mentioned your only option is to become what's called a ... pair\nWhere you have to pay the union\nFor what they say are the cost to represent you\nIn any potential legal matters into negotiate your contract on your behalf\nEven if you don't want them to\nBud allegedly you also no longer have to pay for all the other activities union\nWhich is the political lobbying and election efforts and this will be a good thing\nBut the reality is well\nIf you just look at the only and NEA portions of the teachers didn't use a beep hair is forced to pay\nNinety seven point nine percent of a regular union members do eight different of only two points one person that [noise]\nSo the Ohio union in fact this thing that only two points one percent of their budget goes to non representation activities\n... said\nThat adds up whatever the reality is this ... respond to create a strong incentive for each teacher to leave the union especially when this\nWhen you start to speak out about it or talk about it other teachers try to intimidate you they make you feel like well you don't go against the you've got to be an Indian or you're against the American public school and you're and you're against the teachers [noise]\nI just I don't want to be don't you guys see all this stuff going nobody but there are a lot\nOf people are like how far they do not want to know that intimidation factor is that people were worried that they'll lose their job it they'll have to work with some\nVery credit union and what I realized once you start talking about it people start\nMay identify you and then they freak you out like they will be walking down the hall and and the school and they you say hello to them as a polite\nNormal person what people do and they act like they didn't hear you\nI Want to be working in a school where I feel like I have colleagues that respects me and we can go to each other and help each other and you know across

representative for us authors David Hughes is running a little bit late so we were working man to later on down in the order\nFormat for all candidates is the same an opportunity to introduce yourself and your platform followed by two questions and a chance for for about ... on each thirty seconds\nIn the case of introductions incumbents we'll go first what in the case of questions candidates will drop we weren't address drives instead we decide it's incumbent first every time except for one three in the city where we could go alphabetically and for the school board we're going alphabetically just because there's so many\nUh order response will switch with the second question so ah each candidate gets the first question except again in those groups that are so large everybody's going to get the first question then we'll go for a bottle\nThat everybody gets the second question\nOur questions from the audience will be taken and will be asked if time allows a\nIf you have a question right back there in that corner is there's a paper and pen you can write down your question if we have time at the end we will take a look at them ah when we are if we if time lapse\nA moderator is expected to strictly here at a time allowances with time cards used to assist candidates and type paper to mark thirty second ...\nCandidates are allowed to use their time as they wish but they can expect to be called on in the case of an accurate information unsubstantiated accusations or if they fail to address the question\nUh none of the candidates will have the context of any question before the debate again those questions have been with me however because this is the chamber debate candidate can anticipate business related issues based on local concerns and events\nIf you have any questions or concerns that I hesitate to call the chamber off the six eight one thirty seven twenty thank you for running as a candidate this election season and thank you for participating in candidate debate twenty eight ten\nOkay we're going to uh go right past the U.S house of representatives district seven and we're going to start with the state house representative district one a if those who are running for that office would come and sit on the front\nTwo chairs over there they would include incumbent Dan fading in and his challenger Steve Miller\nAs the incumbent Mr Fabian you may approach and go ahead and give you one minute introduction\nOh thank you grant and thanks to kick you off radio fever falls radio into all the folks for being here this evening I'm it's my pleasure to be here I was asked by actually in an email to\nTalk about what I'm proud of you know I'm I'm proud of of ah the folks in northwest Minnesota\nOr not and and uh and what I have a passion for I guess would actually the board was and I have a passion for North west Minnesota and our rural values are often times we feel like sometimes in the legislature but we stand for what we want to do out here in rural Minnesota is not very important\nI was super proud to be your voice of common sense and St Paul I referred about a lot I really proud of tonight the fact that this is a chamber um event that I've had the endorsement of the Minnesota chamber of commerce and the national federation of independent small businesses was granted there a guardian of small businesses are just did in fact that came out\nAnd I hope to answer some more questions as the evening progressive\nThank you very much was ... and ... if you were closed for just one second I Want to have missed one thing I just wanted to thank a tour of radio Jake Weber mark Allen our onsite leads the generations back at the engineering station and the mayor Brian Homer is our timer so I just wanted to make mention of those who they're all doing a lot of good work here\nOr Mr Moore you can go ahead with your introduction\n[noise]\n\nGood evening everybody my name is Stephen Miller and I am running for the Minnesota state house district one a\nBecause quite frankly I Am tired and on set up with the type of toxic politics that goes on in St Paul that favor scoring political points over benefiting the people who we represent are supposed to represent\nAnd well minister Fabian has definite policy disagreements and hope to talk about those which hits me into this race was the failure of the government in St Paul this year to pass meaningful legislation we had a nine hundred page on the misspell\nThey contain many things that the people the state of Minnesota needed but were buried inside a monstrosity of a piece of legislation that got vetoed after weeks of negotiation people's Minnesota deserve better than what they're getting as your state representative I promise I'll deliver on that thank you\nMr Moore Mr Fabian you're ready for your first question okay [noise]\nFirst question is given continued low unemployment the emphasis in northwest Minnesota is finding qualified labor\nIf elected how would you help small and large businesses in our area find new employees and I'm going to ask you come back to the podium if you would just for the benefit of the microphone and also for a A R broadcast tonight would you like to read the question over there and say I will just a\nGiven continue low unemployment the emphasis in northwest Minnesota is finding qualified labor if elected how would you help small and large business in our area find new employees you have two minutes or\nThank you well we have talked about this a lot and one of the things that I'm encouraged by is that\nA recently it seems that the communities in northwest Minnesota have kind of come together to promote northwest Minnesota as a place instead of\nInstead of supporting or I'm trying to recruit people to an individual community\nWhether it's ... or ... or the fervor falls now there seems to be more of an effort to promote northwest Minnesota or to get people to see the value of living\nHere where we live and and the great things that we have available [noise] um I've spent a lot of time with a doctor bona north one community technical college uh they've got some really outstanding programs going on there in fact\nThere are some was recently cited as the ... most of 'em\nAre the best a community college in in the nation um there's a lot of positive things going on there\nI think that a strong educational program um being able to get people into the jobs that are that we need you know welding technical things are a whole bunch of different things that\nWe can do here locally but just promoting the area I think is extremely important we've got some workforce development projects that we've worked on in the legislature I think that have been successful um I'm Glad to see that uh that there is kind of a shortage because I think that what that does is it puts pressure\nOn wages and it actually raises people's wages uh because the market is determining that not some artificial\nMinimum wage standard or the starting wages that was interesting Amazon announced yesterday or day before that they're now going to be raising the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour\nI thought well widely polaris ... or ... or all well above Fifteen dollars an hour and a when you factor in their benefits so it's really a a good thing for workers so those are the things that I like to focus on working with local leaders said to come up with ideas at work individually\nI'm interesting laugh has spent a little bit of time with the Humphrey Institute talking about what we can do especially\nFor I'm going to go back to seniors people who are retired but don't necessarily want to be a out of work entirely and so the conversation in Minnesota is going to uh how how do we help people that want to slow down maybe working a lot\nBut still have the expertise to be able to work in our districts and help us with different issues and met a gentleman the other day that is interested in um he's an engineering degree he says gosh I can help mend dot ... supervise a project\nI don't want to do all of them but I Would certainly do one or two and I think that's a way for us to ah give value to people that are I have all that knowledge and we have a lot of seniors in this district aren't going to have a lot more\nOn that may be offered able to teach our students the other thing our young people the other thing is is that um we have a disc excellent school like a north and community college and University of Minnesota ...\nWhere I think there are some wonderful ways for us to certify get people out in the workforce maybe reinforce what it is they need to know to be able to fill in need in the area and I have talked to some businesses that said they are more than well willing to work with somebody who wants to work or\nIn a new field and on one thing they said to me was\nThey know that somebody that is a little bit more senior will show up on time for work\nAnd when they're done or they'll say well you know what I that's fine I can go home I don't need to be paid for the time or you don't need to help and I find on the farm that is a very ah excellent way to find good help when we need a people to work a extra jobs so I think we need to expand that thank you\nThank you moved to you Mr lunchroom would you come to the podium for your first question please\n\nGiven continued low unemployment the emphasis in northwest Minnesota is finding qualified labor if elected how would you help small and large businesses in our area find new employees you have two minutes sir\nI believed to help the recruiting process is to develop more affordable workforce housing here in the area I Know working at new flare ups than um we have people at work all the way from worn down through fertile\nOut to Macintosh and even in Grand forks so people are willing to travel um we can increase the public transportation um they have the tribe belly bus runs from east Grand Forks the crux than\nA scheduler posted I Know they have a fair ridership are writing from east Grand Forks to ...\nBut it can be expanded um we just have to look into a ways to provide amenities a honestly as a recreation tourism is my my degree and that's what people want things to do off duty to or off\nOff to off work hours I'm Still in the military think [noise] um but to have amenities that their kids can have acts opportunities in ... in in the community that they live in a it's more of a quality of life thing on top of being in a in a job that pays a good wage you\nLike to unwind and play too so it is to promote the amenities we have lakes rivers streams a witch hunt in and make it a whole package deal instead of just you can get this great job but we have this for the rest of your family to\nMake you very much poster Lindstrom ... was to Mr list or if you're ready for your second question will go head with a\nUh the collapse of the ... bridge in two thousand seven seems to have been the protests were rebuilding infrastructure not only in Minnesota but across the country what area of infrastructure do you see the buildings work and Minnesota new hip two minutes or\nWell living close to a Grand Forks and and so if you've driven over there in the last couple of years you've probably lose front of your car driving around their potholes I definitely believe that the streets on the side of the river and the highways are much better shape and I want to continue to make sure that's true\nBut one of the things I Believe up here is rural broadband real broadband is going to be a key which can also go back to the first question but a lot of people to work from home allow our students and schools to maybe get that course that maybe the local school can't afford to have that structure that program in the ... in the classroom\nBut maybe we can get on line with that rural broadband into a bigger cooperative of of educators\nAre it brings businesses to the customers and customers to business so if you're at home and you need that thing that we just can't get done with a hardware store we can order\nA brief patience to healthcare there's a large\nA movement toward online health care where you can have teleconference with these Dr\nReal broadband I Believe is one big us hindered and says to ... this area and we need to invest much deeper into that\nThey can muster Lindstrom will kill if you're ready for your second question is would come to the podium\nCollapse of the ... bridge in two thousand seven seems to have been the protests for rebuilding infrastructure not only in Minnesota but across the country what area of infrastructure juicy which still does work in Minnesota\nIt's what area of infrastructure do you see that still does work in Minnesota and you have two minutes ma'am\nWell I have to say that I'm very proud of the money that we passed that time I did wonders for our rural infrastructure\nHelp with that as represented said instead as our water issues and also\nA rebuild roads I Do know that there is some projects that were delayed until next year because as I spoke earlier\nThere's not enough people to supervise projects and businesses are very busy so we do need more infrastructure repairs but they are on their way and I'm very encouraged to see us being able to make sure that we maintain the roads that we have\nI Am a sugar beets farmer and so roads are very important for us to get our crops not just sugar beets that uh we ... we got to make sure we can get out of commodity as to where they need to go and so roads are very important part in rural Minnesota here and the north west area of an assault on\n'em but also on my opponent spoke about broadband and proud to say that we did some really good\nInvestments in broadband as you know to the east of the fervor falls more and more people are able to get ... and on and yes it is important had the governor not vetoed the bill that we passed in\nThe spring of the year there would've been more tell 'em medicine which was very important to Minnesota so that people can get that contact when they made you can't leave the house and a very encouraging to see what that will do for those who has got some health care issues and it will also help our nursing service\nSo infrastructure is very important from Minnesota and you're right it that did kind of\nDirect us toward making sure that our\nInfrastructure is up and and we didn't have the failure bridges that one's happened thank you\nThank you miss kill Mr Lindstrom do you have any real bottle with that thank you very much both you ladies and gentleman that state house representative district one be\nHanded it affects us\n[noise]\nWhen we started this evening a David

possible\nMy opponent Collin Peterson as part of the Democratic opposition and resistance\nAnd I believe that he or if he is re elected he wrote a vote for Nancy Pelosi and their effort is to reverse the progress that we've made it last week for a minute so I asked for your vote because I'm going to help the president accomplish this agenda that has brought us economic prosperity greater security in greater liberty for all Americans\nAnd that's my goal in Congress thank you\nThank you Mr he was and you can go ahead and stay at the pedestal there and they'll ask you your first question if you're already a are you in favor of morbid to universal health care or some other form of national healthcare system such a single payer and you have two minutes or\nI Am not in favor of going in that direction at all\nOr last year in two thousand Seventeen my opponent ... Peterson held a number of health care town halls I was able to attend two of them and he started knowing certain turns to the group a president that he thought that single payer health care or a Medicare for all was inevitable at one of those especially he said at five or six or seven times\nAnd gave me an indication of the audience that he had any problem with that or where would oppose that\nI Would adamantly oppose that I ah this is not in on this is not Canada and I think both those systems have had a an are experiencing lots of trouble\nI think the key to improving health care both reducing the cost of health care reducing the cost of health insurance and improving access a and all the measures that we want to improve in medicine is not to be found in a single payer system\nI think that if the federal government can knock down some of the hurdles to those improvements and allow the states to work with the private industry and the private sector\nBut that that's where the solutions are to be held\nOut to be found 'em for shirt a health care is a University of issues and so I look forward in Congress to working with experts on both sides of the aisle hearing expert witness testimony from everybody to come to a solution but I don't think it's to be found in some sort of socialist a utopia idea\nUm work that did you see for night at eight years now ... park manager for to retrieve the courts and tone um basically what I'd like to do was buy get elected is try and help the community you listen to the people trying things settled figure it out you know make things easier and down\nAnd basically you know just\nDo something good for his own for ones like\nYou Mr Anderson up next Gary hints would you come to the podium\nThank you Mr Anderson up next Gary hints would you come to the podium and do your introduction an opening statement if you like it Mr hence you have one minutes er\nMy name is ...
