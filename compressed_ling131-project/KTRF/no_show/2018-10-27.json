been with us now he's got a plan to revitalize or small towns and understand how important they are to Minnesota\nThat's why I'm supporting Tim Walz for governor and I hope you will to thank Brian I'm Tim Walz I'm running so everyone in every part of Minnesota has a voice in the chance to succeed that's what one Minnesota is all about [noise] about appreciate your vote for ... for governor members to report by Tim Walz for\nGovernor years and now he is retired out in Idaho but he has joined us because he's in town to talk about the boundary water Tom thanks a lot for a for stepping in here with me for a few minutes we'll thank\nYou for having me exciting to be here in town today to help to be part of a celebration of the fortieth anniversary of the boundary waters wilderness area\nYou know the reason I'm here is that why was chief for the U.S Forest Service had the opportunity to visit the boundary waters and spend time on the barrier national forest which manages the boundary waters wilderness area and to really get a sense for how special places and not how important it is just to folks from Minnesota\nBut how it is a national treasure for this country\nSo it's great to be here today to be able to help celebrate the anniversary of the folks that had the with them the foresight to set aside this area so that all Americans and especially those folks here in Minnesota they get to enjoy it more than most to have this special place that's been protected or through the wilderness act\nOr the ... that goes back to Nineteen sixty four in Nineteen Seventy eight oh that's one of the boundary waters is kind of formal answers Iran\nYes it was former light in Seventy eight ... but it actually goes back to Nineteen twenty six or in the forest service or working with the secretary of agriculture recognize the the significance of the special place and actually put provision in place back in back in twenty sick to be able to protect the place for development\nIt's a great chunk of property that I've ... I get up to every year you would have you spent some time I know you've flown over your checked it out 'til solve any experiences with northern Minnesota charm\nWell that's the time I spent upon the superior national for the first I did have a chance to fly across them it it's a very large area of the uh the opportunity to fly across the gave me the than for\nThe beauty of the play and why it's so special and part of it just died and then the thing that really stood out for me the amount of water this is the place that recreation fishing hunting just recreating it's all water ... yeah\nThe majority of the area is covered with standing water which makes it great for canoeing or any type of water based recreation and then also the wildlife habitat that that they're not just the fisheries but at the wildlife all the time to these species like comic place\nThat needs to be protected so when I first flew across that I just couldn't believe we had such a special place in the\nIn this country and then I had the time to get on on the ground and the other thing I wanted to stress about it is that before I had a chance to come here I'd heard about the boundary waters from my one of my rice relative that she grew up in Southern California okay\nAnd when I first got to know her I was talking with other relatives I asked what do you like to do and I said every year we'd go to the boundary waters wilderness area to go canoeing from from Los Angeles I'll be darned\nAnd they had found that special place and it was like all this guy would talk about it and so this guy would work year round and he would take his ... his limited vacation time indeed come to Minnesota to spend it there basically to renew his parents is the way he would talk about it so it gave me the early inside about how wonderful that's places\nI Believe the most visited wilderness in the country\nMost ... in the eastern United you know you have our own tree\nAnd when I'm In there I ... I was pumping to someone from far away and you bump into a lot of Minnesota there's a lot of people from Wisconsin but it seems like I was bumping to someone from Chicago or New York state for down south quite frequently and and it's like wow you you drove all the way up here or or maybe even flew into a camp in in our bomb you are supposed to be a pretty special place\nFor the special place in it and from folks that I've met here in Minnesota that seems like it either everyone has a cabin up there\nOr they want a cabin up there right at that kind of special place but it also as you point out people from all over the country and also it's getting to be known for around the world the special place\nWhich brings a lot of people into the area which really drives the recreation economy up there I think the last number that the forest service put together that annually that brings in about\nA forty four million dollars of economic activity to the area that supports a lot of job I'll tell you cannot just credit the economic activity is driven by the recreational at the tourism business owner\nAnd the time you were the director of the U.S Forest Service from there was a two thousand nine to twenty Seventeen yeah that's a nice Ron I'm part of\nDuring the U.S Forest Service from there was a two thousand nine to twenty Seventeen yeah that's a nice run them part of two presidents Jews from different parties so congratulations of her for writing that out so the till you're retired after what forty one years with the agency a\nRetired after forty one years and I was fortunate to\nSpend about half of my career or actually in the field and then if they moved into administration and then had the honor to be the chief of the forest service which is a unique position and federal agencies that's one of the few federal agencies where the the head of the ... of the agencies it ... the title is the chief\nIt's not a political position which I thought we spent a career so wary of somewhat unique in that way I Want to do a lot of federal agency\nThat's nice it's nice to hear the word politics removed from from the ... of a position that important\nOf course we've got some controversial with our Boehner waters here and the discussion of the potential for sulfide mining real within that watershed adjacent really right adjacent to it while you were the forest service director in twenty fourteen you decided what not to renew the leash for ah for one metals is is that correct of course the one that's been in the news a lot here lately\nWell the the twin metal leaders were first day shoot in Nineteen sixty six [noise] which was prior to any majority of the environmental laws that we have an effect in this country today\nAnd then the department of interior that does the league team and all federal lands mainly the they read new deletes a few times into and twenty four team that came up again for renewable\nAnd so they are the ... apartment adventure asked do you want to come down to renewing asleep so we took a look at it and it wasn't just a quick decision and I I Will admit that when I first flew over this country and was out on the ground\nIt raised a lot of serious questions with me about how you could mine even an underground mine how you could actually pull that off with so much of the surface covered by water right and then of course the concern\nWith the sulfide or so I asked our um specialist are mining engineers are scientists to take a hard look at the end it really look at some of the the potential risk for this and what they determined without any question that trying to do 'em to mind is type or the sulfide type or\nAnd especially in an area where there's so much water on the surface that would just be very very problematic and we have a very high risk of impacting our water quality\nAnd you've got to understand that when you release sulfide or to you the air or to water it creates a ferry captain right at a minimum it increases the ph in the water which has a deadly effect you know for fisheries so based on that and all the research and science that we put together we became very concerned in addition we held a couple of public meeting\nWhere at the staff up here to sit down with local people and talk to them about it\nAnd yet there are strong proponents for mining there's strong opponent to Miami but at the end of the day we let science you know guide our decision and based on that I declined to consent\nTo renewing delete them and that's what we did them one of the when I was still the chief for the U.S Forest Service and I can't stress enough that that was based on the science and the knowledge that we have our scientists and our specialist looked at other types of the type of mining throughout the country\nLooked at some of the risk and potential impacts of they had and without any question the decision whether to not consent\nNo time we've heard opponents say this has never been done successfully anywhere else in this kind of water rich environment something you know I'm kind of paraphrasing but is that is that a sentiment you agree with our warehouse ... sulfide copper sulfide mining work\nWell we have every place you have a large mining operation there's going to be impacts sure ... air retrieval commitment of the resource that together but I have worked with a mining and personally in Nevada with gold mining and then also in Arizona where the forest service out\nAt several large copper mine that are on the national forest and they are very controversial without any question but in the very dry environment where you you don't have a lot of water um\nThey're able to actually have an operating minded does not impact the water quality now there's always impacts to wildlife etcetera and\nThat goes along with show is just the physical but in order to dry environment on it to the places where there's much higher than that when we've tried to to mind these type or body in other parts of the country where\nYou have a much more pre step yeah much wetter environmental watersheds it's been very very problematic and it's created the Superfund site right at the American taxpayers are still paying for it today you spent your whole career\nBalancing these kind of equations right trying to find as supporting legitimate public use of of natural resources for ... for for profit for the benefit of the country with the risk of environmental damage\nThe biggest factor I found out recently or I shouldn't say recent maggots I'd known it but you really gotta work for these fish you know especially I've been doing a lot of bass fishing now and you really have to work for these ... but once you find up you've got to think of the box and figure out ways of catching them\nWe were talking a little bit off air here before we get started and you brought up a point that I thought was was pretty interesting and that's that doing or spend too much time focused on structure and certainly there's times a year when you you wanna\nFish structure there there's times you're one fish are are are suspending around structure working structural or they're inside structure right they're inside and weeds that sort of thing but there is a good chunk of the year sometimes working Fisher\nInside structure right they're inside and weeds I sort of thing but there is a good chunk of leaders somehow were Fisher they're not necessarily a warning themselves round structure right well\nThat's exactly ... two words or that we really angers chosen\nThey forced the issue for those two words one structure won his patterns\nAnd structure you know I it's who you and I were talking you know said you're going out a good example is you're going to opening weekend for wall eyes and you found a rock pile or or re for whatever it may be in forty feet of water while it just makes common sense those fish aren't going to be there that they haven't moved that\nFar opening weekend yet so you have to really tie in the seasonal patterns\nThe calendar appears to foreign sources and then you can take a look at structure you know in the summertime Wallace was spent ... been in the summertime ... suspend you don't\nSpend now are so there's a lot of factors but we are so involved into structure patterns and edges I think it's taking away from you know using you're using your electrons you find it and you automatically well we're going to catch fish here that does not happen that's more important use those ... mark actual fish right exactly\nRight yeah and I've seen it this summer I think you and I talked about it it's just amazing and I'm not taking any negative approaches but how many people are fishing crop is in some fish and you know they're not marking him and they're fishing those spots anyway then I've been fishing back to the marketing just\nUnbelievable balance of a ... and you can tell by the way they're picking at your plastic and there's not one individual fishing those spots for crop dusters on right now\nThis is outdoor news radio Rob to resign and tackle Terry tumor or a catching up here it's uh probably our last segment with her before we really get serious about talking hard water ice fishing a little bit later this fall but the temperatures Harry had been fairly warm still during the days I mean I worked in up in the fifties where you going to have some sixties\nOr some overnight laws starting to get into freezing but as long as we're in the fifties for daytime highs we're we're going to have open water and\nAll we really we are and you know you you know we have this done that beating on the water surface temperature that really going to make a factor that one could make a factor at all the ingredients you're preventing it we're not going to have ice I hopefully not real Suresh\nTerrier or one of our bloggers Jason rubber man he posted a blog this week on ... fishing he should go

instance and forty fifty feet of water up in Canada forty ... feet of water at the time of the year\nSo deep structural location are going to be very very good there's no question about that or if

that yeah like you said ... like a number seven really great lower for fall laws and he said you might might even pick up a few crops were the two well\nThat's exactly right if you remember when we were up on the ... of the woods Rob with John remember towards the end I put on a ... network that but we had to go in ... just dynamite right Adam and therefore those few fish\nBut at this time of year for deep fish those kind of ... are very very ... if they're fun to fish too but you have to pay attention same as you mentioned to you to that too often we think these fish are going to hit really aggressively and at this time especially the bat\nManned if you just felt that chick any kind of a tip I mean not just you really had a kind of you better set the whole crowd about you don't hook up with the fish\nSure that reminds me I was a two three years ago we did that for a political it's almost exactly this time of year wasn't a late October was one of the last uh boats to go out

of these guys with his ... going to have\nHim I\nAnd so when I was ... when I Do the voice of just kind of do that and I would get I Would be doing it sort of the get into character to get the voice

Cowboys cheerleader or anyway he would get really excited he just like his biting his lip all the time and this kind of like [laughter] like laughing at everything she said so I started out with that laugh and then I just kind of made his voice sound like the leftist like rats be you know\nIf we all work together and respect one another space will get through this crisis was the new found sense of community\n\nMr ... and that was probably is probably my favorite character rather than Beavis to to do the voice for first started doing that voice I wasn't quite sure where I was getting it from that I remember I used to be a musician and um\nI played with Sam Myers and there was this guy from the Santa Barbara blues society there and he was interviewing Sam said this way of talking he said um I remember him saying something like\nSam it must have been really wonderful for you having grown up in the deep south to be able to travel to Europe and experience some of their culture and share

like for them it is really from here yeah it is and\nThat'll make it different what about healthier club where are you there right now\nAll we have a few injuries uh Ryan Erickson a de Lima in may or may not play a lot of demand so our one offensive lineman is out but it's nothing that we haven't one or two injuries for this I think we're ... a former healthier than we were a year ago\nAnd some of those guys have been out for a little while yeah got to have to adjust already in those positions as well yeah the only new injury is Ryan so ultimately\nThis comes down to you being able to mix and match or off when you get down an and throw your ...\nOh yeah and uh they give us some looks that we think we can take advantage of that if we can run the ball or they'll have a very very hard time stopping us so the key is than protecting the ball and scoring on those drives\nBut for folks who like passing I you're going to see a ton of it on Sunday all had between Olson and Devon area you're going to see you guys go get the global\nPack a lunch she'll be about a hundred and Ninety place [laughter]\nEnd about four and a half hours yeah I I I exactly it it's going to be it's going to be a link you won't be ... things are going to throw it will try to make sure you're home for the NFL night game oh gee things appreciate that ultimately kickoff is one thirty right and uh when put you at home again next Sunday\nThat is correct or against the lower seat of the other division there's no way we'll play central lake sat around us in central lakes of the ... the number one seeds if we when we pull play lower seeds so if we get lucky and when are we would get the winner of massage the range in a task\nWhich is possible they could be I'd ask you if you just played at the end\nFor a task is probably the best team in these soy that'll that'll make for an interesting time to 'cause it's a a chance to a rematch that over time but\nDon't forget the Minnesota west blew out central lakes early on the\nRate so there's less of a team and you got to the right to work they have some athletes they really do you're gonna have to get by tomorrow for certain threat to the ultimately I down the road and that would also be Sunday at one third grade\nAnd then two weeks from today is the state file or three it'd be of disarray there's three rounds right will be two weeks from two weeks from tomorrow Oh yes yes yes you're right and that would be I think like I said if you get there again that is correct so and so that the target right now at the end\nThere is I saw no there is one change and that they have another conflict at St Cloud state so the championship game on that Sunday will kick off at noon not one\nThirty a little bit earlier yeah but uh but that's the target that's the goal\nIs why we stopped there on the way to ah ah we practiced in Saint cloud on the way to Rochester\nAs far as your club goes how's attitude a house or is everything along those lines going into tomorrow\nGetting we're getting there and you know it's a they're all freshmen sophomores or so it's ... but the world playing freshman sophomore so we're all in the same\nBoat the fog list for you for all down into practice there is going to be an interesting ...\nIt is a well that's a light practice so won't be bad but yeah it's a it's a foggy after\nOne other thing that has been a concern\nA off and on during the year this year at times you're special teams especially kicked coverage punk coverage has not been where you'd like\nTo be all not even close not even close now we've returned to catch for touchdowns but on the other hand we've given up too much uh we work every day on squid kicks we work on the ball out of bounds we work on all that stuff and for whatever reason we get in the game and we we can't seem to accomplish that\nBut it but when you give up those short field the kind of puts ... well that is all\nLast week we get a between because they're great athletes returned kicks every time we score they got the ball at midfielder less so they really had we probably gave up Eighteen points in our kickoff team\nAnd that and that ultimately is a is a huge factor for you but you know a playoff time exactly 'cause you don't get as many opportunities cause games closer goats I Know you've got things we do to prepare for practice a thanks for coming in first thing was

going somewhere to play today but uh unfortunately that didn't happen and really coach earlier this week in the first round playoff game more of the same just really struggled support points on points on the board you\nUp and that's been an issue obviously all year um you know and it was a it was a tough started again to you know we go three and now I've had our defense in it and I think I think they might even block to ponder tip the ... so they William I'm you know they're at the fifty but I think it took\nTo ponder kept the ... so that we give them um you know they're at the fifty but I think it took for it took them ten or twelve plays discourse or you know defense that was kind of happy at least with that drive you made 'em earn it\nUm we stuffed them on the the PAT which we practiced a lot they did this one gate and we adjusted and I was proud of the kids with that then the next possession we former right away and then they scores or you know we run for office supplies and we're down twelve nothing and you've seen us all year Wayne and it's been a we need something positive happen early and unfortunately we just didn't get it\nWas one that type of thing happens that quickly in a game and you have the kind of year you had a it's really easy for the kids I don't want us to give up but just lose that intently ...\nWell it is you know and even that you know at halftime or down twenty four nothing in his guys it's three scores and\nUm you know we're still in this thing but when you haven't put points on the board unfortunately you know that that that doubt cups sneaks in and you know I was proud of our guys effort and um you know they play their hearts out like you said you know they didn't quit but you know in the back of the mind when that happens it's it's it's it's an it's an uphill battle in you know unfortunately we couldn't get her done\nOn the off the side of the football I'm Talking about returns now most of your quote unquote skill kids come back\nTo your quarterback or grand Hartman will be back a coal Johnson will be back it running back ah Brigham in in ... and with the exception of miles and the and the time most of your receiving corps or the guys that are the regulars out there will be back\nSo that puts you just a Scotia head of the game because most of those kids didn't have any real varsity experience from a year\nAgo absolutely you know any experience that you get is important and um you know we look forward to those guys and um you know obviously you're gonna miss the seniors I'm\nYou know or it was a tough season for them but um you know at the same time they learn a lot of life lessons in and you know so then we move forward in a ... it was a is a great group of kids you know we love each each and every one of them individually and and we wish them the best next year to\nThe other end of the coin of the off in the front and really the defensive for us as well for the most part was upper class\nSo you don't have a whole lot of experience back there for next year and with the exception of baby holes and wonder if maybe one of the ... the ... missing in my mind uh you don't have a lot of science coming back either\nRight and that's that's part of that you know that's um we've got two main things we need to work on a and I think next year and one's obviously the weight room and that's you know we've got a great bunch of ah fresh bending the R C squad the freshman she see teams did freshman sophomore see Scott did really well\nAnd so um this year and and you know they're going to have to we're not some freshmen playing next year so that'll be an important thing some some some sophomores one yeah yeah yeah that's what I mean yeah this year's fresher\nSaid I think like friday did today and he goes yeah you know I said again and then kind of went who come out of work but okay and then um I said well we do host conference next year so you we will have to meet next year it just won't be ...\nUnfortunately from your own kids standpoint although a couple of kids ran in good times uh nobody qualified this year I\nAm nobody qualified um you know it was a bath course after that boy because the boys rates versus the ... and even ... years I'm\nSo last year the last one getting into state was Seventeen forty was cut off this year it was Seventeen Nineteen and when that when that lasts for ... or cross the finish line to get into the I was like\nThat was a fast pace that all those kids even in the mud like back in those words like it was black and they had to really um be careful with their footing back there and so I was worried even coming out of the trees towards the river\nI'm back there um before you hit the the river area or whatever it's it's really really really money over the air it was really money and I was worried about the footing and\nYou know how would affect times but it didn't affect times times are\nFantastic and so the with that you know we gave ... with the new Jack Davis who said you know you're going to have to probably be at then I'm Seventeen forty area and he was Seventeen fifty nine which is an amazing time for him you know from last year this year he cut\nA minute ten off and that's how we can ask each year to get\nYou know a little bit better and so he did an amazing job all year just cutting time cutting time cutting time and he that's the fastest Caesar and that of course and so we're proud of him for doing that and\nYou know I was looking as I was sitting here just back at the times for the teams and\nOur our team all of them um the from from the we are from there appear to Seventeen to Eighteen they've all cuts so much time and a half like Jonah Carlson is\nHe kinda on nearly two minutes from last year either ... or like our top five where are you losing ... an urban chases the calcium that's it and\nWe were going to be even better next year and so I'm excited for next year and I'm excited for where the kids are we ... we bought it brought up right in line on and so he's a seventh grader and he ran really well and [noise] so\nHe's a seventh grader and he ran really well and so yeah so next year the gun and then on the girls side we lose to seniors that we get some ain't going I'm rest the Americans and so we'll have to replace them but\nYou know ... been a great leader so will miss her in that aspect so we need to find um another great leader um to step up and knew that also but the girls team also we have we have a good top five um that it will be able to run and maybe we can bring up some of those um\nSome of those girls who were in sixth grade maybe or in seventh grade that are you know you know when you're younger ... you're a little bit faster you know ... on the girls that I Do tend to progress when you're at a younger age than when you're a boy so our boys should progress as they are getting older and are girls um\nYeah so I don't know it's been a good year\nFast and what by pretty good ... dead yeah it did\nAnd I yeah I'm thankful I'm Lisa ... our assistant coach has been amazing all year and then we had Paul Brand as a junior high coach and he did a great job all year too so I'm just thankful and then thankful for everybody that came out on Thursday and helped us because we couldn't have done it without them\nNot cooperate directed at spring right yeah I ... in the spring you know when we have the coaches meaning on Thursday one of the coach's raise their hand or Cory and he's like\nYou got a lot of flags out there where there's nobody in the you know kids are going to cut corners I Know we've got forty seven people that are going to be out there by the flags so there will be no cutting corners so it was good to have all those Ontario so we're thankful that they all came out\nAnd then now if you can get kids out so they're so they're running a gym is ringing not relaxing in the spring that much better\nYeah in summer you know you can't just go into the season in August and expect to do well I'm Jonah and eat them and Jake they all work during the summer and worked hard during the summer and you can't go in and Isaac ... you can't go in

your final game of the regular season today coach\nYeah and sophomore days are pretty excited about today's event\nWell let's let's talk a little bit first of all about the about this last week you went over to the lake region to play last weekend yep and played some a scholarship schools yeah and it didn't go as well as it is the first time you're over there this year\nYeah you know as a team to go on they get the you know and prove they get faster they get harder\nHeading there often says beat up and I think it was a little bit of an adjustment over there with some of these due to schools in regards to they're often to schemes I think our defense we took just a second in the blocking category to you know just those faster balls\nTaller girls adjusting some of those you know where we usually loosen up on defense and we're not dug down ready to dig that hard driven ball\nWay to get used to step in that hole in the block and ... you know taking some of the heat up the ball but it just it nicely in\nGame ... game four of the day that Saturday Saturday they came back down to it and when the next three and five so that was nice [noise]\nCame out yesterday and put your second last conference game how things go\nWe ended up I'm meeting having three they have some nice girls that can really put the ball down but are serving aggressive keeping them out our system you know that's usually one of our first things first and foremost things as a ... of serving games to make sure I blockers you know take a little off of them [noise]\nAnd and then today the last game as you said at sophomore day that's always a little emotional because you've got a handful of those is here\nYeah we have four of 'em actually in ... and ... from ... from the folding and rented a longer up from ... so it'll be fun for nice cocoa girls that are just hardworking and great energy in the gym\nAnd and kids but they aren't although at this level you're replacing constantly they're not going to be easy to replace because quite frankly two of them are your top two Saturdays so you're going to have to say look we're for next year\nYeah definitely you know and but one of the good thing because we have also have my hands and then there so um those too inbred on hand I have a nice role models and leaders for her I'm kind of kind of teaching some of the decision making and just that\nThat that grit to that goal for everything hard work ethic is just nice safe\nAnd are you in both cases particularly in Brennan's case but in both cases with those two kids the kids do Kim twenty two there has ...\nAre you okay with the with the progress so far\nOh yeah absolutely um each here's different as you know each group is different as you know and and with this ... this year as a group you know half the guys are\nExcellent great basketball IQs they aren't they grasp things quickly they remember things right away and the other half ... not so much is probably the biggest gap between one half of the team and the other that I've ever had and and so the struggle is\nThat the ... the guys that get it All right away want to move on their chomping at the bit already what's next what's next and then the other half\nIs so still so far behind their they're not grasping the basics yet they're not taking it into the competitions yet it's not that they're defiance it's not that at all they're all great kids they just aren't catching on and so\nThe challenge for me and practices how much time do we spend ... teaching and how much time do we move on to basically competing and getting to the next getting the finer details I end up\nOne some of those cases I no not at all but in some of those cases kids who maybe don't have the necessary basketball like you are you in the given sports or that comes from the systems they play piano\nAnd sometimes and those systems they just kind of give drove through the bottom of the foreign say go get them because I've got five kids who can do\nYeah and that's kind of what it is this year with these guys you know the guys that are\nI've got a lot of talent we're we're young team but we are talented probably top to bottom I'm you know maybe one of my better talent groups um\nAnd so these these guys that are struggling with the system and learning how to play at our level they all of them played in systems where they were extremely athletic and they could do some things in the end you're right the coach didn't have to didn't feel he had to do a lot with them and he just let them play and\nAnd as you know that doesn't fly in college and um they're learning where there's been some real noticeable improvements finally this past week but with them and I just everybody there's we're still in progress I work in progress and we've got a ways to go\nNow over the years you had both ends of the coin as far as kids coming from the football program into the basketball program wants football is over some years you've had come get him in that were big contributors for you and other years you've had some kids come in they just never really caught up in um\nHow many kids from there because there's a bunch of athletes on that team do are you expecting this year\nNone of 'em were were everybody's predicting that are football program football team will advance fairly far into the playoffs again this year last year they got to the ultimate end where they were in a bowl game in December and\nThat kind of put the ... the guy\nAnd there was three guys that would've helped us off of that football team that came\nTo practice once they got done and then a week and a half later everybody's going home for Christmas break they they had already made their travel plans to come back two and a half weeks after my guys are all coming back so it just never worked out and so this year you know we just kinda\n... honestly we had a couple of guys ask us and I just said it's just not going to work you know you guys get so far behind and why they do get by and it's and it's just almost impossible to catch up because of our system\nBecause with your early just team workouts I and ah with with the open practice schedule actually starting a little earlier now than it used to seeing all the college level by very good a good month oh All right now right probably more like six seven weeks yeah\nYou're exactly right and no matter how much experience they had in basketball in high school I'm sure it wasn't the same as what we're doing here and and so it's even it's even more difficult because of that so when do we go for real ... is our first game um that's a week I Know a week from Monday\nIt said maybe it'll against their ... and uh\nAnd then we're off and running\nAnd from their ... slow down till mid February\nRight yup it's um you know I've I've I I I adjusted our schedule a little bit this year\nTo the point because I knew were going to be really young and we're not in the lake region tournament this year we're playing a couple of more JV teams and then we've had we've added a team into our conference with Lake Superior college in Duluth adding basketball\nAnd so we lost two non conference games there\nAnd so we've got a little bit more time in the fall here we've got a little bit more time between game which might be okay it is you absolutely we instead of playing games every three or four days now we play on a Monday we got a week to prepare we play on the next Tuesday we got five days to prepare we play on a\nFriday or whatever Saturday or whatever it is and\nAnd again part of that was delivered knowing that we're going to be really young\nI I Know it it's way too early yet to project lineups and project the rotation so on and so forth but the other tough thing for you and for fans listening used to work through the road\nThe thing for you and for fans listening used to work through the rotation because you're dealing with Fifteen guys right now the majority of whom played significant minutes advised school level well the truth is you're only going to play\nSignificant minutes wise nine maybe nine or ten you know ... and the other five or six are going to see minimum at its best at how they handle that matters to\nThat's the ... that's one of the main issues every single year\nUnless I unless we're able to get guys off the high school teams that were role players that were\nWere good enough as role players to contribute to us and there used to that we're always going to have the the that struggle and we're and we're actually dealing with it right now we have a couple of guys that are really unhappy and because of that fact that they were started in high school and now they're not\nRight now anyway they're not in the main rotation and they're and they're having a difficult time with that and I do understand that but I Know that we're gonna we're probably going to lose one or two of these guys and we'll be down to Thirteen\nAnd it's not necessarily a cutting of the herd you'll know it happened\nIt's just what happens is not intentional on our part it's just the fact that some guys can handle that change in their role\nI Know when I was at the at the for your level and and working as a student assistant you've read these stories before but uh [noise] that was one of the big things for me as a student assistant was a sit down with it and say hey look you got to be patient gradients WorldCom yeah it's just a matter of are you ready when you were African re does ... right\nAnd that we've and we've talked we talked about that from day one that the concept of being patient don't let October November taint your mind and change your attitude just keep plugging away because things in December and January are not going to be the same as they are in October\nAnd November gray gray ... whole bunch of stuff that happened right\nBut again you can talk all you want to so young men and bought that type of stuff but yet patience with some of them is just not really in their make up\nWell there's always I'm looking forward to the season the north and find her basketball's always one of the highlights of the year in and day\nYou'd start soon enough All right appreciate it when things go looking forward to seeing on Saturdays All right thanks go to the corner with making it had goats in Brooklyn pioneers we're going to wrap up probably or tennis now and talk with the ... in Denver next\n[noise]\n\nFrom my arm George story for coast to coast and if you listen to this program for a long time you know we deal with all kinds of strange mystery stories on your phone on go on some conspiracy and things like that did you want someone that we look in his shoes that really affect all of us as well\nI don't know what's happening to our pocket

[noise]\nAnd welcome back we wrap up our foreign program for the Senate traveled was a Saturday morning are hard to believe we're at the end of October already November's just around the corner\nAnd we wrap things up with ... probably girls tennis program ah unfortunately things wrapped up at the end of sections is here you didn't get a chance to watch to play down to the state meet but what a good year\nIt was one of the best years I've ever coached I'm I've been with the girls program I told them for about nine years now since back in eighth grade coaching with ... and this has been such a successful year where I I I Can't look back and say we could have done something different um you know the girls gave everything they had throughout the year and uh we we complex what we needed to accomplish\nWhile they'd be the best thing to do for you is a of the kids who did it advanced individually to the section meat and even your team that advanced deeper into the section meat then we're

all the Keith Ellison to drop their plan instead of yours you can learn more state of great men down or people or by the coalition of Minnesota businesses\nWill come back to Minnesota matters I'm Scott Peterson we've explored many facets of the opioid crisis in Minnesota over the course of the last several\nMonths today we're looking at the impact the epidemic is having on rural Minnesota I chatted with Ruth merit director of the Minnesota Farm Bureau foundation about the effects of opioids on farm country\nRural America is being impacted a we have actually even come up to the levels and surpassed the impacts that are happening in our urban areas\nSo that's a concern for the Minnesota Farm Bureau so we feel that it's really important to get out and talk about the issue find out what's going on it from a from a a a legislative standpoint from a the kind of what's happening with health officials\nEverybody's having a conversation with and they're owned apartments and their own areas but we feel that needs to be a bigger conversation with more players and the community so that's really what we're striving to\nKill me Ruth what do we know about why those numbers are increasing in in some cases surpassing in rural areas what's happening in urban areas\nWell in it and they'll remember we're talking about opiates so you know there's lots of different drugs and drugs that are being abused out there\nWhen we specifically talk about opiates um some of the reason is is that you know farmers will get injured hum the prescribe are often times has prescribed more than the needed amount and that dependency on that Dr happens rap you know quickly\nSo rather than um take time to go in for physical therapy or take time to really healed from an injury\nWhat what happens is they just pop another pill and then eventually that dependency happens so think of a farmer you know not often does he you know he wants to leave out farm you know that that crop needs to be harvested outside of the needs to be done in this amount of time I got this ... I don't have time\nTo heal my body or to go into that physical therapy I'm just going to take this path then that dependency happens and often times at the at the hidden problem\nThere is not resources available to the ... the individual\nTo um take care of his his dependency we don't have the treatment facilities in our rural areas oftentimes they have to drive\nA long ways to find a treatment facility or even just get medical help and so we think that those are some of the reasons that this is happening we we're not exactly sure and that's why these conversations and need to be happening\nUm the American Farm Bureau did a survey with morning consult\nAnd we found out that through that and this was a national survey that specifically targeted farmers and ranchers across the United states is that forty five percent of all farmers have been directly impacted by the opioid crisis\nAnd that's a staggering statistic Seventy four percent of farmers and farm workers um they've been directly impacted by the opiate epidemic so that's three and four farmers so we know that we need to be doing work in our real communities\nUm the other statistic that just really jumped out at me was that three and four farmers say it's easy to access large amounts of opiates um without a prescription what that's telling me is that people are leaving unused opioids and their medicine cabinets\n'em or you know in in some cases kitchen coverage or wherever\nAnd they're saving it for a rainy day they're saving up for that time that they don't have time to run in\nFor that nice brainer that ankle spraying or when they might need an a of a pain killer and they're accessing those unused prescription and their medicine cabinet and the state of Minnesota there were over three million prescriptions written\nUm and in terms of and that was in two dollars and Fifteen cents I think you know we're in two thousand Eighteen so\nHow many of those prescriptions that are left on use and that's a big part of what we're doing here and Farm Bureau is that we're distributing we received a grant through\nA partnership with ... and where we're working with a group called a plan to get the message out let people know about resources available to them um by using a website called farm town strong dot org again farm town strong doubt dot org\nAnd also we're distributing um deterrent drug cats\nAh we've given out about five thousand we have another five thousand to um safely dispose of prescription drugs that are in medicine cabinet\nThere are drop off points but not everybody has access to those dropout points maybe those drop off our during certain hours and or on certain days and that opportunity to go in and dispose or those prescription drugs may not be available over well\nIt go in and dispose or those prescription drugs may not be available over well for the real farm family that may have unused prescription\nYou know you mentioned a little bit earlier the hidden nature of the problem and I imagine the one of the aspects of that and one of the challenges is the stigma associated with it would probably make it somewhat difficult for some people to come forward and say that they need help\nUh in in I don't want to generalize too much but I Would certainly anticipate that that would also be the case with farmers is that what you find\nAbsolutely I'm In one of the things that was pointed out in the um research that we saw was that sixty eight percent of Americans and and believe that increasing public relations\nI which we're we're doing here at former we're trying to make that ah that public relations happened that those conversations but also reducing the shame and stigma are key to solving the opiate crisis I'm you or not you know farmers by nature\nUm have a reputation of being a strong and resilient and\nThat perception sometimes has hurt us they had one we want to maintain that were afraid that they're of that stigma of walking in to a recovery center to walk into a doctor's office and oftentimes even than to our loved ones I have an addiction problem\nSo the more that we can talk about it the more that we can reduce the stigma um it is an incredible disease that is really taking over and it's heartbreaking\nI'm In if you look at the opiate overdoses and kind of look at the numbers are we have a growing problem we are not going to you know or can we are not\nGoing to a raft our way out of this crisis is happening in our rural communities\nHere is the most popular Minnesota athlete out of the book um what's her name\nElse\nNo

always make it a very difficult for me right now Dan\nIs that we got everything going on you got you know you've got college football I got the NFL I mean the Lakers would broaden all markets are five and all yeah\nNo\nYeah we're we're watching all this MBA and oh yeah we got the world series going on what made it\nYeah we're we're watching all this MBA and oh yeah we got the world series going on what made it so difficult this week for me is that I Know I'm late to the party on this folks but on Tuesday my daughter a installed the fire stick on my TV so for the first time in my life\nI have Netflix so imagine if you go it's the first week here on Netflix one night I'm watching it on one forty free one forty two Lakers you know if that's what I'm trying to watch what brought I'm trying to watch you know football and trying to watch the world series\nAnd I'm trying to get started with Netflix so the first show I started with is Ozark\nSo I'm I got I'm getting through the first season you know I go one I didn't realize they get like three seconds I the episode is like ... and the ... now I guess that's why the hell do you get hooked on your is this for thirty in the morning right and then all of a sudden you're all hook\nThat they'll come binge watching what you're talking right and I bought a new vocabulary and I also I also know or Netflix and chill I also found that one out in my twenty two year old son I'm\nAll right so I'm All right I'm gonna I'm gonna try to zip through Ozark which is it now its second season so I got to get season one season to where should I go next now I've never seen Breaking Bad try go back in and go through the whole runner Breaking Bad I Am\nI was like you in that I did not watch Breaking Bad while it was right aired we watched it in a binge fashion and it was worth every\nMinute alright so binge of Breaking Bad I saw Mad Men so I I I did watch that series when it was out what else am I going to\nGet into a stranger things is that ranger things everyone keeps talking about is that um us as well Oh yes ... especially the leaders of of that or is there being two seasons okay released around Halloween\nI don't know where the third one yeah and there's a new um an additional episodes of ah making of a murder\nSo he doesn't want every one of ... one of the attorneys I Do have to say what are the attorneys on the case or my sister worked for in Milwaukee but the problem is there's only so many hours in fact we're still having days a week\nAnd they're in the ... and and that's why you have to determine Breaking Bad was what guy six seasons yes as you said you've got your on Ozark and that is\nToo I I did go out and I get maybe\nTwo to three episodes a night that top sit circus at least a month to do break right right and so that's maybe why it's better to see if you were to start out with the ... that may have one or two seats well that's why you had to wear those are because I knew I it's you know so I'm a I'm a I'm going to get through that and then uh so I mean it's just it's\nMind boggling but on top of that oh it's been going on right now we haven't even talked to any NFL today than I got to get to some NFL I mean the NFL weeks or\nYou know it's the the good news for the NFL is your ratings are up\nAnd a lot of people could say there's a couple of reasons for that there are a couple of reasons one scoring is up and that's good for two reasons one it means that your fantasy football teams are scored more points than ever so that's exciting\nAnd also the fact that we have expanded legalized gambling in this country is making more and more people watch the national football league they put out a a a little report on the amount of revenue that each of the four major team sports in this country will generate in a single year based on\nLegalized gambling the NFL checked Senate additional two points three billion annual to point three billion annual so when you have that serious money on the line yeah a lot more people are actually watching the national football league\nConnection of football and because of the fewer opportunities for games also allows you to think that you know a lot more than they can like you never know what's gonna happen you know if you're on the second out of a back to back on an MBA night you know the other team's gonna show up right may maybe you'd be wary of it\nIn baseball the tough enough with allied anyway because it's just difficult plus if there's a number for starter you don't know what they're gonna start bull pending\nFootball though like a lot of us we feel that we know football that were connected to it and so you have the feeling of wanting to dive in and would have a better opportunity of cashing in on your own knowledge and that's what I think football but\nWhether it be the NFL or even of college but really more so of the national football league\nI'm looking at the odds I I go to a site that just sort of a consensus Vegas odds and it's always interesting to me uh watching\nNFL line they move dramatically when I say dramatically more than a point I mean some of the lines have really moved this week for instance um Cincinnati is hosting Tampa Bay the bucks have no defense\nI was on the bangles bandwagon in fact I thought bangles plus six at Kansas City was not a bad play [laughter] forty five dead by the way the air al Michaels slip it in the number is ... so Sunday night game\nForty five to ten the score and al Michaels who is obviously a guy that knows plenty about gambling 'cause he's constantly throwing outlines and everything else did this\nVery discreetly by the way he said it's forty five to ten he goes I Would imagine it was on it I Would imagine the number fifty six and a half is on the minds of a lot of people [laughter] that was the over under on that game I couldn't even imagine the chief score forty five but I mean look on this line here so Cincinnati\nIs hosting Tampa Bay the wide open with Cincinnati minus six now the consensus is mine is three\nAnd a half that's a lot of money going down on him by as a dog at since ...\nI've said Steve for weeks that of just pure titans and wide receivers Tampa Bay has the best collection of pass catchers\nIn the national foot L look in the yard it's Winston putting up every now and it's not ... and it's if you look back to last year there were a couple of stinkers but otherwise you was hovering around that\nThree hundred yard barrier that give or take twenty yards on on both ends and Steve\nIt's a team that doesn't have a consistent running game so you put a bad defense or the team they can't run the ball you know that he's got targets whether it's big place with Sean Jackson or big targets in Mike Evans and OJ Howard\nHampers really good through the air and I think that's why you're seeing what you're seeing with that game it's just because you know Tampa is going to be able to put up ... points it doesn't matter they can't stop anybody they're often says at least going to be able to score and maybe she said that he's run game won't be able to\nTurn up the clock as much against the Tampa Bay team it'll be\nA tight I got three more games the over under on that game by the way the over under right now consensus is fifty four and a half\nOkay that's a big now that little meaty All right here's another line that his move dramatically there's actually a number of this week I've been I watch this a lot and I've never seen a week where there's been more big moose or tour and more point line moves from the initial moved to where they are now another game\nIn the at the raiders\n... dance is open as a pet come\nNow India's a three point favorite at Oakland the thinking obviously is the raiders of just throwing in the town you know I'm Ari Cooper you're thinking that they have lost that it wasn't like Mark Cooper was putting a ban big number no and Martian Lynch placed uninsured reserve high so there's another game here's another one you ready for this this one this is\nA week as long as he doesn't know he's going to start if he doesn't have time to think about it he's fine for a week but then when he knows he's got his start the next week forget it\nThe guy's a metal gate the man went\nIn my car between ... pm eastern Yemen Fox ... all of the NBA is ah\nTo me the most type season ever [laughter] thank you for [noise] are you in because we are\nYou have to raise it to make do with [noise] and\nAnd you can keep it here as we cover this new seats on on on the hog Fox Sports radio\nBut so is your Sunday with Fox NFL kickoff joined some of football's Tom opinion makers as they provide unique perspective and expert analysis we ... am eastern on Fox Channel Fox Sports\n\nThe ... by er with you on this Saturday hope is great Saturday for you it is for us frozen the nose start with Lowes say five percent on eligible purchases everyday made with a Lowe's business credit account that's a five percent savings in store an on line\nSubject to credit approval cannot be combined with other credit offers exclusion supplies the store for details\nUs only uh we've been flying through the Saturday but I can I can sense the anticipation from Dan by it's been a while so yes it's that time [laughter]\nThe high ...\nSpend up to now I don't know a whole lot of listeners know this but I have a Heisman vote insurers to go out there that with a lot of [noise]\nI I Will say this there are a lot of people that I have a high from both yeah if it came down to one vote he's the one that probably should have it like the ice but voters was just I just been voter it probably should be department there are a lot of people that shouldn't have Heisman votes you should have I well I I look at it this\nWay is a passion of mine I Know everything about the history of the Heisman fact I was back in New York last summer with my\nBoys went to the Heisman headquarters and\nUh started rattling up stuff and they looked at me like [noise]\nAll right this then can we get this man out of the building right now nobody should take the Heisman as seriously as you do and that was from the Heisman people need to get a vote I you know I don't know how I got my vote because I got my vote\nBack in twenty ten I actually made a call to the Heisman headquarters Heisman trust\nAnd I was actually telling them I've done a lot of\nStatistical research that I thought they might one for the arc that wasn't looking for money or there's like I've done all this work you might be interesting because they didn't seem all that interested in what they did ask me do you have a Heisman wrote I said no and I said has happened well\nEach other states there's eight hundred and Seventy media members it never changes eight hundred and Seventy needy members six different districts hundred and forty five votes each and there's a certain distribution by state each state as a representative of the states in charge of the hope\nVoters so you go on a waiting list of all I said well how do you lose your vote two ways either you leave the state that you're voting in or you die [noise]\nThose are the only way I was probably you know I get on the list now I didn't know the guy that was sort of running the LA the California show and I said well I mean I could be on this list forever\nHe goes I Know but\nAll of a sudden he gives me a call a couple of months later\nI got good news for you to stay there is a vote available and shoot you the top of the list\nI'm like who died he goes he didn't die but pat hate and just became the athletic director USC and head or fit his boss\nWhen you're outliving director of the university so I took over pat Hayden's voting twenty and [noise] and I'm proud of happy and that's a victory for UCLA in itself and by the way I look at it and why ... pattern a couple of years after that and thank him for\nTaking that job either so that's how I have a high speed boats so each week I give you my three two one I don't go beyond that 'cause my final ballot only has three spots on it\nWhere do I stand this is true last week's games here as my current number three Haskins is going to\nRoll back the fifty looking fires middle of field\nGoing be from a corner they\nIn a car and in a fight for the phone\nOn a corner you one yard pass court asking summit foreign\nHigh it's very difficult for a guy to hang onto a top three spot when your team just got walloped forty nine to twenty by the way that courtesy of the aisle Ohio State I Am the network but\nWhen you look at Haskins numbers four hundred and Seventy yards passing two touchdowns only one pick he leads the nation in passing yards he leads the nation in touch down fats [noise]\nSo your guy Dwayne Haskins is still hang it on my balance\nThey've got weapons that there is a gather they've just\nThat's good news is still hanging on my ballot\nThey got weapons that there is a gathering they've just lost Austin Mac like good for the rest of the regular season\nBut they've got four other guys that are dangerous threats in the past the game and we just talked about the buccaneers last segment was beats a little similar to the fact that they can't run the ball right now in the defense just acceptable but giving up yards at the place which allows Dwayne Haskins to get you to pass\nUp quarterback he's more talented than brags Millard ... or ... Jones as a path yeah yeah and I was more talented way more high so Dwayne Haskins is my current number three here's my current number two [noise]\nTwenty five thirty one hurry to get around it sounds\nOn to try to make it a seven point\nLead role in from all airfield where the call Tyler murdering another brilliant game two hundred and thirty are expensive for touchdowns nope back twenty five touchdowns on the air just three picks he's also run for corn and twenty yards by touchdowns remember this is it for him is college football career ends this year\nHe will then move on to his full time baseball career won't even come back for a senior at Oklahoma\nMove and hey joined an aids organization that could be in the postseason for the next few years\nI mean he's like Charlie Ward was you know Charlie war was a runaway Heisman winner never even thought about the NFL went straight to the NBA at a solid\nTen year career in the NBA just to Marjah remembered great yesterday and wide receiver ends up being a picture of the big like All right so we got Haskins that three Maria too I Wonder who's that number one here now on the snap rolling writers to off a ... or the end zone\n\nHe like gold just calls him by his first name at the goal from Larry field we now know his name and damned buyer just brought this up to me [noise]\nTongues via law [noise]\nTong go buy a lower [noise] All right do we have the clip but here\nFor the last ... you can come all vinyl hung for aids oh we lost [noise]\nAll right so that's to pronouncing his own name so even though it's spelled had go by law it's actually Congo\nViolent there it is a tongue up by law so I was in this way it was sort of like when Matt Weiner won the Heisman and he was introduced as Matt Weiner hard\nAnd I'm like Asian his name is Ellie I. N. A. R. T. Matt Lyon heart [noise]\nDo you see an agent in its Matt Weiner [laughter] it sounds like a eighties hair band right what did you are and then of\nCourse mark is more a Yoda Mario that it's not America's Mary Yoda it's more kids more ...\nTo Mario Mario though the grey metal Mazda Mario [laughter] fact that he got the mall right but then put an all at\nThe end of his name the commissioner doing it it just again we have you ... if you want the Heisman Trophy okay\nYou shouldn't I mean Danny Werfel was one of those guys were waffle I mean when you looked at it as like ... where where are we going with that name but I think you should be able to pronounce the name of a guy that comes away with college football's biggest price\nThat it takes a while and this is the problem yeah and I said ... been in the league how long for the Milwaukee bought yes and people in the first couple of years just like I don't remember going to know what I'm going to try it either way you lead yeah then you start to you're like OK this guy's going to be pretty good now it could be the league's MVP is an all star every year\nYou have to know his name but\nThey make sure chefs gate was outweigh all his basketball of his first few years it looked out he's going to be fired so why even worry about it and the next thing you know they're in the championship game\n... what a way to go to shut down where to get the chef decay but he was just just gives just remembers the ... the ... W s K out there as that's the easiest way to do at\nAt a um at Iowa State right now is that I Would get ... and doing our job yeah you expect at some point he's going to end up getting a job\nAnd Ryan Day the guy who took over for urban and those three games that he was suspended if he does it get a then they get old Bruce from Iowa State yeah it could have been\nThink I I think girl Bruce was originally a head\nYeah it could have been I think I I think girl Bruce was originally a head coach yeah Iowa State high high so\nSo so so now you've got you got to do you think could be perfect era parents it's urban is it all the way yeah the question is is if there's friction between him and Jean Schmidt the the what she denied this week is Jean Schmidt try to make a move and say outright urban you know it's we appreciate your turn around the program you'll you'll brought a national championship after the scandal that was was year before that\nNew era or do you just let urban Meyer do whatever Myers done because he's done the last five or what he's done the last five or six\nOr Gavin ... was it I was over for a woody I knew he had some Bruce it has to be for that I'm All right I'm going to ask you on a personal level that\nAre are you all in for urban Meyer for as long as he wants to be there or do you think the time you might be right to make a change\nI I I give him the leeway he could stay as long as he wants\nAnd I felt the same way with Jim ... I I even trust will even more so right or what you did with that well he always beat Michigan see they're not translated as well you obviously John Cooper cannot be Michigan no matter how many good teams he had he couldn't beat Michigan ... said the day was hired we will beat Michigan when he was one time in Michigan\nThey lost you know they lost in two thousand three right yeah and that was it that was that yeah that was that was the only time the other thing that an end to that point Steve there was no coincidence that Michigan took a drop when Jim trust all was the head coaches well\nOhio was so many good kids in high school right you think of the greats from Ohio where it was Desmond Howard from yeah where it was Charles woods in\nFrom all your crossovers all over yeah you guys go to Ohio said back in that sense went up right they weren't going to Michigan they were staying\nIn Ohio now urban has been able to recruit nationally and bring it you know the boats are brothers from Florida to different places but for that time period of that Jim Crow era kids weren't living\nAlone would you know that it's time to make a change how could you sense that whatever magic urban Meyer has is over\nI think if you have a couple of more lawsuits like you had a pretty remember they had the one last year against Iowa yeah where maybe just the message isn't there but the way they responded ended up dominating Michigan in the road game secure worked in the big game one the cotton ball against us see\nIf you have a couple of those next year that would probably be assigned because\nLook pretty just lost the Michigan State off of that when\nA last week a looking so great they go on the road and they end up losing by the end of the Spartans\nMaybe shows yeah the teams get up for it but there's no reason that it has to be losing back thirty points to any team in the big tent\nWhere the guy go Fox Sports radio studios some big college games are kicking up more to be played later we'll give it all the latest coming up next [noise]\nFinally does analytics show didn't think of Dodgers games\nAs your fans rejoice says your team gets with Dr advantage when it comes to the world series\nYour coverage is right here on Fox Sports radio [noise]\nThis story is called the ugly truth about Tom share everything that you've done your family fiber about buying a timeshare you need my help hello I'm shot McDowell CEO and founder of Wesley financial group ten years ago I started helping votes cancelled our timeshare contracts and then the process started what's now called\nThe Tom shirt cancellation industry Tom shares the only thing that you can buy that you can't tell me how much is going to cost or when it's going to end when you buy time share you give them a blank check to fill out any amount they want for annual maintenance and assessment they sound crazy\nThe crazy thing is there's never ends even when you die your families now going to be stuck with this burden stop the insanity to stay\nCalm office now I guarantee if we can't cancer timeshare contract you'll pay nothing\nCall for your free information kid eight hundred forty six Ninety six hundred that eight hundred forty six Ninety six hundred eight hundred and forty six Ninety six hundred [noise] oh my goodness\nReally travel back at it again [laughter] covering these\nThree guys who bought off college players and the guys who were in high school gave money to their families in order for them to go to particular colleges and the FBI got involved in investigating and mayor now all three of the people who were convicted of this case a criminal case\nCriminal case now all three of the guys who are involved and giving money to these high schoolers families are now going to federal prison\nFor multiple years these guys all have family I put my lawyer had on here five of the belief that people should go to prison only in my opinion if they are making\nThe country worse or less safe\nBreak so if there is a white collar crime that is in St Louis dangerous that makes our country's economy less safe and put people in prison if you are physically violent and you are a danger to the rest of society go to prison\nIf you are paying a high school kids family\nTo go to college I fail to see how there is a crime being committed here at all other than potentially maybe tax

Hey David\nHow you doing something me this World Series sample what's the matter with baseball\nBats make it that the average pants feel stupid they don't know what they're watching what other sports that you have to go to the NBA Finals not like Iran and clay aren't going to wait at night because the computer says the match on Good Friday or threaten the\nKeep your stars on the ... the old people could understand what they're watching if a if you're telling me about your three home run hitter can't I'm like I don't even understand the sport I think your best players not weigh the costs of this but\nI'm telling you may want to catch all it's a power trip in Port world you have to keep the stars on the field for chat about the\nDamage that I think it's incredibly well said budget track this listen Rob Manfred right at the all star break talked about publicly about why might trout is it more popular and he talked about all the different things that go into making a store more popular in in a public setting yet\nBaseball as David just detailed\nSeems to go to the ends of the earth to keep their stars down you talked about the unwritten rules so therefore they cannot show emotion are now are they cannot even always play ah the starting pitcher the stars starting pitcher where's he going to go\n... your your yanked in the fourth inning the first time you throw curve in the dirt because somebody thinks oh you're tired and the next guy in the on deck circle is a you know got about five hundred batting average against you so all of these things put together tell me the baseball does not understand\nThe equation of how to make us are\nNo they certainly don't like it should be a game where you're trying to elevate the stores\nAre and everything is about playing the hits we talk about a new t._v. what I'm saying we talk about um radio you want to make sure that you're talking about you're celebrating you're promoting the people that the best in your sport and so\nIf baseball doesn't have the wherewithal to uh know that look we need to elevate of stores you to put them on the big stage we let our homerun hitters have the opportunity to hit home runs so they can draw more fans then that's stupid on the airport\nUm let's go to Nick in Nevada Nick we're a little up against the bill passed in two minutes a real quick what do you want to say [noise]\nWhy they've got a nice talking to your own I Believe that all of the points that have been made so far between you guys and all the callers are very valid and I agree that you know those are all parts of why are the ratings are down and we're having a hard time watching baseball but I also think that\nThe national sports media also has a little part of in that because\nOn them either football is such a great game and everybody loves it but the national sports media blows it off and that's all they covered that's all they talk about\nAnd I have heard a few national sportscasters one mainly on Fox that worked in the afternoon time or you know the brains are are that it was about a group of buffalo uh he he mainly him he\nHe bashes baseball during the season and then most of our our fiesta around then he starts\nTossing covering itself well don't believe that I don't need to have something to do with\nThat and then I'll I'll just say this in bucks yeah I don't know what's your perspective is Nick thank you um this is a classic chicken or the egg conversation that I think we have gone on radio a lot\nOf the media does not have an interest in blowing something up or before they know if you want to watch it it works the other way around the media is going to follow football because the data that we get shows that that's what you want\nThe media no longer talks in the mainstream about hockey why it's not because they don't like it I have a lot of friends and media were diehard hockey fans will soon worried about it on the air why is it can't don't get called the boss's office because the data says that won't work\nThe anthem right now that it was weird though you know what they did the other we were in I think we're we're in Atlanta I Believe in the playoffs they actually there were ... in the stands and they came down and they practice the anthem on the field with bands and the stands like at six o'clock if they didn't know what to do so it's better to practice sitting around drinking beers thereby kind of stand\nUp their lives you know just a dress rehearsal town [noise]\nOh my gosh the game itself three and a half hours away everybody know why am\nI here yeah water what why are they are why the why am I I don't know I'm a very sick says\nMan right out of them may then I've got ...\nAnd you and your kind of ... when\nA crate today's game is half as long as yesterday oh half has just happened while I'll take that as well\nI I mean that are being my goodness All right Bill thanks bye see ya got\nOkay bill ...

there there's not a thing that I hear right now and then add this game and what's happening or there there's not one thing I hear that would suggest that he'll be back next year\nOkay so here's the thing with as seen who does is the higher [noise] like is one thing to say okay we can move on from clay hill right who are they going to bring it who was a hard hit coaching Kennedy that can handle the fresh in expectation that comes along with being in as the coach\nUm I I don't know who's out there because there are many big names that are out there\nHow about ... of it or they can't do that [laughter] I'm okay with it but they can't do that you know you're not okay I Am okay where they came with it you know they're not doing that\nI think I ... what do you think about this I think that at USC [noise]\nThis is a a a lesson I got from a good friend one time in my professional circle\nWhere a job that I had came to an end and the first thing you do whenever I whenever something like that happens in your life as you look for where else you can replicate the same thing you're like oh it was qualified to do this now let's go do the same thing over here and that friend said to me be careful about trying\nTo repeat history because it rarely works you cannot when something is kicking and click and\nYou can't just snap your fingers and make it happen again and I would get that same advice to us see that from the moment Pete Carroll got there\nAnd had lightning in a bottle every single time they have hired a new coach\nThey've tried to like scrape up he's off of the tree of what was there before with the Carol and you know ... and then there's there every single one is attached to the previous one it doesn't work it ... it's time to just do something completely new\nYeah I mean I absolutely agree like they have to find somebody there's different somebody that's not necessarily from the tree\nI'm I just don't know like the thing is clear was inexperienced coach um can they take a hike coordinator making a coach can they find a guy who was doing it at a smaller program and make\nThem the uh the name that is going to come up a per se is obviously going to be urban Meyer because of the stuff that's going on at Ohio State I feel like he's disgruntled he's not happy being at the Ohio State university right now\nMaybe maybe this is their opportunity to swoop in and have him come and build a powerhouse it is see\nThat's a tough law that's tough public ... public relations play\nOn a ... at a place that has had its share over the years that would be a difficult press release to write\nThe will be but you know what they want to win right yep something when they when they get to keep your tires and all the guys who are no winners and all I hear you I hear you 'cause it 'cause 'cause the other thing is I don't know like I don't know who's that you can't bring\nA Tom Herman from Texas because even though he grew up in LA ah seamy valley played ... Lutheran yet Texas\nSeems to be turned around and wrote and he's not going to do their job to come to the\nRight and they miss their chance on Chris Petersen\nYeah we missed their jail\nThere that now that's and that's the well I'm Talking about is like you had a chance to do something new and and you often to stick\nWith your your your G. Carroll tree and you made a mistake you did you absolutely did make a mistake\nUm yeah so ah anyway that's just something to keep an eye on I don't think it's going to be a mid season deal um but uh at this point I'd be shocked if a if play out in his back I work with a bunch of Brooks Fox Sports radio morning brown with for\nSports business reporter but also just a massive baseball fan and so he'll be perfect today he's coming up in about Fifteen minutes would be perfect due to dive into some of this stuff\nOr if you're just joining us or the ratings are down they'd been down across the board games one two and three for two of the highest profile baseball teams you could ever imagine with close games at big stars and even last night's drama the ratings are down and those first three\nGames have gone up against a total of nothing in sports\nAnd I they will go up against afternoon and evening college football tomorrow night they'll go up against Drew Brees incurred cousins they are going to get smashed apps reading it is going to be out of epic proportions and it is my hope as a baseball fan that that is the moment\nThat is the moment and that is the data that is the analytic\nThat baseball will put its arms around and say we need to make change and I am with you by she in that I'm not sure exactly how you get this across the teams but the analytics generation needs to go away it does not mean that you can't use data it does not mean that you cannot use math there's always been math\nIn baseball just look at the back of a baseball card however you cannot let that math\nGoes so over the top that you decide we don't need to be entertaining anymore provided that we are correct in terms of our percentages\nThis for me the watershed moment is the Dodgers going to the game one of the world series and sitting there top for a homerun hitters because there was a lefty on about that is an absolute you don't watch your fans and you cannot do it that is you do not work all year to get to the world series so that you can dump your best players on the bench\nNo I mean no one wants to see I mean no one wants to see that no one wants to see your ...\nI mean no one wants to see I mean no one wants to see that no one wants to see your for home run hitter sitting on the sideline because\nUh analytics told you wasn't a good play but here's what I Want to kind of spin a little way from baseball but more to the analytics crowd in general or how did you feel about past Sherman going for two on the Monday Night game when they were down fourteen\nYeah I think he is currently I Believe it's over thinking it it doesn't bother me that much like whatever your thought is on what makes the most sense percentage wise but here's why I laughed at that I laugh at that because every coach will go to the press conference just like sure are dead and and they'll say well\nWe've run the numbers and uh it says that that's the right thing to do well no you didn't you un numbers that are global you ran numbers for all football teams\nThat means if you buy them you believe all quarterbacks at the same you believe all receivers at the same you believe all off in some lines of the same and they're not so you can't tell me the analytic when you're down fourteen points you scored a touchdown since we should go for two\nAnd then we're going to expect the same result whether your quarterback Aaron Rodgers or your quarterback like Miami\nThat's why that made me laugh because it's an analytic that's true but it's it's it's being received in a fake way\nI'm a little bit I I I think like here's a here's the thing like the more because they got for print out on like\nTo get the rest of what ... says pod cast it by searching out kick the and it's always you can hear I'll get the coverage with clay Travis weekdays at six am eastern three am Pacific right here on Fox Sports radio is the\nTime and time again about LeBron James being a Laker and he's just been completely supportive I kind of thought he really doesn't want LeBron to see but you know what I'm starting to believe that he does\nThis is his place he was here for Twenty years I'd live live around the field I think he was Lubrano fluff\nYou are listening to the trouble with Chris Broussard Enron Parker see about that we said that seven pm eastern port be emphasis it back\nOn Fox Sports\nFan mail or show\n\nThe giants in raiders have decided by NFL standards we are going to take one of the\nThings that ... ball people bragged about said it was there they never mailed it and then you can have baseball teams give up to throw up the white flags and basketball teams do it but he says boarded with what Paul DNA than\nMount nights at two AM eastern eleven pm Pacific Fox Sports

built to save you time and money by allowing you to compare multiple quote options all on line so head to progressive dot com today and see if you can say [noise]\nOkay with Russia broke Margaret Willard Fox Sports radio [noise] we got to get into a program abroad and a little bit later this hour about oh yeah oh my gosh and you might need to punch me on the\nFence okay I Can't take it anymore and you can't take it anymore you\nKnow a lot of that will be my battery is I Can't take it anymore I Will get to that are coming up at about fifty minutes or so but right now\nWe're getting more a Brown in here the absolute perfect voice for today here's why more brown with for sports business reporter also a national baseball writers so therefore understand and it's a huge baseball fan so more you're all over baseball yet you're also all over sports business\nAnd right now those two things don't seem to be getting along very well\nIf you ask me like games one two and three all stood alone on the sports landscape with two flagship franchises close games big stars\nRatings are still down now we go into the weekend they're going to get killed by the saints and Vikings tomorrow night in my opinion what is baseball and they do\nWell I mean it's a great question I mean you mentioned in it in their two storied franchises I mean if you're going to sit down and try this out\nIn their two storied franchises I mean if you're going to sit down and try and map this out you know I mean you you probably couldn't have put to better together I mean the Yankees maybe but I mean they hadn't met since Nineteen twenty four I'm so you had this long tenure they're both in two huge markets\nUm I don't know what baseball does I mean look I think I think the thing that everybody and look this is not\nJust me the commissioner and the folks at Fox or trying to grapple with is why and you know you could sit there and look at maybe this idea of bolt pending um has lost a lot of average viewers the fact that um the bloom is maybe a little bit off the bus in terms of\nYou know the it's just not as compelling anymore to have Boston when as many World Series is they have it's quite different than two thousand four so I'm\nCourtney [noise] quite a bit of play\nHere and let me jump in on their morning so you can clear throat a little bit but ah yeah quite a bit of play for sure I think some of the things you're talking about all come from the same place don't they would you analytics I mean that's what I was saying earlier I'm and I'm analytics maybe rights they may be mathematically correct they're not funds from fans\nIt's not fun to tune into the Dodgers on game one of the world series and their top for homerun hitters are on the bench that just seems silly\n[noise] yeah I mean you know certainly if you looked at this I mean last night's game was a record setter for\nA number of things I mean we went through Eighteen pictures and that tells you a lot when you look at how many hits that were which is either tells you that where there's a lot of swing and Mrs or there's a case where everybody's so closely\nAligned in terms of being able to hit that you get that the I think I get it you know you're like hey let's go ahead and make sure that we're ready left you mash\nUps and let's keep those guys sitting on the bench we saw that there was a little bit of a change in the lineup for game three that didn't seem to move the needle dramatically one way or an or another and I just think that people are trying to sit there trying to figure out you know which of these teams are there look the other thing clearly is\nThe red Sox are an awfully good baseball team I mean look they they handled\nI'm not only the Yankees but the Astros both teams hundred wind teams handily\nAnd I think that there's something to say about that I think that people are like wow this is\nJust you know there's no Cinderella there's nothing really to look forward to here and I just think that it it looks like two became is trying to slug it out and then once again I just don't know if there's that much in terms of a compelling story line I keep waiting for many Machado to break out I kept waiting for him to not swing it at\nPictures up and out of his own he just cannot seem to lay off a high hot stuff so you know it's starts to become highly predictable\nYou know more so much of the conversation the leaders in ... in a lunatic thin or analytics ruining the game we see in the deepest and she is we're making it very difficult for hitters a divine holes in the defense what do you think about the process or\nWhat do you think of the impact in the middle of the game and can we blame analytics for some of the lack of viewership when it comes to people wanting to watch the game\nNo I I'm not going to put this an analytic Fiedler guys I'm I'm a huge proponent of it now there is a shift I think you know probably something that makes it difficult we thought for the longest time I came from the school that it was like hit it where there ain't right I mean if if your shipping everybody over to one side of the field and by golly hit the other way\nAnd we're not seeing that what we're seeing our batters deciding you know what if I hit it out of the ballpark it doesn't matter where you put people on the field I'm just going to drive it out where you can't get to it and so I think we see a lot of that I mean strike outs were up we had more strike outs and hits this\nYear it was just you know it's kind of an odd state right now so I don't know I mean ... are largely though I think in the world series we've seen a little bit more\nStation to station plan spots which I think it's interesting you know but I mean still overall I think we're just looking for some kind of compelling story and I think guys since since the the cubs won and broke that futility streak and the red Sox broke their\nFused to lease street look last year was up\nAnd I think maybe that has a little bit to do with once again kind of having two big markets in there that don't have you know big stories for whatever reason that's the only reason I mean last year was up and I don't think the players change that dramatically other than how the ... are being used and look if you use a bunch of pictures and have a lot of commercial breaks\nGames are going to get along and people are going to switch the channel\nMore brown with for sports business reporter is with us mark and Bucky Fox Sports radio\nMaury how much of this is off you know I I don't know baseball always assessing what's the problem is well 'cause it's like oh we need to move quicker and like well football games are just as long oh we need more scoring well soccer's grid going you know going up in popularity\nWhat is this just two thousand Eighteen and and we may not have the attention span for something like baseball\nNow I think that's really what it is and this is the difference guys between the idea of pace and link the games and they're they're somewhat related but they you know they aren't in other words look if you if you're both panning and use a lot of pitchers every time that they pull somebody out of the book and we're going to a commercial break and that just loses your momentum\nWhen you had starters that could go you know maybe as many as seven or eight innings right you could have some sense of momentum\nAnd that was really something they kept people view to the television I think that that is a large part of this you know they tried to take care of this by limiting mound visits and you know that's helped 'em in you know we no longer have four pitches to get on base if you want to automatically walk somebody\nBut I Do think that there's something to be said about the Christmas of games and that's something that just doesn't want to buy very well there's something about games that move along at a good pays that's different than the length of games\nLike more a real quick you're a baseball fan you're watching these games do you think that these are good baseball viewing games\nYou know what I don't and I mean that's\nThat's a hard thing for me to say I thought that this year in general was just kind of down and it just largely is that thing I keep looking for some sense of movement to the games themselves look it's a World Series I'm not going to miss a second of it and they're great plays and great moments\nEvery single game I I just cannot stress that enough but the thing about it is is they seem to be getting stretch further apart due to how this is getting broken up so I don't know how you deal with the guys I don't know what Rob Manfred can do pitch clock sure maybe but if you're still using eight hundred pitchers again\nMean I'm sure it is a work around I'm sure it can be communicated a but let's just say they're playing on the up in up I Am sure that the way that baseball is done now with the analytics and and the like that before the game a day robbers meets with the people who have the numbers and have the book they talk about\nTime to go strategies before the game who will be the first pinch hitter who's going to be the first uh get off the bench rigging this situation going through all the different scenarios\nSo even though they may not talk today Roberts uh in real time in the moment there's certainly been a kind of like a undivided gushing over how they want to play this game who they want to utilize in one of the best time to utilize certain parts of your person on the roster\nEight seven seven million

now the U.S again [noise] our law and the guy go far once radio studios fifty minutes with that if it's been present a montage drugs that are Tom for favorite quote so I'm seeing some people on Twitter criticize her backwards look I was just happened\nTo his ah thirty one it's one of the day that the top [noise] there's about\nMinute and change to go in to get us he does not have any time about their use quarterback breaks through the line on the run\nAnd he's got nothing but green grass in front of him or he takes it all the way to the house so scores you touched down you're going to head with just over ... minutes ago but now you're given the ball back us see mhm and some people that huh\nBut now you're given the ball back to you I see mhm and some people say harm you gotta you gotta have you got to have you guys know\nIn that situation to just fall down because then you Neil out the clock and the games over instead now as he's got the ball in theory they could get a touchdown and go for an arm sidekick\nAnd tied the game if they get that on site kick\nWell they did just scored a touchdown and now with thirty five seconds they're only down by three again and doubt to conduct an armed sidekick and we'll see if they get it you know they probably won't but uh let's say ball bounces up in the air now asked your coverage and so they'll escape\nBut in that situation I always go why are we blaming the coach like in you you coach at the high school level don't these players like they're big enough to know that that thought and that idea aren't they\nKnow more you'd be surprised pro players on big enough really hits you really really you have to kind of talk\nI'm over and over about situation awareness so one of the teams that\nHas always been the best team when it comes to a situation of football has been to New England patriots and one of the reasons why is because they are committed to not only talking about those situations\nThey practice those situations Bill Belichick gifts pop quizzes on those situations and when I've asked other coaches well why is New England so good and everyone knows that they're good at situational football how come everybody isn't that good\nHe said because of the coaches are lazy and they don't want to spend the time that goes into being good situation of football usually they don't want to take the time to go over all of those scenarios they don't teach it they don't spin\nThey don't go to the level of detail that build a check in the patriots go same thing down in Alabama when it comes to Nick statement\nThey are detailed meticulous about making sure that their players understand situations at all times and most coaches don't have the band with nor the discipline to say that I'm a make sure that all my players truly understand\nSituational football they'll give lip service but the actions don't always match up with the words\nWell play to win that game I Will I Will back\nYou up on this you know I Know a handful of guys who who used to play for the patriots and it's it's not like other systems I mean they do they they refer to it is I don't know if they use the word jail but it's like they don't they don't when you're a patriot you don't have a life you're not allowed to have a life\nAnd so it's it's ... taking the time to go over each scenario doesn't just mean like oh boy state after work a few minutes no no no I mean it's like ballot check his round the clock\nAnd okay so ... so so I Do it in terms of you and I'm working on this rocket okay so the night before you always send me a very detailed emailed on hey here the topics here's what we're going to cover\nAll the way we live in and then I'm going to view yeah\nYeah like he is what we got [noise] or whatever\nOkay well let's think about maybe some of the guys that you work with who don't have that level of detail and who don't have that level of attention to all of the things and how your show may suffer because their preparation isn't up to your level\nWill when we talk about these games and most games and football and decided by seven points are less will the guys that are really committed in focus to really make sure that their players understand\nThe details how you win games and those things they're the ones that when Marty shutting Homer told me a long time ago when I was playing against that he said this and it resonated\nI'm more games are lost than one if you can just go out and get your team not to lose the game many don't turn the ball over don't have a lot of penalties make sure you understand what you're supposed to be what you're supposed to do when you're supposed to do it\nYou wind the overwhelming majority of all your games and looking at how his career played out he wants you and your games and yet people are taking the tests were not winning in the playoffs right but each and every year he won ten or eleven games\nJust because he wouldn't lose games and then you may not win a championship like that but you will always be in the hunt if you can kind of buy into a let's make sure we do the things that we can control if we can control the control room and a lot of games\nWell I mean I'll also just add that just because the kid didn't fall down doesn't mean Hermeto works didn't tell him to the other thing I should other things like well blamed recall she was like well I don't know if I I who knows what he told them right\nYeah you you never know because you can tell man we we've sold\n[laughter] around over and over again light so the two weeks ago\nWhen I came a late because I was coaching my game on a Saturday\nAt the end of the half his the balls on the thirty nine yard line they're eleven seconds left the other team does not have a timeout hitters third Nineteen so all you tell your players we all the time out and said hey\nDon't let him out of bounds don't let him throw it over the head you know what happens mark\nThey threw it over our head for a touchdown so you can talk about it and it still may not clicking resonate with the player\nNo brother I got three kids you don't need to tell me [laughter] it sounds like things are just that the people that they ignored [laughter] I mean is it is a five minute by five minute thing yes I have heard the words of my house what did I just [laughter]\nSad why why did I say to let that adds a yes though it's a it is it is difficult or by the way I wanted to follow up with you because it was last week\nYou said and I got some ideas on how to fix the shah of watts it did you see those things on Thursday night\nI did I fix them you so you say that affects them look a lot of people that want to thank you man I Know\nA couple of things that are played out the last two weeks since I wrote the article about the show us and its on reading NFL dot com I Am and that's my guy guy he just shot\nI'm Lamar Miller has been a factor when it comes to running the ball I talked about they need to take pressure of the shower and wash them by run into football\nThe last couple of weeks they've been able to run the football will and because of that it's played out last two games the more ... has had over one hundred yards in each of those games on the ground\nWhen you can run the ball it allows your quarterback to play in a comfort level and allows your team to control the game the other thing I talked about we'll full of needing to be a factor a willful there in the show was and had a major connection\nLast year he uses vertical guy he could push it down to feel\nLast two games real father had made some place now fortunately willful the towards they feel on Thursday night and he's not going to be and he's not gonna be available to them so they're gonna have to find another deep threat\nBut they found out that they're able to get ready to return from the Sean by asking him to do less not more fewer pass attempts\nFuel responsibilities allow him to play and I don't want to say as a gay manager but really\nKeep them on a pitch count don't expose them to so many hits because he was getting beaten to a pope the first few weeks of the season\nThey are now beginning to play kind of a ball control style and that is allowing him to flourish more teams need to do that with a young quarterbacks they're running game matters even though this league is shifting to a passing league\nAnd they didn't want to keep the begin with because he can't tell you they're changing can't tell his own players hey we're tanking jog godly\nWendy's during the um eastern he's much more well rounded knocks\n... for\nThe past the Mexican Americans how fresh independent tax big twelve\nMid America something about Britain usa\nAll of your schools are ramps right here\nYour legs for Fox Sports radio\nSo your Sunday with Fox NFL kickoff joined some uh football's Tom opinion makers as they provide unique perspective and expert analysis we actually have some are on a ... am eastern on Fox Fox Sports [noise]\n\n\n[noise] yeah that's the Georgia Bulldogs radio network and the second touched down to the game for Jeremiah Harlem and are now joins us to live on Fox Sports radio we are going to move wrecked euchre back about ten minutes but he'll do join and let's get Jeremiah Jeremiah congratulations on the Web\nSite you something that you got to go into those we're uh we're doing fantastic are good for you guys I I I Wonder\nCertainly Everytime you go play you you you try to win but I Wonder is now that you've been on a top ten team you guys sort of feel like you have one of those signature when necessary to impress the people who vote on this kind of thing\nA lot of like it weighs a lot uh honestly you know it's it's up there and they can they can be a lot of people you know the daughters and things like that we came out we play the game that we need to come out successful\nYou know you're talking about the world's largest cocktail party or how does what does that robbery mean being on the Georgia side of it\nIt was great I mean uh non non history and stuff like that just on his first time since the eighties the Georgia is one ... years so I mean knowing that we're a part of that no one I was a big contributor today I mean that's that's great\nAnd right now Jeremiah you guys this when and and the opportunity to play\nKentucky next week or if you guys when that you guys are going to you know how to control your own destiny in the SEC ease and obviously then it sets up potentially down the road you guys might be able to face Alabama how bad the do you want to play that game\nI mean it's not really about like who are blind which is whoever whoever's in the way whatever you have to do to get what we want to because we we we don't want it in a closed book too early so that's that's really what it is you know\nJim are you guys are forcing because you have to really really good quarterback today obviously Jake from headed going Seventeen to twenty four two hundred and forty three touchdowns but talking about the quarterback situation Jay from Justin feels or to both of those guys bring to the table\nOr I mean liberal I'm there to different types of quarterbacks but ah you know not knowing that I saw this on uh they they correct each other they they make each other better in the day this is what they do so that's that's what it boils down to uh so yeah and that's that's really helpful for us 'cause I mean we don't really have a bet there's a quarterback situation\nJeremiah Harlem and Georgia receiver joining us by sports radio how different is the life of a receiver are based on who is the quarterback you know different styles oh what what what is different for you in those scenarios [noise]\nOh what the I mean really we don't lose the or who their quarterback just knowing uh they both get the job done basically are both of them are on the tape will know do we gotta do to do everything so yeah\nJeremiah we really appreciate it a few minutes here Tom thank you and she grabs again no problem OK\nOkay Jeremiah Harlem in Georgia receiver with a couple of thoughts down today at Georgia Tech South Florida vi final uh thirty six Seventeen\nAnd now they're on the road at Kentucky as kind of jarring Bucky to look at their schedule and seeded Kentucky is a twelve reading him in the nation I'm like I'm On the right I'm On the football page right I Can't really be Kentucky is writes wealth in the nation\nI mean is unbelievable but they look they have some really good players a student a really good job getting those are getting Kentucky on track then a dog fight right now they are a play in Missouri but the person in both zone therefore you're going in down forty nine but they are playing really really well on defense\nThey will be a stiff challenge for the Georgia Bulldogs\nAnd when I think about Georgia or is unique that you have two quarterbacks that can both stored and make a ton of plays Jake from obviously these guys to the national title game of seasons ago um he has become ability but a kid playing behind and just appeals was no more\nRecruit in the country become quarterback um Jeremiah mentioned iron sharpens aren't the competition at the quarterback position normally it can kind of praying fracture team\nBut in Georgia for whatever reason it seems like it's working we'll see how they continue to play out with this team did in the middle\nIt was like his working we'll see how it continues to play out with this team did in the middle of a hut to go get a national title\nOr keep you up to date on that Kentucky Missouri game right now Kentucky has moved the ball in Missouri Territory they're closing in on about a minute to go\nFourteen to nine Missouri leads Kentucky Rick euchre will join us in about five minutes while we're talking about quarterbacking all eyes as we approach the trade deadline seemed to be on the raiders because they've been the most active\nIs Derek are going to get moved it certainly feels like you walk but Bucky I was interested to read your article that you have this week where you wrote view where of the draft than Rick rebuild for John grew in what do you mean by that what do you think's gonna happen next is running everyone\nIs excited because I think we all see ourselves as general managers because fantasy sports it allows us to kind of have their own theme so we think hey man drafting is just either we'll just go drafted players that we need and poof\nA waiver to replace the ... replacing them more Cooper and get whatever we need right away and that would immediately changed the fortunate the franchise\nWhen you go back and you really look I'm drafting in the first round is a fifty fifty proposition in terms of you hit rate in terms of hitting ... not only at like a starter but a high level player and so those five picks over the next two years were saying maybe they'll get two and a half players\nThat can play at a high level where the trick is I'm\nIn the league in history you haven't seen people have success when they've had multiple picks and the first round fine to a more pro ball players that can reach that status in multiple seasons so what John route and is trying to do is something that the U.S who just can't be done he is going to replace\nAnd offer a player in little Mac and a pro ball player to both pro ball player in a more Cooper and address I just don't think is going to happen because when you look at history down in Tampa he didn't really make 'em\nHeadway with a lot of great picks he didn't have those kind of the players that elected when he looked at it I just don't think is a good place for the Oakland Raiders but time until if John ruined is able to restart their roster and get them playing like they were playing two years ago\nWhile and Reggie McKenzie is not going to be there anymore that certainly seems like the secret is out and so it is going to be on Gurdon and maybe does better this time around I just look at the whole picture and I I feel like people would be saying good things about the raiders if they had simply done mess let's say this I'm Ari\nCooper trade had happened early in the seas and maybe even before it a first round or for mark Cooper fact I even think today people like that's pretty good cause Cooper's been you know he's been great and then he's been not so great at other times\nSo they get a first round pick that's really good the reason people are laughing at it though is because he also came in the wake\nOf the ... which was not a good decision if John Goodman simply to look that I'm Ari Cooper and said I think we can do better and he looked at their car and said I think we can do better we're not going to win a Super Bowl with those being the two best players on or off ads\nPeople would have bought it and then he could have kept ... Matt fucking traded the wrong one at the start of the season\nYes they traded a wrong one there's no reason for them to treat ... can I can go back in detail why they didn't need to train them at the time that he did um but and I'll say briefly ... back was playing on the fifth year option the raiders had the opportunity to put the franchise tag on ... Mac and back to back years\nAfter that so for this year and the next two years basically for three years they still have a little Mac under their control without having to put him in a long term deal no matter\nHow much she was crying and whining about wanting a new deal they did not have to ... they still could have had him on the hit their control\nAt a deal that really play to the team\nFor whatever reason John brutal was well he was too much money he let him out the door\nThe issue that you have is ... is a proven player everyone in the locker room knows that he is a tough player disposition they know that he's especially play or maybe even the best player\nHe was the best player on their team when you trade that away and then you come back a few months later and you treat them more Cooper way another guy that is recognized in the locker room as one of the best players\nThe locker room is now looking at John group inside ways they're wondering ... is this do really in to get now or is this part of a ten year plan and um unfortunately going to be caught up in the wash and not really able to compete in for feel some of the things I Want to\nBut I I Need to see it at crunch time I need to see it when when I Need a D to go take over a series to impose basically like again if you're talking about their size you're talking about a D you go back and you watch that playoff series last year you didn't see Anthony Davis\nDanny Davis should should should not allow dream on green to play him even or to uh to be able to handle him one on one\nTo play him even or to uh to be able to handle him one on one he should be drawing additional attention\nAnd forcing a the the warriors to make a decision do we double or do we double ID or do we stay at home and we let him get his ah and worry that he'll he'll take over the game and and beat us that way\nHe didn't do that and for the pelicans to do everything that you hope they will that's what he has to\nDo wreck wonderful to have you as always appreciate your flexibility thank you you got a guy\nOkay read euchre senior Indian writer bridge report joining us marketed Bucky Brooks Fox Sports radio and the
