I think was\nAsserts aware of the girls but they really stayed up tonight they play well ah one of the things a coach throats and says we need communication we gotta talk out there and if we don't talk were not successful she said in practice we're doing it\nWe just got to turn that into the game type situations and tonight they did a little better communication there still times I could see they weren't communicating but they did better tonight and that helped to pick up there with\n... syndrome on the other side and they had come into the match a winning they're ... they're over five hundred on the season you're working on for your for your group Silver Lake county should win this one but\nOver we managed to one but two rivers\nSaturday I didn't know what to read like how central to have a good year they're playing their plate good this year they've got good players on the team they've got good coaching a you know they it's a new I think it's a first year and his first year head coach here\nUm and this team is playing well at times not there was also times tonight assault where they didn't communicate as well or get a little frustrated at times\nUm and when that happened in the ... going to run with it they wouldn't uh they've missed a couple of shots and get a little frustrated just in a\nWet the chargers take advantage of that but they've got some really good players I\nMentioned uh Jennifer pollen at the NASA\nWill tell you which I think she was looking a little tired maybe at the end 'cause some of the shots he was hitting where he there all day long\nBut she had a fantastic game Bernstein another one she I think is a senior this year ... and that she had a great get they've got good players that the net they've got good players to uh to

O. V. I. C. K. O. V. I. C. word one eight six six five oh jumbo at the Allen calls in from Dallas this evening and listen to the cliff five Seventy good evening welcome Alan\n... going to be on the show thank you and what's on your mind to lie about\nOh here he was sure spending that much spirits has been I'm sixty one years old I've I've tried truck travel and most of the major freeways in America Ninety five north south on the east coast my ... my experience has been you need to map out your your your route\nWith with on an on the major freeways but then if you run into a situation where much of south to North Carolina where the Florence are gender flooding a closed that down then you need them\nYou need to make sure that when you're when you're going yeah go go on the major freeways first and they wait for the Detroit then that's when you shouldn't you shouldn't start on the side roads because it'd be judgment there was a major hurricane like Michael's coming through it's coming up to Alabama\nYou just need to get get on the major freeways and get as far as you can as fast as you can stay on the clear major uh I'm In a state and then a bed and then if it happens when you have to take a detour then go that gun then go to the side Roach that's all I'm saying\nAll right well let's see what I had the kovac has to say about that certainly sounds reasonable to me that he\nIs absolutely correct but importantly you must know what the side roads are so this way in case you have to work those rows\nYou should at least be familiar with and so when you're traveling on a leisurely um track to some of these escape areas that you may find yourself having to evacuate sue\nSo this way so if your if your area is let's say area that everyone knows you're going to be there now and the other people are going to meet up with you\nAnd you should know at least several of the major roads to get to that location just in case you have to\nTake one of those roads so when you're doing it on a leisurely timeline it's not a problem you don't have to be concerned about it\nBut if you let's say before let's say you're on a major artery and you're told that upbeat so it has to take place you can easily tax the email from your phone that hey I'm taking this beach and we're going to go to through this direction to that location so this way\nFamily members who you rely on those even as the people on the other side cannot get that sick no meaning that tax to the email message wants that to our turns on and the people on the other side\nGet that connection your text or email all show up once their their cell phone reaches that tower\nNo as a as a as did the beer thank you Alan for your call the ... and your thoughts here or how does the GPS era affect all of this\nI'd makes everything so wonderful that we know where each of those are like you said and activate your GPS for your family members so this way you can see where you know your family members are by checking where they are on the GPS\nSystem so but in times of weather related problems such as Michael you know the storm skipped throw it down you know can take our technology\nAnd if the towers that people that you're sending a signal to went down\n... single you won't get that you know the people on the other side won't get the message but if they hit another tower that active they will instantly receive those messages so\nAs long as you're sending a signal you can let people know which way you're going how you go in that way and on the other side it's imports and understand that they will receive it wants a power is connected to that cell phone they will receive that message and now they know what happened to you\nI Would just do it a quick little plug for radio a good old ubiquitous over the radio always

the bull headed show with our guest disaster preparedness expert at the early ... good evening Patrick\nA good evening Jim ... is a this coverage is very fascinating with the hurricanes and so forth [noise]\nUm [noise] and uh otherwise than being a good script per movie um why not just bomb or a hurricane several hundred miles out into the Pacific\nA couldn't be a new killer it would rain radioactive [laughter]\nA waste of [noise] but uh maybe a hydrogen bomb or\nWell that's a nuclear bomb to the case you didn't know because it involves a a a\nA trigger that consists of either uranium plutonium but beyond that if it is let's assume for the ball with that we didn't care about the radiation we just wanted to really knock a hurricane out of kilter\nA I Am not sure about this but I Would dare say that if we were to drop our entire nuclear arsenal into hurricanes I\nIt might have an impact but these things are so much bigger than a single nuclear weapon that aside from all of the other end practicalities of such an idea they're just too big and then they [noise] well\nYou know let's put it this way let's say the United states was to say\nOh you know in the state of Florida the state decides hey we're gonna take this action and do something with the storm and the storm goes towards Alabama Texas\nNow ... is the state of Florida liable for died during the storm and damaging the states the other states or let's say another country let's say the United states there is a big storm coming towards us\nAnd then we diverted to Mexico and they go straight through the city and cause a hundred billion dollars worth of damage\nAli libel for that so that's another area of issues that arise if we were to try to control the weather because the weather's going to go some place and the people that it hit they're going to be upset\nYeah and I would note one instance in which this happened I'm not sure that anybody was ever found liable or even there was proof that in fact the action led to what followed but this was this has been probably half a century ago or so somebody got the idea\nOf cloud seeding or part of the eye of hurricane this was I think the hurricane was off Jacksonville, Florida\nAnd so they did it and the hurricane promptly took a sharp left turn and headed inland\nAnd the ... but he was ever able to tell if in fact the cloud seeding caused this but I don't believe that ever again that was tried so\nUh the the fact is that we just don't know enough about these things in the end it after the notes quite correctly or a what a bit just simply changes course in damages somebody else in the ... who is liable and uh I think\nIt could be a painful lesson and be a liability laws if in fact we ever did learn to do this we we'd better learn to do it with exact precision will take some more calls will get an athlete Kobe and\nHis book is the emergency prepping simple disaster preparedness for the Modern Family has ... emergency prepping dot org where

could say a hundred percent chance because it's snowing right now rain and snow through the day becoming all snow after ten am I think it's pretty much all snow now I think at this point\nI don't know that there's any rain\nRight now a in a at least in our area this woman to bring up the or the latest radar just to see it looks like the rain cut off\nOr probably south of a south and\nIn South east

are up in the ... and let's let's say for all up in the northeast all going down to the southwest gay and a kitty corner line that's where it's it turns from rain to snow right in our area it's pretty much all snow right now and will continue to move through the area\nAnd it's how much you know we are going to receive and and right now we're watching as the snow comes through\nAnd although there may be a little bit more snow just off to the\nUN maybe to the west of us a little bit we're still going to continue to see lots of snow in our area\nSo uh at this point they're predicting roughly two to four inches through the day to day\nAnd I remember to like on the roadways a lot of this is melting as it comes down and you look in the in the grass we've already got an inch of snow plus a and we're thinking two to four on the roadways as always keep melting will be fine once it starts to freeze that's when we could run into a little bit more difficulty ah as far as a high today around

very scary\n[laughter]\nKitty cat [laughter] yeah it was it was basically you know you could it was a pet well kind of OK was yeah you\nCould turn him loose out there and he wanted wander around a little bit and then he'd come back to gauge\nAs soon as you called them ... so is that why we saw him on a number of different episodes yeah if you really pay attention that bobcat shows up more than ... out of it was kind of the [laughter] the pet\nAlthough bobcat are are ah we have Bob cat in the area so\nLike they're not here oh yeah and if you sure okay if\nI didn't notice uh yeah 'cause now

from a school ocean side\nIs the place it's ocean side a school\nAngry community members parents and activists on Tuesday demanded accountability and sensitivity training after students at Cesar Chavez middle school made a deportation themed board game\nThe board game was made as part of a school assignment the border crossing game allowed players to complete a to compete to cross the U.S border and reach the U.S flag while deporting players\nAnd the game that is mandatory that players go to the bomb shop to blow up a wall to cross the border players who were all at two can choose to deport another player back to the start players are penalize that they land on the last ...\nCaught you back to check point space or the you've been taken into custody skipped three turn space ...\nStudents previously told the San Diego union Tribune the class teacher had approved the group's board game theme of border crossing\nRoughly three quarters of students at Cesar Chavez middle school are Hispanic or Latino according to the California Department of education Seventy five percent of our schools are Mexican American and uh I'll be darned if I felt like that was a joke said one parent\nThey owe us the alumni immigrants and the human rights council had ocean side in the mecca the miracle ... are demanding five actions Bobby\nFive action by things happen in order to be demanding number\nOne district wide cultural sensitivity training\nNumber two annual public forums\nNumber three at teacher committee on ethnic studies number for a no your rights forum and number five agenda material in Spanish\n... they say my ... one of these members says my biggest concern where did the kids get this from this is a learned behavior so if they are learning it at home and bringing it to school that is fast\nI have a couple of things come to mind here are teenagers can be real jerks anyway\nYou know in the end and no offense to your teenager or if you're if you have a teenager who isn't a jerk this I'm not referring to you but I I I Know even not all the time necessarily but if there's anybody who is going to be sarcastic or pushing the edge\nOn any social issue in your household chances are it's not your spouse or your toddler\nIf you're a teenager because everything's funny a two bedroom um they don't take life serious because they don't have to yet right you know we are aware of what's going on in the world\nAnd the end to the uh you know and so I made that this does not surprise me that sounds very much like a teenager would do um you know very irreverent\nAnd anything you know and I hate to use the word stick it to the man because it's a David term from way back when but you know teenagers all like fat as if they can yank somebody's chain\nThey'll do they'll do it now you can argue with me\nI Know of anybody anybody [laughter] ah\nWe don't need to do and they did nowadays they do it on social media\nLot or whether they will they will put stuff on social media and and we have seen that\nThey will they will put stuff on social media and we've seen that I'm a you know I don't know how how much the teachers are at fault depending on how much she knew maybe about this game because it was assigned to make a board game and if it was called border crossing 'em you ... you\nThink that maybe they okay maybe a red flag just add that or is that a limited or I'm I'm not I'm not saying she's she or he is blameless\nHim all the all but then I'm not surprised that the teenagers coming came up with the game a number one and the oil and and really all they did that you can take a monopoly board in and change the corners and you've\nGot a game that offends you you you ... yeah you got home even even you can say monopoly is offending some getting used to you know ... capital and capital [laughter] you know going to jail um Lord's going to jail at at at the ocean you have to go to jail no you should be probation guard\nYou know so yeah\nI ... in sensitivity training man I don't know I I had an agenda material in Spanish you know as as Cesar Chavez was a\nWas a um an activist or you know Mexican American activists from way back when I'm certainly among migrant workers and you send the Seventy five percent of a\nA Mexican American and it's all angles I'm actually going on you so I'm guessing to some of these teenagers probably were of maybe Mexican American imagine so I don't think it was probably just a group of white people I don't think so and they didn't they didn't break down they they know that we're doing this either but\nWe're ... we're so easily offended by everything now\nAnd who would the sensitivity training before I don't know teachers are the kid there was the kids\nThe kids need to sensitivity training or maybe maybe they do give kids Iraq ... kids said I think kids can be cruel Oh absolutely cruel to each other and they're the worst\nAnd and and bowling write write them all part of it I guess\nIn the ... very emotional there ... or ... for being for being the uh and now I now don't get me wrong ... a is a is a problem at all levels different ages even adult I Would agree\nI mean ... ... ah kids are emotionally unstable if you went for two I mean they're they're mostly affected by that I'm\nMost adults can walk away or would change your job or would move or you know in and handle it were were a kid probably as a little tougher time doing that a ... you don't need the people locked into the situation there in here\nHa\nSpecial report hurricane Michael\nHundred and fifty five

anything going on and at that point he saw that it was just\nMy family\nHad actually left eye and he [noise]\nHe said last sorry about that whole Pearl Greenland poison into sex\nShe is now an abolitionist fighting against sex slavery and the darkness Erin [noise]\nShe does is sharing her story to bring light to this horrible problem [noise] to which many of us are blind [noise]\nMy mom died when I was\nBorn and and people\nAround you said it took me a day where a very involved and you know I didn't think I was already being trafficked there's not a\nMemory that high ... in traffic we lived in that very small\nIn Kentucky [noise]\nTaking into [noise]\nLots of different stage she never said to attract me again I have seen [noise]\nWithin our house\nHe was a teacher in the

just a\nJust a normal family\nLife seems perfectly fine from the outside [noise] no one ever asked or anything or check to see if there was something wrong\nThere are a lot of ways that we can be aware of sex trafficking\nIf there is even a moment we feel something isn't right\nThere was a constant fear as\nMe that I Am this horrible person there's a constant fear that you know I'm going to do something wrong 'cause every single thing that I did was always from no matter what I said or did it was always from either got\nUm some form of kids punishment sexual punishment or um [noise]\nThere was just a tons of things that\nThey used to control me\nIn my twenties I began to\nEvery single little thing is controlled so [noise]\nYou know have a lot a lot of issues about um [noise]\nAnd I\nAnd it's very obvious on the outside that there was\nMe so I was in it in a situation where\nIt it just worked out to where they\nThey took steps to try to help me you know\nTo quite some time\nFinally able to open up\nLittle at a time about what was going on with me and um\nAs I began to do that maybe and take steps to give me a place to live\nAnd they gave me a car to drive and help me find a job\nYou know just a safe place to stay now\nIt's hard to understand\nWhen every single\nMovie that you make has been controlled it down to who speaks to normally\nIf I ever spoke to anybody that they didn't want me to speak to that wasn't involved in all the things that they were doing they would tell me\nWell you know that we're going to sell you didn't then\nSo they are involved as well and so I just\nEverybody you know that's just what people said to me and I didn't I didn't know there was anything different so\nThey began to make these steps to show me love and show me kindness and it just started breaking down walls that\nCould never have done I'm ...\nAnd I'm sad began to to learn how to trust them like it I remember um\nYou know night after night with these okay\nWhen it's going to be the day that they're going to\nLike that at all that other people like when when are they going to change 'em because I was continually tell that\nThey would be just the same um\nBut over time\nThem less made like like as a real family having them\nCare for me like a real family not expecting anything because\nAs someone who's like somebody that's being trafficked everything you do has\nEverything you get in everything that even your basic needs\nBecause you've done something to earn and it's not nothing is for free and so as I began to do things for me and love me and show me this kindness it began to break down the walls\nAnd I know it's very hard and difficult for people to understand that I'm Still waiting in traffic during that time because I just\nI had been settled trying to think that that's all that I deserved\nSays I began to just show me my value and show me that\nYou know I deserve better and and you know it was just waiting and waiting for something\nAnd

a lot of threats to those people a lot of starts to me\nIn for me I I could deal\nWith the threats to myself you know I I\nHad such low self esteem and with a K with being\nThose consequences for

how you doing Rob\nDoing great how are you miss the Chris Broussard how's your great\n... has been great man been wonderful lot going on in the world of sports lot to talk about I'm just excited to get to it\nOh no doubt about it so let's welcome any a couple of crew as we always do we wouldn't be able to do this five radio program without them Rob G A producer Alex engineer Depp Carson of course all anchor and in turn ...\nHe's in the house so they're all on the other side of the glass Chris let's kick some ass let's start the show we got so much to do I was already on a ... a undisputed this morning and then I did to hurt with colon who gave all show\nA shout out I don't know if you saw that on Twitter did you see the little clay and see the hurt I saw you on on disputed this morning that so that are present it well thank you darling represented well we\nGot those two down and now I'm ready for the three hour radio show strapping get ready to go\nThe grand finale well look we're speaking are ready to go we've got a maybe the most anticipated preseason game\nOf the NBA season and that's not saying a ton but you do have the star studded\nLos Angeles Lakers now that they have the Brian James he's their star and there stood going up against the Golden State warriors two time defending NBA Champions\nThree times in the last four years they wanted off some people think they're the best team of all time this is the first time the two clubs are meeting I Know is pre season just an exhibition in Las Vegas but it's the first time there meeting with Brian in a lake or uniform\nAlso lines oh ball last year's number to draft pick is making his season debut or his pre season debuting been out with injury\nSo that's going to be exciting Robin ... when they hit you with the a lot of the warriors there are a lot of people that feel like this can be their last hurrah\nWe know Kevin Iran can be a free agent and clay time will be a free agent and both of those guys have been very complimentary of LeBron's moved to Los Angeles Kevin Iran\nSaid over the summer that he thought it was the perfect move a liberal starting a new chapter\nChapter three or four whatever you want to call it but a new chapter in his career and and the rent was very ah applauded that move then you got clay Thompson who just recently said that he's excited about it in and he thinks it's pretty cool quote pretty cool\nTo see little brown in a Lakers uniform of course clays that Michael play for the Lakers the Showtime Lakers\nAnd a lot of people have always felt like play at some point is going to come back to the Lakers and play for them uh but the interesting thing Rob you know what you might ask you will go ahead and I know you want to happen here\nI was just going to say but clay did say so while you're writing said it's cool\nHe also said that the Cleveland team that LeBron play would last year was better than this team that he has so that was another thing that I was interested in and I don't know what player was but there was another player I think\nWho said earlier this summer too about how on competitive the finals of been the last couple of years and he hopes that this year it's a little more competitive so I thought that was another little shot even though they're talking about abroad and the Lakers\nI Do not think that Cleveland team last year was better than I'm telling you come to lay Thompson no I don't know yeah I Know something I Know he's but I'm just\nYeah yeah and they look the last two finals haven't been competitive no\nNo no the leg building eight out of nine times they claim\nThat no one game that they want let's just be honest they shut a historic shooting nice story right but here's the thing I Know you don't believe that\nEither of those players is going to go play with LeBron James and his complimentary as they've been why wouldn't one of them go join him with the Lakers\nCause they already know the script it's been it's been delivered time and time again the script is very simple\nIf ... if they if the team wins LeBron is the greatest and he's the reason why and when LeBron loses as he has many times in the finals\nStates what do you expect he doesn't have any body LeBron can't win by itself it's the same story over and over\nAnd I think you know people think well he's the greatest play the world you should just want to play with them no matter what you don't make it to the NBA and be the greatest player you know one of the best players in your state when you were in high school and college all that other stuff\nTo be willing to take a backseat especially when you there's no credit for you it's just human nature what uh what\nDo they have to take even at the NBA level I get it and people take a\nBackseat but not like the ... the back seat that people have to take will abroad and I think that's why people don't want to play with them [noise] I I don't disagree I think\nThat ... or ... on and off the court just overwhelms the situation and you saw at the same way who is his biggest anybody playing in the league outside of liberal on\nA will a brown and him teamed up in Miami and to win championships their second and third years together he had the backup and basically become in my opinion about eighty percent of the player he could be to fit in with LeBron\nAnd uh they didn't win two championships so I guess it was worth it but are you writing Cleveland\nYou know Kevin Love he came out and said he in an article on ESPN dot com today he talked about how you know it was some dark time playing with the brown and you have to learn how to follow\nHow to follow the leader a and a lot of these guys that want to be leaders aren't going to want to do that now love did also talk about the great benefits\nOf playing with the brown I mean he's won a championship he probably never would have won\nA championship and he may end up being a hall of fame I don't think he is\nBut you got the numbers he's got a ring while historic ... actually and so he may get in the hall of fame because he was a teammate of LeBron James I hate to\nMichael into this I really do 'cause I don't want to get into that because we also had some comments but it's just I I don't know when you supposedly the the greatest player on the planet right what brought\nYou you would think that people would want to play with him and that's you know be like yeah my career was awesome the play will abroad and watch this guy play and sometimes that the pinch myself to think that I was on the same court with him at the ... do you know what I'm it's none of that\nTo leave us alone camper\nTraining [noise] check out\nThese name's Collin Calvert shrink rich I said please try the godly Broussard Dr Parker chasing my Carmen Archie Jonas not people such good these are the names that bring you the best sports talk\nOr your week days you know\nI agree with some wonderful things are you with us this is the Fox

crushing when say look who's from all your favorite female hardest would come in and out of break the AQAP\nYou buy this cover cars to discover card you slide you treat use [noise]\nHi Rob we're talking about LeBron James do stars wanna play with them or not as you mentioned Kyrie Irving left him and said in an article that appeared in bleacher reports today by Howard back then it was the best thing he's ever could have done the best thing you could have done what does that even now like I don't believe I'm\nOn my right that [noise]\nThat what that that that he's saying is the best thing ever happened was that are left you know what I mean like yeah\nYeah yeah he said that\nYou mentioned Paul George didn't really look at the Lakers and free agency as he had been you know talking about doing for the to the previous two years\nAnd then um [noise] who was the other player\nA jury butler Jimmy Butler likely Butler's rebuff team at least according to all the stories and reports uh the Lakers are on his wish list of destination so\nHit us up eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox with your feelings on what's going on and do people or want to or not wanting to play with LeBron James\nAnd we'll get back into Jimmy bought little later on below said to the phones Chris what about the Allen in Maine you're on the odd couple and Fox Sports radio what's happened in Alan\nPaulos doing great what's happened\nAnd I'm so here's my take on the brawn uh Celtics fan and as you pointed out Kyrie Irving moves away from from abroad\nUh but the ... the thing with the brawn is that the way he the wave will work say there was like a two percent chance that he was coming to the south a liar minor but that ... percent chance put such a year like this large amount of Celtics fans in this area because of the fans didn't want him either\nBecause he can't draw more hell and we're seeing that we're still in Britain shape the way we all\n... and in that I saw in my opinion of fans don't want it either but moreover from that\nIs if yo ... who goes to LA because I mean it's a really it really is a perfect fit but he's not going to draw more people there because it's his brand like he's developed this brand brawn James\nAnd if they're going to allow the younger guys come and go league like hiring you're still young he wants to develop his brand and you've got all these guys are developing their breath and they can't do it if they play with a bar because there are always so overshadowed by his brand\nI think he's done such a great job other than Michael Jordan in tiger he has developed his brand so well that people don't want to come and play with him because of how big his brand is they just kept developed at all you have a best show on the radio I listen to you every night after all will show keep it up or\nGo to our present that was an interesting comment I got I don't know what I meant\nTo hurt a little bit I meant to Alan ... take a little bit a cause I I Do understand what he's talking about his brand overshadowing up that I don't think that that's ...\nI think there's something there and what I Would say though is Kyrie Irving\nNow his uncle drew movie that was in the works when he was playing ...\nOr ... can I say flop well yeah I mean ... how many guys have great sports I mean ... I'm just saying it was a lot to say Pittsburg was at a huge success did that when a any uh whether the Oscar I don't know what I what I mean what what what I meant that uncle drew like\nTrying to take a a a little TV commercial or whatever and turn it in in ... well that's the that tells you all you need to know not not ...\nI'm I'm ... I Want to see it every time I felt like let me go see I'm going to do tonight I just felt like\nI don't really know you know when you realize I'm you know you're going to know why you didn't go you realize your sock drawer needed to be real rain and that's why you just figure [laughter] but but seriously it only made forty four\nMillion that's that's the number that's out there which isn't a lot for movies\nI think it's just tough I thought he is the ads on you two were tremendous well but you know but that's your right to turn a fire in the white ...\nLight of all you know full all up\nAnd so on and why ... wage of all no fool law up now I picked up pictures heart\nI Will say this because I saw the you know outtakes or the trailer and I didn't see anything that really drew my attention or you know made me want to see it but a few people that I went to see it did tell me they really liked it really yeah they told me they really liked it so I'm watching the subway but but my point is is\nKyrie builder brand he had his own signature sneaker hey here's the thing about ... when he says leaving little\nBrown was the best thing that happened to me I mean let's let's step back and recognize what playing with LeBron James\nBrought you you would not you know if you will hear one of the most historic shots in NBA history in NBA history you would not have been in the finals to do that if LeBron James and going back to Cleveland and being your teammates\nYou wouldn't want to jeopardize your with al ... he ... I mean unless you had a comparable teammate who is just as good of you know close to ... billion you need each other you know how to get into Jordan Pippin but Jordan you know you never want to without people so you need other teammates I'm just saying you got to appreciate\nSome of the things that you get from playing with LeBron James\nHey we got a a tweet from L. J. and he said he's a ball that's what he says about the bronze that of course you believe that\nWell I Know I he definitely not a ball hog but what I Will say and this was there a lot of reasons ... rerun it out but one of them too was that he wanted to play point guard and with LeBron James if you notice\nOutside of the Kyrie who's the reason Kyrie could work with live round was because he is the score and he can play off the ball and he just shoot the ball so if he doesn't have the ball in his hands he could still be effective but look in the Bronx teams Eric Snow Mario summers he's never had\nLike that other than Kyrie that really great point guard because he's bringing it up half the time ... so ... got tired of you know the round bringing up sixty percent of the time and I go stand on the wing\nAll right let's get one more call art earners in Detroit you're on the odd couple of Fox Sports radio was up Ernest\nHow you doing on Mr Parker doing great\nOkay I didn't want to let you know appreciate you for taking my call first of all I worked at the Detroit News for about ten years and I've read probably more articles than anybody that several guardian on your show in fact we actually met you one time at thirty six district court but I just want to say\nOh what I was I was growing up with the car could have learned and I don't know who actually do it\nDo you conduct in the story and we're on the outside oh no no\nI just want to say real quick you know you all say it all the time abroad dangerous arguably the second\nGreatest player ever voice of a pair of shoes and a lot of these guys that don't want to play with them when they were the main reason is because they can't\nHumble themselves and to play with the greatest player sometimes that's what you have to do and we talk about championships and history and all of that or\nDoctor Jay ... won all Moses Malone and the story goes on and on but also want to say this again let me reiterate what I said I'm a big fan\nOf yours Parker I Love your your love your journalism scope and everything were why is it but you just tell me what a wife and me I cannot understand what it is you're biased miss what level\nAre they are is no biased against LeBron is just a different uh take thanks for the\nPhone call Detroit much love but the people need to get off a big thing I don't know abroad I don't have any kind of personal axe to grind the whole idea there's different ways of looking at people course has one view I have a different view I don't understand just because you like somebody\nYou think that because I have a different point of view from that I have a bias against somebody right admitted that you know what I'm saying Chris I just I people need to understand that this is not a I don't have a personal stake in this I really don't\nIt's an opinion based on my covering the MBA since Nineteen eighty seven and different players in talking to people and watch it for myself that's what I've come up with that is all\nNow I feel you you're right you're right so we're going to switch gears a momentarily a and do the M.
