I did\n... dominance wise you know he's hurt but he's fine job yeah it'll be it'll be great he's ... he's fine but say going Barkley I mean you can't do everything himself benefits of wind terrible you look at what are you doing here it's like you're sitting there with a joystick which runs it runs after the catch\nScreen game seems to be working well for the giant short of anything you know they've got going on but sailing balls too high in the red zone you had multiple opportunities to really make this a game right for a dominant as Philadelphia wasn't at first that\nYou had several opportunities point blank range right you've got the big penalty on Bennett to set up first and goal what do you do lazy cheap\nShort you'll go attempt is all you come away with as as it goes through but for Berkeley you you gentlemen and company bet on the fact that they can reach things with Eli one more time that you had enough weapons obviously they're missing Ingram tonight but that's not everything the ... guys but they brought in\nYou know late ... guy Eric flowers and they had to they they wait\nYour ninth picking two dollars and Fifteen he's supposed to be one of your anchors of your all bets are blind\nCan I you know he he got the leg lamp and he got kicked out and tell you every time my uncles the biggest giants fan of the world every time we talk and I leave a message for

is the overall rate because when you look at total yards\nTake the Russian yeah for for for what they are but you're talking over a hundred and total yards each game you can't ask for much more out of a running back to ... particularly behind them bad off the blind and with a quarterback that you can't trust to put the ball down field\nRight always completion sort of Barclay\nInsured attempts to shepherding to the tight end up pushing the ball down the field at all even with an opportunity here against the Philadelphia deep it's been pretty generous to opposing passing games\nEight seven

Barclay has been good so far this year\nHe hasn't been great 'cause like I say is that one hundred yard game and he's twelve in the NFL in Russia and coming and it's a night but he catches passes out of the backfield who did I tell you he was he was Reggie Bush\nWho was the turning out to be so far Reggie Bush ... had a ... you have a look at Reggie Bush is first go have felt no let's not eighty

I get I thought you said the quarterback could do the job you said he had\nNo I didn't know what I said there's no no no\nNo you're not in front of them said there's no no no no no man said he said that you can figure that out who had vowed to bring in from writes my fourth or fifth [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOh no back um junior leaves the field before half time\nThe only player to leave the field early\nAs you know this is something that you do not do in the national football league you wait everybody goes into the locker room and a half time unless you're going in to get checked for an injury\nOr that's the only reason why but here's out back um junior and this is who he is I hate to say I told you so about auto back um junior but I told you about a\nQuote from just short says is that right former NFL lime and play with the Panthers the Vikings was a teammate there with the giants twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen guys I'm sure I'll do is just heading into the locker room early because he needed an IV\nOr maybe a bathroom break or whatever else will be told crying laughing about ... times for there's\nI mean you know whatever it's going to be the giants locker will be closed its or older back and you're just gonna say screw it I don't care I'm going to say whatever I Want to say he leaves the field before half time so now this is what the rest of the game and the post game and the rest of the week is going to be about for the giants I've said it from the beginning with auto back from junior\nYou pay him you're going to rule that day because you get his talent but you also get knuckleheads plays on the field and crap you have to deal with off the field that you normally don't have to deal with if it was just the off the field stuff I Would say well you know what\nYou deal with it because that's you know hey he's that kind of a talent but half of the stuff he does is on the field whether it's losing his mind and getting penalties because he's kicking in that and he can't keep his composure whether he's leaving the field early before halftime because he's pissed off whether he is\nOn the ... team and he decides to give the other team a touchdown because he's making a bone headed play because he has too many drops or fumbled he fumble the punt again tonight he was lucky to recover it can I ask the question is who owns al ... is the chair recognizes Mike harm is why the hell him on coverage\nReally dangerous to grade your your your draft if you want change ... receiver back up and you know I'd say the same thing with Antonio Brown returns fix and everything that's been fine for the sailor so far not not I'm not an idea that that that's been he's been okay I look\nThis is who oh they'll is this is just who he is you want to sign up and give them money and you got to put up with this kind of have to deal with the devil and\nNow your own\nFault in terms of assessing your team exacerbated by a guy who doesn't hold his tongue\nRight it's one thing if you'd made the picture the court can do you still need to go get a quarterback here's the problem they're going to be just good enough at some point the season that they're going to win a couple of games and they're going to be screwed because there's not going to be the quarterback sitting there waiting and now you got a running back is still a battle offensive line you've got to figure out how to uh\nPeas Mr back him at this point\nAnd you you ... ... sold them a bill of goods out what he could do with Eli Manning they believe that they bought full in Gettleman goes and gets sake one Barclay and now you're watching it all crumbled and the headlines from all the newspapers man when did you ought to be\nThat guy that night it's [laughter] I mean they got against a riot [laughter] tag line in the back pages or the eagles drive 'em back again they've got no pass Russia's either back I might be the best past Russia to my defense but there are two\nBut now instead of dealing with the issues and and the giants are a dumpster fire and then the eagles are on the doorstep now going in for another score that could increase their leaders twenty four six now nine fifty five to go in the third quarter a eagles at second goal is that now this is the next few days this is what the giants are about oh they'll left before half time\nAnd you can not talk about it after the game you can but someone's going to say something at some point he got what you're going to deal with this is this is why oh back um junior you're smart you say you know what thanks\nBut we can we can we can do or we can do our best without you because as good as he is on the field when he is good he also hurts you on the field he hurts you off the field and you deal with stuff\nThat you don't want to deal with it I'm Sorry but an NFL team can't wake up every morning and go okay what do we do today this is one week of old back um this is one interview on a Sunday\nAnd this is now here's on Thursday night he's leaving the field before halftime and that's going to be a thing and he's also having a bad game so now it's again we got to deal with this stuff to ... you look he wants to be a giant\nBut boy he looks like a guy that just is what I said from the beginning you pay him\nAnd he's going to continue to be the guy he was ... when we for everyone in the same guy for three weeks he was great in the pre season 'cause he wanted to get paid and the giants all fell for it hook line and sinker all yeah he's here he's a professional do is supposed to do and they over compensated\nBecause he's so ... and and and whiny and outside the box with everything\nThat they said oh well let let's reward him for three weeks he's like\nThat was easy that was that was simple I just had to not say anything for three weeks and they gave me a million dollars oh this is awesome and then now almost ... from work and and now look where he's oh like that's a bonus

Botox is going to be talking to lied about parenting and a couple of terms that had been used over the years of one or a with some regularity the other one was a relatively new to me\nAnd we're going to be talking about that and the conclusions that have been reached by our guest Dr John Huber clinical forensic psychologist and the chair of mainstream mental health or doctors uber thank you for being with us today\nWell thank you for having me on Jim I appreciate\nAll right the first term is a helicopter bombs or or helicopter parents and I guess most of us understand it is a term of ... referencing parents who hover over their children and in essence won't let them make the mistakes necessary to grow up and become adults but that'd be a reasonable definition or would you admit that\nI'm not sure that's a pretty good definition and ah I think one of the things that that they learn is that somehow they are at the very least they deserve things in life\nBecause their parents did those types of things [noise]\nAll right uh ... that's something else that it it seems to be the\nThat the generation that has provided us with helicopter parents\nOr their parents as as a group probably would not really a about doing this sort of thing where they I mean a ... it's hard for me to to think that before this generation of a helicopter parents that we had a\nA generation before that have parents that are essentially provided the robot for these people uh it it seems to me that these people sort of sprung up uh uh on their own and the the whatever their influence may have been\nThat it was not entirely their parents because I I don't think that it goes back\nA that many generations does it [noise]\nYou know it doesn't really I mean there's some there's some small groups of people who've always been like that but if we go back and look at our generation is a whole you know the the baby boomer generation their parents\nHad to have had to scrimp and saving do without during the war and so we found a lot of those individuals you\nKnow the great grandparents great grandparents would store you know thirty cans of core and even though the grocery store having three cans for a dollar down the road um and that generation said okay I don't want to I don't want to or\nThings like that so they started easy now a little bit that the greatest generation\nWas are afraid of you know what happens if we end up in the same kind of situation again they want it to be prepared the next generation came along the baby boomers and they were like okay you know it's possible we lived here before we know the sacrifices will have to make\nYou're in great myself I just got to say the helicopter and warm or parents sounded like the kind of parents who were glad they have their children grow up poor you know bubbles but that was possible\nWasn't now you know I don't think you're you're ... exaggerating entirely too much there ... there are some practicalities of course involved in that but I ah Dr Huber I I think that the Don may be closer to the literal truth of he'd like to think he is your thoughts Dr\nI I don't think that actually correct in unfortunately what that ... is a an adult who is dependent upon the world for things and not just the permit but completely entitled they deserve this\nAnd you know I was taught right on day one I don't deserve anything I have to earn stuff to to get anywhere in this world\nYeah uh what one would would certainly hope that that was the case I Would I Would like to think Russia to your your thoughts on because I I think that it probably comes close\nTo me right now uh you know I I keep I keep hearing about about people like this I'm not sure that that I Know of any of these people granted I I I ... the young people I Know by by that my my definition I'm Talking about a\nA parent's today's parents who are generally of course in their uh their their twenties and thirties and some of their forties or the\nOnes I Know which are not a a wide swath of humanity they're they're very definitely not a this category uh I mean they they do discipline their children their children are expected to do certain things and just set includes bumps grapes\nA failures of picking yourself a dusting yourself off and and the whole learning experience is there any kind of a of originality about this or a geographic concentration because I don't know that I have never actually met a helicopter parents much less a lawnmower parent\n[laughter] well I don't think it's necessarily originality I mean I I taught university from Nineteen Ninety six and killed two thousand the Seventeen and one of the reasons why I was glad to to step away from that was probably the last four years\nI we get calls from parents going what do you mean my travel got us thirty on their cats and I go well I Can't even ... kids in my class and they would blow up and like what do you mean I go well you know there are actually federal laws against that they're they're adults I Can't disclose anything you know\nAnd you used to be when I got a thirty on a on a test I was in trouble today the teachers in trouble\nYes at at the university level not even at the high school level [noise]\nWow uh I had\nOne flew flew in from New Jersey to Texas to to talk with me about their child's great [laughter]\nWhat a good heavens well but that that does almost eight lay literal helicopter or this case an airline I guess a remarkable hour ride a Greg in Springfield, Missouri joins us on the jumbo ahead and show with the clinical

even know if she'd be considered as long more ... ... is something else going on me\nShe obsessed with taking pictures I Love him to death\nIf he stands up you know it's like he can only baby it's ever done it and they don't even she won't even let them\nSit like what myself grab a laughing I physically go there and grab them because always on top of them that you know and he can't be around neither grand kids you know they're playing and they get in says there are some germs you know it's like real estate and I'm almost worried about I mean\nWell maybe you should be more than almost worried I'd Hoover Dr Huber sounds to me like Greg may have found an example here\nHe might have but I'm assuming this is her first child\nYeah by the grace is it a burden to\nOkay and you know at first child you know they they are at the store and they are in the living room they spent their pacifier out and you got to go stick it in boiling water for ten minutes or you can put it in a second by by the time she has her third kid she become dusted off it doesn't matter you know where they get up out of gathering dust off the mouth\nSo that'll change how well she\nJobs to pass by she goes by the new one that we wouldn't last oh\nWell All right now the ... and why is it yeah going going my daughter\n... remind her that you know you you raise a child and spoil the grandchild or if you spoil the child you'll be raising the grandchild\nYeah exactly as we go to the next call here as a Dr Huber I guess you do know the reason why ah grandparents and the grand kids get along so well\n[laughter] yeah they have a common enemy okay\nA little cynicism there for the program at the top in Port Angeles Washington good evening I'm\nA gentleman he uh one of the things that generates\nHello gentleman I see a one of the things that generates show up your mom just the amount of legislation that's out there that you're a seat that the CDC that child develop a people\nAnd a good indicator dish\nDrink get word of something in your your child got injured or did you leave go to play in the yard and this happened or the charge you for you at the car seat issue do you do what you have the right one through your head at\nAt that age right there there there's a whole lot of stuff that that that you would never even dreamed up as kids would be\nA and I'm like you're in my church is right\nAnd and my parents never would've dreamed you know if you're somebody would have a hand yeah at the state or local level a show that's got to create some paranoia out there for the people that are remembering a used right on the trucks writers of a fifty three Chevrolet pickup truck and hang out with a truck\nYeah we\nCan't ride in the bed and the truck now yeah exactly it all I Know\nThat and and and and it doesn't do the things that I could think of you guys go out get the next ...\nWells that are your thoughts are Tom uh to what extent it has a government if not imposed this on us at least encouraged this\nWell I'm from the government and I'm here to help yeah right [laughter] yeah and and\nWhat happens is you get you get a vocal minority of people and they go out\nThere and they raise this think and they stand up in front of a school boards and governor meeting on our legislators and all of a sudden we have these things in post now there are some legitimate things that need to be regulated I I don't disagree with\nThat but you know uh\nI've been involved in so many different types of court cases a forensic psychologist of people following a pediatrician word\nTo the letter a on a first child or something\nAnd the pediatrician assumed that oh you know there are an adult they'll they'll know the kids hungry you don't wait three hours to feed on even though I said you know do eat every three hours\nAnd all of a sudden you get a child protective services involved\nIn it because you know the kids take being taken up the hospital because hey crying all the time and the other they think oh they're not feeding\nA kid and the mother's like no I'm just like the doctor told me every three hours [laughter]\nAnd it's crazy [laughter] it's scary for new parents\nEspecially young ones and uh they they follow those rules and then what happens with kids they hit the public school system and they learn\nHey as your parents do this this child abuse their parents do that a child abuse and they start coming home and dictating the rules of the household and it's scary because there's no handbook that says what really you can do parents you know what you can't\n[noise] well uh suffice it to say we somehow it Dr Huber managed to be here and I managed to get here and the people in the world has managed to get here a courtesy of parents who did not have that handbook either so I guess the the the old methods at least a do not a cause a ...\nA tremendous a fatality rate among our young people that might be some lessons there to be to

S. squad\nI think they're scared of the commitment and they're also scared I've heard a lot of people say that they are scared of getting called to a car accident and that person is somebody you know and love\nAnd do you risk that anytime you become a emergency personnel\nThat's right and you know the way I look at it I I had that same hang up when I became an EMT\nUm I have young cousins in the area and it's a small town you know everybody's so my biggest deal was what if there's a car accident I come up on it and it's somebody that I Love ... but the thing is is what if there's a car accident and you come up on it and it's funny that you love you can help them do you have to look at it the other way\nAbsolutely it's it gives you this amazing confidence to know that you have the potential to help someone when they're in need and right now with our local ambulance squads it might take ten to Fifteen minutes for us to come upon the scene of an emergency ones were called out if these laws should fail it could take\nTwenty thirty forty five minutes for a larger ambulance service to reach one of these smaller communities\nAnd we all know that every minute counts\nEvery minute feels like a lifetime when you're in an emergency situation\nEspecially we have a you know growing population of of elderly and the issues like cardiac arrest and stroke they are very time sensitive issues waiting that extra half hour for a fee for it to respond\nOr rosel to respond it it's not realistic it might not make it J who's a candidate for a becoming an EMT absolutely everybody you need to you do need to be Eighteen once you are certified to serve on the squad\nUm that's about the only requirement we have\nGay how about as far as where you live in relationship to where the ambulance is\nWe can help you with that make arrangements for that if you feel like you live too far out of town to respond in a timely manner um you know we ... we do have places that a person could conceivably stay within the city limits for an evening or a weekend if you're on call ...\n... the the regulations for tri county what we say is you need to be able to be there driving the speed limit and being safe within ten minutes within ten minutes\nIs you need to be able to be there driving the speed limit and being safe within ten minutes within ten minutes does that change who seems like it used to be like five minutes I had and it has been it's been about that since I've been on the squad\nOkay ah seems to me ... years ago it was it was like within like a three to five or five mile radius or something but it seems that as we're talking here today because of the problem with numbers they've kind of broaden the scope just a little bit\nThat's right it's helped it has helped a lot of people um be able to be on call more often in that sense they can be at home and be on call there is getting somebody\nThere in in ten minutes I asked her to twenty thirty minutes as or just mentioned with another service is still still is at the jail you know that's still a benefit okay All right so ape do you have to be Eighteen or over how about as far as uh the top end I mean does it matter as long as you can what perform duties of an EMT or what\nYeah I mean if if you can get up and get yourself dressed in the morning and go about your daily life will take\nUs or aged age doesn't matter I mean look at Steve he's still there right\nYeah [laughter] he needed [laughter] one\nOf our longtime EMT members and we definitely appreciate all of his years of service and the uh the knowledge expertise that he brings to our area I think he's he's been there thirty is it like thirty\nThirty five years later you want to say [laughter]\nKeeps trying to like go but we won't let him he had of\nCourse a former squad a leader and he just what gave it up just a few years ago didn't it yet but two years ago I Believe he gave that up All right\nUm so I'm Eighteen and as long as you can perform that that man woman doesn't matter does not matter right\nUm if you ah I I Know the key Ava who was a I'm an EMT in the area and the new folding are actually yet you have the right to no longer a paramedic shed ... I Believe that's correct okay anyway she had sent some and one of the things she said if you're an adrenaline junkie yeah so I you know that's true to a point isn't it\nYeah and I mean when the pager goes off your heart beats a little faster so if you if that's something you love than by all means he come join us\nOkay um family members um if you have a family I think the the points you guys brought up about helping a family member um or is coming across an action where you know somebody um you could you could save a life at home\nOh absolutely am and what if you came across an accident and it was someone you loved but you didn't know what to do\nI I just I feel like everybody should learn basic CPR and um this just takes us another step further\nIn in in one way we talk about how it's harder it's it's harder to get the people at the same time some of the things are trying to make it a little easier right and you mentioned the Lucas device you mentioned cops that are able to move a little bit more themselves or lift themselves um so there are also on the other side tried to make it a little bit easier trying to help the empties\nRight yeah that's right we have that MR acts machines in our in our eggs too that takes the blood pressure for you and monitored keep the patient monitored the whole way um the whole time you have them it really takes a lot of the guests workout 'cause I I feel like a lot of people\nThey just don't think they can do it they don't they think well what if I forget something what if I don't do it right what if I screw up but a lot of the equipment we have takes all that guesswork out and it's it's about being there and and using those devices okay\nAs far as uh incentives that some people are looking for okay um [noise] they want to help out but they're not really sure how to go about it\nUm what are the incentives I mean do I get anything in the long run I'm if I'm away from work you know how does that work is that with this with us information session as well where you can provide some of this information\nYeah we will definitely provide that information that different squads have different um incentives so we can speak for what the middle river squad does but I'm not a hundred percent certain on what the other squads better but\nI Do believe that there is a slight pay that you get by the hour for being on call during weekends and then we are paid while we're on an ambulance ran so if somebody calls and they need us and we transport them to a hospital then we get\nWe do get reimbursed a little bit for our time yeah you do get an hourly rate pay wearing which\nWould uh when I when I first got on back in the uh the late nineties um I didn't realize any of them are are they needed an ambulance people at the time and I told him I said I don't\nHave time to do the actual EMT course but I could maybe do the the ... the first respond or is it called him at the time because it was less hours so I actually got on and then like after six months or some uh I got a check for I don't know a hundred bucks or something like that uh what's his for some while you were on this many runs ago so we get paid for\nIt so I mean it's not that there's a lot of money out there but it's incentives to use for Christmas presents or set aside for savings or whatever\nAnd I we do get paid at the beginning of December so it is a nice little ...\nOkay that's a perfect little Christmas All right how about as far as the training as a as far as ours are are they trying to help the are the people as far as getting the training hours and whatnot\nYes actually this session that we're looking to start up in November um they're hoping to do some more of the course work on line so that it will cut down on some of the in class hours\nOkay I'm soul when when when you look at one of the class we starting you mentioned that November\nWe'd like to started just after deer season okay what do you told us and so that she's looking at November twelfth and the started the whole class I had heard how they work\nKind of give us a rough idea of how classes would work\nSo the last time that we had a class Laura and I taught a little bit of it and there was a classroom portion and you sit and do your course work for um there are a couple of hours session so that they're just a couple of times a week and then and then there's a lab component where you go through in practice something\nOkay um okay so time commitment that's something to look at yeah but do you work with them or as to try to figure out what's best and then you try to do some some I mentioned you mentioned the online or something that would that be kind of knew what it is it that is trying to help people out as far as\nThat would be a new incentive and we feel like it would help especially during the winter when maybe you don't want to drive or you don't want to leave home so much you know you could just snuggle up with your laptop and work\nOn some EMT our which a lot of stuff is nowadays isn't it there's not a there is more that's done on line isn't there there there's a monthly trainings that we do as established EMTs and first responders\nWe can do that on line but we also provide some training during our monthly meetings and that all goes towards your yearly certifications\nOkay All right so once you become an EMT you you also have ongoing training that as well they're absolutely\nYes you need to re certified every two years but we during through the monthly meetings and and uh online stuff it's pretty easy to gain not certification K uh\nIn the final few moments running out of the time your quick or if you have any questions or for either Laura or Trudy about to becoming an ambulance person or an EMT or a um somebody to work with the ambulance or give us a call ... one twelve thirty or you can email\nWe have the tools to help you have on your prescription medication\nHi my name is Wyatt ... and I'm a

newsroom saying ah I'm ready over here don't forget me so we found him\nAll right ah on our second half of our open program today Marty ... fire chief you're in deep river falls with the fire department in Studio good morning or good morning mark good to have you in today to thanks for having an emergency a day to day so yeah it's kind of\nA whole week of it yeah I'm the we we visited earlier this week with a very cheap upper middle river Kenny bite on today we've we've got you in house\nA it is a chance to focus on the fire departments are and and then you've got a ham dinner coming up we're going to be talking about but first let's talk a little bit about the uh the fire department here in town sure we uh ... this week is what does this week is called fire prevention are began genetics nationwide okay\nAnd as as a squad how do you guys you know when it comes to ah because once a year\nHappens how do you approach this\nA busy week for us usually um we take a the times uh first half of the week is usually um we have all the kindergarten classes to the fire all we send a one or two of our guys out we also hit all the preschool kids with just early flare message fire safety\nSo that's two classes of deal with their um [noise] we've got a whole associate burners comes in with their kindergarten or St John school\nAnd uh we've had a couple of daycares tour um so it it just busy and uh you know along with the preparation for we usually plan our fundraising meal kind of in the same time okay ah ... fun to get the kids in his next\nSo much excitement there yeah that's you know that's that whole kind of like herding cats [laughter]\nAh but it is fun you know we try to at the end we tell them save your questions for the end and and then by then they've been in there long enough that can't remember if they wanted to ask and\nSo you get a story and grandpa burned the barn down one time and you know you just nod your head and smile and but yeah it's it's fun it is it's really fun having them\nAt the at the same time it's it's all about educating as an even from that very young age\nYou know it's surprising I hear from some of the parents because we send them home always telling them that they can be helpers for the firefighters and uh you know wherever you're staying with a remind them it would be a good time to have a fire drill remind them it's a good time to change batters and smoke detector\nDo they wear their seatbelts remind them you know so we go through this list of safety things and of course these kids take that Holleman repeat it and I'm sure it gets almost annoying affairs but it's a good message\nIt is a good message how it is a man and and the things that you mentioned the like a changing batteries in your in your fire alarms it's it's something we a lot of people would just take for granted and forget about it until somebody you hear somebody on the radio say\nMake sure you change your batteries and and smoke detectors or an amazing thing because they do save lives but I can remember when I first started giving those tours\nIn a long time ago we hold one up and show the kids and and you know kids who didn't know what they were and do you have met home and some shook their heads and all very seldom anymore to have a child that says doesn't know what it is or say they don't have 'em in their home\nAnd if if they do we encourage the teacher to kind of pursue that because we have some programs where we can get some to them if it's a low income situation or something like that so\nAnd the and the smoke detectors and fire alarms were not they've changed over time to have a name or they're getting\nNow absolutely you don't get so many false alarms I'm One of the things I was skeptical at first and I I've really gotten onboard with are the new version that have a ten year battery because smoke detectors are supposed to be replaced they have a life expectancy of about ten years so now these new ones come with a battery that's good for that full ten years and as a gift\nTen years so now these new ones come with a battery that's good for that full ten years and as it gets to the end of its life it starts beeping and telling you buy the whole smoke detector and the battery technology has gotten good enough that they do work so I I'm starting to\nBe impressed by those yeah that's that's a good deal because not that you want to just set it and forget it but you want to set it and forget it many people do forget to change the batteries so it's it it eliminates that piece of the puzzle\nI you know I'm not a thing for the for falls you guys are are a magazine that I mentioned with a Kenny on Wednesday a foreign for them a structure fires are not as they don't do many structure fires is one grass price for the former falls um you probably have a few more structure fires than some of these smaller communities\nYeah you know and that things have gotten safer it seems like when you do have them\nThere are more intense than they used to be because of all of the materials now even building materials are you know there's more water with glue in it um\nYou know the things we have are all made a plastics you know so when there is a fire and it actually gets going it it's usually a little more intense than some of the old structures that burned so you do see that it will\nAsk you a question I 'cause I mean we hear this once in a while for training for the fire department or we used to be or ... many years ago I'm an old house and we can burn it that we do some training on it it isn't as simple as that anymore I said no we\nGet calls all the time and uh with with today's regulations pollution control UPA everybody gets involved if you want to do on and it is still possible to do um but\nUh you literally have to uh some instances remove the asphalt shingles before he can burn it they're considered bad you know to burn 'em they'll come in you actually have a hazardous material inspector come and he'll tell you what can be in that house if you want to burn it a ... a big thing you know a little you know has to come out\nAround the windows even a can have a master's in it so it's gotten so that the list has gotten so long or the amount of work you need to do to prepare it has gotten so great that you know it\nIt it really hinders doing it is almost you could almost just plain build a wood structure and and and yeah and then try to take her down and we're very odd for training\nPurposes for us now I just had a conversation with um the the the gentleman who runs the program in east Grand Forks tax which is affiliated with M. C. T. C. here and and they actually have a live burn simulator now on campus\nAnd it sounds like will prosper possibly be able to use that like to send our guys through for their first live burn if we don't have something that we can burn so on there's options out there but it's it's a little different\nYeah a training as it has to have to have adapted as well but but also technology helps us in some of that doesn't it\nYeah you know it's uh it it it's a good thing we've got better technology we've got better turnout gear you know the guys are safer um and I always use that as a generic term guys whether we have gals are guys on the apartment it's always the guys [noise]\nUm but yeah it it actually to the point where we have to watch and be concerned with people staying in areas are places too long when it's too hot because they have such good protection so you know it it's changed for the better but you also have to use that technology wisely\nWe were just talking with the gals about training to become an EMT how much for firefighting how how's that training\nUm state of Minnesota when you become a ... a volunteer firefighter whether it's the forever I'm you know middle evergreen Bush badger anywhere uh there's a hundred and forty hours of of classroom time that they have to go through to get certified to the level at Minnesota would like to see volunteer firefighters train that\nAnd that doesn't include also there's another twenty hours of hands on practical time testing other things and just the classroom portion is a hundred and forty hours\nSo it's a you know it's a major commitment to\nIt is but it but at the same with me I Am teams the firefighters um you you got to keep people coming in and out in ... I don't know that you have trouble with numbers some of the smaller departments do here in the fall I don't think he would have had Indian\nFortunate we just put on um three new ... volunteers last spring and we had a a a pretty good pool to select from to the point where\nThe candidates we have we're looking possibly for two more of this fall we might have to retirees and and you know we we've got a pretty good pools still to select for us and that is we're fortunate\nTo disappoint deceive delude to imitate mimic what's the word\nForeign line is home of of burnt orange tree fresh never frozen birders from Michael's me a student or a bar and grill now serving him like seven days a week the game for much for stopping after work half\nAs good or a bar in real fast burner in downtown on second street fever we're\nFostering stopping today more gold is going on for saying out orders at one time on the\nBar for a burger basket sixty one twelve thirty one of those ... days word for free burger basket from the school owner six said one twelve thirty six eight one twelve thirty call me up right now what is today's word it is a\nMeans to treat with scorn or contempt the ride ridicule\nThere's a verb means to treat with scorn or contempt\nDerided ridicule to disappoint they seemed to allude to imitate mimic\nWhat does the word for free burger basket from the school intersect say one twelve thirty six eight one twelve thirty any guesses high daily definition\nBowling no thanks for the call high daily definition pardon me no thanks for the call high daily definition\nNope thanks for the call Bailey definition nope thanks for the call daily definition camp nope thanks for the call daily definition mock\nYeah yes it is Marcos is Tim get about your job or a burger baskets out of the station pick of the time I got a\n... market mostly gay and that is today's daily that but as your budget by the ... bar and grill in the ... one minute past noon am twelve thirty ...
