advertisement in the paper the thumb on a thought I think now that have the O L a new Grand Cherokee that we had an extra ...\nYeah and that will try to read so red charities white shirt teams like an angry at there you go\nTo Rio played mine sang grease swine Franklin\nUnfortunately that's what I call nine one one though did you\nKnow no and actually Ryan came right ... came picked it up and got the gloves and it took her in this one once we had a chance to look at it hadn't been used for anything it was still must have been dropped or something to fill the brand new but you can't take a chance in with with ... and all this other stuff that's wrong\nYou can't take any chances you know we're talking on a you know it isn't even take it and I said there was a day when you were just pick that up to take it all the throat in the garbage you know I mean that was you know thirty forty years ago it was no big deal\nNow with it with a sharp ... involved with the needles involved with all the stuff that could be inside the syringe and I'm just a call offers and they'll come and get they've got the gloves in them in a way to the sharks container dispose of it in a way to do it\nBy the way if you had a sharp show something can you bring them to law enforcement\n[noise] I I don't know I Would guess you could ... do they have like the pills drop off yeah and like that in the news you not go in and out of the needles do not go I go into that one uh I call and ask a I I don't know if they if they go and I'm Renee do either because\nWe I brought some uh we had a prescription bottles and and some you know you never seems like finished the prescriptions right so I use this\nIs right in the bottom and drink do till it's done yes I oh I Know all the way you know all the people who do you feel better anyway okay so there there were ... we had someone I brought down their Craig method of happened to be down there and and I had\nA dinner and I asked him about sharply sharpest there but I I Can't remember what the answer was so I just know Internet all the drop off there there's not ... yeah but I talked to them down along the figure something out there are at\nOdds eleven twenty four came the Iran for sixty one twelve thirty if you have any calls questions comments or user a pizza attacks on and say one twelve thirty joining us here in Studio or he ... he wears a bandage today so we can we can let him in a legal Tuesday Jeremy wonder how much would the DNR Jeremy welcome to the show and thanks for having me out today um we\nWe uh we kind of got a they've caught up and everything is going on right now you forgot to tax me I didn't even think about it either but they use different with NBA or coming up uh we care is already here\nRight it's easier to actually starts on the Eighteenth so all the kids are off from school for ... ah we have a North West Minnesota used to hunt so take a look on page thirty five of our hunting a synopsis to make sure that the area you want to do is open um it's basically are Pennington Marshall\nKissing rose on the wood county areas but um some of it of those zones actually extend a little bit south indirectly comics will take a look on that page to see if he's on his open and get junior out there to uh get a deer\n... you know how long has the youth there have been going on for quite a while\nUm I can say it's been out at least for eight years because I remember the first year we had it was the first year my son would have qualified so okay eight years ago was the first year we had always reasoning they wanted to start doing this it was designed to be a mentor and hunt so um that's why we don't go all the way up to the age of Seventeen so we should mention that that is for people that are Fifteen Years of age are under so ten to Fifteen year olds\nUm and it's a metric tons of has to be with an adult so you can have one guy out there with three kids and let them go in the woods altogether there has to be an adult with each other a youth that are out there hunting\nSo it was just the way we had really hide your numbers that year too so it was another way to limit some of those numbers to get rid of some of the deer deprivation and some of our areas that had five year limits I'm so that she has to give the kids at the opportunity to go out there without the hassle of dad meaning to shoot a dear as well so it was only that we're allowed to hunt\n'em and it helped out a reduced the population and now it's it's been popular so we ... I still see quite a few folks coming from the metro area coming here to utilize the hunters well\nOkay I and you talked about dad not hunting to in the case of the Utah ... dads and moms adults whatever cannot carry a weapon is that correct correct\nThey can't time so they couldn't party with it and the campaign for something else it's designed to be there to mentor the youth center get them excited about the outdoors get them out there um you know a liking deer hunting and stuff like that so it's a way for them to have all of their attention focused on the youth rather than than you know trying to harbor severe themselves\nKay how they have to have a a a a license purchase for the upcoming season or did you how does the licensing work\nA great question so it's actually a regular season you're licensed its ballot for four days early so if you do want to participate in the hunt you just go in and buy a regular your license for their use\n'em ten eleven and twelve year olds actually get a free license and the uh Thirteen fourteen Fifteen year olds pay five dollars for the license I should mention that in Minnesota or any youth and this includes not residents as well\nAny use license in Minnesota is no more than five dollars and if you have a ten eleven or twelve year old even if they're non resident get a free to your license to hunted Minnesota does the mental have to have a license to know a great question in the metro does not have to have a license as well so if you have an unlicensed mom it wants to have um\nJunior out there to hunt or they do not need to have purchased a license or just have to have a license for the\nI'm On a hunter safety and we know that at age twelve they they get hunter safety but this is for ten to Fifteen so how does hunter safety get involved with the youth aren't\nWell this was something that legislators did for us to give us a little bit more complication of your old I can say fire fire safety are usually aren't allowed to take from safety and I'm not qualified to there to get their certificate until they turn twelve\nUm with this metric hunt if you were ten or eleven and you haven't taken part in safety you must be within arm's reach up an adult so they couldn't go sit by themselves they can't get more than an arm's reach away so that mom or dad or aunt or uncle whoever it is could\nStop them from doing something unsafe um and also if the kids are a ... sort of want to try this hunt and having taken farm safety yet we do have that other option which is the hunter apprentice validation so you go in and you pay your three dollars and fifty cents and then that allows you to uh try hunting you also purchase a license without a fire safety certificate\nUm to try out hunting for a period of one year um and then you go out and you can actually you don't let you buy a license without a fire and safety certificate or just to try to get people excited about the doors and see if they like it or not before they take the full class\nAnd a and the but The Apprentice you can only uses one or two\nBut it's actually gonna be for two years now and while you're when you're saying is that you have to go back and purchased another one for the second year if you can get into a class by them okay but hopefully we get all the parents to get the kids in there and that have practiced hunter can't come by themselves either they must be with another person that's already taken firearms safety or someone that was exempt from it and on The Apprentice\nWas was there an age on they print is no nobody nobody had adult could use The Apprentice correct\nWe want to get people out into the outdoors um this again was given to us by our friends in the legislator um that uh it's a way to get people interested in the outdoors without without having to sit through the whole entire class I\n... I like ah I liked that idea though I'm a member when it when it came up and because of my uh my son a had a couple of buddies that didn't typically hot air and we brought him with one year with The Apprentice license yet and they had a chance to go out and and learn about itself\nCan make a lifetime all ... you know love earlier doors just on that one instance so you know what's going to just go right especially to see the big one yeah yeah [laughter]\nAll right so that you thought when did you start this Thursday the Eighteenth so ... ... a half hour before sunrise shooting our start or shall I remind folks in his own that are open for deer hunting if you're a bow hunting or something else doing other types of hunting or we got to have you believe in God or buddies pink\nA new one took the full brunt of the pick up in a total out pretty much a that was the one that was still there and the second one another both slightly larger according to the driver\nI'm had just been kind of bumped grazed ... made a down into the ditch and out through the woods I we went looking for that wanted to see if it was injured and I we had to put it down or something like that but we couldn't find inside there was a second that all their news there yet that was just north of Holt\nRight yep just north of ... threat right as you hit there on the the big corner yep a is what it was and it was funny because we uh we saw it and then when we went by and they just put the ... on the trailer\nAnd we'd go by and the huge antlers and and that so yeah we actually turned around and came back and then kind of hollowed out at him and he knows what's going on and they said that to pick up that he had\nAnd stuff and that's why I wanted to call you what happens if you hit an al because an elk ... either very specialized area do you get an elk license during the season but uh what happens to be hidden help with your vehicle\nWhat's your do well ... the individual did strike the animal um is gonna be able to pick up what he did get to utilize the means or what he has to do though is we do take samples from every oak we find whether it's a ... of each of the samples of the ... or is he means they're harvested during our a kitchen county oak season\nUm their samples taken have lymph nodes liver um and why is that just check for a cw de ... because it is such a a a small sample size that we get 'cause we have so few elk any way we could test you know\nTwo hundred thousand year we harvest every year but we ... about twenty ... each year so are we want to get um they do genetic testing they see what types of diseases they had if they have in ... if they've been exposed to um a brain worm\nA liberal groups all sorts of different things so we can get more information on that species that we have in Minnesota so er an individual came and took the samples that was required and then the person was allowed to take it to the meat locker and get a permit I gave them a permit for that so that he can utilize meat\nOkay so if you hit and al ... you're the one that hits it you have the right to that and I first right basically an animal\nGets at the same with the ... so the striking and that changed a few years back I'm actually in legislator now that the striking person is actually a like you said first choice or first right to that animal\nOkay now what if they don't want it\nUm I have a list of folks that are interested in road kill animals whether it's bears whether it's a beer things like that I gave away a lot more deer during the season if they know there are going to be cutting up there and they want to make some sausage\nI get a lot more folks that find beer alongside the road it looks pretty good I'd like to get a permit for it and then they end up taking it home and utilizing the meat way more than when it's Ninety degrees out and and they're not already cutting up someone\nHere okay okay so um if you do have an animal do they do they call a state patrol law enforcement they called the unarmed who who do they call and how does how does it go because you have you had an animal or you're a little maybe a little worked out but you may you may even have been injured I'm so we want to know kind of ahead of time what what what you need to do\nFor sure so first and foremost after injury to get a hold of nine one one and you get somebody there to help you um if you're not injured or the endless still needs to be taken care of you've got to get a hold of a either state patrol through our dispatch um or your county sheriff's office and they'll get a cold a hold them the closest officer that will be there to put the animal down to it doesn't get back up and get on the road and hurt somebody else\nUm otherwise at the animals are already gone to even get a hold of the state patrol dispatch will dispatch us that you get a hold of me on my cell phone or through my radio in my car or on my computer\nThrough an email and um then they'll give me your number to call in contact you I'm On the biggest things that can help or something like that will probably come to the scene and get the samples and take a look at it at a at that um otherwise I can issue a permit to you uh read through your smartphone oh okay uh you don't have to uh be worse\nThan that so many right you need a permit signed by DNR\nCorrect yep and I'll have it it'll be issued from me and have it on there and you have to keep that with you as long as you have any of the um meet left in your possession\nYou actually take the samples um I don't I'm not good with a scalpel but [laughter]\nUm but we have a full from our wildlife officers we have biologist or can actually I don't even trained they can act or lymph nodes and all these other things but uh something else on something big like an elk probably go up there just to check to make sure that there wasn't any kind of fell play involved but from what I had three different people call me on it and say that either saw it happen or were right there right after it so it was definitely hit by a car\nIt wasn't something that they had yeah shot and tried to get by us that use it for another ... or two three five ... ... if a if you hit\nThe animal and just say the viewer you're somebody who carries a rifle in your trunk or or you have a a a permit to carry you have a gun can you just factually animal yourself or what are you guys suggests\nNormally you should actually has contact law enforcement first um because then will you'll be free yourself from liability um I've had it happen before a guy says you know what I've got a twenty two here with me I'm an hour and a half away the deer suffering in the ditch out if they have a safe thing I'll give them permission to download a permission from you got around it and that's what you should do first at all times get permission ahead of\nTime because they don't and you come to the scene you find that it's been shot a few times and you know that they've got the weapon\nAnd maybe they pulled it out of the little towns who\nKnows but I just a distance yourself as ... exactly and so having your bases and then just get permission so that the liability isn't there\nOkay and uh certainly again as if they don't want anything you have a list of names so that they're that way if it doesn't go to waste if they just get hit you could maybe contact somebody who\nOh for sure and and the deer list as went down over the years um but a bare have got a list of folks indefinitely folks for help and there is a moose list but that's pretty dusty in the corner I haven't\nHad a set up like a long time ... ... ... is our moose population coming back you know I I I've seen a few between a how born anew fold and I think it is right on the south\nSide of Agassi I was with one of my training as this year and I saw the biggest bullets\nIn a new fold and I think it is right on the south side of Agassi I was with one of my training as this year and I saw the biggest ball I've ever seen a North West Minnesota with a cow\nI'm Still coming into Elmo WMA over by farms pool where people do their duck hunting\nI'm across the road through a ditch and the ditch looked like it had to be about ten feet and he because he couldn't touch and he was going to cross but he was a massive animal big Ehlers so um but there's a of a meeting pair I'm hoping they liked each other because they went out across the road is already I Want to have\nPlayed some romantic music as something they didn't even go on a\nShirt changed since the years where we used to have to change its chase moves out of town oh sure who it's only really changed\nI could remember pushing ones when I was twelve of this is like Nineteen eighty seven and we get more ... than here so if we chased the woods you know to get one or two years I'm Out on the day you're driving six most\nYeah I'd definitely changed when we moved over here in eighty seven and a I remember wife when I first Hans and in the middle river area and yeah there was moose everywhere where I hunt so now it's a treat and I consider it a treat to see most you know what I don't see him around and\nTalk to my youth at the farm safety classes and I happen to raise their hand who's seen them loose in the wild and when I first started this is you know fourteen short years ago\nUm everybody can raise their hand and now it's less than a third Asher maybe less than that kind of sad but hopefully there'll be on their way back\nUm since it's legal Tuesday and the Alan and are normally wouldn't know in a Ryan is here to talk a lot about in town stuff or let's let's talk a little bit about with with the 'cause we we brought up by al topics where we say hey you and you have to check with a D and are\nThings like the river going through town here and when there's things that happen on the river I'm ... and the animals you talked about what most coming or bear come in or what not into the city limits how does a D in our get involved with ... glass\nNormally would like to let the a local agency whether it's the city or if it's on the river would be the county would be ... on the river as it goes through town\nUm we let them you know take the lead on it if we can assist in some way unfortunately we don't have the really cool tranquilizing guns and stuff like that and the chemicals that would make them fall asleep and things like that\nOr we just don't have that so we can be there for any type of assistance we have vehicles that can load animals way easier if they\nUnfortunately have to be put down her was hit by a car or it's harder to put them in their squads than it is in the back of my pick up so I can usually go there and assist with that so pick up animals that way but normally we wait to be um you know request assistance from the local agency and then we go out and helping and we we can\nWe've never been shy about calling I'm sure because they've they've got in the novel and and the equipment I says you get to pick up trucks and whatever so it's a\nMinimum wage in the back of my truck so if it's a big animal we can actually win then we don't have to worry about lifting at things like that so hard to get ramps so I mean I can get a disposal things pretty easily I guess is part of it um otherwise technical advice on how to to deter the animal from coming back things like that\nWe had issues with um coyotes coming into town over on the west side ... earlier this year I'm trying to get some type of advice on how to do that I talked to some of my local trap or see if they could get permission to set some traps\nOr because you know the couch or unprotected can be taken at any time you know without a license and there's no seasonal license no limit us or didn't try to do that to save the small pets of the western rather than some of the city and I didn't I hadn't hadn't heard of any of them actually losing any pets or anything\nLike that ... to the coyote or coyotes that were over there I didn't hear anything and another\n... ... it's almost like they moved on because they just you didn't hear anything and they were just\nA he's somebody got them and we didn't hear about it or or moved on yeah\nAnd actually it was pretty smart they actually had more sightings on garbage days then they hit on non garbage days so it figured out when the garbage trucks were becoming on when it comes to get the garbage and that's that's the truth they actually had more people call when people had garbage out in front of the places instead of you know other nights mhm so they figured out there were some good food sources if they could come in a garbage and then leave again without\nThe ... season a duck season things going\nYou know it's it's been a moderate I Would say moderate uh we haven't seen as many a local birds and the migrants having come down yet you think when we had ten degrees that it had to be way colder in the north and they'd be coming down but\nUh we haven't seen that big influx of our migrant population coming through ah we still have a central crane season open and there are still some central cranes out so if you want to get out and get a crane it yourself a crane permit\nAnd we'll take care of that um I worked on opening weekend on the flight ... pretty good success there are

with\nPolanski himself was born in Russia in a small village called all and that's but he always felt that Poland was his whole\nMen would someday be his home\nIn Nineteen eighty when World War one came to a close\nPoland was a re carved as a country and re feared on the maps and the first time in a hundred and twenty three years\nBut immediately the Russians under the new regime of flooding

down they've resisted in every way imaginable does Polanski was one of them along with another gentleman he cofounded a resistance movement and\nAnd all because he wanted his country to be free free

reason was the polish communist government knew that you couldn't tell the story the full story of the total Polanski without revealing what he had done after the time that he resisted the Nazis so they they would have loved\nTo have had the story told [noise]\nOf what he had done to resist the German but of course everybody would then asked what what did they do afterwards\nAnd then you'd have to tell the story of the fact that he was against the tyranny of the Soviet Union to it was against the communist regime so instead of having any of that story being told they decreed that his very name could not be spoken in public his own family\nWere advised by the government that they could be federalized would be finalized jail if they spoke of the top ... in public it wasn't until after

analysts rapper he does all of it or Steve in Jackson stacks will be joining us in the third our so you don't want to miss any of this is the odd couple\nIn Mr Parker how you\nDoing today I'm doing just great how are you Mr Chris Broussard I'm\nGreat man if it's lovely weather out here in LA and I mean we're a heat wave would go with the right way or in the morning and it just makes you feel good\nUh makes you feel good every day we're not rubbing it in na na around the rest of the country not at all and then of course a lot so welcome in an odd couple of crew as always\nWe have back in the south or producer Rob G A engineer our legs are anchored Deb cautious to keep you updated or through the rest of the show and a intern Sean\nThey are in all Chris on the other side of the glass so that means Mr Broussard let's kick some ass on trash\nTalking to say about ... you know it so it will be later on in the program your chance to trash anyone anything in the world is for your call us up\nYour give us a hot taken about thirty seconds come hard strong facet of Mike and a chant way\nRound Parker we watched that game last night the Green Bay Packers I picked to win the Superbowl or to reach the super bowl this year against the New England patriots actually pick them to beat the patriots and\nThe super bowl now I think I'm Crazy\nI see no way that's going to happen they did win last night but they edge the beat down beat up hapless San Francisco forty niners they won thirty three thirty because of the heroics late game heroics\nAre no surprise there of Aaron Rodgers and Rob I'm Sorry\nI feel like the Green Bay Packers and I'm not the first to say this but they are wasting the prime of Aaron Rodgers this guy should have more than one Super Bowl\nHe should have more than one Super Bowl appearance\nAnd their waste in ten years they're the best quarterback arguably that we've ever seen mobile can run to make any throw\nAnd they don't put the pieces around them number one and number two they've got the most unimaginative off events in the NFL\nTheir waste any that's what you wrote that\nWas your take away from the game last night because I I've\nBeen thinking that for a while but last night just underscore did you\nLike there were underscored I got you I last night when I came away with it even more\nWas\nTo be able to watch this guy work his magic and we've seen it for years now\nThat's why they're always in the ... you're right they don't always have the greatest talent but they're always in the hunt they always have a chance you give that got the ball at the end of a Raj has a chance of beating you 'cause he's that good the roll down the nice that holds on the sidelines all that other stuff but what I came out I thought about was this\nThat\nAaron Rogers was is officially to me the book the book poked [laughter] he's opposed the poll best passer\nOf all time that's what I took away last night because I don't think most quarterbacks can do if you saw the score to the touchdown he do to try to game 'cause yes how many guys can make that path\nA fantastic pass\nRight by the time I I look at him and not just marvel at what he can do now your your take on them wasting him I think that's why they have a new GM this year I think that's why Wednesday\nNew Jim go and bring in a running\nWell a main\nAttorney question what a lot a lot of teams don't don't run the football nearly as much as they used to but I get it\nBut if it would always teams have some sort of a threat\nBut Aaron Rodgers also is a guy who's had at least two other trips to the Superbowl snatched away from him\nDon't forget there was the on site kick up in Seattle right which was supposed joy nails was supposed to catch it in the tide in\nA hit it like it he was told to block ... watched the video or go watch a get a look at a picture of it Jody knows his right behind the tight end he knocks it away from Jodi Nelson\nAnd of course Seattle yeah got the ball or what they were supposed to go to the super bowl that year and there's one other I'd have to go back but there was too too that he should have gone\nTo doesn't matter what it should have no other saying what he had been closed the and let's get\nBack to the poll I yes I Love your own thing of the uh low for folks are without them or so all that but some of them just don't make sense why\nWho cares about being the book poll he's the well I don't want him to be the guy\nAnd he will not being the gold conversation unless he can win more Super Bowl when he does not win more Super Bowls unless they get more imaginative on off is let him do its thing and get him some help if he can win you know round\nBowls here's the thing don't count 'em out don't count the Packers out that they're never going to win again 'cause I don't believe\nThat well of course I ... I Believe he but he's got to do the right now they don't do they look like they're going to win the Superbowl this you know not right\nNow but they're also like a a half to get better but when you keep winning these games they could be right now have only one last time\nDon't want to hear about all the laws we did a lot of them five\nBut then there's nothing to do what they were ... we\nCame up here with a bunch of excuses for LeBron James he could have five titles you wouldn't be here and that what you have kind of corporate had just hit that shocked me down way I'd even\nTalking about that you're going to sit here you got exclusive full abroad and he still I\nI don't like it is usually more if I Try to you wouldn't be killing me all you're going to see here make excuses for your man is you caught him\nA Raasch hey Roger [laughter] I'm just saying I look I Love a ride I think just as much as you but I Want more Super Bowl so he can really be in the conversation for the goal is you know ...\nThere's no wow either yesterday when he won't\nBe there with one and I get that there's no doubt about it if he wants to more Super Bowls and the numbers and the stuff that he's doing he could be in that Congress\nHas you know they have these if he's definitely an\nIffy Serino and with all you know is the best quarterback rating of any quarterback ever best a touchdown to intercept to Rachel any quarterback and ended up not as by a wide margin it's not even close for the war\nTo help you get out of a ditch [noise]\nYeah I Know I'm a bit rusty sadly you know nine [noise]\nHe was far

weigh in on our\nEarlier conversations are the Green Bay Packers wasting the prime of air Rogers or anything else in the NFL give us a shout at eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox that's eight seven seven nine nine six six three six nine and we'll get to you\nAfter our next guest we bring it in the host of Fox NFL Sunday you can follow him on Twitter at Kurt men to be\n[noise] it is of course none other than Kermit if he Curt welcome to the AQAP why are you doing what's happened to\nYou guys doing\nWere great man we're great enjoying a a wonderful NFL season and we were watching the game last night as I'm sure you were to Green Bay San Francisco obviously the forty niners are done this year but they gave the Packers the battle encourage it just drove home the point to me\nThat I feel like the Green Bay Packers are wasting the prime years of Aaron Rodgers I don't think they put enough around him I don't think they have the creativity of off ... and my off or or what do you think you're all of that\nThough [laughter] I don't I but the problem you're looking you're looking at what I remember him off as you think about running game ever run again when they're running or suspended unhealthy\nWhat they do you think they have the running game that he needs yeah I heard it all over the other thing\nThat look that often it's not going to run the first of all the way the NFL now you know very few teams are going to run the ball thirty times the game anymore now when I don't think I I think the debt off in particular is not never was going to run ball thirty drive the gate they needed up the threat to open up play\nAc unit cetera et cetera I think they got that they're I think they've got the titans but he hasn't had in years past ... maybe ... or Michael fiddling with a Jimmy ... not what it used to be but I think they've got the combination of of guys there jamming and Kendrick and\nMercedes Louis that they can do the job or more this week and I love their while to get it yeah we're looking at the scene like no it hasn't been fully healthy\nOffice including Aaron Rodgers has the opening week so I think when they're healthy they've gotten more pieces now what a question defensively\nWhat they have I think that's a fair argue that well I think all up to me I I really don't don't worry about it or they can't go work team will be ... I think the ... like that I\n... what uh what about the giants and he lied manning a made up\nA lot of people out the giants made a mistake when they didn't go after a while for a judge quarterback last June to drop with so many gods available to bring them back they said the running game\nA ... it was going to help 'em and then they'd have all the receivers back and all the other stuff and he still looks pretty bad or what are the giants go from here and and give me an evaluation on on the line\nYou know I think you take a look at it I was one of those that I saw them in training camp I saw them free season and I bought into the fact that I thought they had the weapons that thriller office somebody was going\nAnd I bought into the fact that I thought they had the weapons that thriller off that somebody was going to help and while the dysfunction that happened on defense happened because that season went south and respect the head coach et cetera so I thought oh that would be straightened out they'd be pretty good team\nAnd then you see a by the opening game against Jackie do you start scratching your head to go with little old year old son right and then watching players that goes on and on and not only the local he looks for lack of a better term you get if you look like he sees goats\nEither he's going down in the past Roskam forty dumping the ball off throwing it away he doesn't really seem to have the wherewithal to stay in the pocket anymore that offers of mine's not great but it's not as bad as I think he makes it look through part of the time\nGoing back to your question about the drought I think that's where you go if we can see this now and maybe they got a little too um but they should have been able to just said hey you know this is a year\nNow what we don't know if maybe they didn't like any of those quarterbacks as much as everybody else that maybe they think the kids out of Oregon urban next year is going to be better than they all will be and then they'll have a shot at him because so many teams have already gotten their quarterback you know so they didn't want to risk\nTaking the number to pick on on a quarterback that they didn't believe it and pass up on Barkley who is without a doubt are they going to be generational running that\nYou could ever generation running back for eight years you can have a quarterback with these guys are not getting it now for twenty\n[laughter] right right that's a big difference no doubt come yeah\nIt's the idea of what Chris Broussard ... room were Kirk men to feed the host of Fox NFL Sunday and currently says\nThis for you guys know about four years been amount a month just been a mom well congratulation\nThank God thank you very much we're enjoying it I'm you're in the studio obviously what how long and Michael straying Terry Bradshaw Jimmy Johnson all that what they think about today's NFL with the you know the rules\nReally favored as you said you can't really hit the quarterback you know defensive players you know really have to be on your ... and ... so to speak\nUm and the scores or you know astronaut through the roof yards especially a guy like Bradshaw mean yard is now ... arena football outside what what do they think about the waste the game is ... now\nI I think when we all sit there and we watch every play of every game because you've got to go to our studio we have monitors so we see every single play every game as they go on and it's just everybody marvels at it\nYou know I think how we and and and ah Michael ... at least they've said publicly too\nThat it would be hard for them defensively you know to to pull off in the play the game the way it's played now but they weren't I don't think God's have much of a choice and I think you've hit on the nail on the head or the jury seated Jimmy sees it\nAlways talked about too as well do the job of the national football league is to have people watch it and make the games exciting and keep the ratings up and you know increase it and that's what they're doing forty three forty has people\nWatching [laughter] right right you know thirty eight thirty five so even with the ... last night you know the score points\nPeople are gonna watch it and we can say it's arena football he says the twelve football\nDefensive guys don't have a fair shot with say don't but you know it's just the way of the world right now and this is really come up with the college game and we've been seeing in the in the NFL the last four or five years you know they started probably five years ago where everybody's like we can't get off of the mind because\nOften the wine it don't get down the frequent stance in college and it's all the spread office and it's all receivers and you have a hard time by this\nAnd now it used to be sports filtered down from the pro level to college to high school it's done the other way around\nThat's what I was going to sleep that's strange that college like the NFL has follow college versus the other way around\nAnd it's not even just that I've been colleges follows high school when you look at these quarterbacks I mean look at all the kids that came out you were old enough to call them kids who were trapped in the first round this year all those guys were in quarterback camps will never twelve Thirteen fourteen fifty so\nThey throw more football they study the game\nMore than guys had when they play the league for five years Twenty years ago those guys were guys who play basketball basketball season baseball the baseball season and then they play football and then they went on to college and specialized maybe a little bit more than ... yourself and really learn the craft you got kids that are teenagers now to do nothing\nBut throw the football year round and study the concepts and those kinds of things so I think we see guys that are more advanced when they get to the NFL which allows the coaches implemented zinc they see at the youth level or the college level because those the concept of the players have been running for years and in some cases you know maybe a decade\nYou would think that they I mean he knew obviously rituals around age at home with them by but that doesn't mean they have metal he's not going to ... I mean been Simmons is riches agent to in ... I'm not saying he's going to\nDirect him there but it does say eight I think it opens the door where the Lakers have a great shots of getting\nI I just don't think anybody's going to wind up I think that this will be the time that LeBron comes people see what's going on with LeBron and with the Lakers and it's a swing and miss and then it'll be like\nLeBron and with the Lakers and it's a swing into ... and then it'll be like I Would love to see what the what the game plan is after that if they don't let that second player and just say for speculation say crews\nThat the war is somehow basically stay together maybe just around we stayed data gathered in why didn't there's no way to run there'll be those guys eight seven seven Ninety nine all Fox is the ah telephone number unless or
