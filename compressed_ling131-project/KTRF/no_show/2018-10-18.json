and I am saying I Hope very much that the person who did this is a apprehended than charged prosecuted under convicted given a severe punishment\nHowever when you go beyond just the statement I been sexually assaulted and you start making accusations either in a court of law or in this very public forum of the the Senate Judiciary committee\nAt that point I think you have to deliver the goods as you say you need to know the specifics in fact I've I've talked to people on the air who who have different with me on this and I said it is very important I Know that there is a tendency to try and

New Yorker latest work is a politically incorrect feminist it was published by St Martin's press\nLooking at ah the circumstances of the Supreme Court today we reached the point where you could look at almost any given issue and if you are a veteran Supreme Court watcher\nYou could pretty much call the outcome of within a vote because the court has become so completely illogical that there is a very great predictability about how it given justice will vote on an issue do you think that's a good or bad\nIt's bad [laughter] each one as we all should should be\nThinking quite independently and

has turned into the sound of one left hand clapping\nAnd no tolerance for diversity intellectual diversity there's a lot of desire to have ethnic and racial diversity\nBut what about thinking to yourself\nWell why don't you that I don't think thinking for yourself is encouraged in fact I Would have to ask you as a person who is again the the term legendary is a is a a thought about the too casually I think these days but the call you a legendary feminist leader would be accurate and now you've written\nCan be there for the call you a legendary thumbs leader would be accurate and now you've written this a politically incorrect feminist my guess is you've taken a fair amount of heat for this book\n[noise] well I think I Will but I have written on the books and I've taken hates them I wrote the new anti Semitism when I saw the ethnic hatred of the Jewish people rising and coming to us from the left him from the Islamic world not merely from the white right wing neo Nazi world\nAnd I took heat and then I wrote a book called the death of feminism where I look at the failure of women's studies which became rapidly gender studies sexuality studies gay and lesbian studies but no women the women would disappear and all of our civil rights issues which are still burning issues will forgotten\nAnd our feminists knowledge was not systematically passed on to next generations and that's why the at me too movement arose\nAs a way of reinventing the feminist we'll we\nThe early Nineteen seventies had speak ads on rape condemned it we worked on legislation we set

I Believe a fraction became or or certainly interacted with an overlapped with with a tip\n[laughter] and they effectively I I guess gotten the chance to\nReview those those beliefs and those hypotheses within government we've taxpayers' money and and that of course gives us in an interesting opportunity to find out about ... because\nWas often an interesting opportunity to find out about this because I and I hope we'll we'll have time to get into this late but now of course talk of congressional hearings to to get to the bottom of that but\nBut the bottom line drawn the question is is that I think there was a believer ... they made them move they came up again some wrote a couple of different right blocs one right ball with they simply go to a point where you know they they looked at this and\nAnd they investigate it but because they didn't get a definitive on\nThe feeling was but they taking it as far as as they couldn't what else can you do\nThe other sort of blow up but they had this very controversial later\nI called it a religious road block from from senior people in the Pentagon who frankly for the UFOs from the paranormal with him on it and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do\nWell what do we\nDo we won't have anything to do it\nI mean um it it was started the whatever the it was but I I as I say that there were people\nIn the beginning probably still all who who's deeply conservative religious beliefs\nLead them to think that that they are dealing with that they don't make a demonic phenomenon here might come uh come up again is there for a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of one of my bosses was um\nUh she you know they're pretty extreme with the S. and in the the the individual who wrote that the classified\nIntelligence assessment on on UFOs in the ministry of defense\nCarried name project ... he would have wanted to go too far down that road he had some play the old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book of Asians I think it is where it refers to say as being the print the power of the air and I think is where a lot of these conservative religious people ... the idea of UFOs might be demonic\nCan just you know and there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] yeah and and it\nIt it's frustrating you know than because and and it's almost ... ironic in another way that you know you have a bunch of people\nIn in the cod that the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating it researching it in a proper scientific manner\nAnd we come up against skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect um but that skepticism isn't the sort of [noise] they Nicole or intellectual a human they kept a system but I think most people\nI associate with that concept it's actually it it it's a ... probably trying to believe or tripping skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the pen picking 'em\nI say that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic well it's just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another so really these by\nThese people were skeptical told they will leave but they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back and chat more right here on coast to coast or you\nKnow you can get show updates and connect with other coups tunes when you're doing the ... billion Facebook page just go to preschool dot com slash goes to go see him and the like button [noise]\n\n\nAm twelve thirty J.

I defense reaching in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represent a threat not the only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know if you ate piece represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd so this this gets quite interesting because ah parts of the the ministry of defense was saying to parliament the media and the public know there's just no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if that\nOf any defense in ... but no no no threat and yet in the way they were classified documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper assessment and so we we can't tell\nYou simply can't sell well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be some kind of threat\n... it would be if\nWe could absolutely\nSay that it's it's physically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes and psychological delusions\nAnd and an other misunderstood\nPhenomena the the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like bought Hopkins type Jacobs where we're always saying\nYou know that this whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack and and some of the other people who take him on new agents spiritual view of this\nTalk about healing and things like that and he goes back to the idea of who who can really say and I know this sounds bizarre but in millet treat 'em\nThere is actually in a way Asian\nFor I'm working out whether this is a threat to our knowledge or robbed of this this\nIs a kind of them we don't know the values but intelligence some military sickles\nWe say that ... is defined as being a a construct of capability plus intent\nSo so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you would count ways of the ... and if there is\nWhat ... what kind of a threat it is well we have some idea about the capability of you ate pay and and again the the file the ministry defense files state like clearly you know pizza maneuvers\nWay in excess of anything but then we've got so the capability\nWe we know has a higher value what we don't have any idea about his intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once\nWe it may be unknowable in the u._k. the astronomer royal to march in race\nSpeculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and uh gender and motivation said it may be trying to approach to try and figure this out he said it might be ... the analogy would be trying to explain quantum mechanics\nAnd you can find the well we don't know what it is we don't know what they want but can you categorically scenic that it's happening\nI Can't say that abduction is happening no I don't know that\nBut I mean visitations visitation\nWell what I can say is that there seems to be strong and credible evidence that\nYou a pay a rail that they do routinely penetrate are already defined\nRegion I'm In the u._k. the U.

it's a great a point which is of course he goes back to this this thing that I think a lot of people in this field do no\nI'm the idea that this phenomenon suddenly started in Nineteen forty seven is of course crazy I mean people have seen strange things in the sky since the dawn of time but I think the other interesting thing about this this cold and these these familial\nRecollections is is the fact that you know these these phenomena are always interpreted through the lens of of personal belief system and culture and it is interesting when you come up against couches where where this\nThis thing is is almost commonplace that it's it's like oh yeah you know that that's the thing we don't necessarily know what it is but yeah it's it's real miniature Israel\nWe don't necessarily know what

listen to many times and you're very um [noise] informed and entertaining to listen to um I have two part question if I may uh first of all a based upon all of your knowledge of um [noise]\nThe western powers all of the NATO countries them for that matter and let's say the eastern bloc countries ... how many ... as long as you've been following this how many uh aircraft and uh pilots had disappeared and this guy while pursuing so called UFOs\nAnd are based upon your response I I have a second part a final question if I may okay\nNicky with us yeah sorry I thought you were going to hit me with pot too straight away\nWhile we're waiting for the world will be down there aren't one\nI'm now I'm going to found a little bit skeptical on on this I Would say the on three is less than than a lot of things that I've I've read in in the UFO and tentative belief communities I mean I've\nSeen some people talk about pilots going missing and and you eh fires and I think\nYou know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous\nUm occupational certainly laws in in the early days in a lot of lot of egg Croft just disappeared because they crashed now now of course then you have\nDo you have some kind of see cases like a ... ... the mentality case we he didn't disappear of course but he crashed chasing a UFO which skeptics say with the planet Venus we coming off of cost to the fortieth anniversary of arguably the most\nFamous disappearance of all time involving a UFO Frederick ...\nOh yes and that was strange I think we're literally don't use the way in Australia right\nYes I absolutely over the or is it by trade I think all the time has been\nStraight maybe the bass straight is part of the past month say excuse me I'm geographically challenged in that particular part of the world but um but I I don't buy into the room as that that I've heard the pilots were were\nSharing and disappearing or all the time as a result of of that we had a case in the u._k. tragic case involving a pilot who who just flew his car off into the sea\nIn Nineteen Seventy it was during a night exercise and some people years later I tried to attribute a UFO\nA story on to that but I pulled out the board of inquiry file which was about two inches thick I went through every single pipe in not filed and I couldn't couldn't actually substantiate any of these UFO rumors so I think I think the ... the question is is very few\nVery handy okay go ahead and they say oh okay so the second part question based upon your your response to this\nUh as you probably know during the Eisenhower administration there were so many aircraft that we're a suddenly a malfunctioning falling out of the skies\nAnd uh yes in some cases just suddenly disappeared that the Eisenhower administration gave the order\nTo a stop to pursue the aggressive pursuit by American aircraft obese UFOs and secondly I spoke to Dr Heinrich before he passed away a Chicago radio station for about a

terrorism and counterterrorism and the intelligence agencies it's our turn Kendall now and uh it's it's going straight\nTo a paper by going I think November fifteens\nGood luck brothers that's the

our final segment with Nick Pope of course huge part of the aliens up the Pentagon filmed the DVD as well in his latest book is an action thriller called blood brothers and how do you get the book Nick\nWell its own chemical at the moment I'm a I'm coming out in paperback in November but it's on Amazon so so basically I just go get dramas and look up blood brothers Nick Pope or it's on late Nick ... website on the books\nSuper in your opinion uh assuming we're being visited do you think most of them look like these so called de Leon graze the people described or do they look like us what do you think\nWell and it's a tricky question because I think the media I'm kind of might have this this kind of\nTrump or me or whatever you call it of of the alien gray and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because I think you know when people say oh I've seen one of these aliens ... gray large head ... shaped\nOil it gets reported but when when somebody says they see something that doesn't quite fit the mold maybe it doesn't quite make the caught or get the coverage but in my experience when people report entities just as when they report UFOs they come in all shapes and sizes\nRobust sure do but you but you saw almost saying then that people basically they hear this they hear this and then they think they see it\nYes I think perception plays a big part in this but here again who who can say what um what technology if we are being visited by a civilization in let's face it the universe is nearly fourteen billion years old\nImagine what a civilization which you say a million years head start on us money to be able to do in terms of you know hiding themselves masking that true appearance\nDeception uh it's it's unimaginable so so again I think we're in the

maybe from\nI again I think it takes us into the territory of water are we dealing with even if we didn't leave some something real do we really know what it is\nAre we dealing with it even if we

all of of this and\nI think earlier in the show I said that there is unlikely to be one single neat solution to the usa mystery so I think you know when you asked me what might be out there I don't think if there are other civilizations and the cosmos which I firmly believe there are\nI don't think it's going to be a question you know there's just one of the civilization um that for you know are they good or bad I suspect\nIf we share this cause ...\nWe share it with with a whole bunch of different civilizations which which may have absolutely different points on the moral spectrum if I can call it that um I guess the person's way of saying that would be you know there's probably\nGood aliens outlet but knowing I'm actually stick extraterrestrials\nAnd and ... year olds yeah with with

not only for U.S Treasury certainly for large purchases in the defense industry\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if\nThe school provides a you know at the end of the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans\nUp but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most apps and of the consumer protections but I just mentioned\nWhat if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted author student loan novel huh\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless you're making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um\n[noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there but I can tell you what we have now today is the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nUh people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war has the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise] ah so\nThe founders you know are they require bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan absolutely we're going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition Allen\n[noise] sure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default\nOn the loan they want to default don't that's right if it becomes more financial\nThere were to default on the loan they want the default don't that's right\nIf it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead well that's a defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the guarantor ours\nAre often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm\nCompelled the borrower to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they got a sixteen ... percent commission right off the wall so you know where they can make a three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for servicing a healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation and so the financial incentives that\n... there's a federal student loan system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nKnowing spleen the process of a default to loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure that's a that's a good case I'm good easy numbers to start with so fifty thousand offshoot alone when the student graduates what say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nUh they're unable to make payments they\nLose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise] um the student can expect a lot to be thrown into default so the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably defaulted somewhere around\nOh let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars what with penalties and fees and capitalized interests that are slapped onto that loan very quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty\nTwenty five show him the power is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in fall for roughly ... let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars\nOh my God so what the what\nThe lending system will do will say oh you're into falls on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise]\nWe can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nThat will be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera\nSo huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or so ultimately they will wind up um hopefully in the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make\nPayments for about a four ten months typically none of those\nPayments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that oh this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars\nWhile these agents again is sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or these agents that that compel them to do this loan rehabilitation\nGet a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus ... it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nFees and the ... indeed agents are collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own guaranteed horse so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before\nA President Obama so these companies make out like bandits\nThey would far rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than uh than alone that remains it's good that I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there\nTo rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate\nThey default again three to four times and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that a hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loans if that's the fault again and that happened something like eighty percent of the time\nThen the whole process starts again\nTo stay with us Allen let's talk about if there's any recourse here and again we'll take calls next hour with Alan Cohen coast to coast the\nSign of no go zone or read email newsletter today at ... dot com [noise]\n\nThomas Jefferson one said there are two ways to conquer and slave the nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is they will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the sons and they become subject\nTo arrest so in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and and forced to uh to come into court that way\nTo deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nWell that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly a in just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise] uh\nThe one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interests and court costs in fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um\nThat's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson flirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison a that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war\nAs far as an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey all fifty thousand or they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of these defaults the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that it grows even more can't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted\nWhat kind of settlement is that\nFor most people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan default is free unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans they're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org show many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nUh you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um [noise] I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this was happening to realize that\nYou know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you saying that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to rescind revoke suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment and for the case of default is student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nDoes this cross a park party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what has President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\nIt absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAh unfortunately the past say three presidents really have only made the problem worse under Obama Obama essentially federalized the lending programs so that we're before\nA bank such as well as I mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae now let us after a where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans and by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program now Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before\nHe said why is the government property not student loans this is nonsense you know of all places that the government shouldn't be making a profit you would think student loans would be it\nA and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five you know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the ... system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days I'm so unfortunately you know those ... don't Trump's rhetoric was really good but since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than\nDone this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device\nWho herself had stock in student loan collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than

could a file bankruptcy in wipe out to students that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um [noise] some of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away and so um\nSo yeah Congress ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about\nThree tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy this is less far less than the average for other loans so there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that\nWe've had just suffered under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing ... this is a problem to Congress should've

much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nTelling a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma\nOr is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of these student loan issues\nWell absolutely and I agree nobody wants to file for bankruptcy is a terrible thing to have to do and and even more difficult thing to fight for I should say [noise] ah but it's just the threat of bankruptcy that would really help the lending system but you know there there are a lot of things

anymore they'd rather go on the red lake maybe the late ... better than that play hockey though I don't know they they play hockey I've lakes rivers up\nAnd we even earlier okay where are you looking at me\nLike I don't know because ... you have a better idea than I Do so I'll go with what you would do decided [laughter]\nYou know good hey you know what mark was outside because it's so nice and I was going through a website I was a lot of photos of a lot of our nation if we enjoyed the ethical so\nWe are right now currently uh getting photos done putting them up on our website and they're both going to be an arbitrator but some of these vehicles we have these previously enjoyed trucks are nice we've got a great flux right now uh when I was in Seventeen ram Fifteen hundred limited layering limited that's one of the vehicle and that's all they got about thirty three thousand miles on it so\nThat's a nice truck to come and take a look at take a test drive in which you know the sixteen ram Laramie that's ... that's the only got about twenty three thousand miles on it\nAlso another one or the ecological brand new brand new tires on it as well I'm\nJust going down the list I've got four different\nPreviously enjoyed rams arranging anywhere from twenty thousand nine hundred dollars all the way\nUp to about thirty seven thousand dollars just depending on what you want what your price ranges but all those that I just mention how leather interior ... seats this year will\nCall the navigation so we've got a lot of trucks out here that are loaded I'd have a lot of great teachers and you know just like I said depending on your um your budget your price range\nAs close to to be gone but they're still there is a little bit out there\nA yet and I liked it there to providing clean water it is a lot of our um um countries that are continue to fight to have clean water [laughter] um would that be like in the form of trying to to provide wells rice in the last time it\nIs it simply I'm building a well I'm are taking a well but uh\nYou know in in a lot of these communities the challenges that I'm\nA lot do gooders will come in there and you know with a with a pocket full of cash and say okay we're going to do this for you\nAnd then they do it and they walk away and then the communities like uh what do we do with this right they don't know how to maintain it it doesn't fit in with the way that they do things\nAnd it ends up the money just ends up going to waste and so the real key and that stuff is um if they have local partners on the ground and doing things that the community wants to get done you know and and helping empower the local people\nAnd it was something is is really different going in and dropping in and doing a service project and walking away\nRight and it's funny watching some of these uh uh yeah I'm One of them I think of as a seven hundred club I I've watched it a number of times where they go in and they'll ah they'll they'll dig a well around the group they get the money to take a well watch these these third world countries where they get a well and it's like this is this is the best thing ever regarding able to have fresh\nClean drinking water at their fingertips and it's something we take for granted ... when they got it there was just wonderful so I can see preventing clean drinking water is as really an important thing\nWell the advantage to being an international organization is say that that our club decided we wanted to do an international project and we could find a rope most likely we could find a Rotary Club in that area where we want to do the project and partner with them to get it accomplished um and that that's that's really the difference of\nBeing on international and and and in those cases I'm guessing a of a well say cost though I don't know five thousand dollars or whatever and then then you're a local group could raise a five thousand dollars send it over there they could get the well dug in you guys would all be a part of it right\nExactly well so I'm a lot of that um work is accomplished through the rotary foundation and so it's got this foundation and the way that it works and I contribute um\nUh regularly to the foundation is just part of our our dues structure and everybody in rotary can choose to do that but the money goes into the foundation\nAnd then it sits there for three years and then it comes back to the local district or is available to the local districts in terms of grants and so then we can write a applications for matching grant money I'm from the from the rotary foundation\nBut then the uh the because it sits there for three years then all that interest from all this foundation money is going to sponsor these projects so it it's a it's a really significant\nAnd all this foundation money is going to sponsor these projects so it it's a it's a really significant structure that provides um the cash to the things\nTo these projects um you know and I guess when it comes down to um [noise] there there's a lot of international stuff going on I contribute to the to the foundation that's kinda how I personally feel like I contribute\nUm international aid to the project from what comes down to projects for my club I like to try to focus and keep it as local as possible to because we've got plenty of people in need\nRight in our backyard way we you know what I'm ... and this is just a personal thing for me I I was actually a Peace Corps volunteer for two years really um yeah I was in West Africa I was teaching in the schools there um I Know what what worldwide need look like I'm\nIn the eyes of that you know but at the same point in time\nFor me to go up and and I was in camera in West Africa and I know there's a lot of need there'll be cold up and pick up and make an impact over there is great\nBut the thing is is that there's plenty of hungry people right in our backyard there's there's plenty of people um you know we need it you know a good place to live through um there's just so much need surrounding us um that that's really where um I think it the first priority right is your backyard I'm very much so and I and I've heard\nThat with a lot too and when you hear organizations groups whether it's rotary or other group said that uh like to help out internationally it it's good to see some of those things\nGo internationally but a lot of people do come back with the fact that what what about uh are are homeless we move got plenty of homeless female home lyrical right here and people that are going hungry here kids that are going hungry as you're right we do have our own problems that we keep\nWe keep a balance of got to do we've got to do both but we can't lose sight of what we what we've got right here absolutely\nA Scott ... is the president of the Rotary Club and he's our guest this morning on our outline program ... if you have any questions or comments you certainly can call in on the show

uh for the time you know the thing is is that a lot of organizations will do fundraisers and the and the thing we haven't typically done much of of of anything to really support that other than making contributions\nAnd so one of the things that we're just trying to do this year was just tried to get the word out by getting on the radio so I even had our last pardon me more like well there's at least one thing we can\nDo is is actually talk about this a little bit\nMost people don't realize that this whole\nUm eradicate polio was actually created and and initiated by a rotary I'm originally\nAnd um and it still I'm One of the primary drivers now you've got um you know lots of organizations um the uh uh you know Bill Gates this fund is is contributing to that\nBut it was all pretty much initiated by rotary and I'm In rotor is raised over one point nine billion dollars to date to ah to eradicate polio in his down to I think three countries now two countries that are uh let's see\nOnly fourteen children have been paralyzed by the polio virus in Allah twenty Eighteen and that is huge\nSo big difference but ah so that's kind of how we do it but the but all\nSo many of our rotary members contribute to this foundation and and the foundation in turn is funding this polio eradication so just about everybody who who is wrote hear any contributed to the foundation and claim some piece of that huge huge endeavor and and very close to a huge success\nSo locally as far as when it comes to world the polio date you and your guys is group I'm a is all about getting the word\nOut yup there at this point is just a matter of trying to get a well get the word out so that people recognize what rover is all about 'em and the fact that it's that close\nAnd certainly there's lots of room to still raise a funds for doing that and so by ... you know supporting your local Rotary Club you and turn our kind of supporting this a rodeo or polio eradication effort okay I'm\nI'm what on the lake national or international seen them do does rotary do as well as it is it basically we're trying to raise the funds to continue to fight a\nWell so that means there's there's actually um I mean I and I've emailed us out to our uh our membership is well I mean there's opportunities\nOr any any one from here can pick up and go on one of these trips to India to actually\nUm apply the um the polio vaccine\nUm the so there were there was a ... and so these things come out regularly but it's it's volunteers who have to go out there and and get the vaccine to children and so like right now I think India's trying to do 'em all their children like\nIn one day or something like that so there's this huge initiative going on in India right now now India it's been polio free the only places where it's really left is along the Afghan\nPakistan border where um there's you know so much turmoil today and there's so much access to so hard and keeping track of who's going in and out is so difficult that it's really been a challenge\nBut that's just about the last place that um that polio exists in the world\nAnd if you can mix it there than in almost got a table too is that you got to stay clean for three years basically no new cases for three years then you can say okay it's gone\nUm but until that happens it's still out there and and you take your eye off the ball and it could come right back\nMentioned I think for the fourteen cases cases fourteen know dams ... fourteen well it's not that because it ... is the phone and a lot of cases will ... I was in Pakistan area or a I Believe um\nI Believe so I Know Nigeria had a little um was clean and then a couple of cases popped up in Nigeria and for now people are crossing their\nFingers that uh that it's going to be clean and I told the U.S is there any reporting cases a no no no and hasn't been ... years right any many years right I I think that's why a lot of people in us don't realize that it's still a problem with ... um you know and this is something\nThat cripples kids and then they just can't live a normal life so you know getting back to the the whole um you know I'm six purposes of of rotary it just ties into so many once the disease and the and the children and local local economies to write you can't be productive if you're if you can't walk\nAround so there's lots of reasons for ah for that being the initiative\nI I'm a Scott tricky again is our guest this morning on or off line program where to continue to talk with Scott here just a moment and again ah your calls questions comments six eight one twelve thirty and calling on the show and ask Scott or you can text us on our pizza tax line six eight one twelve thirty or you can even email market ... radio dot com we'll continue our conversation with Scott and\nI'm almost certain things\nOver to Dave burns in the newsroom good morning Dave\nLike Mark ... news today a sea for reform span is accused of kidnapping woman and repeatedly assaulting her thirty two year old Frank Kaiser made his first appearance yesterday in the ... after he was arrested Tuesday\nSteve Little stall there at the paper for ...

says damage is done she was identified without her permission as he survivor of abuse in a campaign ad for democratic senator Heidi Heitkamp\nAnd on Thursday she said she doesn't that's today doesn't know what the senator couldn't do that would make it better like these or less and now we're all just stay in her name or and\nThis lady you twenty four year old self identified liberal from Bismarck North Dakota open up about being in the ad to CNN Erica Hill a new day\nI don't know what she hike camp could do that would make it better I Know that's why a lot of people in this situation are reaching out to seek legal counsel because of you know what she did this wrong she added that she thinks it's very reckless that Heidi didn't read and improve the document before it was published so many messed up\nEarly this week I Can't put into slam her Republican opponent representative Kevin Cramer for suggesting tough people do not identify with the national conversation about sexual assault in the treatment of women ran an open letter to Kramer to show him what prairie tough looks like\nThe letter featured over a hundred and twenty names at the bottom but separate women including ... have come forward and say they were either included without their permission or not survivors of domestic violence sexual assault or rape has specified in the letter\nHigh camp issued a personal apology to the women on Tuesday [noise]\nYou know the names that didn't want to be out there are already out there for the world to see you can't really retract that the damage is done that's ... said good apology oh no no this is ... oh okay ah high cans office told CNN Thursday that they plan to reach out to ... or\nSomething ... said she would already uh she was already told before that they said they were going to reach out to her\nHow long does it take to reach out to pick up a phone on the phone call there are other previous he told CNN that she no longer plans to vote for high camp on Thursday she stuck to that position telling hill that as of right now she's definitely lost my vote\nAnd as of right now to the most recent polls Fox News\nHas Kramer up by twelve and NBC valley news has Kramer by ten wow so this could not have happened at a worse time per Heidi Heitkamp\nNow the the one side note I'll make it on that she's doing this this woman is doing all these\nYou know these national TV shows she didn't want to be in there she didn't want to be identified 'em to why she doing all these you know the press now what did you just stay away from it then and\nYou think she would hide say say her piece you didn't want to be bothered and then you know I've tried to hide from the spotlight\nYeah I and I think she's right I mean it was obviously wrong you know what had happened in the name should not have been identified you shouldn't do that I kept I\nVery hard we we talked with is just the other day how or after the vote with the Supreme Court justice so that she they really pushed hard and maybe they they\nOh with the Supreme Court justice so that she they really pushed hard and maybe they they just overlook did they just ran a real hard and kept pushing throwing that after ... together purchased one together and and maybe didn't take their time to ... everybody knows what's gonna happen\nThough is the high camp going to pay for something that a staffer yeah higher by a staffer yes to buck stops ... it does right opposite the Tom yeah you know and and she's taking responsibility for it but that's the way things work you know you have all these people\nWorking toward getting you elected young does happen that are not personally you know are you sure be held personally accountable for by the campaign I disagree with you there because she wasn't attorney general\nShe is now a sitting senator now she wants people to vote for her to be senator again\nYou again so I on the radar here if if they had reached the ... southern Mexican border or not you know a number of the people in the caravan thought they were going to stay in Mexico they weren't necessarily you had a ... for the American border but what they could do is travel in relative safety\nAnd cheaply by joining this caravan of people okay otherwise it's very expensive if you're like tried to go by yourself\nAnd travel so they have their reasoning for being in a large group well strength in numbers that but ... but I have two and a handful of them are have no more ... for their plans to get to Mexico City the rest of 'em are headed to the U.S border so yeah I'm looking at a couple\nOf stories here um the Mexican government has said that five hundred federal police are being dispatched to stop the marchers from entering Mexico and the people who enter the country illegally will be deported me well and the tweet today do as president threatened to\nCut us humanitarian aid to Honduras if the if the caravan was allowed to drive into the border wow yeah and just by the just the you know those ...\nThey can go there to talk to them any bats run and run back to point to sell in there and I heard your dog or CD in that [laughter] ...\nOn our pizza tax lined the Democrats want to open borders but you find one of them that would take refugees into their house and let me know or for their own local town\nLike again then it's a big argument but the I I thought we had a legal way for you to enter the guy had a contract to you know and that's where the change has to be made\nIf if they're going to be a legal way to enter or not you know and and not just show up at our doorstep and want to get in\nYeah well as far as I'm concerned I and I once when I was younger we lived in Phoenix we lived in ... actually lived in Scottsdale my dad worked in Phoenix um it's not too far from that border and you know and in in when you get down to Texas there is a areas where you get close to the border and of course New Mexico\nI Would feel bad for the Americans that are citizens there that here that there's four thousand people on their way to the border and it does sound a little bit scary because you know who these people are\nAnd as a federal government if a hurricane went through and say the panhandle of Florida we're there we're here to we're going to protect them if some a terrible flooding happened in the mid west where there were going to help them if there is a forest fires and can in um California were there\nBut certainly got four thousand people marching marching and getting closer and closer to the border where hundreds of thousands of Americans live\nWell of course we should be there right away send a oh this is our border these are our citizens we do because what is it because there's more thousand that they're just gonna rough and push right through it all seemed like the idea probably more on the radar of the media because of the size of the group\nThat's my guess I mean seriously if you I mean we're town of just over nine thousand now it's almost half the town the town can burn she on the border now right so if you were if somebody lived down there and you were you know you've got a home in a business and everything\nI wouldn't be nervous and suddenly you know that there's thousands of people worried about the jumped the border on diesel homeless people\nComing up from there it was that some of them are\nOver but summer are chased out because of the civil unrest and government unrest and Central America you're older legitimately trying to leave their country\nAnd then others are just I think tank you know on trying to get to America jerk you know they're making a mad rush you know they're going to bull Russia but is it we were at a point now where you can claim almost anything uh you know we have rules and brings up you\nFeel threatened in your home country Yup I you know you can get into the United states will now everybody's threatened yeah the amnesty has gone way out of proportion out ... you know\nSo I Hope we we've been soul lacks now and ... the word gets back you know that ... to ... you\nKnow we should be telling everybody lives good in Canada so they'll just walk and walk right here you know and I got up somewhere in snow fence and just keep 'em one really use the old Jefferson highway they could bring them up and went up and like a country the LDS set it up\nSo that we can have like little food\nStands as well if I asked her grandmother water as you come by what candidates do they only have\nHorses are getting some ... old ... [laughter]\nThey only have horses and ... all my [laughter] welcome to Canada [laughter] we don't have enough America is for all his mental\nTrump is a hundred and forty four year old bull so packed that boost Chinese retailers and I had no idea this thing even exist it and what is it ... you look you might have Trump you might like Trump you might uh you know a guy to you don't like the way he talks you don't like the ...\nBut to me this is one of those interesting movies where\nWhy didn't we do this long time ago\nThis he's going to withdraw from a hundred and forty four year old international pulse ordering it that enables businesses in China to mail small packages to the United states and he hit the discount an arrangement government officials said boost foreign competitors in costs the U.S postal service roughly a hundred and Seventy million dollars a year\nBecause those to exit from the universal postal union the UP you\nA comes as the White House cranks up the pressure on Beijing to drop what it calls predatory commercial practices including swiping trade secrets are American companies operating in China\nThis has been a longstanding long festering problems said Robert to the chairman of the postal Regulatory Commission and independent federal agency the administration framed the departure as separate from the trade war in which Trump\n... has a impart terrorists on roughly half of Chinese goods entering the United states wow I say go go for especially a how much of a hundred and sixty million a hundred and sixty million or a hundred and Seventy million dollars a year out costing U.S Postal service yeah which is not in good shape the way it is not at all\nU.S Postal service can use any helping yeah stamps are going up again at the end of the you know there are now we are and\nWho else has stamped anyway I use ... her I buy a book because there's a machine and our office said if you run it through there and they put something on there and then you can send somebody\nAnd they were going to say that I Know how to know it doesn't\nAsk for any money to shows\nUp without permission of [laughter] rather than a personal stuff at home I get free at anything like what are you sending in where you know\nWe have we have um and we battle this for a long time here in rural Minnesota North western Minnesota we can post offices they're cutting back on days of operation days of delivery in the rural routes of all because\nThe post offices bleeding money Joe you know and and if you're taking a hundred and Seventy million dollars out of the coffers of just you know ...\nThere was a hundred and Seventy million is is the U.S postal service paying that no that's the ... the ... because the fact that they're getting this this huge discount on smaller packages\nThat money that says that this will force them to pay higher polio which would increase what they're getting because again the post office still has to pay that guy to deliver it or the woman to you know put it together whatever the all the different charges coming in the ... the airplanes and all that they have to pay it regardless of bad mail packages on there or not but\nUh so apparently a hundred and forty four years ago\nNobody knew that this was a good idea a president that\nProbably was a you're a you're going back to the late Eighteen hundreds or the railroads a large influx of Chinese laborers would come to the country it probably wasn't the ideal at that point to try to move the water's between\nThe United states and China at a time when our country was just about ready to explode yeah no it's all probably served as well at that point\nYeah but at some point yeah it should have been reading ... nobody ever really looked at it again you\nKnow those things are hidden away and so I ask you\nIs this not what a business man type of president does absolutely looking for every ... every possible and I'm sure that's what he was telling his people around the table going All right let's look at the numbers both let's find out where we can justify making cuts in and pulling out a different agreement and forced Beijing back to the table to\nTo come back with a deal that award for everybody like candidate like Mexico with dad but instead we spent all of our time on whether a judge Thirty years ago\nSomething wrong and we spend weeks on that when this is the real business of the government is what they should be doing I tell them to be creative and cutting costs instead of being creative and spending money yeah he's a businessman them yeah it because he also knows that if he's going to have any chance of being re elected\nHe has to show real progress just like any type of business person any chance of being successful you have to show progress otherwise are he has the jobs and the employees and they can't battle him on that you know as much as they want they ... they say he's a racist or because he doesn't want to illegal immigrants into the country\nAlthough he's trying to keep them out of the country so that you know more Americans are are getting these jobs and they're not paying underneath the table and you know people are forced to have to hire people and that's what he's trying to get but also some of the other things you know the uh\nThe fair trade with other countries yes there are certain businesses in America like for you know who have plants in other countries who are making automobiles and then trying to import 'em back\nThey're not doing us any good when they're saving all that money unemployed they're saving all that money that should be spent here in America so and they have these uh oh well was us well was us because you know we can't sell as many of these imports anymore and then start making them there bring them back to Americans are making them here in the NFL teams\n... at night and I just got a number one goal of victory by just outside of San Francisco of art and I thought of and thanks\nUh uh uh Eddie Murphy yeah wasn't that it um no I don't doubt that wasn't it was the one who was with a a a prior Richard\nPry ass or somebody ... million ... million will yeah he had like Seventy two hours ago and this money is like here I have had anything to be only buying shoes and everything is all my all my\nDrive me across the street here's a million dollars that would be tough I mean the fact that'd be cool reality show you know ... million dollars you get twenty four hours to spend it okay\nAnd you can't find any large too I think that was there was there was some stipulations you can't just give it all the charity or something you could give so much a percentage or something like that one night after the largest jak on mega millions history role to friday Powerball three hundred and Seventy eight million survived the next dry and you know that there's people out there that are like\nThank God because if I knew when I don't want anybody else doing it on other shot at it that's what I always think when I wake up and look at my ticket\nNo together since the and the numbers have changed together these two could be one point four billion dollars and welcome Friday Saturday so over the weekend if you're really lucky and you spend four dollars\nYou could win a vote in your show up for work on Monday yeah because it's going to take a couple of weeks of planning and we have then I'll well yeah that and that's why I'm buying tickets in North Dakota\nSo after the show I got to drive the Grand Forks again and buy some more tickets\nOtherwise you know if they're really worth it we as we always talked about this if you want and you came back and did some stupid and you had liability all of a sudden for having done it and then you have all this money yeah what would happen then well if you're smart you'd ... you'd have a bunch of different shell companies\nAnd a lot of different ... and limited liability here and there and they're and they're and they're in and then you put money in different places so that they can only two for one deal but I mean don't why would you come back to work that I mean you know what I'm saying I mean what if something happened at work that you're liable for\nYeah 'cause in radio there's a lot of it all wrong this maybe\nThis is the conversation sharply gender came from somewhere else but I yeah I just I don't know I understand what you're saying too because again let's just say Bobby won a billion dollars yeah all of a sad or as a hobby won a billion dollars why we're and Bobby winds at because Bobby's lucky when he's behind\nFantasy folds Motorola ads true let's just say I'm Bobby ... to have at our Web so he goes out\nThere and he throws his two dollars into the lottery and he comes back with a billion well he's got a good week or so to get the uh you know the CPA and the attorneys and everybody put together to come up with the plan how they're going to distribute the money so that\nIt's you know he he has a way to you know take the check and not just go to bang go like to catch this how does the million yeah now he comes back to work and in suddenly somebody finds out that\nHe's on the onus every day that's not like\nWhite on making coffee for everyone is yes\nYes and he's wearing clean clothes [laughter]\nYou might there might be something going on and he spent an extra divers here he's normally has a ... a ... so two days into it somebody finds out he's got the Powerball and we just happen to have a new Internet working here\nAnd she wants to come up with the reason why she wants to get paid now that could happen now I'm ... now you're going to say I could easily happen because we can see what happened to a a a judge\nWho's going to be put on the Supreme Court it was Thirty years ago they had no actual evidence but he went through about three or four weeks of of just war trying to save the job of becoming a Supreme Court justice\nBobby he might just happen to be doing this morning show and and working and and then in turn says oh no you know I was in the production room and he did this boa ... he's you know having to figure out a way to pay this\nI Know what I'd gladly under his car tires I'd be like okay go ahead I'm Sorry I'm ready to go every time he's both walk or all the antibiotic cargo and I don't know if you're good enough [laughter]\nThat's again that's going to be there's two different things that go wrong when people win this size of money\nOne um they either lose it you know because they there there are so many

should that he would have in that half he was ten for ... through the air in the first out for the pioneers\n\nFor seven let's see forty seven fifty to fifty eight yards on the first half\nHour but then also you add in sixty eight yard pass actually as well and that would actually put them up to eleven for twelve\nIn that first how deep gold correct wells so he would have\nA grand total of one hundred twenty six yards passing in that first taps accounting is other pass as well that went for sixty eight yards to the house for his receiver colonial grants for granted a nice verse tap on the receiving end of the pioneers well he would lead all receivers for North one in that first half\nParents are grant would have\nThe three catches four eighty arts in that first tapped for the north and

the tank the accusation you know handle the touch means fewer germs to pick up or leave behind the leaf overheating revolves around\nThe\nCasket in a way is wrong Cato was kicked this one high in near St Julian goes back to receive it but it bounces in the end zone for the touch back so be pioneers will start to their opening possession of the second half [noise]\n\n'cause they'll start to be twenty yard last [noise] or twenty five excuse me that's the college and professional rules so used to doing high school football here but she just uh forget that some of the rules are different in terms of ball spotting in terms of\nA touch back some scenarios such as and so the pioneers will take over from their own twenty five\nFollowing any touch back and now coming in at running back once again is to real Yuri\nBecause the pioneers have rotated running backs old game law\n\nFirst down intent quarterback wells any pistol set with Uri behind\nAnd a bad snapped don't well if he's got to go back for it and he's taken down at the five yard line [noise] boy the momentum has really swarmed in favor of vi task uh\nAnd uh now they'll spot of actually at the age yard line [noise] [noise]\nSo that is a loss of Seventeen yards for wells\nOn an unofficial run as they would call it just on a form of recovery\nSo that's unfortunate second down and seven twenty seven for the pioneers wells look in the past in the end zone rolls up to the right past is thrown away out of bounds intended for Yuri that brings up third down and twenty seven for North where\n[noise] why the pioneers in deep trouble here early in the third quarter\n\nAnd obviously if you're a coach Cox the safe route here would be just to run up the middle or some sort of run just to get some extra breathing room for this most likely in suing point or you'd take the risk and try a deep on here\nFor two different scenarios see what the pioneers come up with here with third down and twenty seven looming from their own yard line needy be thirty five\n[noise] and well steps back to past looks down feel pressured throws in the past incomplete near the left side line intended for Yuri\n... bring up for it down and the twenty seven for the pioneers legal three out\n\nHere to start this second half [noise]\nAnd so now they'll bring on rock we send me a to point to he has had a phenomenal bay punting the football now he goes against the wind with this one so we'll see how he does\nThat deep is done for the Vikings standing at the pioneer forty and a flight comes in serious gets away an

that's usually in the vicinity of ... are running into the kicker as we'll check on the penalties here\n'cause the boss right now spotted up to twenty five so against ... uh Rockaway semi as didn't have much room to either get rid of or get away a punt on that one is well\nPioneers indicating both of 'em are against the Vikings\nSo again we will check\nAs soon as we get an official call here pioneers might have the football here\n\nTop side or no they they call opposite side of the pioneers\n\n[noise]\nMan for ... for\nLooks like it will just be a retrial veer off setting penalties Sylvie pioneers we're off the side and their alignment\n\nAnd what it was a personal fall penalty against the Vikings so again it was it will be just offsetting penalties but five yards for the pioneers\nApparently because it'll be for down and long stupid the pioneers is still up hunting situation and our movement again the task of Vikings get the pioneers to job they'll just take those five yards back they say\nIs the Viking defense of wind you were a little bit of switching there and the pioneers flinched and went for it so that'll be false start on the pioneers\n\nFinale seven penalties in the game [noise] on north what [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo now again we will\n\nRedo it again as a rock we sent me as punch this one high in the air and the ball nearly hits a member of the Vikings\nAs they were all firing away and the pioneers well down it\nInside the twenty eight yard line the Vikings in business down by six a score times they've had an extra point gives them the
