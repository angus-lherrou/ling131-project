next couple of days things uh [noise] and it's seen here as we will go back and ... it might get a chance to talk with Mr\n... and uh\nAs we do get hooked up with Mark Mark in volleyball matched tonight tonight you were in New full moon as in northern freeze shut out of Warren over into was well uh\nUh this one was pretty quick your marriage lasted maybe an hour or the northern brings juice and too much for a more than ... tonight\nOh they did a land and ah [noise] ah the\nThe last time these two teams that they met twice during the regular season\nAnd both times northern freeze wanted they wanted three games tonight I I think it was both both contests won three non uh three ... three to zero and there are two batches earlier this year ... they came and knowing that they could win the police came and knowing that they could play with them and they did that again that I played\nWith them but they they just didn't find a way to beat them and they just couldn't barely get over the hump that passing as a big thing and you watch 'em in volleyball if you have good pastors you have a team that's pretty successful or if they moved the ball wealthy past while they\nThey get some good SATs they can do that they\nAh they give themselves opportunities to be in a game or team it's a little wild or are they struggle\nA lotta times or just because they're not getting that at the national Pasadena her get a good sets\nInside pony struggled with passing a at times the freeze struggled with passing tonight as well but in the end they they had more stats that better stats they had that better passes that more kills tonight better serves hot and in the ad all the numbers to favor the reason they did win this one three games\nTo not uh\nI think got wherever came out of tonight's game knew that they uh\nThey had the toughest road ahead because the winner here which is northern phrase they'll have to go down to eight on Thursday night and and they are uh are the best team in the section there's no doubt about it\nThey have only one loss on the season I think it was the pine river back is\nStill there an extremely good volleyball team in and dead freeze now they've got to go out and they had nothing to lose their the underdog they're not expected to win and they will cause ate it is just that I had kept see our guy goes down there or or or the or the gators or or a Sacred Heart I mean anybody does that\nThey would be the underdog because ... is just that guy but tonight the phrase had enough a lead to to pick up the win again good plant the nets by Keely doll by Ashley Olsen that that that they are sent them good steps than I\nAm ... percent at ... Sorenson coming in after a city out of much of that for that so um\nIf you're the lower seed you got to do all the fundamentals while you got to block you got to keep your quarterback times you gotta get open up the whole where you're running back\nAnd if that simply you got to shut down kitchen county central they could do a number of things that could hurt you but\nYou know get get gotta be able to bring your best game you're a game whether she should have no factor looks like it's going to be a nice weather wise\nNew minutes we're supposed to say well we're a temperatures over here in the forties at least we're Graham sunshine we wanted to play in the rain and all around and everything's you'll be all dried up so it shouldn't be ... good night for a playoff football\nYeah just to bring a you know what to bring up long Johns bring out the card stay warm when you're watching the game on the sidelines and day it'll be just that much more enjoyable you're right it sounds like a clear skies are not so much when that just a little cooler temperatures but for this time of year it's football weather\nAnd exactly and the you know if you're if you're from Minnesota your nose and once you get into the playoffs for football but uh it's supposed to be cool though\nAnd men young men with her own show edited\nDocumenting surprise anybody and you know look at the forecast and we might down some rain by Saturday which wouldn't be the second round of these games put to tomorrow night's everybody should have some really nice weather some good for you to\nA conditions and I think we're told him so I mean we've got a lot going for his which we did not happen for a lot of the season\nThat should be a decent job conditions are no slippery fields all I Know excuses you know it really is you could go down to a few things your chart overs or the team that turns it over or may not play again with the team doesn't take care of the football you know take advantage of opportunities\nOut there and I've got a good ridge Britain was\nClear ... game I don't know much about ... I Know a good ridge Britain will be the um pretty much work around their quarterback you so much to ... kind of one of those unknowns that you really don't think of a lot of\nGood coaching over there and and typically a coach garlic hasn't playing well towards the end of the season\nAnd uh there's a team that again could sneak up on some somebody go to Greg ... is a team that's got size lotta size on the line size yes yeah and well what you started the charges you you're not going to early in the season you know I don't remember which game you had to who they played at the time but\nThe point the northern freezer believe\nFor the phrase okay All right well whoever it was a\nLong slow\nOkay and you're right they get a big line a judge is doing to get you know take advantage of that day key so and and uh um [noise] oh I can send in the backfield\nAnd they kept on some drawing a blank on the third or the other back a\n... yeah I'm drawing a blank on the other track\nBut I Know there's a uh they they do have a couple of ... besides key so that they can give it to\nAnd Brian Brian's Lincoln was kind of you know what could happen but if the state highschool\nWebsite and you look on their roster Lee you'd see the name and then you could tell me and then I walked right you know [laughter]\nYeah well I remember hearing about he changes up here let's see when we got to rule\nOut is it about ... about that you're talking about\nKen and that's what it is yeah yeah yeah ... and then of course the so the quarterback in in demos the jets and the other one yeah they've got ... and then they they don't pass the ball a lot but when they do a show said the other one receiver uh he's got some good hands so they can do a few things they don't they don't go there a lot but when they do they can be effective\nWhat made him so effective is yours what you're talking about is the uh often and serve in defense of lines of those guys in the\nMiddle there are those are some big kids they have some guys that actually could boys from college football\nYou get to a line that control the game you know push a get they get the forward motion to get the foreign phobic get there two three yards every crack you you've got a line that can really control a ball game not and and again when they open up the holes\nUm you know and if they get out but I saw Jensen break for how many big runs a for about is the workforce and of course key so you never know why he's just he's one of those at the when they run the option\nHe can talk on the run me getting the may pick up some big yard so there are dangerous team but again Joel Joel with look past ... got a big because that is one of those teams that can can sneak up on you to so chargers play their game I think they can pick up a wet\nOkay well give me one final learned again a vulnerable action or you have the vote moments between the northern\nFreeze and weren't over in ... northern freeze winning that free nothing or any kind of conclusion you come up with genetic\nWell I'm looking at him where he is a the coach for the war's over the last all parties tonight or knew that she needed to come with a really good game she felt good company get\nAn a and I think a good point on the fact of the first game had they won their first game could have been different but uh again coming up towards that certainly heard now for the ponies Jessica Olson is a senior faith quarter is a senior Sarah ... is a senior ... the senior encountered tell them is a senior so\nThose are the seniors with opponents who just play the last game tonight they will bring back some players do rather more number one of their better player she is a junior highly Hansen justice sophomore and she played granted the net that\nThey've got some good things emerged Shelby Duran will be back next year as well I'm old bird both um ... burger underclass that there'll be back in the ... rollers that Jane yourself they're bringing a lot of the above their classrooms back to build around and\nThey've got to be able to put some time and the off season if they want to get better for the phrase again a when you move on so they live to play another day\nOr a very good ... drive home safely probably home by now but you know sitting in the driveway I was going to say you probably had been here about ten miles away from home when you want to so [laughter] yeah yeah\nI Love doing games in the new full than if it's the closest to drive home so [laughter]\nThat's true All right well you have a good night and we'll talk to an immoral\nOr

we're going to switch gears we're going to go back over to regret\nWhen is between Goodridge regular right now and ... when like you said we won't lose you because there is a little bit of a dense spot out there but are you at a match that I'm barely lasted over an hour as well\nYou know it was interesting that\nBecause there were lots of question marks for both the good restrict beat threatened the boss white during the regular season [noise] so it was that put a beat him three times type thing or what but they all play I think I had seen them playing and rise up and down when the match\nOn top of that good rhetorical was playing without one of their top leaders ... you know you can download ankle injury you get drafted night but they didn't use or they're open that are available on Thursday nights so we'll be step up and take that for that or to the op ed\nFor the chargers and the perfect didn't get it was wild that went back and forth they would never more than three either way the old time\nRed lake surface percent twenty or twenty three did not on that point on the inside out at what the chargers the chargers stepped up and served up next to including effect when it's like the money for and it's very entertaining match that long rallies long point\nBut then this is not is cut and dried isn't it hasn't been some years\nNo great he didn't go up and those are the those are the top but I think I'm right now if the if say a leg up on everybody in the sex in my opinion\nOf course would go back to the section eight nine man and everybody knows it's

chance to be any of the time in in during the year but at least by its Poors\nCan buy record it appears that that accurate\nAnd that even our colleagues Debbie favorite I add ... if you don't you don't need a big problem with the rug out\nIt's just too many different weapons too many ways having having said that the chargers inveterate require great big and very physical up front and they've got great speed especially in the water back because I ... and it's got to be central playing very well\nBut I got executive playing very well right now they should be in the unknown here you're not\nExactly one section in all year\nNobody really knows where they are they the number one number and find that out going over here and they play a\nStorm you said that a little scary because they have so many weapons and that's you know\nOften simply defensively you even look at the scores and you'll look everybody boils playing against wherever a defensively they're just as there [noise] yeah they don't\nGet a lot at stake I think I look at them\nBut there are very similar to the long run they added back ... where it will make a mistake you're going to make you point that mean journal over a battle the wrong time to yourself short on giving them\nThe way\nThat you played all year with a little orange or what have you know they get rid of all down\nMarket I talked about the good or is going to a game and Claire ... if I'm correct Claire ... didn't they lose their starting quarterback right in the first game of the season I heard that\nYeah that's right yeah 'cause I heard that they had a really good quarterback you know to start the season when they said that they are pretty much went around him\nHe was lost from the sings in the first game that's used to talk about some of the

giants tend to sex as we go to the fourth quarter of a barn burner in Atlanta and a couple of fifty are plus a reception that I Want for shepherd one for a while back and junior I mean that's a riot six points\nWonderful how on the plus side the giants have only a given up ten you have two fifty yard passes yeah he lie is to sixty five through the air\nHaving an okay game sixty now that you've already thrown around like a rag doll but I'm six points six points when they go on ... twenty six which shows you you can have talented running back and wide receiver you can have all of this\nBut you can still stink and this is what's going on where the giants right matter offensive\nLine is atrocious you spend a lot of money are hoping to eat one more big year\nOut of date so older he's off off all he's what what is the Twenty one against the cap or twenty two I mean you're you're talking about it a good chunk of your cash on a guy who's a shell of his former self and surrounded by\nPedestrian line then what's called what it is and and you will get Eli Manning diminished go or not he's running for his life like yes they did to design bootleg ... now I'm running with purpose on my own as opposed to running in fear\nOf what he's been under dress and only four sacks I'd be curious to see what the hit counties at this point [noise]\nReally this is a giants team that is absolutely a mess and you can keep saying yeah but these guys soda and oh that was so good and I'd say quote about yeah okay they're also good their teams still stinks scope for their team absolutely still stinks and this is why when you pay out back in Ninety million dollars\nAnd you decide not to draft a quarterback address acorn Barclay number two overall your team can still think\nYou have to ... you have to choose who you pay and who you draft more wisely ... that's what you have to do this with the giants have done and now they're losing and they're getting killed again I'm fifty yard field goal geo ... there you go is more of a writer fifty yards away\nSo now Lana who thinks is leading the giants Thirteen six as we the giants get the ball for the first time in the fourth quarter who\nAre Joan still scoreless uh for twenty Eighteen so we were in that and they're they're putting up the one on one battle back um versus Leo Jones in their yard and showed all\nThat matters who's who's tried out nobody ... I don't know you you're both your teams are under performing obviously the falcons had their\nInjury defensively that if if I told them\nWhen you look at the giants can I if there was one night for the giants off inch to open up you get as an interim back he's a ghost invisible he ran a terrible route on a second downplay I thought he was going to jump on top and start beating [laughter]\nI thought he was going to go WWE autumn I I don't think I've ever seen a you lie that demonstrative in his disappointment with one ... one of his receivers good uh and you've you've had a couple of big players but not able to cash in\nDubious call on fourth in one earlier then you take the field goal the next time you're in the red zone so some curiosity or as that goes but\nIn the end ah your plane fry drastic and and for bad show at you or are you going to be angry with the media again\nAnd wait till your later it hey you really think should address the quarterback huh does things you're taking a cornerback in number to Pat Pat\nPat Pat how about a quarter back pat a soldier and we'll keep you updated here we are minutes away from the Lakers and the spurs yeah buddy big changes in lake or land after the suspensions were handed down following the big brawl again she used to it on Saturday raised\nOn Ron do get three games branded Ingram gets four games Chris Paul gets two games after Chris Paul was spit on not really spit on but kind of spin add in less than a ferry is way he puts his finger in the face of rage on Ronda Ronda throws a left hook\nChaos ensues brand anger throwing punches from behind this was after Brennan grim almost punch the raft 'cause he ... he was gonna body slammed the ... got thrown out yeah they throw up your throat the lead singer of the red hot chili peppers that you know what I'm kind of donnybrook\nYeah they said yeah you're giving us gave away you're giving it away you know what you're doing it now [laughter] I mean you know what do you know\nWhat Ron Paul Chris Paul are saying hey hey hey hey get hurt we got a banana boat in the off season\nBut this is more on getting criticized for that I Know I Know and you know or do here's another thing this happens in all of a sudden it's all like and now the Lakers I have to make moves obviously long ago ball will slide into play point guard and ... will\nCome in and play for brand and Ingram but obviously as it is it's always about LeBron James and the Lakers and I am actually\nFine with the fight I'm fine with the results I'm fine with everything and there's a reason why sometimes\nTeams need the play together for a good twelve Fifteen games before they start turning it on as as I've said the Lakers will struggle the first twelve or Fifteen games then they'll start winning games as they start playing together more\nBut what's what's Chris Paul folks do know Chris Paul started the whole thing nothing happened physically so Chris Paul put his finger and everybody

you're inside the entertainment of that the I mean these people in Montana last week we're\nWaiting hours out there in freezing temperatures not just you know I I don't know who I Would wait for for

going to tell you who number four was and I think she's been out it Ellen DeGeneres was number for it and I may shock\nYou think of Alan nice enough woman it seems to me the dancing and all that well here's an example though you know she brings on Democrat politicians right before the midterms right before the presidential race just gives them an incredible forum everybody's so nice there is no challenge and it's like an infomercial for them that's what it's about\nWell the executive producer do you know the executive producer is that the top producer out a multitude of producers of the

not\nOr in some ways but here's the problem down right now we have whole generations of people that have been under educated or indoctrinated in colleges and the like and to them socialism is not human misery socialism seems like a new idea and kind of cool to them as strange as it is\nYeah but I think something like that myself\nNo but that's a big difference of course we couldn't we've seen this we've lived through various things are these millennials and the like today I'm done it they just see that they're going to get something out of what is a tough time for them thank you and it is for some millennials student loan debt Everytime I see this Cory Booker is out there tonight you know the Spartacus guy the guy in South Jersey\nCory Booker is calling for fifty thousand dollars be given\nTo children in various families of under income that's his big ploy running for president\nJust give them fifty thousand dollars that's a way to make things more equitable fifty grand by that a hundred grand I don't know the fifties enough\nAnd I I've seen Democrat after Democrat\nGoing after student loan debt well here's the thing who's charging while there's the people that run colleges are progressive or Democrats making a lot of money why are they charging it well every time they raise the rates people start to scream how much it costs to go to college so what do they do\nThey have to get more student loans and more money from the government is so then what do they do they raise the cost who's responsible\nFor how costly it is to go to college it's the people running colleges making that decision these figures are not figures that are reasonable or keeping up with inflation or anything else they're made up vigorous they're charging but everything got away with and it's outrageous\nAnd I think you're starting to see a little bit of a pullback here\nBut it's progressive that are running it All right so who is the most polarizing figure celebrity figure out their

see that\nThey have a a just a motorcycle statue made the bike like he rode\nAnd then they have a black big blackout talking about it and that and they gave Steve McQueen the credit for the job but Steve didn't actually do the job but it was but he thinks that did it but I mean it's pretty cool because when you go to a wide area and that there's a museum and they still have all the shoes of the\nPrisoners that were killed there and died there and that and then they also have a tour that you can go through there and then there's also down a little bit is or where actual our biggest star lacks Thirteen I Can't read it you know I have to use my phone translator to figure it out but I think that's the name of it and they have to sign up there that\nYou know cause it's the great escape so\nThat movie was actually real and this is where it happened\nA ... or ... yeah ... is ... interesting little town remarkable in modern times of the site of one of the most celebrated prison break out Sanford the great escape I'm just reading up on uh now\nI'm all although it's not the easiest place to reach by public transport from either of these cities it's easily accessible by road and has a number of other points of interest in addition to its star attraction the remains of ... three or is it is Lou threes that their team\nOr something like that okay now I now the home of the prisoner of war camp museum so they yeah they have a museum on their uh and then they have what ... what it looks like to me is is the\nIt's almost like a sidewalk that goes along where they show where the tunnel was yep running and they didn't like nearly nine meters below the ground and they escape you successfully completed to escape through\nYeah yep yep so hot\nThat would be interesting now is that I don't I don't know any more about this but they do you know if they uh maybe if you go to that place can you go can you see underground meaning that underground part still open or do they just have like\nI from what I heard it is but the one I'm taking my art are that's going to be wintertime here I mean it's already started in wintertime here now so I don't know if it's going to be covered with snow and be able to get air either in there and not [noise] but I'll find out\nOkay so that's that's where you plan to ... you know you you called your aren't are you a little vacation then\nOh yeah

that takes up to two to four days of your ten ten days or sixteen days our every many days you'd take you know so\nIf you're ten ten days or sixteen days how ever many days you take you know so I Would rather just stay here I'm staying here local and that just go on to the towns 'cause I can go to buy one I can drive to Prague Germany or\nPoll in wherever it is I forget but I'm I'm already been in a burn land then and then I go to war claw Paul and then that I could run make airport where I'm from that and\nThe thing that's really kind of bizarre hears the freeway the speed ...

hour\n[laughter] [laughter] yeah really [laughter]\nYeah I mean the Audubon oh wow\nI don't know if they call it an Audubon it's only two lanes wide on each side and that but I mean I'll be doing one

cameras are going to the side and slow [laughter]\nHopefully not get let's get this ... this it'll come out of your pay later [laughter] well now you got to pay at yourself in a court case but like I say the money\nHere is just unbelievably cheap for everything\nYou know like I say that you should have cost probably like eight hundred bucks to get fixed and it was only thirty seven dollars and then when I go back Monday I'll find out how much it will be for the permanent failing that was an actual point but\nBecause I went to one Dennis right next door hotel 'cause we get they tell you you

end of the block you know so I could walk there\nAnd go okay what what type of the city is it a rich city a port city um you know culture there while they don't they\nThey don't make much money here and they don't get paid very well and now it's not that rich I mean there's one ... one of the bases would I go to you pass those houses just been bill natural rarely alter beautiful in that but that's because he's a gynecologist and she is I think the dentist lady\nOh so they have but typically housing is an old the old houses yeah houses and small and\nA apartment buildings and that that are stacked on top of one another and like our hotel actually used to be a mental hospital [noise]\nI don't know if I'd like to stay in place like that [laughter]\nThat's a bad thing too is that the guy that owns that his he has Triplett daughters and their famous um violinist oh\nNow you can find them on YouTube and stuff like that I forget the name of stuff and that I I guess if you talk a type

Tuesday or either the paranormal or legal questions six eight one twelve thirty we have a caller coming in and let's go to the phones good morning you're an open mind legal to the go ahead\nHi yeah I got a question okay\nIn all ridden a sharp object more for my state law\nOr I\nRead the fine structure and paper wires are never ... are they being published in up state or is that you just wanna rock falls all watch going on locally\nCouldn't tell you I don't know if that's something for the maybe something maybe for the paper I don't know the answer the question because\nCanadians do get fined do free tickets to them so [noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo yeah so it happens so they're not happy as I anything so I don't know I don't know that I guess if it's if it's something published in the paper you'd have to ask the paper that\nI\nOwe case not unless blossom thanks for the call I have a question here are coming in on our pizza text line six eight one twelve thirty good question that says question for officer Basset\nOur drivers are required to slow or stop for pedestrians who clearly intend to cross but have not entered a crosswalk my university wrote tickets for not doing so which seemed a good idea\nI I Would say when someone is about to enter crosswalk you are to stop them I mean if someone's walking up to it in theory you're not you don't you're not required but if someone is about to enter or is entering you you are to stop and that and\nThat brings up a good point I was actually just posted something on our Facebook page about to cross walks in town okay um one is that's Bruce in a first street ... north of Franklin middle school\nBrand new they light up kids are going to be hitting that productions are going to be the NEA cross button and then will light up when that lights up here to you but as soon as they are about to enter their slow down and yield to pedestrians so and then the other one is I'd Greenwood and spruce south of Franklin that one lights up to\nTheir new they're very well it in there now you're you know very very very noticeable okay and it's because there's a lot of people across and that area I'm In north bound and coming back and forth from Franklin so you know that we got numerous complaints yesterday about people not stopping\nOkay and you mean for these kids who says okay so what is the sign of the flashing doing it just you know notifying hey there's some of them already to cross here they're they're here and they're pushing the button stop but what's flashing as it is just to like Eliot ... okay so it's just lights and not it didn't say anything then\nIt actually does say that says something that pedestrians about to cross or pedestrians ... sign that says that I don't know what actually signed it actually says it to audibly\n... I think of that kind of lets people crossing that things have been activated yup yup\nSo okay and this one the one by Franklin when south frankly north and south of Franklin spruce and first day in Greenwood ... Greenwood and spruce okay so it's on ... you know it was the one who goes by your your uh salary and you know in front of Franklin yup yup\nAll right um so watch for those and when you see 'em they're flashing than we stopped just just stop I even if someone's not in the crosswalk or a ball to enter just stop your car\nYou know you know we do a lot of walking and you know the problem is when you come up to the crosswalk is you're going to cross you see a car coming well you might hesitate because\nYou don't know they're going to stop if you if you got hit you you're going to lose so I mean that there's been many times where we started to go and we stopped in the car has gone by\nAnd I'm sure as soon as me I'm sure they're thinking well they didn't want to come across but I'm not going to challenge you and go out there and force you to stop because if you do I'm going to get killed so if you see me there or anybody there yeah and absolutely can go can I ask what the record\nI think there are kids that are just not going to be you know assuming may maybe kids may assume that they that they may people will stop\nOkay or have their heads down in their phones are not paying attention was All right you know folks I I'd rather have the drivers be very defensive and looking\nIf you're not paying attention you need to see this society if you don't know where it is going first street towards holiday over and that's general direction see it and make sure you know what's there and pay attention for it um when the lights up or if you see someone approaching maybe they won't even hit that button but\nJust stop I mean it's love requires yep so\nBe safe to say All right we have Jeff on the line to the question I'm an open mind morning Jeff\nMartin or you know part of a mutt it a a a waiter at a ... a month on the road from you know on a on a while\nI'd be contact the street department for that day I don't have the answer to that\nAll worked out or on the line\nIs there a lot of mud that say I guess I was kind of it's dried stuff I I actually wondering about that myself the other day yeah they're they're doing some work over there in the ... they are out of al ... the city a call in and let them know\nOr oh\nOkay yeah maybe they did I don't know and and they may have somebody listening today so All right ... thanks for the call and I have an art show again

about it and were curious about the question about it or concerned about it I get a hold of the uh the city on our on our sensation down I Would think they need to because of right on the roadways are supposed to well I think isn't that farmers are in charge if they get mud on the roads isn't that the farmer themselves that are in charge of getting it on\nYes that's what I was thinking I mean I'm not a hundred percent sure that all by the way I to question the other day just you gotta know somebody asked if uh you can it's legal to keep receiver Hedges and\nAnd I and I and and they said they've heard that it is illegal and I and so I Know all the way it is not illegal to have you receive or you know half of your head and it's not unless it's obstruction your plate there is there any way it's gonna be a problem and I we didn't have the first\nCaller a call back and then eventually they disconnected here so I Do have another one dull on an email or on a text message or a pizza tax

now I mean is the greatest thing of cognitive dissonance you will ever see is the fact that I Am in really good shape in fact I'm In better shape than most of you All right so what we're not talking about today we're not talking about cancer\nBecause I spend a lot of time talking about that [laughter] I'm really not interested if you have any herbal supplements or remedies please stay away from me\nAnd we're not going to talk about things that are\nEven more important than achieving your childhood dreams but like I talk about my wife and I told my kids because I'm good but I'm not good enough to talk about that without tearing up so we're just going to take that off the table that's much more important\nAnd we're not going to talk about spirituality and religion [laughter] um so what does today's talk about that it's about my childhood dreams and have achieved them I've been very fortunate that way how\nI Believe I've been able to enable the dreams I've been able to enable the dreams of others and to some degree lessons learned I'm a professor there should be some lessons learned and how you can use the stuff you here today to achieve your dreams or unable to dreams of others and as you get older you may find that enabling the dreams of others\nThing is even more fun and that's something we should not lose sight of is that the inspiration and the permissions dream is huge\nSo what were my childhood dreams you may not agree with this list but I was there a [noise]\nBeing a zero gravity playing in the national football league an author and art world book encyclopedia I guess you can tell the nerds early and I wanted to be an imagine here with us and uh it turns out that NASA\nA something called the vomit comet so they used to train the astronauts and this thing does\nParabolic Arkes at the top of each argument about twenty five seconds where you ballistic and you get about ... you know rough equivalent of weightlessness for about\nTwenty five seconds and there is a program where college students can submit proposals and if they win the competition they get to fly\nAnd I thought that was really cool and we had a team to team together and they want and they got to fly and I was all excited 'cause I was going to go with them\nAnd then I spent the first brick wall because they made it very clear that under no circumstances where faculty members allowed to fly with the teams [noise]\nI Know I was heartbroken right but I work so hard [laughter] and so I read the literature very carefully turns out that NASA\nIt's part of the outrage and publicity program and it turns out that the students were allowed to bring the local media journalists from their home town [noise]\nAnd ah [noise]\nRandy Weber journalist is really easy to get a press pass so guys on Nassau and I said I'm I Need to know where to fact some documents and they said what documents are gonna facts as I said my resignation as the faculty adviser and my application as the journalist [noise]\nAnd he said that the little transparent don't you think [noise]\nAnd I said yeah but our project this virtual reality and\nWe're going to bring down a whole bunch of the our headsets and all the students from all the teams are going to experience at an all those other real journalists are going to get to film it childhood dream number one check\n[laughter] sorry let's talk about football my dream was to play and the national football league and must have you don't know that I actually put no [noise]\nNo I did not make it to the national football\nLeague but I probably got more from that dream and not accomplishing\nIt then I got from any of the ones that I did accomplish [noise] um\nI I had a coach I signed up when I was nine years old I was ... the smallest kid in the league by far and I coach Jim Graham who was six foot four he played linebacker at Penn State he was just this whole ... of a guy and he was old school okay I mean really old school like he thought the forward pass was a trick play\n[laughter] and he showed up for practice\nThe first day and you know there's this big hulking guy we were all scared to death of him and he hadn't brought me football's how how\nWithout any football and one of the other kids she has me coach but there's no football\nAnd coach Graham said right how many men are on a football field a time where it's at eleven on a team twenty to\nEncourage Graham said All right and how many people are touching the football at any given time\nAnd he said right so we're going to work on what those other Twenty one guys are doing [laughter] and that's a really good story because it's all about fundamentals fundamentals fundamentals fundamental she's got to get the fundamentals down because otherwise the fancy stuff isn't going to work\nAnd the other Jim Graham story I have is there was one practice where he just wrote me all practice just you're doing this wrong you're doing this wrong go back and do it again you owe me you're doing pushups after practice and when it was all over one of the other assistant coaches came over and said yeah coach reemerge a pretty harsh and they\nSaid yeah he said that's a good thing you said\nWhen you're screwing up and nobody's saying anything to you anymore that means\nThey gave up and that's a lesson that stuck with me my whole life is that when you see when you say you're\nAnd that's a lesson that stuck with me my whole life is that\nWhen you see when you see yourself doing something badly and nobody's bother to tell you any more that's a very bad place to be your critics are your ones telling you they still love you and care and the other thing about football is we send our kids out to play football or soccer or swimming or whatever it is\nAnd it's for example but I'm going to call a head fake or indirect learning we actually don't want our kids to learn football I mean yeah it's really nice that I have a wonderful three points dance and that I Know how to do a chop walk and I was kind of stuff but we send our kids out to learn much more important things teamwork sportsmanship perseverance et cetera et cetera\nAnd these kinds of head fake learning are absolutely important and you should keep your eye out for them because they're everywhere\nSorry civil one being an author in the world book encyclopedia when I was a kid we had the world book encyclopedia on the shelf and after I had become somewhat of an authority on virtual\nReality but not like a really important one so I was at the level of people to roll book with ... they called me up and I read an article and has his Caitlin Cal her ... there's an article if you go to your local library where they still have copies of the world look look under vie for virtual reality and there is\nAnd I'll have to say is that having been selected to be an author and in the world book encyclopedia I now believe that ... is a perfectly fine source for your information\nTo follow the controllers for real is it is saying that he and my next to it being an imaginary\nThis was a hard one\nI Believe me getting to zero gravity is easier than becoming an imaginary uh when I was a kid I was eight years old and our family took a trip across country to see Disneyland and if you've ever seen the movie national lampoon vacation she wants a lot like\nA quest and these are real vintage photographs\nAnd there I Am in front of a castle and there I Am and for those of you who are into foreshadowing this is the Alice ride [noise]\nAnd and I just thought this was just the coolest coolest environment I'd ever been in and instead of saying gee I Want to experience this I said I Want to make\nStuff like that is a I loved imaginary and it was just a spectacular place just spectacular\nEverything that I have dreamed I Love the model shop people crawling around on things the size of this room that are just big physical models that it was just an incredible place to walk around and be inspired and then at the end of my six months they came to me they said\nYou want to do it for real you can stay [noise]\n\nAnd I said no but it worked out okay and if they had said stay here or never\nWalk in the building again I Would have done it I Would have walked away from ten year I Would have just done it but they made it easy on me they send you can have your cake and eat it too and I basically become a day a week day a week consulting firm engineering and I did that for about ten years and that's one of the reasons usually all become professors
