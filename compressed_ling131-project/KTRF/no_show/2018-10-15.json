the hammer rights and the others and waited for a hundred years even though he knew the outcome would be negative\nAnd as those four hundred years went by the descendants of pain and the M. rights and others became nasty people cruel and heartless people\nWith abominable practices according to do to run and me twenty per se team they were sore servers wizards doing all kinds of ... stuff they had called prostitutes as part of their worship of their idols and\nAnd they even practice human sacrifice infant sacrifice what kind of person lays his infant son or daughter in a fire and burn them up thinking he's worshipping God\nThese descendants of pain and were dangerous people to kind of people who lead others astray\nBut when the four hundred years was up [noise]\nGod spoke to Moses he said go back to Egypt and lead the people out and and God said to your show not when you move into the promised land is due to run me chapter Eighteen you shall not learn to follow the abominable practices up those nations\nBecause of these abominable practices the lord your God is driving them out before you\nAnd God said ... did run me chapter ... utterly destroyed them to hit tights the hammer writes a cane and nights the presides et cetera that day may not teach you to do\nAccording to their abominable practices\nBut the people of Israel did not drive out the Canaan nights for whatever reason they were lazy they were something they did not drive them out\nAnd God's warning proved to be a a a legitimate warning because we read for example in second kings chapter sixteen that has was Twenty years old when he began to rainy ring sixteen years ...\nHe walked in ways that the kings of Israel even burned his son as an offering according to the abominable practices of the nation's whom the lord drove out\nBefore the people as matter of fact or at least six references in scripture that say specifically the people of Israel adopted the abominable practices of the nation's whom the lord drove up before now\nBut what what God due to the Israeli ... he ... the abominable practices broad judgment upon the Cain tonight's the hammer writes cetera God drove them out but now the Israelis for doing the same thing what would you do in a Jeremiah chapter Nineteen\nAs for doing the same thing what would you do and a Jeremiah chapter Nineteen God said I Am bringing such evil upon this place that the ears of everyone who hears of it\nWill tangle\nAnd the destruction came the Babylonians came that conquered the land is surrounded the city of Jerusalem and be seized at the people were trapped in the city they had no source of food that was so much hunger in there in the city that people became completely desperate\nAnd we're told that mothers even ate their children\nEventually the city bell and was destroyed and the temple was destroyed the nation everything was destroyed the people were carried away as prisoners of war and slaves and they lived in exile for Seventy years\nIt was a terrible time more column inches of space and the Bible or spent on the exiled God's warning of it's coming to invent itself and the reconstruction that came after Seventy years more space in the Bible is devoted to Baptist any other event\nTelling us how important it was how big\nIt was and how ... how great the lesson was that should have been learned but stunningly even after the exile as red tells us that when he came to the city of Jerusalem\nOr the officials approached him and said the people of Israel and the priest in the Levi said not separated themselves from the people of the land with their abomination from the Canaan nights they hit ...\nAnd ... tells us when I heard this I tore my garment to my mental and pulled ... from my head and my beard and sat appalled how could the Israelites make this mistake again how could those Cain like people so powerfully entice them to sin\nEven though they were subjugated even though they were a\nSlaves of the Israelites they and somehow they entice the Israelis to sin and then as relates experience exile and they came back and they did it started to do it all over again but as\nI got it stopped so that our tax for today we have a cane tonight woman coming to Jesus was a lot of context\nIn one sense this Canaan like woman should never had been born yet the Israelites had done in Josh was day what God told them to do if they had on early destroyed the Canaan nights and the hammer rights and cetera et cetera\nThis woman would never have been born yet here she was\nThis woman of the of the source of rumors the cult prostitutes that child sacrifice there's this woman of the people who somehow enticed Israel to sin and destruction she and her kind cause Israel's greatest downfall suffering and humiliation here she was\nShe was persona non grata and Israel every day of her life but she was a human being a person\nAnd the mother who loved her daughter and she had a daughter who was in her words severely demon possessed\nMaybe it figures that a cane and they would be demon possessed it for her daughter continued to practice the cult stuff that that Tina nights have been doing for centuries you would make herself vulnerable [noise] doesn't tell us exactly how it happened but it did she was demon possess can you imagine having a daughter so afflicted\n\nCan you imagine how it tore at her mother's heart to see her daughter tormented\nWhat could she do scan and I'd woman came to Jesus and the ... of the Jews she called him something to David recognizing him as the messiah what did she know about Jesus she\nKnew that he was no respect or a person's perhaps because Jesus said confronted the hypocrisy of the fair season said Ulysses and the other heroes of the Jews she knew that Jesus was welcome children or she might Deb Jesus said suffer the little children to come under being forbid them not maybe he would receive her daughter\nShe knew that Jesus welcomes women or she might have if she heard the story about the woman who touched the handle of his garments if I can only touched half of his charm and I'll be healed or even more so the story of the woman who was caught in adultery\nAnd brought before Jesus and thrown down on the ground at his feet and the people said should we stoner and Jesus said\nGo and sin no more\nCheeses he'll do poorly preach the gospel to them maybe she heard the story of the Samaritan woman at the well the Jews didn't think much of the Samaritans either\nBut Jesus brought salvation to her maybe she heard Jesus said come to me all who labor and the heavy late and and I would give you rest she believed\nJesus didn't make it easy for when she came with her appeal at first you can order until the disabled said get rid of her she's just a candidate woman then he said that was said only to the last cheaper at the house of Israel and there was no escaping her heritage and that was put on the table as if there was any question that\nWould be I was only ... but she didn't accept because Jesus\nActions set otherwise he received the American woman to well she said lord help\nThen he called her a doggy says not fair to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs implying that the children of the house of Israel were children and that became tonight's were\nDogs she didn't argue I Am what I Am I'm a cane and I when I Can't change that but you have a crumb for me\nShe said to Jesus and Jesus roughness furnished a demonstration Jesus\nDisciples saw in the heart of McCain tonight woman\nWhat faith looks like and Jesus said to her a woman great is your faith be done for you as you desire and her daughter was healed instantly it doesn't matter\nWhat your history what your contacts what your past might be\nGod's love extends to you\nAnd when God said come on to me all who labor and are heavy laid and he was extending an invitation to you as he did this came tonight woman who found a place among the people of\nGod menu to find a place

ever did an advantage in that climate I just think this is a a built in advantage for the dolphins and I wonder if we look into it\nMay be similar to how we look at Denver when Denver plays early home

that breeding couldn't you noticed something about Patrick the homes are I guess they're calling I'm Patty ... homes in uh in in being town as you're playing Sunday Night Football they're ... not the same player and it looks like an adjustment to Bill Bill ...\nWell yeah I think one of the things you like to do with a young quarterback is put a bunch of bodies that are on the line of scrimmage what it was just a quick exes knows I I'm not sure people know this [noise]\nSo you hear the phrase three four and four three All right what that means is this and a four three four down Lyman three linebackers and the three for three down Lyman for linebackers okay\nThe reason why it's harder to throw against the three four is because those for lying back because you have ... besides the three down it's harder to discern what you guys are are potentially blitz saying and get a pressure you and what you guys are dropping in the coverage rights as more bodies moving around\nAnd what New England is doing right now is they're standing up and they're putting a bunch of bodies around the line of scrimmage and what they like to do is they like to get a lot of the ... on the field in line backers um who aren't defensive linemen\nAnd then you really don't know if you're the effects of climate quarterback who they're responsible for 'cause the first thing you always address and you walk it launched room which is All right if we've got to pass play\nWho do the five offensive lineman have right so typically they have the down Lyman usually guys their hands in the dirt and then they'll have you know one or two linebackers depending on how many guys have their hand in the dirt well if you got all these guys standing up and and some of these guys moving around and some guys are are the bees they've got numbers in the twenties and thirties some guys got numbers in the fifties\nYou're not really sure what you guys are going to bullets which guys aren't\nAnd what New England is doing right now ... confused patch for homes is the first year starter is\nThey're putting all these bodies were on the line of scrimmage and they're dropping out some of those guys like they did with adopted heights our inception and then they're pressuring him and they're getting hits on him so he doesn't know where that free runners going to be coming from\nAnd that that makes them think slower let's decisive which leads the less accuracy so that's what they're doing right now and so far it's been pretty effective\nI'm so glad you said that because I was going to say the exact same thing and that just such as you an Iron Man that's used you and I do an egg on stage yeah it it made it so that's why I always tell people and I've been saying this for years and years and years and I should probably make a decade Sean yeah it is why I always tell people\nThe more pressure in the pocket the less you've got a rocket [laughter]\nAs in like a red rocket yeah well I mean uh you know uh you know what I mean it's just a yeah let's just uh I I'm for a second book goes you know I'm just I I Am I'm a firm believer that if you are if you can make things messy up front\nUm it's a long road back you know what I mean that doesn't rhyme\nBut it's not supposed to run we're talking ... and those here they should just fall I thought oh yeah I thought this was like one of those things where you got everything the rhyme so it sounds like no no this is I don't think people know football\nPhilosophy is not about rhyming this isn't Dr seuss okay this is talk of philosophy and the football culture and all I Do is spit out football philosophy it's what I Do Brady ... and those guys I don't know how to you know I don't know what to tell you\nJust what I Do I Do I Do I Do want to 'em and listen I'm not here to to rub or dance on any graves here on Fox Sports radio because there was a really cute story that was going on in the NFL for a couple of weeks it was really cute I'm telling you like I even fell for it I fell for it a little bit um\nBut unfortunately we should have paid more respect and we should have listened closer to some of the great voices of the NFL in years past um because apparently one of the great voices and one of the great soundbites in years past in the NFL\nApparently they called their shot when it came to the twenty Eighteen Cleveland Browns when they said this\nWeek they were not that\nWe're not letting them off the hook the browns looked awful on Sunday looked awful ah this was I'm not surprised I actually in my knocks locks I Know you're very familiar with that um weekend overnight radio knocks locks I Do off five picks each week\nAnd the chargers that wouldn't be going well chargers plus one and a half that was a bank heist yeah well I ... I Would have taken that sue 'em but uh the Cleveland Browns are you concerned\nConcerned like I'm not concerned I just I think because\nThis team ended up being I don't say media darling but after a hard knocks we saw these characters you know everyone fell in love with with you know Bob ... Todd Haley and Gregg Williams and an end Jarvis Landry and the passion and you kind of felt like you knew this team\nAnd so I think people wanted to root for them\nAnd the thought was you know after last year not winning a game\nEveryone kind of came away thinking you know any any success will be greater than what they've had and and and that tired narratives that everyone keeps bringing up as well they got more than more with this should have had the last two years [laughter]\nYeah okay [laughter] like we did that no this is the new year like ... Jackson once more the fans were more everyone wants more than what happened the past two years that was debacle let's move on\nAnd what what was being sold to us is this the team that can contend\nThere not a contender okay they are who we thought they were and that is a team that's more competitive will be when a seven games what they've got ten games left is that right yeah I mean think about that\nThey've they've gotta when um let's see if they have those games I don't know that I'm that I'm buying this team's going half of their games for the rest of your ... best\nProbably and and it's it's not no disrespect to them they're a young team they were in their first year what's hot Haley as there oh see you know Gregg Williams in their defense has improved mightily with this team and Baker Mayfield the rookie quarterback they don't need to win the super bowl this year than anything of the playoffs this year\nThey seem to show improvement and I think they've already done that and they'll continue to do that\nAnd hopefully by the end of the season they're playing their best foot ball and maybe they do win two or three in a row but let's just pump the brakes on a new linking them this team that's going to be able to compete\nWith a division or that has the Pittsburgh Steelers who are probably the most talented team in the NFL\nThe Baltimore Ravens who've got a point differential of Seventy one points like like that's not even just to put it in the context okay point differential meaning\nHow much they're off at destroying versus their opponents okay so they're showing Seventy one more point to the season and their opponents that is more than Kansas City in New England combined\nThis year\nThat's how that's how good the Baltimore Ravens had been playing so that that scene that I don't think you know you could go back to looking at that game you're watching like okay like I don't think it's gonna work out later on this year for them for that matter but I think that was more of an indication of you know Baltimore and their struggles than than what they're going to be this year I think they're more of a playoff team\nBecause no one deserves our health\nThan the men and women risk their lives to keep us safe [noise]\nWounded warrior project [noise]\nWe never leave a fallen warriors behind\nLearn more about what we do as a warrior project dot\n...\nAnd the devil a college football\nWhen it goes down in your town that promise you all talking about football for you like better we're the ones that you do\nThe state's Fox Sports radio sports\nWhen you know the whole season and the drinks all stars\nBecause the only thing that math is October\nAn ounce the good News Tomorrow want\nOne [noise]\nLike [noise] wait and when he joined us doctor rating quaint and Fox Sports radio I'm coming up here in just a couple of minutes early ...\nAnd I are going to tell you about how one NFL team has already started their fire sale or so that'll be coming up here and just a couple of minutes are up for those of you listening on a podcast right now you don't hear music you just hear ... when a saying something like move that body and and I I'm not sure who is\nWho is speaking to your either your song [noise]\nI Know you pick this no man I don't pick any the music I Love both\nFor actually you know what that I think about it tonight with\nAaron ... music\nYeah let me play one elementary I also saw a lot of hair and\nWhen I Love ...\nWillie when it when it's when it gets a little more spicy we'll call you both both but until then we'll go proper since you play proper music here on the show was that proper amusing pink he's up for air and everybody if you're\nDriving around like that you have\nWell I mean I just think uh you know for a guy who will do connected about words period so connected with with hip hop and and the culture and you work for hip hop radio and\nYou're ... yeah well yeah he's got to areas on with his family are in short do not play hip on were ... station\nOr what what do you play a sample of adult contemporary\nPlay Stevie Wonder Lana Ritchie yawn saying yes plenty GOOD Music or wow\nTalk a lot of island about now I don't know all the money\nNow don't call it don't cost db please don't phone calls Stevie Wonder you know Stevie Wonder whether you would think oh come on it's a joke matter if you want if you really want to get ...

a swamp cooler yeah it's it's one of those deals like people even know how to diagnose what exactly he was had budding and punching yeah I like at least yeah things got feelings do\nYeah I don't I didn't have an issue with these guys guys he's passionate he's out there trying to win\nMen want you to try though it's it's it's always overblown um but back to the conversation in regards to the raiders okay it it just seems like the writing is ...\nRegards to the raiders okay it it just seems like the writing is on the wall you already moved the best player that private property Reggie McKenzie will ever be able to be a part of drafting or is that is it fair to say or is\nThat yeah um well he was part of I'm trying to think 'cause he was part of the Packers front office but he wasn't he didn't have control of the draft did he\nUse it wasn't his pick like he was a part of it so maybe it's inaccurate saying that I'll say as far as his draft selections\nI don't know that you ever find a better talent or a guy that seems like and this is a bit of an overstatement but even though it's early I think ... could end up in the whole thing you know he's he's got that capabilities that could have a player okay so we can say that much I I think any general manager\nWill be lucky to draft a talent like him\nFair to say yeah okay so that he's already gone\nThings have not worked out great so far with their car who knows what will happen after the season because\nYou know they don't they're not on the hook for a ton of money after this year and his contract there's rumors of Carl jokes if it was their first round pick under Reggie McKenzie who you know it has had its ups and downs during his time there whether or not you want attribute that to his play um his health\nWas the fact is that a revolving door at the federal court in a position of all those things matter to him not being deployed there hoping he'd be another mark Cooper who looked incredible when he first burst on the scene as a rookie and then he's all of a sudden cut out at\nA couple of rough though what the hell's that that one alone I don't understand the ... and again I think\nThe best coaches they look at what they have and they figure out how to make it work\nThat that that's what you do like when that that you interviewed for the job in Chicago right he didn't look immature disk and say okay you know I Need to get rid of this guy or he's not exactly what I'm looking for he said what does this could do well\n... how ... what kind of often don't need to run and how can I you know surrounding the built talent around him it's been the exact opposite with John ... he basically got there and it has this old school mentality of this is my system this is what I Do if if you don't fit that then you know we're we're going to move on\nAnd I just I don't think that's a way of one getting players to play for you but I don't think that's the way you become successful in this day and age I just I don't I don't think as many examples of that in the NFL\nYeah um it almost feels like and and I know because we've got to take a quick break here and find a get to see to say good for what's trending but I actually I don't think that John groove and\nMay I don't think he's been wrong about his assessment of the Oakland Raiders I Do want to get to that ah with Brady when you're coming up next to your on Fox Sports radio I'm ... so we will get that here on up I saw it right now though we go to Steve to say good for the latest including somebody at the goal line looking to

trying to promote an entertainment product and they're sending the raiders overseas so long man Steve you gotta go civil law just a thought you know this is probably what England is thinking right now about the NFL\nA hundred percent and and look that team right that that seem that ended up leaving and then finally in the home of Baltimore\nThat seem in wanting a super good team at I mean there was

... was fabulous and a\nAnd I'm going to share that interview with you here coming up in about five or six minutes\nAnd I think you're going to find it very good because you get you're going to get a sense of the man of what he what lies ahead what the interview today I think our tonight on sixty minutes I thought was ridiculous Leslie stall did a horrible lousy job I think my time with the president a couple of nights ago was much better so I'm an air that interview or in a few minutes\nAnd the president also extremely complimentary things to say about me for which I'm most appreciative and also if it wasn't for I think Sean Hannity and my friend\nSean Compton [noise] and then also their friendship with the president [noise] uh I'm not sure he would have invited me to [noise] to meet with him on friday night and a couple of nights ago and I also taught you asked me what I thought how I thought he was\nDoing in the mid west and\nThey have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they show Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it so we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a piece of grain\nOkay we want to send the piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing Eucharist because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right as I said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away\nAnd then ah with us I said look we want to talk I didn't hear from I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we are not every call me back but I'm going to give you one more chance and interested that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\nAnd they immediately helped in a plane and came over and talk and now they want to make a deal I I don't know that we're going to make a deal with them I can tell you they want to sure but we're going to make it one way or the\nUs we've built China where five hundred million a year five trillion over ten we've built Shanghai we felt Beijing at some point we've got to start building America they got the new airport we don't have the new airports they got the new bridges we don't have the bridges at some point in our money's got to come back to America\nYou're so right so China's been taken out five hundred billion dollars you know people have no idea what that is five hundred billion we have rebuilt China can't do it and I have a very good relationship with President and she said we can't do it very simple we can't do it anymore we're not going to do it anymore\nSo we've now put on two hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of tariffs\nAnd by the way there's been no impact has been no effect you know what people do say is that we're taking in billions of dollars in our treasury because it's a twenty five percent\nSo we're taking and billions of dollars and we have we're going to create jobs now some of these things that we're not buying from China or they become expensive because of the terrorists they're going to start building these plants here to make the products here which is the old fashioned way that's the way we used to do it so China\nHas been like China is the\nBiggest ... by far probably sixty percent of our trade lost we lost over the last

or when they were going to be talking\nWell one of the things that mark and I'm going to spend a little time on today is say we're going to look at where teams are for the seeds for instead of the play off next week now they're still games this week that can affect the final result\nAnd day of all sports the one that was the most in the final game is football because of sampling is so small yeah there is only eight games and it does it is affected by how you do\nAnd how the team you played all year do in their final game so the numbers can change quite a bit\nIn the last game but you have a pretty good idea going into the final games where you're at a I was just looking at the volleyball too are often and apes I won't say cut and dry but it's a lot closer with just a few matching and\nReally what that first ... playoff game a team's pretty well know right now if there aren't home or on the road maybe the difference in that forum where you land and four or five because you can be at home or at road in in any\nTeam with that that's part of it on the other thing is the other thing is are you two or three because to worry each get a first round home Ghana to also get the second round home game if they win yeah yeah and and the two if eventually advance may end up being meeting number one\nWay and if you're near the opposite brackets right than than than the so called best team or drank so by with two or three factors in just because of the second home game also sometimes\nToo is the easiest route to a championship game yeah if you get in that opposite bracket not always but but some\nWanting to pay it depends on who else who is in the brackets and so on and so forth but the\nBut all of that's going to factor in a will spend some time taking a look at those and trying to analyze that a little bit not that it's anywhere and yet I was just telling you about the volleyball one and a three and four\nAre only about three points apart and the tie breakers going to be five and they've split so\nIt's no time yeah so I I I just got to be very interesting to see if it gets down to the typewriter margin\nIf it does for moves up yeah I if there's something else

good us grains council president and CEO Tom slight says writing new trade agreements it the hard process but well worth the effort\nThe main motivation for for trade agreements really is the core principle that us agriculture can compete given a level playing field any producers in the world and we always felt that particularly for the course Korean sectors that\nThey're the most competitive farmers on the globe and certainly if we can knock down some of these barriers of entry for their products in the world they'll be able to compete with any of our other competing countries it's a way for us to develop a core understanding and a way for us to allow American farmers do what they do best not to compete\nTrade agreements light says can go well beyond the sale of grains\nThings that are really being talked about more and more these days are really the geo political impact of trading dream it's particularly as you look at debate over China's new stance in the world is a trade

River Falls before\nAnd she came in late November the last time must have been five six years ago and she was not doing specifically a holiday concert that time he\nDid some holiday music but he did a lot of other things too and I think this time is going to be specifically\nA Christmas concert so if you are wanting to start your Christmas season ... it will be in late November and you can kind of kind of get into the Christmas spirit and last time that he was here\nIt is just unforgettable she's saying Mary did you know and I think he will probably be singing that again on his on his Christmas\nA list of sun so um when you hear him saying Mary did you know you just melt so it is so powerful and it is he sings with with so much feeling\nLet's ah here a little bit of this is Leon Williams\nA use of their turn tone baritone okay Leon Williams\n[noise] wrong [noise]\nOh oh\nOh oh [noise]\n\n\nUh her Leon William So he brings the whole orchestra\nWith no he well all of that night it'll just be piano accompaniment and if she happens to sing something like he was singing from an opera if he happens to do something like that he\nWon't just get up and well now I'm going to sing this and not and not give you any explanation he's very personable he he talks to the audience a lot so if there's something\nThat he feels might be unfamiliar to the audience he will he will explain what it's all about and what it means and so forth so it's it's not going to be just him up on stage singing all of these songs and not interacting with the audience\nSo and this one is it does say Christmas shows always knew huh huh ... I mean like a everything's going to be Christmas or a good portion of it is good portion of it will\nBe Christmas um and there will be both sacred and secular music okay All right and uh uh just as a side note to if you remember the movie glory\nI'm with Denzel Washington out the civil war movie up in the background you heard that this angelic music\nAnd that was from the Harlem boys' choir and I'm Leon Williams was in the Harlem boys' choir at one time and then also he went to Julliard so he is a very finely trained musician classically trained\nTo shove him his master's degree in at Juilliard a school of music um he has all sorts of bachelor's degree Westminster choir college ah the guy is a very challenging as Lee is long list of credentials here too\nAnd yet he makes any kind of music he does uh he he makes it relate to the audience he makes it fun or he makes it a he makes it where you just want to cry [laughter] 'cause it's so beautiful\nArt black market trust November ...

Austin is doing All right after that maybe like if there was a but other than that there really isn't a whole lot the county's central not to take anything\nAway they've ever do their best year and year they have\nThey have a twelve and eleven they're above five hundred first time in years uh at the volleyball seeing they've had a good year um but this year that you've\nGot some really good teams on the west you hear the power seems to be in the west most definitely seems to be that way by so that's volleyball we will know for sure next Monday I as far as what we all probably know wearing a couple of days let's go to the for her fault because they got a big one way in here tomorrow non double A. right now the former falls is sitting for and the top four teams get home games\nAnd the team that is five is crooks than the team that six is world already beaten crooks in okay and they are within that tie breaker number of their way and that means tomorrow night's games pretty important isn't it\nWell he hears the with the way I understand it\nMeans tomorrow night's games pretty important isn't it\nWell you you here's the way I understand it\nIf the ... be war road tomorrow night that should locked up for for them because they will have beaten both of the teams below them re or too far away from deal with Clinton Feldman moving into the three spots right no matter how many points they would garner tomorrow night with the when yeah\nSo a ... because they're Nineteen points away and you're probably not going to move Nineteen well not at all\nSo I ... I mean I'm not well any of them a home game and the first round from the way I read it now the other thing that factors in here which we haven't looked at yet is crooks doing more road and who won between the two of them if they played in to see whether see which team will be coming to the river falls under those circumstances\n... so if the ... River Falls when they have a home game right however if they lose more than likely they are on the road then to probably ... or ... you know what but I'll tell you in a mom and dad okay yeah you're right war order cook so we have to\nFollow if a if it's ... and they went there within the six they still get the ... if critics than we are to move up\nTo ... world beat crooks done and so they made him to nothing but the last of them to one so that throws out the window\nYeah and then you go to section record next and they're both five hundred\nSo I think when you go to overall record right now Kristin has one more when so again the the biggest thing here is if the river falls wins\nThe way we understand that they should be at home and the first round\nNext door yeah I I I see that war road or a crooks and has climax Fisher left and war would of course that's deep river falls lap so\nA win by war road would be huge for them because that would put him above both of those teams\nRadio we over falls within them up yeah so that's a huge game for them but ah the simplest form air as if the former falls wins they control the problem is when they're home at home on Thursday right there at least that's the way we read it yeah that's the way we read it and uh my ... pretty much agreed this morning too and they were looking at it that way he kinda figured it as well\nSo are there we go that's why he will be the expert since he's on the district committee [laughter]\nHi sports monkey let's say go from volleyball way now to football because a week from tomorrow so football playoffs start yeah\nAlready adult everybody plays on Tuesday [noise] yeah I'm\nGoing to happy about that I ever bought and I haven't been happy about that for about ten years now who weigh three a\nI miss the old days when the nine men all played on a Saturday of MBA awake [noise] yeah I get to afternoon games to evening games\nIt was fun I was a very much a tournament atmosphere and they stayed out of the way of the eleven men games on the following Tuesday\nIt get a kind of gave them their own highlight and its switch you know it's been a number of almost ten years now for about ten years so I'm so everybody plays on Tuesday and the reasoning behind it I definitely understand it came down to for the nine men teams playing many of them play this but this uh last played last Thursday\nAnd they played Thursday Tuesday Saturday yeah and it just the coaches were concerned about\nThree games in ten days time any injuries and recovery from injuries and I respect all that I and I understand the idea behind the decision if just for the fan the true football fan that through high school football fan it took away the chance to go watch a whole bunch and explain\nThat was fun and and of course we with radio we'd cover a whole bunch of game\nWine and from our coverage standpoint it affected to show you and I are high school football fans bio and we love that old format 'cause we'd go watch a game Saturday afternoon\nBuzz and go watch a game Saturday Night and I and and the nine man and most of them were close enough together you could get from one or the other you know\nEven if we weren't working it wasn't unusual for one of us to show up if if you did an afternoon game and I had a night game it was not unusual for me to be your afternoon game and leave early to go to set up for my night game and you to come over afterwards and watch the game you know and we did that a lot\nAnd then it allows you to go see the eleven man teams play on Tuesday\nSo you got a whole bunch of playoff football in any in just three or four days right now you really have to\nPick and choose help yeah because everybody plays on Tuesday and put everybody plays Tuesday night most of my seven although there's a couple of six o'clock I think the I think the uh eighty three games or six to ... falls is at a struggle this year when they're on the road we know when I Know that I'm OK so they will be on the road with\nI don't the top two teams get a top times get by on sixteen okay so that would be ... more than like right now the way\nThe cue are F stands fever falls would go to east Grand Forks\nNow I'm not familiar\nWith say east Grand Forks bill with money and Feldman and who won their\nMy assumption is east Grand Forks because I think he's Grand Forks was only last they beat the jail forty thirty four so east Grand Forks holds a tie breaker there anyway\nYeah so I\nI don't know that it's going to change very much with these games unless somebody gets upset or knocked off this week because the ... River Falls plays a\nAlthough the top three school east Grand Forks plays ... lakes on Wednesday if they beat the quite like that would probably put them in the to spot and ... lakes would be ... and ... and then we'd probably go to be quiet and then you go to peak what\nSo I guess it'd be a hope that east Grand Forks does not win\nThat's a long drive on a Tuesday or hopefully people I lakes comes up that when we get along really well I met her to go to east Grand Forks a shorter drive you know the better for the kids for the kids for the fans are everybody in a so we'll wait and see but again Wednesday's game um the ... of course play but that doesn't matter what will happen there doesn't won't change\nAnything you know I look at\nThe end well they're going to get some extra points by by playing in ... school but then I close enough to park Rapids area to matter anyway but they may be alive to park Rapids earlier years so it's not going to matter high so and so for best case scenario is let's watch that Wednesday home we're on the road the Quentin precise yeah or will\nFlee peak why beats east Grand Forks 'cause otherwise it will be at a longer trip okay so that's three and class a Wayne ... still the team to beat on top and the section as they are every year there are seven and all\n... number to call when you need roadside service or toys twenty four hours a day six eight four fifty one hundred ... going with twenty four hour roadside service sewing lockouts jumpstart tired you just joined gr heavy equipment to plus all's going is now doing in light mechanic\nWork and minor arteries is when you need help take on the phone and call falls doing six more by one zero zero\nInto a number to know when you needed to do six four fifty one hundred [noise] ...\nIt was underway and lens ... headquarters whether you're looking to buy some games are set up a seasonal lease program\nAll engines hands knew when he was models for both hockey players and seniors skaters and to the ice in the style with lenders sporting goods school lunches also has a new supply of supplements reimpose wearing ...\nSo get ready to compete with the ... led to a sporting goods next door Michael's me down ...\nBiggest football game areas it's Monday that means football than I did the river walk public house with the river falls radio join us for for the mouth watering Frank football tonight at the river walk public out with the river falls radio [noise]\n\n\n\nHis worst monkeys or Casey are asked brunch you buy legends\nAnd also by our friends and rent like electric and falls telling high\nTwelve or you want to Katie are out but we can do their call before we are talking about the NFL we're going to get that just a few moments there's a lot of stuff to talk about what happened in the national football league but first one I forgot to mention a cross country and some runners all conference last week\nHe has one boy and one girl love both finishing the job Fifteen Jersey fins dead on the girl side and Jake David from the boys side both ... both ... Fifteen so both are all conference a building prep work now and have a I think they have a token meet this week just to kind of convenience competition but uh\nThe twenty fifth year says section meet here in town that's ah next\nYear's managed that next week already yes sorry about that one wouldn't go off a I'm\nA okay ... now ... dropped a couple of old big ones because they play Dryden\nThey picked up points in both games could bowl games are over time games also they still get points for overtime if it goes over time each kid or you each get a one point the winner gets too if there is a when I see\nSo yeah so they picked up ... points in both games but uh but came up short twice in overtime losses to Dryden this past weekend and they're trying to this week give some new faces acclimated uh they did add a few more people last week they still have some space as to fill the trickle down then going on right now\nI players who were on the edge of making us a gel teams and then didn't will trickle down to the M. J.\nAnd invade trickle down to the M. G. the odds are since they were potential usa legitimate potential usa Joe players\nThat they will bump players on the M. J. teams who didn't trickle down to the side Jay gel and then it's a matter of can you get them to come here and play so are you should leave and Roger changes I the next week to ten days for sure\nFor ... for most of the teams in the anti jail\nThis wasn't a factory last year because they went on I was Seventeen old start ...\nHad it like that but but there's two things at a factory and mark a first of all they had a ton of returning players a year ago from the first year right yeah okay this year they last seven or eight kids age out\nYeah so they had several places several blocks to fail yeah first and foremost secondly the league changed the rules again all the mess that affect us load affected everybody in a league but they reduce the number of it's\nAll done on birds a year and I forget what birth year would be 'cause I don't keep track of it that closely but ultimately the guys it could have been thirty year players like ... ... be reduced the number three inches bird here\nBy one per diem so that's one less guy you could have at that age bracket\nThat affects all teams maybe it does but a number of the players that they've had show an interest in coming here have been in that first year and they're full of member of your life they dumped somebody they already have\nNow but I'm looking at and going while we had a great great here last year a great start to the season this year I also want a whole\nBunch of those really close game last year you'll remember not now I you know the last two overtime games this past weekend last year they were winning a bunch of those games are really have a new coach too they do and his co workers and that good called it a nice job but\nUh but again call had a whole bunch of guys for second year players who knew who his style knew what he wanted and the new the league now you have some new faces both employers and in coaching staff\nAnd they're kind of get to know if you're going to get to know process there not last they've they've beaten the last placed team and beaten up on them a couple of times even though they had to forfeit one that was stupid do but it happened well\nTo the league's fault outlet eight is what it is ... hours here might want to get to the ... here's my question how do you not process the paperwork to give the dirty played for the team for two years\nI don't know going back to jail he'd\nOnly been here for doozy there but do you have to do the paper every year paperwork was turned in the league getting process it in time\nWhat is your ... during playoff or why why did better than ours 'cause you have to pay for it because they own because he wasn't processed and ... and legal at the time OK well somebody missed something here right from what I understand it from what's been explained to me it was I Believe offers ...\nAnd not be as I said Joe offered that they can eating junior hockey league often if it wasn't that are useful why do they have to pay for it that's the way it works OK\nLet's move on to the NFL endless stock of the Vikings ... while the\nOkay All right let's move on to the NFL endless stuck at the Vikings ... while the NFL then at the end of the north has really tightened up because the bears have three wins Vikings out three ... of the Packers when the night they have three ...\nUltimately what will happen is if Green Bay win tonight Minnesota in Green Bay will be tied for first in Chicago will be a half game back because of the extra game because both Green Bay in Minnesota will have one more game in Chicago outlet and we die after this weekend\nAnd that all humans itself out when everybody else has their body weight right right but uh like Detroit has about a week this week fantasy north is yours is screwing conference that that they are by we'd get split up most of the ... most\nOf the shot rather by week yeah last week well Detroit must have had their ... to 'cause they're too in training beheaded by week this week they\nHad it this way I think they are to play this week\nOkay yep yep but I think so because they're both they're they're the same as the bears a to a flip flopper bears between two lines or two and three right\nWith a baby Chad thereby weekend so I didn't ...\nHave to have there's yet okay biking got nice when you actually how about Adam feeling a leading the league in in a receivers Adams having a very nice here seven hundred and twelve yards fifty eight catches leads both a category as as a receiver\nAnd I saw the stats yesterday I don't know if you watched any of the game yesterday a okay and I'd establish something to do with\nAh most a hundred yard to is receiving a gamers soy ...\nPlayer since Nineteen sixty one or something like that yeah they have a hundred yard receiving nine you know the first six games yeah nominally you'd have a degree or\nNo doubt about that not only the fact that he I mean that's just a great step it think think of how we've the NFL's become so much more pass oriented him or the past ten Fifteen Years and nobody has done that toll Adam feeling this year it's ... it's amazing though I was reviewed by reset Emirates even\nA hands hands the England great the job and and here's a here's a couple of bonuses yesterday with one treadmill actually caught a couple of balls\nOr that helped I I Will tell you that helped Adam ceiling get another hundred yard ... I think so too because what it did pay the ... ... was at three or four times early\nAnd he caught the bulk of those passes and made something out of all what it more than I did was just catching them ... what it did was forced to Arizona to have to honor look won dread well\nAnd in doing so they couldn't run the double and\nFeel it right there plant and they and they put their best guy on Stefan damage to try to limit him yesterday right and and they they did but then when they do that with both the eggs and and the ... and they're both great receivers you\nYou you live with one you get the other one the great opportunity well they have to have it but it but it had\nHad ... will not showed up at the drop those first couple of houses as he has to pass\nA van they can continue to roll the safety over the top on the line prize a treadmill is still with the Vikings no because I personal opinion I think his quarterback the coaching staff and so I like this kid we have a connection keep him around [laughter]\nBut they haven't had a connection and he's not catching them but he wasn't actually think about it on a preseason if you think about when yeah when I first got here all day and was talking about it later saying the balls he was throwing the tribe yeah I Know you know and\nContinue stay you know what all he's got to do is do what he did yesterday catch to three kittens cadre and it makes a difference in the game\nAnd you're you're paying your quarterback eighty four million dollars you're probably going to live in one of the damage on the joy plus when they got a running game yesterday uh with ...

Miller\nIn September from an apparent overdose the two are also of course busy with their driving careers area and I made the final decision according to sources it was time to realize this wasn't the right time for them and Pete is incredibly heartbroken\nShe just feels so in love with her now I was out of his whole world to revolve around her but she was emotionally unavailable he realized that she was at her limit with pressure from everyone and everything around her there were days she just wanted to run away and the world and from the world do get some peace and quiet and\nYeah so they only dated for about a month yeah\nWell no no no no they hate it from other gotten gas tall and they were engaged since June ... and it was still on it will ensure if a if it was yeah that still nothing day area\nHere she she is an enigma to me I remember watching her on Nickelodeon yeah and she played a real ear had [laughter] I Can't remember campaign 'cause her and her eye character's name and this\nYou know and and I didn't see it up and but she didn't come across as a really bright\nYou know but that's what the character she was player and then she goes from bad to be in an international music superstar yeah and she is pitch perfect\nAnd it has you know for being a little gal ... will go you know a hundred times bigger than she is you know but yeah\nIt's really become a superstar that through the Disney machine I suppose or oh yeah there's a few of them have come through the through the Jimmy Fallon a favorite he's just like a ... he has her own all the time for stuff you know not just day of my mom\nWill no but I mean and like all the time we're doing like skits and stuff like that\nSo it ... but here's my thing and the reason I bring it up you know first because it's you know it's a big training story but second\nThis has a lot to do it life is itself with just normal people because I'll see on my Facebook page over and over again in fact I mentioned this about a week ago with the new Facebook look\nEach show's events in history like on towards ... when you got a job but you'll see like some friends will say in a relationship and then the next town over in a relationship next one over in a relationship next whenever you know\nLike they got in a relationship in June of two thousand sixteen and then it got into a new relationship in August of two thousand sixteen they got a new relationship in September two thousand Seventeen and then a new one in December to them you know and you you look at that going\nMaybe first of all you don't post that you're in a relationship until you bend in one for a little while uh unconstitutional relationship right and and and here you've got area ground day and and Pete who made it like a fish on and made it you know a kind of a star thing they\nThey I think more than her I think he wanted to be like the next Brad Jolene that type of thing you know he he was\nPushing for this to be like there's this new sensation um and I think because of you know now the fallback is\nThe sensation um and I think because of you know now the fall back as she pulled the plug in now he's all upset and and you're going to see a bunch of really sad Saturday Night live skits coming up\nWith that and on top of that I mean if that wasn't enough for the\nSeries went bankrupt today [laughter] because you see what he dresses and pretty much yours I Hope Sears can can reorganize how can they do about an eighth inch shutting down stores love for the last year they've been they've been running water and losing ground\nLet me ask you every step of the way is the last time you went to his years\nWhile they are they close their all caused builders one in Grand forks in there that's caused oh it is close to ... yeah I guess you are but over there for a while and no I haven't been able to leave anyone idolize\nWell I've been at the Jaycee granny over there still are in a door at the mall there on the back side of the bone towards a you know and you and Dan Sears used to be around the corner\nA died in that even I although I did notice the last time I was there\nThey ah they have these cars one wall I'm used to have garages\nAnd I was thinking to myself when did JC penny have ah you know like repair service\nI don't remember that but they have all these different garages there that they had boarded up and painted over and stuff that was the Sears automotive\nDepartment I Believe on the backside also they have it over then I I think so okay 'cause they yeah there's you know housewares or something you know where that is but um but if his hat into a series of probably five years and that's why\nSo I'm the reason now but you are like a lot of other people I have no damage than go to the series because one\nThere is nothing in Syria that I I mean if you're going to go by craftsman tools you can get a cheaper somewhere else but but we have there's a different you know we have our own home town to wind down here's a ... a much different ... different deal absolutely you know and I I shop there Dr\n... but I think the tools there between ... and stuff down there but yet\nAgain it's a different variety though it's a hometown so you had done so much different than just here as well first of all you go into his ears into my past experience lesson one to one was up in Redding, California there's nobody there\nAnd you walk around aimlessly looking for somebody to talk to you kind of like a big box store\nAnd oh yeah and you're kind of like go out and they used to have I think they had like a hairstyle in place in there as well yeah a ... and the auto taking and stuff like that my my main reason for going there was ... you know like tools are are certain things like that you know like in the garage type of thing\nAnd there was never really around there is now it's like they're always worked in a different counter you go down to the one here in town and you know when you walk in the door you see people and they'll right away they went Indian or plants or you need ... ... they're I mean I got used to knock on his years just because\nIt seemed that first of all there in these big malls so you have to go park in a big mall parking lot walk all the way to the store and then go through this door to find something and then it wasn't very convenient and so that was part of the problem I\nDon't know why Ford there wasn't that wasn't the whole idea of a mall to have everything in one\nPlace that had the convenience of who's going to a mall shopping or going to buy some clothes and then I'm going to go by like a big crash in a garage center while I'm here\nYou go to the ... you go to different stores in a mall and you you know you didn't Sears also have clothes and stuff so yeah okay yeah but uh but\nYou can get the other and more than just that I'm older I mean you go to west acres and you've got Dayton's in her burgers and to launder season I mean I Know that it changed names in places have gone away but um even markets and all the different places and then you get Sears\n[laughter] going shopping for close\nYou know probably the er I'm forever Twenty one or the ... fish or or some of those other ... is a change\nYeah here's ... who was a name that you had to go into Sears sure but that was again that's why I think they could have done a long time ago and they didn't keep up ... should have moved out of the malls and created their own stores which one would have been a lot more easy to get in now go park just like a a regular store\nAnd and and then change that what they're selling I think they were I think they found themselves behind the eight ball everybody else is doing what they did and couldn't get out I mean you know the the ah by k-mart yeah\nAh ... expand it became more line yeah and when they by k-mart\nYou go to Kmart and then they say you are with you if you have a huge card house and get discounts here if I wanted to Sears card from Libya I drive\nThemselves any good either and in every month no no that's true there were always Sears I mean they were always the exact classic game where they grow up in Thirty years ago now without the blue light but I said they were they they find themselves behind and they never were able to catch up you know they they were they tried different business models\nThat ended up closing story after story after story and they never were able to get back to the zero well and you've got again Amazon Best Buy a home depots office max mean you've got pretty much every other store caters to something\nThat if you want to get the angels role in and pick those up again unless it's like a small town friday you know where you can go to say here in our town\nYou go in there you know the people in and you you're used to what the you know what's on stock and you can get you know good service him that's the biggest thing I think they they didn't have service ... ... it's ... it's a lot more important these days and the people that don't shop Amazon do it for a reason they want to actually physically touch things and talked to somebody about it [noise]\nRadio shack could not compete with\nAll the different online electronic stores all the different best buys ... cities I always thought radio shack was again late uh the the branded optimize as their\nLand yeah and that isn't good ... ... ... it wasn't it wasn't terrible it wasn't terrible but it was when they write what they were behind I mean you're you're going against Sony and you're going against Bo's yeah you're all these big names and yeah and and you\nCannot change names in midstream to try to you know catch the interest and yeah it was an attempt to get people to buy optimists yeah and um have you ever there were linked to have you ever try like their headphones\nAh I Know I don't they weren't good if he were you know if you add up I I had optimist where you are optimist receiver I think at one point and it wasn't like a speaker you once again if you're talking just a basic electronics to a receiver that's fine but when you talk speakers they had some outdoor speakers and weren't too bad\nBut ah the name itself didn't you didn't sorry Claire ... loyalty\nTo optimists no and and it it was weird because of the brand in everybody knew that it was radio shack like\nHey was cheap you know he is getting a deal\nI liked radio shack but it really wasn't that cheap I mean it wasn't like you're getting a great deal no not later on you know because compared to what you could get it other stores so I Wonder I Wonder how are\nThey opened one of these dollar generals now\nEverywhere random Carl stood up and read more and I just opened in ... I Wonder what their business model\nCheap yeah they're opening up stores all over the blow yeah anyway and towns of Alex got one Warren's got one yep porous lab built put a yeah every every one is the same time they're on their model it just you know is\n... the communities that aren't big enough for a Wal Mart that's where they're going and that they're trying to own that market because a lot of those even the small town stores grocery stores\nCan survive and somebody will just drive thirty miles to a hero or Walmart and that got we'll just go do some shopping this weekend and and and so they can survive against that either so you see the decline of the small town grocery stores to but now you've got\nThe dollar generals ... so much of their product imported from other countries they're not paying much board and the sizes are much smaller than what that's the thing I've noticed about I Wish that I Want to know more\nAnd and and bought some way to buy some prayed candy here um when the for the parade and do we all we found some candy at this place and then with that oh we play paid about the same while we paid ... for about same all we thought from a different place ... bought one we dumped all the bags it was about half of what was actually\nA man there's so much smaller amounts in the\nBags and their ideas that and you've got the same you know like down really falls has one on the ... Yeah Yup yup everybody who is you know at least a twenty twenty five miles away from the nearest Wal Mart\nWill have one eventual and they put them up in a hurry gosh it doesn't take long to put the building up at all they're really tense but they just on the outside the actual structures that are not\nBut they do what they're trying to do is um have just enough to supply somebody who\nYou know I don't want to drive by the way Tony well I've got a store and it looks like I'm going to get a deal and stuff so you've got different toiletries and you have a just a small variety of food and as a dollar on them sign young you know you're going to get the deal and then there's some stores that are dollar stores\nThat not everything in the store is a dollar for some reason they I Can't remember the name of the brand but they are they open up and then you think al everything's going there three dollars and eighty cents [laughter] something somebody did something wrong here\nBut there there are capitalizing on now you don't you want it for me I went to one in Texas one time going wait a minute that's not right but you know they they have one of those right next to Walmart here and I said where every time I go by just as busy as any other store\nSo is it because they perceive that there's a a value this\nYeah I Would think so and and again there's a segment on population that lives on a limited income hunter who who but\nThere's there's there's stuff there that you can get added a party supplies or something that is you know dollars stuff like that it's a little and you know big get people going the other party supplies or decorations or whatever there you don't have to lay out a bunch of money and there's a bunch of it their craft stuff\nYeah it didn't you know you're not buying save your mind the toothpaste is not craft its crusty answer [laughter]\nBut I Do I are now more time they pick up some later right and and you go to especially if people are going on trips you know if they're going ... in fact I Know a lot of people that do this on purpose the going on they camping trips and stuff\nThey'll stop there and get a bunch of stuff because at the end of the trip allowed him to ensure all we have a way to do that throw away and so they they're making a niche for themselves you know they have found\nA niche where other people had in and they they built their business on at Sears had a business and\nThey were slowly but surely getting next out of everything to where everybody else change in time to end in grass that that if if if fears grabs onto the\nOn line model that Amazon built they'd be\nPlay right now but do you think it's too late for that I I think it is I don't go to white but if they would have done that earlier sure\nYou know and they had their brick and mortar but I have this big online presence think about if any of these companies would have done that before Amazon yeah\nI mean are they worried about the ... even shortly after Amazon did I'm sure yeah there you go 'cause somebody's got to be the first thing you know right Amazon came up with a metal ... ... people are never going to order overload jabs why people didn't do it and want to try other genes are not buying\nMoney that's Microsoft thing here and again Amazon's model was perfect because what they did was they weren't actually selling the stuff they were built there were a wholesaler I mean they had all the different businesses would supply them\nThen they would send it out and every once in a while you'll get stuff directly from the you know the the the place you're buying it from most of the time of getting it straight from Wal Mart or from a Amazon\nAnd so Amazon was distributing it and they were pretty much the middleman and they're making billions off of it and now if you go to Amazon you can buy Amazon products\nIn fact most of the time you get to you know like a ... say laptop case is um you know you go down the list of it it's almost like Wal Mart in their white label stuff that Wal Mart still sell the exact same stuff that crap to hasn't\nBut that white label it and they called their great value a value on Amazon to the same thing it's called Amazon basics you know and so they now have the exact things that you're buying from another place but they're marked Amazon basics\nAnd they're turning their their their base any sense here they're\nAll type one of these one of these\nTwo yeah that's yeah in the free shipping and a three day money back guarantee and all the other things that go into it um you ... you can't go wrong I mean that they've got a great model and it works for them so Sears probably too far gone [noise] what are some of the other companies out there that might be too far\nGone that you know I have talked about it and I have looked at you know ... they're they're uh they're models not quite working anymore you know I don't know who's left you know as far as media and we we all left yeah but we've lost a lot\nYou know as far as media and we we all left yeah but we've lost a lot of them they're still struggling there'd been trimming the entire built for years that should social Chinese

what did you learn\nFrom last night's game\nYou know I Know a lot of people like look at these two teams here the titans in the AFC who have items I top two teams or whatever without question I learn without question Mr Chris Broussard that neither one of these teams\nWill win a Super Bowl because you can't win a Super Bowl playing this kind of defense even in this league I Am sorry\nThe Kansas City chiefs we're giving up chunks of real estate\nForty two yards on this past sixty yards on that path forty two yards here it was ridiculous I hadn't seen anything like this\nIn a long time and I

win the\nSuper Bowl you need to stay away from making your proclamation no I'm not 'cause you have proclaimed the Jacksonville Jaguars they will be the best\nTeam in the air for the buck forty point yet did they did that Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys I Know what I call\nThat a bad day at the office\nAs little as they have three bad days at the office in six weeks no they haven't had or what I thought that was who you are that right All right yeah they have reached a are who we are already\nThought they were they are always saying where you are you are self proclaimed\nThe New England patriots dad they are I think that\nBest team in\nBy the going through the super bowl noted not like I predicted before the season started New England is going to the super bowl you will see these two teams in the AFC Championship\nNow that's a bet right there 'cause no way both are going to make it they it doesn't happen have you follow\nAnd make you still got Jackson your favorite how do you ... have you follow any weeds career\nOkay he he gets the championship games don't act like he does it just can't win them he can't win them no and that's why in these are two\nVery closely matched teams because they're both terrible on defense Pittsburgh is terrible on defense your boys ... about forty points yesterday to the hapless cow there was a bad that he was putting it on the fence hopes
