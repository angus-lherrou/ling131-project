I don't really know what's going on when you the one that founded on ... island projects and that was really really interesting I mean he was describing how\nYou know he went up there and these ...\nAfraid of isn't really mind them a lot especially early on as able to set up front next to that and at some point fairly early and he took a very cautious approach talked about I was like kind of ... around them at first that's been a long time yeah a project that they've had going on that goes\nBack to the eighties goes in eighty six I think that started out I remember\nThat they've had going on that goes back to the eighties goes in eighty six I think that started out I remember reading about that when I was a kid that was a big deal there was only ... and he went\nUp to Brandenburg

a ... which is a huge island what nor extreme northern Canada right\nRight and it's just ... you could probably skip Iraq crossed the fjord I'm over in Greenland that's all right to end up there we\nWere talking a little bit yesterday and I I've interviewed gave me a couple of times over the years a mayor shared outdoor news or he's eighty one now I Believe I saw him hop up in and comment on a couple of the um a breakout sessions I didn't see him speak to the whole group\nBut it looks great T a ... is still clearly still one of the top all researchers in the world is a sharp\n... actually I did with them not too long ago in the last month or so a topic and uh yeah I mean he's he's a sharp guys are real nice guy so as a kind of fun to chat with them\nThis alternative very robbed her son and have your started working recapping the a wolf symposium that was held in Minneapolis last weekend ... dropped in their uh one topic I don't know if you heard much about is is uh what what's a wolf what's a coyote what's a red wolves or you know this whole topic of hybridization and\nI was really interested in that at my brother you as you know my I got a brother in North Carolina and I've visited the outer banks and I've driven right to that alligator a river National Wildlife refuge where they've got some red wolves go so I've I've had a little personal interest in that and I remember when the red will project launched the re introduction project in in the eighties when I was a kid kind of following that\nI tell you what you you get into what what is the eastern ... what is an al ... can Canadian eastern wolf what is ... what is that good old fashioned Wylie coyote it gets really confusion oh it really quickly or you know and\nI we got a pretty simple here in Minnesota we gray wolves and we got coyotes and ... they really don't I don't think your hybrid dies much but you go out to you you got ... red wolf hybridization you gotta lotta dog genes kicking around right now it's pretty baffling\nThen that opens us confer pretty serious questions we're talking about the ... things I Am\nBut I Know that area well to the ... river I drove through it at least I'm Serious probably about three hundred times when I Lived in North Carolina out for seven years and yeah it's a wild country out there I never saw one out there I think I did hear one once and we're talking about the rent\nWill yeah we're talking rebels they had as many as a hundred and fifty at one point that program was was cooking along and now they're down to thirty and it's a number of factors one since they launched that program coyotes have become I won't call them in face of their their native to the to North America course but\nTheir numbers have increased in eastern part of the United states and so there's like there's been some hybridization and then you get into that and then they could pose questions what is it a red offers of a hybrid is a protected now and then I think you know they've had some local shooting them and they've been getting hit by cars and yeah they're down to thirty of them\nAnd there's almost no political support in the state of North Carolina for the ... the governor supports it but the legislature there that just not a\nI Would say yeah I mean having lived there I mean there wasn't you know there wasn't a strong I mean there are people worried about other things on there than than the red wolves I was almost like if you read about them and like conservation magazines and not knows about as far as that conversation went\nWhere I Will check out happier story I I think it's page seven or eight something like that in the streets print edition of alternatives are real expensive story especially on a dance Stark's comments I also wrote my column about symposium\nAnd I got to block it outdoor news dot com and some of those pictures of the Iraq War at that time and trust any of us are we had just a minute left ... story it's hard to believe we're coming up on the ten year anniversary of passage of the legacy amendment huh\nYeah yeah it's hard to believe and it's pretty amazing what's what's taking place going well really nine years ago and the kind of implementing that um so yeah I wanted to just kind of say here's what we've done\n... there was a really good story idea it passed on election they two thousand and eight that was the\nUh the year that a brac Obama was elected or for his first term and that yeah it probably took the better part of a year to kind of short out what this thing is to get out of the ah the course of the council up and running\nAnd then started allocating money so it's probably only down dollars of only probably been hitting the ground for nine years but I'm not in the last uh it's it's been a huge success story it took us a long time to pull it took us a decade to get that thing going so it's really been a twenty year process you know to to the point we are now\nHunting I'm Out of an area is pretty difficult yeah like I you know like coyotes like you could even tried to haunt him out of an area but I mean it's pretty tough trapping um it's typically the way to go but yeah that I haven't done it but I'm sure it's a blast\nYeah yeah and and uh they're tasty to rent\nOut figure that I Love there like a bonus animal to get you know I I usually grind them up mix them with deer venison on a good way to go yeah yeah and then you can make some meat balls and burgers and stuff and they'll stick together\nAnd I said I Want to be a good way to go yeah yeah and then you can make some meat balls and burgers and stuff and don't stick together and gather good to eat especially the you know fifty two hundred pounders um the bigger ones can get a little tougher investments meal um but it's a cool critter to have gone by when you're on a tree stand\nOut no doubt this alternative J robs responding with Tony Peterson catching up here just a couple of weeks for the farm bureau probably got got

left but we've got the firearms open or just two weeks away\nAh hey it's not too late citing a rifle write them guys can still get onto that they should have done it earlier but uh you could still pull it off or athletes ... rifle ... fire a couple of shots just make sure everything's on how do you go about that I mean how many rounds you run through your rifle a deity zero it at a hundred or what what do you do\nUm hundreds good good range for me I'm usually ends and tight covering or not that not a clear cut shooting five hundred yards hum as many as it takes ... you know I Want to I'm big into controlling what I can control and that's one of the things that you can you can make sure you're dead on at wherever distance you want to be please do that\nSure okay or and or do you when you're ... do you use copper amyloid yeah seems like it's getting more popular ... talks about that\nUm I have and you worried about letting the meat or that's not really um you know I never really have to shoot so few dear with a surefire arm but would I rather not eat any lead in me yes so I mean there there's some pretty good viable options out there now for not lead ... ...\nThere's a bigger story a couple of years ago a blue corner so even in ten of a little bit of research to kind of testing and there was a lot of there's a little bit of backlash like you know real men eat lead kind\nOf thing and uh I I was like you know can we all be sensible here folks if if you're here and and it literally brain led drop the meat might you know microscopic chunks to lead\nI got a bunch of kids I don't want that meaning led why ... ... that can read when they're when they're Nineteen so if there's if there's an option out there not to do it why not yeah\nI mean that that's one of the things you just present the information out to let people make their own choice yeah\nYeah but I I encourage folks to to shoot a little copper get get used to shooting that because\nIt may come to you know where we're seeing some studies showing that the lead you to the eagles all that sort of thing I gotta feeling it's just going to be more and more research like that funded\nBy you know some of the the greener groups that are going to show this was happening and so why not why not use copper anyway well good luck to everybody I guess going on here and a couple of weeks ago yeah definitely well

I was\nOut in the middle of you know right in the middle of nowhere so um but that's that you know and that's that rising up to the next next play and um you know some of the urgency that we've been preaching is that you know you got to find a way to make it happen\nWe've always said a playoff time especially first round playoff games you can talk about talent you could talk about execution it still comes down to how bad your seniors want to play one more\nAbsolutely and that's what and I are seniors aren't aren't happy with their season obviously like all of us you know we're disappointed and and and the where we're at so far but\nIt is what it is and we got to get going for Tuesday night now and um I Do I I look forward for our seniors leadership to come through and I'm In at the same time the juniors and we're going to be planning a few sophomores to on Tuesday night that they got to step up and and uh laid on the line\nUltimately this comes down to pride\nRight oh I a hundred percent um you know I I think talent wise D G s a they're a little bit better I mean I you can't deny that but um you know who's got more heart and and pride and absolutely um\nYou know we've been advocates believe that we can get this when the coaches believe that we can get this way and so it'll be fun to see it if we're going to battle either way when just why for people who haven't seen it to six o'clock game time yep\nSo we got to be on the road a little bit early you have to get noticed school you know but that's that's all part of that and the kids are are very good with you know

his team were going to go back to games ago because last Saturday when you when I visited your on your way down to the College of science\nAnd uh a game that had a huge playoff implications for you or a wind gave you a home field throughout the post season and I understand it with a little bit of climate\nYeah yeah it was the other thing too is um\n... when north one drop football uh they left the Dakota schools in which are tremendously advantage over our lakes so the Dakota schools have ... on the west so were the first Minnesota school to win the officially the MCAA see west and it was a hard fought brutal gain down seven nothing came back\nA hard fought brutal gain down seven nothing came back\nUm the weather was kind of strange uh there's snow melted so look good but the interior of the field was very slick and the wind I don't think it ever got below twenty miles an hour and it was a crossed when so no matter where you were throwing the wind affected it\nThrough the good old it

personnel to back some kid gives out twenty twenty and the DMV thought he was he was supposed to drop and so we had one miscommunication and they got one long run outside of that they did absolutely

of air out of you and practice in in twenty five degree wind chill in all of a sudden you show up at Seventy degrees were dinky on defense and we just plain guy gas well\nAnd and it was a situation you and I talked about this when you first showed up with the wind on Saturday of last week you locked up home field advantage throughout the playoffs as well as walking up winning the west which really meant the Thursdays game except for for a win didn't mean anything\nMan absolutely nothing so the strange thing is we won the west central lakes on the east and both of us lost to cross over games in 'cause they really don't matter uh so uh it is unfortunate but the key is um\nWe were down in the fourth quarter we had under two minutes drive to tie it with a to point a touchdown and a to point that's a great experience for the playoffs because all the games are going to be like that\nBe the the negative and obviously the the emphasis for you and the coaching staff between now and a week from tomorrow when you play is cutting down the turnovers and cutting down the penalties Eighteen penalties and seven fumble six of which are lost simply or too much ...\nOh yeah you can't win a

state he he's a good runner\nAnd of course all the girls ... shooting for her third grader parents\nYup he she um she went to say the last two years she missed it by two or three of the year before that so that's a ... third year of trying to make it to state and it's tough it's tough but in the same breath thought that she she knows the course we\nWe know the course well she should she should know where she needs to be we we walked it on\nWednesday Wednesday we walked it on the backside of practice and so you know where those plants are you know where I'm it's going to be a little ... you know she knows all that which is should be a competitive advantage\nFor her now you can practice on the course until when um we can't practice on the course on Wednesday so ... ... Monday and Tuesday and we can\nBe out there we just can't run the car you know so well practice at the Mac but not on the core someone said to\nNotice of course just asking skill set up much like it is for the universities do where you are get finished up the tracks\nYes we finished right inside the stadium right inside the bleachers um if you go past there today actually or any time from from now on until Thursday sexually mode um the courses you'll see if you're out on is highway one to one\nOne wants to um you you can see it from from the highway um the path and all that so it's kind of fun I'm sure if people have been out there I'm seeing a path and you can see the course that goes out behind the baseball and softball fields and\nI'm back behind the north one about um baseball field in the woods back there so it's a fun course I'm a ...\nI I was worried at one point to see what some of the section schools would what they think of our course because it doesn't have any hills it's not it's not super hardcore\nShould be a relatively fast track\nIt should be at that yeah you're right and it was it was for our first home our for our whole me a lot of people's first me um\nBut I got a lot of great comments from section coaches and kids and they like the corps so that was a plus for us and you never know is it challenging enough for some coaches that a lot among seemed to enjoy what we what we have out\nThere or there'll be a few of the schools were never been there\nYeah so there are probably be if I think there's five schools that didn't come to our invitation that will be here and sort of be their first time seeing it um will probably have a few\nSchools that are staying overnight on Wednesday night just because they don't want to travel that that long distance and then have to have their kids to be on the bus and then run you know it's kind of hard on their legs so it'll be it'll be a help in town on Thursday\nAnd plus they're section volley ball that night and so they're ... they're going to be a lot of people all around town and\nSo that's exciting for the for over two I think\nBefore you refuse a [noise] I don't want to see a once in a lifetime 'cause you never know how long somebody's going to coach for but it but it's it's it's a rare chance to host because it's a rotation and a sixteen deemed section so it doesn't happen often\nNo it doesn't and it's exciting on I'm excited to have everybody up here because\nWe go to these ... we go to these meats and the section meats and these coaches meetings and I want to I Want to showcase for falls fever falls is a great place to to be to have this me and I think we have a great course in ... and has really helped us in the course\nUm to make it the best that I think that that it is today so\nIt's we want we want to showcase and I want to I Want to add other section schools to say while the forever did an awesome job and we love their course you know so it's we I mean we've tried to make it that way we have our volunteers in place we have everything\nNow are looking forward to it all the girls are kind of excited to you know I'm not only am I doing there could even with those girls are all after the coach who want to go to the game can we have practice or early ... these girls who want to come here next year so that's really nice\nAbout how big a factor is that I mean everybody says well the coach has talked to me but how important does it for these kids to go out and say you know what we'd like to have you complete with us\nUm I think it it actually has a lot of weight because I'm these girls to fortunately I think her social media a lot of back in the day we would never get to talk to our competitors and now these girls are getting to be friends with them and bar so and so I think it's a huge oil to help with recruiting\nThat'd be great for you to because the games this week are important gains for you in the conference knew Greg\nOh absolutely yeah very important\nNow is is the final conference games on this coming weekend\nThe final two and then it'll be ... and he will travel to central lakes the next week catch deer hunting opener\nOh boy [laughter] yeah [noise] that will make sure the major you know where orange on the road that do the right\nUltimate leave this is what she she began this season shooting for was a chance to play in the regional and give yourself at least an opportunity to go to the national drama rape\nOf course and you know overall that she never ... when the girls and that's another thing you know she's a coach I don't think I'll be able to do that and you know yesterday with your seat ... accomplish things things that are before they'd ask questions not you're seeing them start to be independent and they'll say oh it's nice to see\nHow have you felt about this first year at the home of the pioneers how's it going for you\nKnow the I ... um well our stress of the assistant coach at the ... well pressure but it's always fun so\nIt's been a lot of fun that group of girls are just grades um you know traveling with down there there are riots so it's pretty far down time and stuff like that in ... job a lot easier when you have a good group of girls\nGoats good luck today I Will talk with you again next week and probably see you next week when you were in all\nSounds you got to have enough

right now for the seeds to come out a couple of teams still played today you do know you're going to have a home game you have some idea of who you're going to play is it hard to prepare for Thursday game at this point when when you really don't know whether you bought it is\nWell no I think\nFrom what we know I think it'll either be her than our world and we thought cricket early in the air and we just thought were the other night so I think um\nWe have now three days we can prepare which is good um we need to take a minute we're actually going to scrimmage eating our guy which will be good for our girls that competition because they're very good about being that\nI'm a I think it's always good to compete against somebody that I'm a little bit stronger and can give you I mean at the same like anyway\nWhen when you look back at the at the season ended up more wrote earlier this week he was a game and had an awful lot of pressure on him because quite frankly you were going to be anywhere from before see where you should be now to this ... depending upon what happened with the breakers so there was a lot of movement depending upon the outcome\nYeah that that game was pretty stressful um we definitely need a lot that one and I told the girls that beginning and not too sure what happened to third that but um we ended up on top of that which is good either way it's when\nYou played pretty well in the first two sets I mean they were close but but you played pretty well you'd be outcome was never really in doubt on either one of them was it\nNo no\nBut then in the third set a big kind of look like the girls maybe relax a little bit okay we're up to oh we got this in the bag and and then we're kind of keep storming back on\nYeah it's funny 'cause I think right before that that I thought the girls that we can't get comfortable because\nYeah it's funny 'cause I think right before that said I said girls\nNow we can't get comfortable because they need to secure the game and we had them in fact I was on the line which I had for them and I just wanted them to go out and play and aggressive and\nI Do I think they got too comfortable and they then they thought that whole again and they were like oh my gosh how do we get back to the how do we get back up and it just kind of got flustered and they started playing um individually not as a team and then you can just kind of was not a good match at all but um it was good to have them all back together the\nFourth game and I'm kind of life that way\nNot but I think it affected the final outcome of the match because I think you had it in hand at that point but how big was ... injury\nOn huge that seems the momentum quite a bit I think all the girls\nI'm In the hot all looked at me like oh my gosh and she's an awesome player like her jumpstart were outrageous that her hits were crazy um\nAnd I gave it to her she's an awesome player but yeah once you got injured I think the girls were like okay let's go now [laughter] I think they get a little bit at first but um once she was injured and what we were okay\nAlthough you play the game for him the first two sets and I and you've got to got you're sure touches blocks on her which helps\nYeah now yeah\nYou're going to see another beginner like that and you're screwing this week going the opposite I Hope you prepare for Thursday\nYes it does and\nUm whether we like her in our world they've got some good hitters\nUm nothing that we can't stop what Glenn is definitely going to give us something that you can work on it and adjust to end um learn from her so I'm so excited to play a scrimmage against them on Monday nights and the rest of the teams out came a phenomenal so I'm\nActually they're called reach out to me was that Thursday or friday and at that we want to mention that I didn't hesitate once and I just told the girls and they all look kind of excited like a nervous excited but they\nThey're excited to see my dog because they've I mean even has been doing well this year so it'll be fun to watch them and I ended up not us that's such a stressful environment where we can stop and work on things so it'll be good\n[noise] well the biggest thing about the scrimmage more than anything else as if it keeps you from having a little bit more than a week without a match for both of you because that's a long time a distributor\nYeah it is it's a long time I gave the girl friday off I just I mean everybody just a mental break we've been going study I think we've only missed one practice all year so\nGiving them that extra mental break inside a night that come back Monday and refreshing ready to work and then we got to be getting Wednesday also ought to work on some blocking and surveys and all that good stuff though\nOne of your regular junior year it was only able to play a ... road she going to be available for you on Thursday or you're going to have a full ...\nShe has its strain hamstring right now I'm ... or the fact is she didn't do much was wrapped I'm sure we'll go to physical therapy I think are\nOn Monday and Tuesday and then we'll go from there and see how she feels but heating up and get a nice job in her spot than I Do they count play Thursday I I'll just raptor and you've got to keep her for some stronger games\nReady because you could do not believe the very next Monday you win on Thursday you play on friday and you'll probably get rosel they're the one seed and that would be a match up in the bracket so\nYep right and you remember the ever ever ever saying you never see Memphis in early in the year\nRight yep and then we saw on the program a little bit but ... not pretty fast [laughter]\nWell that'll be that'll be when when would you like to just put away somewhere in forget about we we've\nWe've watched that day yes for sure\nWhen you come in you coming off of his big win a momentum to earn a home for advantage important news and for your seniors to get to play

want to be in control of that decision and um [noise] I push it forward a little shorter than I probably was intending to for you know the reason I think it's been pretty pretty well publicized my

still got you know more than a few months ago and is excited to finish for the for the flurry and still enjoying it every day but yes I'm I'm leaving after me but it would would be almost fifty years since I walked in high school junior which is really ridiculous to think about\nThink about that high school junior yeah just hanging out say they're never less well\nFortunately they didn't have intern programs like they have it and not only television right now but it's a lot of businesses were mostly as a as a junior in college you're allowed to come in\nA you get credit for it you're there for three months you learn as much as you can and then you leave a well when I walked in the door there was no such thing as internship programs I just happened to have a neighbor who was leaving WTC hotel was named Phil Jones who\nCalled ... Scott who was a sports strike because they got this kid across the street bugging me no matter who shows up and I and I did and I to this day I don't know why they didn't make believe certainly wasn't anything special just hanging out\nFilling out it'll take in high school scores on a friday night and then they'll know grabbing ripping in a row reading a wire copy in typing to my fingers started bleeding and figure out how to write copy into legible copy that somebody could read on the air so\nBut I learned the basic from the best that probably ever existed in the local news or sell 'em at all it all turned out somehow some way and it's it's just a credible how the flash it it's gone by this fast\nAnd you think of all the different things over the years that you've covered I Know you're going to um I think kind of the last marquee event will be the final four of us banks stadium in terms of of all time or work in the right and then you get one more marquee event had Superbowl last year and\nAll kinds of different things over the course of your career\nWill yeah a lot of uh locally based as well um I I think you think of course a long time of fans here and we haven't had that many bright spots but uh you know the seven Ninety One World Series but more than the event itself I think the the relationship not only the media had but it but the fans had with with those players I think that's something that's missing today there was a real connection with\nThat group for the twins in particular that they lost a hundred and two games that they can Nineteen eighty two and we saw them kind of grow up right before our eyes and we all do the names by now but\nThere was a real bond and I I think that's missing we'll use that word loyalty and sports anymore is Jerry Seinfeld says you're cheering for laundry but I think back in that day when you had ... pocketing guy Eddie and her ... laundering viola I didn't go out on the line\nThey were part of our fabric in this community and people really glom down to that team and and those teams that particular so those those are will always stand out obviously I'm going back before that to the lake placid in in what happened in Nineteen eighty a will always stand out\nThere are certain individual moments but I think the bond in relationships it's always been about relationships beyond the games and I think that's what I'm most proud of in terms of my career\nWhen you made the announcement I'm obviously everyone wanted to talk to you about it congratulate you on that what's it mean when you hear what you meant to people whether our listeners what his workers and colleague\nI I'm I'm honestly uh blown away by because you're you know like you know this business you're you're it's a day by day thing you don't have retreats like a lot of businesses do you don't go on these ... are long weekends to talk about how we going to make things differently you just go literally day to day to day to day to day and\nYou know I and I I ... I've had a lot of uh insurance I bet a lot of insurance who I'm because I've always wanted to pay it forward knowing what the people did for me\nThat if I get it like a proud pop a great deal of satisfaction seeing that they've had success if they stayed in this career or gone on to another career and so when people come back to me and\nDuring this time in particular and say hey I Can't take enough are treated me so well and\nAnd always giving me a helpful a piece of advice or whatever the case may be ... yeah I mean it's it's astonishing because that's all you can ask for in life that's the stuff that's the most meaningful and I've gotten so many emails from people that ... little things meeting people and airports or whatever it might be say a time for my son to\nTake a picture a signing autographs or whatever it is in a debt stuffed means as much to me it is as any pro athlete coming up to me manic something\nAnd then when you hear feedback to from viewers who will say you know hey I went to\nBed with ten twenty five every day for forty five yeah I always like during a woman because it says I've gone to bed every night and wake up every morning I'm\nGoing well good I'm happy I'm Glad I Hope it worked out for you hope your husband's approved to that but I Know it's it's very very very nice and but I think that's the relationship that we have this community that people have done you know local news\nUh it ... we are a very appreciative of the people inviting us into their homes every night I think that's the one thing with this day and age of social media people around there under devices all the time and it's it's all information but it's not real personal and I think that's the one thing that local television local radio can do\nStill does I think it's more important today than ever before\nBecause we do feel like we bond with people and I think that's what everyone is lacking right now uh it's just it's so a distance and and so informal that I think that the fact that you know we are invited to the people's homes and they listen to us or watches a mix all the more meaningful\nIt's been very meaningful watching you on TV my friend thank you and Thanks Mike\nThat's mark Rosen and Mike grim Rosen says he plans to continue his frequent radio work with the twin cities sports station will still be on television occasionally after he signs off in April [noise]\n\nLooking back to Minnesota matter it was a busy week for educators across the state and then ... tells us that started Wednesday with news the Minnesota students continue to outperform the nation on the ACT college entrance exam then on Thursday hundreds of educators gathered in St Paul for their annual NEA conference\nThat's right Scott education ... made the headlines three let's start with the news that Minnesota students again ...

I've got a patio\nThat ah it's cut off a certain point but yet we got a deck over chop ... through a day or two bladder I've got mud brick you know maybe Eighteen Inches up all great\nOK okay what have you tried to get it off of ...\nWell that's [noise] Bye bye go to the pressure was right but I don't know that you're probably taken away motor used fresh\nOr not if you don't you know might go to on that might be a pressure washer to Dan but yeah you just got to be you know how to use a little common sense on the amount of pressure you and use from the pressure wash or what I mean by that is I probably wouldn't use\nLike if you used a twenty four hundred PSI pressure washer\nAnd you used a twenty five degree nozzle and you were Eighteen to twenty four inches away from it you'll be fine [noise] unless I really had really soft brick or really saw mortar I'd probably go that direction but you were going to say my problem is so go ahead [laughter]\nWell I mean by a pressure washers up like a twenty seven hundred fear is that I think that'd be a problem still\nOkay so if you have that let's back it off to a forty degree knowledgeable forty degree yeah okay so you go at a forty degree nozzle and then you still say Eighteen to twenty inches away from it\nAnd it'll probably be enough pressure to go ahead and take it off you may have to play around but you'll be fine if you go to a wider\nSpan of that uh nozzle ... in terms of a cleaner oxygen needed bleach would be the cleaner you would use\nUm yeah and you hear me talk about one in there's different degrees of it I talk about the masonry defender dot com which is ... they have a masonry cleaner on that website which is a hog grade oxygen needed bleach\nSoap your wife or their either that or right so in ... mix was water you'd spraying on splashing on mopping on led send about ten minutes rubbing rents\n[noise] okay All right hey thank you so much ... a\nGood about things they care Bye bye good point by him two really good point when you use the pressure was certain that I Love using pressure washer and people that have pressure wash or they love using pressures to ... game little toys little fun\nBut you can do a lot damage if you don't use it properly so have you have like a twenty seven hundred and eighty up like four thousand PSI probably ... ...\nSo if you have like a twenty seven hundred and they all up to like four thousand PSI probably more than that you don't want it I mean if you get thirty five hundred PSI pressure wash or twenty five degree nose will start hitting a concrete driveway your twelve to Eighteen Inches away from that concrete you actually etch that concrete\nBut if you're a twenty four hundred twenty five degree knows where he changes the way you not\nNew clean it but\nYou might wanna sealed after that so you got to be just a little careful with it but you can use it you change it to a wider fan docile back off a little bit how close you are\nBut even if even use the water for a a pressure wash Ron brick inspect the brick and he said missing mortar in that is a problem you got to make sure that you don't have missing motor ever\nOn your house I got a couple of good stories about that too but a pass we'll get to Dan Dan welcome\nGary thanks so much for taking my call you have a great deal thank you sir\nHey I Need your help here but I Do a lot to do it myself and I'm working at a on file quiet in my\nEye on the lab and I got about eleven hundred square feet\nDown there and it ended up here to all be about the crap and leveling the poor always is um [noise] I'll have a problem with grinding coffee grinder on the scene and getting that what helped me out with the level and um\n[noise] ... how about you how far away [laughter] it can be a big deal it can be a big deal\nYeah we're not we're not bad guy or the back on the vinyl plank is three sixteen over ten feet and I'm right on that edge I might have a little bit more than that but overall I'm In pretty good shape but I Do want to get a good\nWell there is floor level lawyers that are on the market either pre mixed or the ones you have to mix and ... and ... it's self leveling for the most part\nUm or if you wanted to you what I usually use a two by four you get yourself an eight foot two by four used as a float you pour the floor level are on there and you just run that two by four over which will spread that evenly and level it out\n[noise] okay I Will\nI been guys on line using trials and I didn't I mean they're more like our then\nYeah well you know if you got a two by four I think that's the perfect way I mean that's the big long float somebody on the other end of that just run that over perfect perfect because as you you know it's\nThe floor you're put on there is you know it just needs to be level just means thirty and level and that will certainly\nAccomplished that task in ... and ... sometimes be way of an inch inch and a half that's a problem\nYeah yeah um how 'bout how 'bout the craft the soccer field that with the level or\nUm while you're gonna have to it it'll probably just crack right through I mean but it'll be level right right ... yeah you're going to anyone over that\nI didn't know if there is a different uh [noise] a different product\nThat I just remember that that salt cut their is designed to be the weakest joined us lab in case you have some movement it'll\nCrack in that crack ... and if you put Flora level or overt it's going to correct so but that's OK your floor is going to be over but you wouldn't even know will correct\nOkay so I was just concerned with using that much or level in that middle crack a critical caught why in deep huh how wide early uh well at the top of them they got to be a good half the time of course why really got yeah\nAnd where you at what that was something oh\nOkay uh any ideas who suggests [laughter]\nI think what I Would do is if they were that white I just haven't seen them that what I Would get a backer rod in a backer rod is like foam rope okay that\nComes in different sizes have fish five age three quarters inch in just push it down in there get it
