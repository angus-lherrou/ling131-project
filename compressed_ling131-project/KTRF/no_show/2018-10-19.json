now and fall and these are\nAll different sure it's out there so if you're looking for something a little more than ... take on may be one thing that's going to be better suited for hunting and\nYou know or you want things all the all the ... they only have a lot of options out there and\nWe're going to have more mild expert and a half mid miles and miles you know so that's definitely going to

spreads\nAnd it's our team forty four one K. tea and and you have that\nAll the way down to thirty three eight if I were really good deal there as well and then you had mentioned the demos so not had a demo tape had a demo Roger how to ... and so they can ... and all that good mind that you\nOwe woman [noise] come on a but I'll tell you know now that they can use the little the they they have a lot and anybody that you know hadn't had one of our demos before and now that\nGoing away yeah yeah but it's been a troublesome night for him on on open or wasn't it\nYeah and it was it was frustrating because a lot of those falls you know we're often this fall and it's a moving three and it's a block charged call 'em\nYou don't get a ticket that one on a two rows and on the defensive then we're rose and you know kind of leaders arms out and and ripped through cat you know that one could go either way\nUh so I think it was frustrating but I I think you're absolutely right even if he has a normal game and you know normal game for cat is like twenty three fourths both rebound right or if he does that I I think your weight and go it away and\nYou don't have as I talked about earlier they offered degree thoughts or San Antonio if cats out there are I have to imagine that you know he would have an impact on the defensive glass because he's a very good re bother\n'em so I think you can point to a couple of different things and say yeah cat could have really had an impact here or there and help turn things around for the state\nAnd it's because when I joined the the game he wasn't on the floor at the time and and the third quarter and gotten a fourth quarter and he's still was not on the floor and I'm thinking\nHoly cow so I I got on my phone and I'm I'm trying to find out to you know did the cat get injured is he out what's going on and then of course he did finally come in and then they they said about the files and everything I all have that answer that\n[laughter] but uh it's a different team without him on the floor\nIt certainly is but I Do want to give a little credits Gordy Jang who all he played well no doubt\nHe yeah he you know bouncing back from\nA season it which when he went to the bench just never could find his rhythm never could really\nYou know locked into his role consistently but I thought he was a very good for Minnesota I mean he ended up ... points ... rebounds ... couple of his is a made some good players I thought he played solid defense bill that was a really good died from Minnesota that\nA court he looked like the Gore gave old\n[laughter] yeah ... years they go and John if he can play like back in the role that he needs to play in other words when to dispel Carl Anthony towns and and and and you know give 'em the quality minutes like that\nThat's a that's a positive but you still gotta have Carl Anthony out there you got to have him in there um if he can he can can play like that in the role he's supposed to uh you're right that's a big bonus for this team isn't it\nYeah and you know the other thing too is talked about this a lot you know what a Minnesota starters were versus what their bench or a season of going you know he brings up the office of efficiency the defense of the fish and the numbers and uh that started five of the top ten deep that defensive unit the bench beat la\nWas dead last in the NBA or so you can get ... out there playing defense like we saw in that spurs game I've you could get Anthony caliber you know able to switch a little bit at a guard multiple position I'm Josh\nFor you know able to switch a little bit at a\nGuard multiple position I'm Josh Cody the rookie out at Georgia Tech we did not see him on Wednesday but he's somebody who comes in kind of what that defensive mindset and can give you a some quality admitted it and hopefully get some jobs you know those guys\nIf they can come in and and play with a defective grid or it would really help that second unit but you know at the end of the\nDay or this team is going to live and die by their started but I mean there are the most talented of the group they're the ones that you know are are\nGoing to be relied upon as opposed to pull out went for this team and so that's why you know you if you're Carlin that it sounds you got to find a way to stay on the floor yeah because you know that you're the focal point of the opposite\nOne of the focal points and certainly hope not to take anything away from ... but when ... got the ball on the way they're not sending to defenders\nData or wouldn't go right to Adam what they will the cat that open things up for others\nYeah he got a good a good first came to me\nHey did and he was aggressive or you know you're sixteen I Believe that the twenty seven in the second half but\nHe really turned it off I like the way he was going to the basket or you know run into picket role you get a big three in Minnesota's come back there in the fourth quarter to pull the wool Stewart the three I just really like the pace that he played at and Minnesota as a whole\nPlayed with a good pace they ended up with sixteen fast break point that you know when you go back and look at the pace numbers for that game they were at you\nKnow Ninety nine roughly which is a little below league average but it just felt like there was good pace to that game for the world than you know San Antonio is not a high paid any necessarily with Marcus Aldrich August all kind of being\nA some of their focal point than do for the wolves do basically doubled him off the\nFast breaks on a a lot of that credit goes to the pace that Jeff cheek by that I thought that was good to see\nI Know a T hit hit three pointer or late in the game was big butler course at that really big one um but but overall this is not a great three point shooting team never has been or hasn't been for a long time [laughter]\nYou know how do they change and who's going to step up and there's gotta be somebody that's going to be a perimeter guy they can make this team because if you if you get a three point shooting team here or where they can start he's in threes that makes U.S team that much more dangerous doesn't it\n[noise] yeah absolutely and I mean that was you know when you go back and look at the numbers from Wednesday it would be off at the ... second chance point and then three point differential and that's been an issue for this team\nFor many many seasons you know trying to figure out the\nUm\nYou know trying to close that gap essentially of a maid threes versus defending the three um and I think it comes from you know Andrew wicked becomes from Carl in a big town becomes\nFrom you know Jeff tea or anti Taliban was brought here really\nUh to be one of those guys to let it slide the I think you'll be accepted shots on Wednesday so are those guys are they you know get more and more acclimated to the ... the kind of find where their spots are hopefully or they can pick it up from that three point range because you're right I mean in this day and age\nYou know that was that that was the difference in that Houston series a year ago was essentially Rick trading threes for two and you've got to hope that he used it as it off night I'm ... and you can keep it closed or find ways to make up those points whether it's at the free throw line second chance point points out turtles or whatever it is\nA because teams rely on it and it is such a weapon\nOr we're missing the John ... minutes from temporal radio network on ... on the line this morning to you have questions comments or I'm sixty one twelve thirty call in and talk to him or you can text us on a beach on tax line sixty one twelve thirty um another one on our pizza tax line says butler sure looked tired maybe he should have worked on conditioning more [laughter]\nYeah I mean you're talking about a guy that did not play in any of the preseason\nGame um you know it was only with the team for a little bit in training camp and you know he was re happen a wrist injuries but a tip talks about it all the time there's nothing quite like the speed of an NBA game you know you can work out you can run you can\nBuy you can play scrimmage isn't but once you get out there um you know your your condition and really shows it and you're right I think that\nYou know Jimmy played well independents that he got but certainly when you go back and look at some of the shots around the room that exists in some of those closed in one that you would normally be getting a you know I I think that points to you know trying to get back into basketball play in shape and and pick up that condition it but I Will say Mark I'm\nBased off from what we saw in the first quarter with Jimmy versus you know the the second half in the fourth quarter I thought he got better as he went along a I thought he he look you know in better condition\nBaby in the fourth quarter than he did in that first quarter or whether it took about maybe about midway through and when he came out that time he looks pretty yes but I thought he looked better is the game what a lot more comfortable and got a little more comfortable and more acclimated again yeah absolutely and and just kind of caught is when you know it was like oh that's right this\nIs just sees this as a way that you know what I mean [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nUm I guess uh we're just going to enter the final few moments here just to to kind of touched on or things that got a game coming up tonight or how important is it to come back stronger tonight's game season\nI think it's very important and at home especially important you know this theme was thirty and eleven at home last year or it was the third best whole record in franchise history the fans came out we at sixteen sell out the most of the body what Ninety to see the uh and so the fans\nYou know the pack this building were rewarded with good games and with weight and and that kind of still wild on itself to the point where um I I Want to see who have Thirteen straight spell out there at a at one point\nYou don't want Thirteen straight game here at target center a and that's a big reason why there were a playoff game a year ago it the way they took care of business at home now with everything that you know we've kind of talked about at the beginning and that kind of the did you resolve their situation and and all the things that have been swirling around the same for the past few weeks\nThe one thing that will get everybody on board is playing hard and winning\nA if you're expecting you know a packed house tonight whether it becomes a sell out or not I'm not sure either were closed at this point\nUm but the hope is that the the the come out uh put together a really good effort against the Cleveland Cavaliers pick up a when it got to spend as you know there's ... whole feeling good about coming out supporting this team\nAnd then doing it again next week where they go\nOh hold on Monday against the idea that pays there's an old next friday\nAgainst the Milwaukee Bucks before they're welcome in a abroad and the Lakers ... he died so a number of whole game a here through the rest of the month of October and you'd love to see him get off on the right foot tonight against Kevin Love the cat and they've got a ride that moment of either that or next stretch starting next week like I talked about\nWhen we all have the game on K ... tonight six thirty pregame show this evening you're on a K T I wrap and they do take on Cleveland different Cleveland certainly obviously without the brown on the team by Kevin ... is going to be kinda fun you mentioned Kevin coming back here in the town I should be a fun night tonight but it's a different Cleveland team there's certainly a game is very winnable for novels\nThey'll come if if nothing happens will come and which is my big fears that they'll come and nothing will end okay nothing which I guess it's quite common they said that that does happen and uh not to worry\nAnd then maybe next time I'm they'll come back when we're there will will actually\nBe there an hour and that was going to be my my next question why would they have to leave because it happens when you're ... yeah ...\nThey they want to get kind of everything's settled in the house kind of what's out there to see what the activity levels like in kind of have a baseline um that's kind of their goal ... ah they get nothing and then they'll maybe it's one of those things where we need to be there for the activity to kind of energy in the house to kind of go up\nAnd have lost their along with you know our daughter and our dog and stuff to see what the what happens\nFor those that that that Mr conversation about it earlier water some of the things that you you you get this feeling from in the house um or you didn't know this\nBut my wife a while back saw actual shadow person I and I didn't know that she must have told me and I forgot about it [noise]\nUm at the top of our stairs one night I wasn't home I was working nights at the time and a ... she told me but I just I forgot but she was telling her the investigator that the other night some some a male\nFigure at the top of our stairs one night so was definable enough of it is that yes [laughter] yes she was able to stare at it and see it um so\nUm and we've had a lot of we had seen in the past for my daughter's room when my daughter was sleeping I'm\nWasn't coming from my daughter\nUm we've had\nUm my my wife's been touched in the leg are bad has been touched and push down at the end is a better feel like a I touch or is it like a call I don't I don't know my wife can't really describe it sheer need touch basically and then like the end of the bed or is it like a hand was pushed out in the end of the bed\nI'm sure the cats in the house nope no cats I got the odds and house one dog hey you know it it was wasn't a wasn't dogs dogs and a lot upstairs and words and I saw there was no access wasn't our daughter\nSo it it just kind of varies the other morning I had\nA I was getting ready for work or I'd gotten up and a\nSix six thirty in the morning and I heard a lot of like a toy from whatever bedrooms um my my wife's office\nAnd like a singing like noise from a toy and I heard it twice and I thought maybe it was her I pat I thought maybe it was a toy left in there that was left on or something and then I look through the whole room\nIn her eye pad was in there but it was not on and I will feel it the whole room there's nothing in there my wife toward the rural part later ah there's nothing in the room that could have made a noise Irish ... got my attention to the second time actually so it was very odd to me um it just was weird\nIt the it is goofy but that is a ... and that's why they're coming that it it it would be for them to fight I can understand 'cause doesn't happen here every day this is not a good ... you\nKnow we all month or so on anything and then we get a numerous things will happen then it'll go away [noise]\nSo the things that do happen it takes ... whatever it is or what it takes quite a bit of energy for that to build up from them from ... whatever it is that they have to they have to build their energy up and it sometimes it takes time\nFor that to happen is that what they these are colonel most people said yeah um and it's kind of something that I've learned throughout time\nOkay so you've done some of your on your to investigate yeah I insist research I've done in research and better not investigate it yeah I don't and you don't investigate ghosts no research yup parents and it just takes time for them to build energy and ah so that's why they feel it goes in streets yeah it'll it'll go on strike 'cause my daughter has even talked about it a month\nOr so maybe it's building again could be I don't know it's all but the the it would be cool if it happens like him to catch something but I I don't I don't I don't know I mean we'll see what happens there but we'll figure it out and all keep updating and\nUm yeah it'll it'll be interesting to to see it it's cool or whether you believe in it or not it's just interesting to to see you\nAnd a lot of people if you don't explainable ... well that's just because if if you're a you're one of those people that don't believe it in and tell you actually see something yeah\nOr experience something ... I I was no trust me I I've gone out of my way to try to debunk or try to explain everything ... um to dismiss it now I Can't run you run out of thing I've run out of things to try to explain it and I can't I Can't\nDo it you're not at the point where it's you guys are scared or not we're not on the urine scared for your because you have a child you yeah you know you have a young daughter ... yeah you you are no there's no fear here or anything else you feel like there's a evil presents or anything like\nLike that and that's just hey I'm here notice me you know when it's kind of weight is with my daughter and you haven't but if you you've done some research we haven't been able to find anything as far as I can too many lenders are\nJust too many names Nineteen forty two is when the house was built and its many owners between now and although that's you know not not that old compared to some of these are the ... century homes you know it is not that old\nBut you can't find anybody in that and it's weird because the previous owners as mentioned anything to me about it okay and you have been able to talk to some of the well I mean it's one of them is a relative you know from my wife some guy they've never mentioned anything to us we bought it from Seoul and have you talked to them I haven't but I think that we I Know that they know about\nOh and have you talked to them I haven't but I knew that we I Know that they know about things that happened in our home okay we've talked about it and they've never mentioned anything or said hey I just happened to us or how long did they live there you know I'm not long okay\nShe could how long have you lived there before you had your first experience almost right away oh okay so that that there goes that idea emitted takes a while for it to happen but yeah the one of the previous owners of 'em and Ryan from budget his brother oh okay and the house okay and I\nI don't know if he knows about it or when I'm dealing with her I couldn't tell you [noise]\nInteresting I couldn't tell you interest and then of course we're getting closer to Halloween\nOh yeah that's always the big fear right someone's going to happen to her and make sure interesting geysers Asian yeah it does yeah well you would like is an ... I don't know if you're looking for answers but he looking for it'd be nice to know something random it'd be nice to know if there was something there or how was something there there's two questions one\nUh I Want to name if I knew the name from or whoever it is or why they're there and how do we get rid of it\nOr can they move on you know so it's kind of my ... year thought about holding a sense I'm not doing that they don't recommend that they don't know that could bring evil it could just open doors for things that no I really don't want to be part\nSo we'll we'll figure stuff all that that group actually does a lot of a cleansing and stuff like that within the home that can help us with that I had a pastor over there a river and I have not ... I'm not\nThat I don't think that that's kind of ... I mean we could we could clearly do that I mean but we're going to go with these guys I think of it if it's not evil a pastor there is and I don't do anything I don't know\nIf it's not even at this point I don't really think we need that okay I just need a couple of answers and then we can maybe cleanse the house with some rituals that they do that are very clean and\nA simple but yet a fact of and a ... whoever it is or whatever it is can move on I I don't know I'm not scared my wife isn't my daughter kind of as well not all of that happening because if you watch movies\nLike uh the the ... okay you know if you watch the movie you're always saying why do you stay there\nJust leave yup so if it was bad you'd leave but I don't know I I don't believe I think we found a way to get rid of it yeah it before I leave it's all about [noise]\nSolve all the availability to leave and money and catches up and leave a home and we're not we're not even close to that that were okay with it I mean it's not something that\nIs concerning and just not until my daughter\nDeals you know is freaked out every day and constantly talks about it and and this is becoming a concern we're getting touched\nAnd things are happening to her and then we're we had a problem but we're not even not even close right now as an arm and on of yeah whatever's going on is very nice it's just hey I'm here letting us know when will just keep it there and then oh the the group will come over and we'll we'll see if we can find on anything\nAnd I'll just keep everybody updated and\nI'm from there do you do you ah do you avoid watching you know\nI've watched home ... evil shows or anything like that whole day yesterday okay I see no huge fan I have no issue would say oh no no as you watch Ghostbusters a couple of times even then you get any more activity that are ...\nAll right I'll let you back to ... for the uh officer Ryan basket and we've talked to if you've been a listener the open my program uh we've talked about it when Ryan has been in a couple of times that this is just some some things a paranormal odd that happens in his house that he is they've watched him and his wife and as for a while and we talked about it so\nIt'll be kind of interesting thought we'll have more hopefully uh Brian ... is in next Tuesday on a legal to we'll get an update on that aren't as loving forty I came to refer to wrap up our show coming up and just woman had a back to west side motors coming up\nIt's another whole weekend for the faint forever ... friday and Saturday Night the red lake miners visit rousing anger that arena face off both nights and set for seven PM it's all weekend up fast paced intense S.

story about that coming up in just a second as well and case you're wondering the mega millions is over a billion dollars now about the change in the name\nYeah how do you make a billion yeah well no it wouldn't be still making millions and hasn't him billions single billion billion dollars ... billion that ... you know eventually but we get their own oil I'm sure one day we'll get to the point where you're buying your lottery tickets or twenty bucks a pop\nInstead of two dollars because you know what happened was the only in dollars every time or yeah because America is going to demand it wants to [laughter]\n'cause it used to be the Powerball was a dollar then I went to two dollars and and just recently the mega millions went to two dollars used to be a dollar but this last this year they went to two million or two dollars\nAnd that's why these keep escalating quicker quicker but will will people buy who will buy tend to dollar tickets by one twenty dollar ticket yeah well they yeah because I mean look at it look at how quickly they you know they'll they'll jump off they'll go to twenty two hundred two hundred and fifty three hundred four hundred billion\nI mean it wasn't anywhere near a billion four weeks ago it was just in the last three weeks we're just ... you know boom hundred million or two hundred million three hundred and it just jumped [noise] and I still think they it when it gets to a point they should they should have won jackpot when you're when apple back and\nThen how five hundred people win a million dollars you know all along I said they're doing it wrong if they hit a certain amount like you said like five hundred million than what they should do is just you have like a a an automatic drawing of like\nYou know just keep drawing numbers I tell ya ... given away five or however many right you know those numbers exist yep you do get to be computer software that can just spit out actual\nNumbers that were bought as opposed to numbers that were drawn yeah so\nThey think it's five hundred million nobody wins then five hundred people get a million and you just simply keep pulling out ... yeah yeah\nPeople would love that I Am so slowly yeah at the I don't care I only a million dollars would be better for\nThe economy in general to yes can you have a five hundred people only have a million dollars and after taxes they still have five six hundred thousand well actually if it's only a million they probably still have you know three or seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars you know because you're not going to get attacked the higher bracket\nWhat they take a chunk out it's a hundred and fifty thousand\nAnd if you are purchasing stuff than you know it's still a good deal it wouldn't be a great deal and you know that they have the technology they can do it now because right now they know every time somebody by the ticket the minute the Powerball is one they say and the ticket was purchased at Lenny used a surf ...\nBaton Rouge and being shot yeah they do exactly what time and when and where it was ... went to which whenever I buy my tickets I avoid the cameras\nI have a hat on [laughter] so that if they do they say yeah it was bought over at the same spot at or else they're at twelve or one on friday afternoon you'll see a guy wearing a baseball cap way down [laughter] walking away from the camera thank you and then just Turner won't go to the store because you don't want to be identified\nAlthough they can look back and see though is the same guy that goes there every day [laughter] I Would probably see it from another one\nThe U.S Mexico Mexicans in the U.S going to try to say that right U.S Mexico agree on plan to handle migrant caravan from Central America under the deal which

refugees established shelters along its southern border with Central America\nMexican a Basset or to the U.S a elaborated on the request for an interview with Fox News saying just today\nMexican Government and this is a very important step requested the intervention of the un the opposite of the high commissioner on refugees to help Mexico review any asylum claims from the members of the Caribbean\nDoesn't make sense is that the way it should be should be that way\nNature shouldn't have to be just for whenever we're at war right you don't correct they should be able to step in in a situation like this it's United Nations they have got peacekeepers they've got people that know how to deal with certain things\nFor four days miner team at\nThe very first year I had a budget of Twenty one thousand\nThat's not much that so much at all that's not much would that are only amount that the ... the authority to partner with already would give for the entertainment based on what they had done in years and years before that they never made a dollar on the entertainment and every one of those nights they never made any money\nAnd they were charged a couple of bucks to get in so the very first year he said fine\nWe will ah we were ... will do the Twenty one thousand will come up with something I got a junk happen to be around ban for Seventy five hundred bucks did you really yeah and they they were our our home run you know that was our Saturday Night teacher is a good Seventy five hundred though I'm already down you know what I mean that's one third of it for four days has gone\nDown day a young up and coming country singer had one hit on her sister station Prague eight Ninety nine point nine we got them for sixty five hundred\nIt's a lot of money for somebody who's only has one hit but they were hitting at the moment they rip as those coming through\nThe song became huge you as you know it was really it was a big smash yourself this is one time they are going to say they're going to sing all four days for them when they're singing one night it's just a one shot while and then plus we have to pay for some regional people to do with the opening X. ray so we've already blown over half our budget just on those two nights friday and Saturday So then we got\nJohnny homes and the beaver Rajani homes and you know you're traveling by show here\nAnd uh he was forty five hundred yeah and that was for a Thursday night and so we had Thursday Friday Saturday and then Wednesday we did kind of a local there's a a local band that came out and play the uh but that was the first year but the big deal as we didn't charge\nWe did in charge at all because we knew that if we get people to come to the concert they're going to drink and when they drink then we're going to make our money we did show well that first year\nThe target them with already gives a hundred thousand the next year wow so we upped it so we had thirty eight special we had lover boy we had a big like a ... country actor and so we were able to build it up\nAnd again oh rich Springfield we did reach wrinkle on a Thursday night\nDidn't charge Eighteen thousand people showed up\nWhile the year before on a Thursday night we had about Eighteen hundred people show up the year before that they had about two hundred people show up before we took over and started doing it\nSo not charging ending having some better entertainment\nWe got to Eighteen thousand people and they drank drank really well I had made so much money on it\nBecause after paying he was thirty grand for Springfield ban after paying that we still made a ton of money how much are thirty special and were they ... they were like Twenty one twenty two thousand hits it now because we've got 'em on a on a rotating you know that the other thing is you can get a good rowdy and we can get somebody on an update like on a Thursday night you know you'll you'll do much better but\nWe're talking about for the Ralph the problem exists with one the size of the Ralph how many people can you totally put in there and four thousand maybe\nYeah you you you you lose part of the bowl because you have a stage and you know but then you gain for your orbit or Europe for ... for four thousand forty five hundred and ... ... that's slightly bigger than the Fargo civic center used to be you know I Know they've done some changes but\nUh you have to get a certain act that\nFour thousand would be a good number to bring them in so when you're looking at the level of successful artist out there you can't bring in a Keith Urban they need Eighteen thousand minimum to attend and they're charging you a hundred hundred and fifty dollars a ticket for the high end stuff that I think the low end was\nFifty fifty Seventy five a hundred and sort of probably averaging around eighty now yeah yeah and we're talking Eighteen thousand seats they can do that and then they're going to sell you know their merchant are going to sell everything else\nSo for a show like this over at the end what I'm saying it can be done I'm not saying it's it's unheard of but\nYou need to do is you need to understand the the method so if the city wanted to put on some shows they could probably do really well because especially if they put a good show on\nAnd they track people from Grand Forks that aren't going to that same show there are people that are are fans of of talent and she'll be book that talent and they're not playing in Fargo Grand Forks or anywhere near maybe Minneapolis Winnipeg in fact if you get them on a ...\nIn Fargo or Grand Forks or anywhere near maybe Minneapolis Winnipeg in fact if you get them on a Minneapolis to Winnipeg tour and you're catching open night then you're going to get a much better deal but you need to get somebody significant enough that's going to drop\nBut then the second part of that you can't overcharge you over charge and it doesn't matter how significant they are people won't buy yep but at the end let's just say\nLet's just say thirty eight special game and it's going to cost you thirty grand bringing thirtieth special yeah get so if you had four thousand people there and you only charge for ah say ten bucks a pop your lose no you won't while the ...\nYeah but you're always that idea out yeah so you basically break even break even production costs to having the you know the sound in life and all that but you're going to make your money on the fact that it's packed with people buying food and drinks and all the other stuff\nThat's what that's what works you have to suck it up and realize that potentially going to lose a little bit of money on the band on that side but I Will make that money back and everything else on all the beers and all that other stuff salt\nAnd if you do it in the right way we're not going to do like some bands will do a say a band wants twenty thousand plus eighty five Fifteen split\nSo they'll take eighty five percent of the tickets after that twenty thousand and then you know you can work out these deals but you have to be willing to possibly lose a little bit of money on the back and where you're you're you're buying the talent\nThe hopes is that you pack the place and get four thousand really Thursday hungry people\n[laughter] laugh because the average concert goers will spend Fifteen dollars if they're going to a good concert Fifteen dollars between food and drinks the average so if you get four thousand people spending Fifteen bucks\nHello sixty thousand more on top of what you already did for the production that when ... and you've paid all your staff and everybody that's working there and you've been able to use the facility again and people in the community haven't had to drive all the way to Grand Forks for a show or Fargo or Minneapolis or what a big yeah\nPlus you the I liked the idea of using the facility 'cause you bring down costs when the war you something that the more you bring down costs to me you got to have lived on ... so I mean you might as well have something going on as long as you're going to have plumbing and electrical we might as well if you have something going on except for the security side but you you know after all production\nCosts yeah and if you don't think as a a city that you can do it yourself\nThen you higher production company you hire a promoter somebody like Jay Nielsen a long ago a friend of mine from years ago he's done so well he started off just doing little bar type of promotions and\nThen he would do any bench and they get a little larger little larger now he's all across Minnesota South Dakota North Dakota Montana Colorado He does shows\nIt's ... it's J. present jade present but he's an independent promoter you get somebody like that who will then come in and you go [noise]\nWe have this facility camp we have this facility and we want to start doing concerts on a regular basis will jeans a guy who's going to bring in the talent and he's going to pay production and all that\nBasically what you do you give him the building and then you take your cut off of the food and the drinks\nAnd so he has to pay for the newspaper all the actual staffing and the you know the police department and the the security and all that\nBut he knows that what is not is now that he's not paying for king you know a hundred or Fifteen hundred dollars for the building and plus this for electricity and heat and all that\nBut he gets part of the concessions you said then we'll know usually what you do is use use strike a deal saying we're going to take the percentage off of the the food and the drinks every day okay okay you're selling the tickets and you're going to get that and he might come back and say well I Want twenty percent of the beverage right you know but again\nIf he can put three ... three thousand people in for say\nA thirty eight special show or some of these younger and when he can do because he had the advantage of he's he's actually buying Eighteen dates ... he's taken it from Minneapolis to Sioux Falls South Dakota you know and the right down the strip and he's going into Bismarck or he's going to Rapid City South Dakota and he's going to\nAnd then he gets you on that tour then you get a date and sometimes it's not a Friday Saturday sometimes it's a Thursday and sometimes you know it might be a really great Saturday\nBut he's taking pretty much the most of the the the reliability yeah\nAnd you you're simply saying I'm going to let somebody use this room for the night\nAnd we hope to make much money on the food and beverage it's like I mean you might pay a little bit more for that than just doing it by yourself what it's like you're buying insurance by putting the risk on him you're probably giving a little bit more but it's almost like you're buying insurance against loss and that's how he's done it over the last ten years and that's how he's built is business because\nWhen he went to Rapid City and started using the ... city civic center that was the deal they made him basically will let you do this and we'll you know we'll take our back and\nAnd he's gone from city to city Sioux Falls all over the place uh Iowa down to Nebraska and he builds these relationships with these towns who have disabilities like bart we used to have the civic center and it was really undervalued people never used it and he finally got to you know a deal put into place and it just started building\nOnce ... once you got a couple of shows going he took off and he knows how to do the show he knows how to promote it knows how to to ah work to deal with the agents he knows exactly how much is expenses are going to be so he doesn't want to lose money at the idea [noise]\nIt was a top picture and she she normally looks you know a lot nicer and went together yeah\nUm so somebody's going to hear him\nSpeaking of that and I told you last week when a\nJolt came on and did his actors thoughts around you know you did this whole thing about it and this is Joel Heitkamp Joel Heitkamp again it's her you know that's his sister and right\nUm so he went on and you can call Kramer liar and he's just a bolt based liar and you can't trust him and blah blah blah and he went on an even think about at the time uh 'cause I talked to somebody just the other day about best from Fargo who works at that same station\nA and you know it was very very intelligent when it comes to news game like I say who it is but they said\nThat the problem they're going to happen now going forward is Kramer wins\nThey're not going to get very many calls from Kramer to be on the show yeah and you know it's also I mean it's already you know that they're kind of a democratic leaning station across the street WTY is more of a cause Arbor and yet on by the black family and all that\nBut when you do that in the face of a an actual election and you're supposed to be balanced and at least ... some type of a report\nWhen you call out of ... liar\nReally tough with that candidate then come on the air with you a couple of months later and go hey it's good to hear from your own yeah\nYou're going

Misha first Fifteen a three pointers because you know this what everybody said where's the three point shooting coming from and questioned it and it it really is ugly head in game one\nIt's certainly did now on the flip side if you want to be a a glass half full guy all eyes are going over Fifteen 'cause they ended up seven for thirty three so after starting over Fifteen they actually hit seven of their last Fifteen three I'm saying but my only thing is you don't want to hear that 'cause you Mr\nLeBron haters that the whole boat now you're you're not running away from the Hubble we got him a W credit for that in Cincinnati\nBoat especially when it comes to the Bronx and now the Lakers\nIf he that's his team so they get seven uh Fifteen that's almost fifty percent so may be but they're not going to be great\nFor the ... what does he want to be decent\nI'm going to discount them because when you start knocking down threes when the game\nIs already out of out of reach you just said what was the one oh what'd you say one on one on one hundred with about ... minutes to go to a lot of help get them back or keep them in the game\nAnd then and then uh I think if I remember correctly\nThe trail blazers jumped out to about ten eleven point and then they started making some best comedic close and then the trail blazers pulled away anyway my point is that going to be a ... I didn't think they'll abroad James and the second half he had three bad turnovers in the fourth quarter five in the whole right he ... he was passive\nHe only took five shots in the fourth quarter they came was around I don't know why and and twenty ... twenty six points in his\n... Eighteen and the first ... a poison and say who see I'm saying yeah and that's the part the lady that ought to take it over and he could at that game was there for the taken\nRight right well let me ask you this because after that game Brian said that look and he's right it's not instant oatmeal you know it doesn't come together right away is going to take some time restaurant rage Iran do the other veterans or you know accomplish veteran on the team he said\nWe have to be patient like teachers he told that to the undefeated so when I asked you Rob Parker is do the Lakers have time to be patient they are in fact in the western conference after all do they have time to be ...\nAh\nThe ravens just stacked the titans eleven times but the week before they lost to\nTo get the ... the ... that pod cast by searching out kicked the coverage and it's always you can hear out kicked the coverage we ... we have to say I'm a third three am Pacific right here on Fox Sports radio\nJunkie godly show\nDoesn't mean that ... that doesn't have value if you\nGraduate as valedictorian you get a better job than some dude that got seized for degrees and if you're the best college football player at Ohio State you end up getting a better a better job than anybody else but the idea that people watch college football because of the individual players is it Joe jog godly\nWendy's in during the um eastern\nHe's much more well rounded box fan mail or shall\nWe made some assumptions we pick the Thursday night game the cardinals and the Broncos assume the position that the\nCardinals would show up and try to can we assume positions rock show up and try to be a we were wrong he gave out erroneous information because the Arizona Cardinals are from a bunch of laws\nBent bowing nights at two AM eastern eleven pm Pacific Fox Sports radio play\nWhat the the the the big Michigan American ... independent tax will be twelve\nMid America and something about outbreak usa [laughter] your\nMind all of\nYour schools are wrapped right here\nIt's your college for Fox Sports radio ads that one\nMan\nTo find out fast one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com or details pass pass while\nShe I couple Chris Broussard ... around\nCar shopping can be confusing I Know I just bought a new car turnpike dealer price list price in voice\nWhat's true car shows you what you really need to know what is other people favor the car that you want that way you can recognize was a good price it was a bad price trust the brother when you're ready to buy a new or even a used car visit true car to enjoy more confident car by\n... and we always bring a celebrity interview you every Friday as this week\nOn celebrity corner is Michael Rapaport the great actor director author pod cast or you can follow him on\nTwitter at ...

so many reports coming out well first of all there there are actual things have happened Kyrie Irving left liberal\nPaul George didn't interview with the Lakers win the brown we wouldn't even be would magic and now there's reports Jimmy Butler\nOr collide littered don't want to play with the brown with the Lakers although we're we're not sure if that's true but those are the reports and then even a myth our guys are buddy over ESPN he says\nThat Damien Wilbur doesn't want to go play with the Lakers what do you make of this do you think this is true and if so what does it say that a lot of these guys are avoiding playing with the brunt\nExcept that not everybody wants to play with the regime that everybody wants to her not everybody wants to play we\nYou know on it for people you know there's some competitiveness left um I don't think it's like oh I Want to go with the ... you know not everybody wants to play with a guy that brings the circuits apparel not everybody wants to play with a

yeah you get two points but I think ... you could have done a lot better not\nYeah I think last weekend was obviously frustrating I think we could have easily had four points and you know in ... and kind of came in Iran can control the play and uh obviously we're battling the whole time and should have for sure when the second game but yeah to heartbreak hers and obviously the guy came in motivated this week to put it in good work and be ready for it and I\nSaid we've got a plane full sexy managed plays fifty nine minutes fifty nine point four seconds you know they score would lessen the second regular and regulation on the second game a that's a tough one because it's now you don't believe or another week\nYeah it was really tough to be honest uh obviously Monday Tuesday were pretty hard days for the guys obviously you know losing is unacceptable and especially at home in front of our fans and uh that was upsetting and I think everybody everybody was upset and you know
