much\nBecause immediately after the fire is put out and they began complaining again strong craving only if only we had me do when we were in Egypt we had fish that cost us nuts and bolts they went

even goes too far as to say the guard God just killed me\nSo that I don't have to do this and what brought a responded to his complaint guard gave him relief from the duties that he um\nWas

I picked the New York giants to win the FCC before the season I Believe\nYou guys will dial yeah as that I that I like diamonds seven the duck out running away without at viability\nWhile they're wanted for and it's not looking good I that is if you're a giants fan that loss on Sunday where you feel like you're in the game you feel like it's going your way\nYou feel like you're you're finally going to win a shootout you finally get oh del bathroom involved you've you finally start to see the often shine a little bit you get some creativity oh back um throws a touchdown pass it felt like the team was starting to figure it out\nAnd then you lose on a sixty three yard field goal not in a dome\nNot on on astro turf\nIn Carolina on that turf to end the game that is a rip your heart out disgusting feeling why watching an NFL game and if you're a giant fan that's one of those you don't watch sports for at least two days\nYou watch keeping up with the ... you watch total bellows total divas the food network the cooking channel diners drive ins in dives Monday Night raw\nBig brother something on Netflix shameless a Deadliest Catch whatever you can watch that isn't football related where you're not going to be reminded at what an awful last that was on Sunday that's what you do that was terrible for the giants\nYeah all the way round though a a better performance just not good enough and and that's the problem with this giant Stevens [noise] I I don't know that they're good enough to win many games on the road ... they're tough matchups at home they're looking at how this came went like I just\nThey're not they're not the team that I thought they were going to be and I think there's a large part due to the library you know you don't be I hate putting on a one player I don't believe football is is always about one player they built from a team sport um so I hate doing this\nBut man he is just the shell of himself and that's saying something because he hasn't been that great in his career in the regular season about posting zero high you know what a mess with them okay ... what he gets there he can turn it on now but regular season Eli is is average and he's playing below that so far this year\nBut even post season Eli outside of those two Super Bowls that he wanted which isn't which is great I mean that's awesome and it may one day get 'em in the hall of fame\nOutside of those two years he's never won a playoff game he either wins at all or she loses the first game it's a it's a weird\nBut that's just been sort of a microcosm of his career that he has these these big wild swings in these ups and downs and being in New York there's no worst place to be a guy like that because you're just going to get pounded on by the media all the time now\nOld out back him did an interview with ESPN over the last couple of days and snippets of the interview of come out and\nThe first one that came out was friday evening to wear ... questioned the heart of the New York giants a question why can't we throw the ball twenty yards down the field so on and so forth another piece came out on Sunday when he was asked about whether or not\nHe blames Eli Manning or do you I Manning's fault he said I don't know\nSo pat Sherman responded to it on friday he said well I Believe it's more of an execution thing\nWhich is basically we're giving you the right place you're just not do it in the right way so you had this back and forth going into the game and it looked like\nThrough all of that you were going to win the game and instead you lose on a sixty three yard field goal so old out Beckham was talking with the media afterwards the interview he did with ESPN and the criticism he gave his teammates and possibly as coaching staff was brought up and here was the post game without outback him\nFrom living with you on them and asked you for Boehner says I don't think they have a report you have either do it on my heart honestly ... there's been all my heart\nAnd it had been on my ...\nIt had been on my heart [noise] um and I think all of those both of his father just kind of came out on the wrong way I'm In touch with him and I asked if I can have a minutes\nTo talk to the same um because we don't we don't if we're not on the same page if there's not a finish your real and we can all understand each other and there's going to always be with your fish so I'm able to do that was big for me I was nervous to get up there and and\nAnd these are your brothers and you see every day but once it over there in front of all of them a little nervous so I'm\nJust excited about the way we are supposed to go to the um like I said we came up short but we refer to the don't\nRegret anything medicine if it if it could fit for us to come together as a team like we did a a cigarette every single time\nSo ready that was the recap there's this comments afterwards your takeaway is what\nMy my takeaway is he's frustrated um I think we do this is only a matter of time right like getting his contract was one thing but still ... is a competitor\nAnd I think he's frustrated with the the lack of their team's ability\nTo get on the ball even though today now that wasn't the case I mean he was the leading wide receiver got targeted fourteen times you know twice as much as the next guy so he can't be that frustrated with that I mean and and held there if given the opportunity to throw a pass for a touchdown which might I add\nThat is probably the single most telling staff of the season when you have a wide receiver that has the longest I've ever catch now\nI Know of usually\nAnd da Vinci were on a mission to help veterans get the benefits they burn\nI'm a veteran and my victory was finishing my education\n... offers veterans of all

Cowboys five and a half minutes to go in the first apple keep you posted on on that game as it develops throughout the course of the game\nI'm let's talk Green Bay Packers Brady\nUh this is another team that I had them going to the super bowl\nI did I Will I Will take full responsibility for that awful pick because as it stands right now they seem like they are all over the place you got Mike mccarthy you've got Aaron Rodgers maybe taking shots at each other in the media very very frustrated Aaron Rodgers seems like he's finally getting around\nEighty a very very frustrated Aaron Rodgers seems like he's finally getting around to being a hunt or at least close to a hundred percent based on you know being off the injury report for the first time this past week but still the Packers seem lost out there on oftentimes\nIt's crazy to me too how like Jimmy Graham just hasn't been a more integral part of their office\nI'm ... and think about this like as much as we were talking about the the Green Bay side of this look not Patricia now after that week one blowout plus if you are chips with the rookie quarterback Sam Donald his first start on the road after that performance they've kinda figured it out they've got a subtle did\nThey beat the New England patriots Tom Brady they've beaten Aaron Rodgers the Green Bay Packers now and I think\nYou have a radio nine or game they probably should have won the nine or ... that would they were close to that game on the road after that Monday Night game\nYeah and and I think this is a team that's by no means you know complete as far as what they're they need on the roster to ultimately be competitive but I think as much as it's telling about how the Packers look so far early on 'em and just you know again like\nThey're making a more concentrated effort of getting Jimmy grab involved I just I don't see them having the same type of impact like isn't he was he supposed to be the Jodi Nelson cut to ten touchdowns you know per year type guy especially the red zone where they'd end up you know throw high pointing I'm just throwing us some jumped balls letting them high point the football\nYeah it's it it feels it feels off at this point like there's something about it that's not working I just I I Wonder about Jimmy Graham um\nIs she a little overrated do you think as far as what we ... is is is the potential greater than maybe what he really is because I think we look back on and when we think about those years in New Orleans when he had Ninety nine catches and he had a eighty five or more catches in consecutive years three straight years\nBut since then he's never come close to that um he went to Seattle that was supposed to be like a big pickup for the sea hawks and I remember him getting injured one year\nAnd he just he's not he's not been close to that and I just wonder if maybe we over value what Jimmy Graham really is maybe a ... our expectations of them just on a reality at this point\nI think it's two things I think it's hard to replicate what a lot of guys doing and playing with Drew Brees sharp pain\nIn the system in New Orleans that's hard to replicate and then the other thing is she never developed I mean you could say what you want about ... that fit into his category that are largely a ... a wide receiver first before they become like that guy who can really block\nBut I remember playing with killing winds blow out a lot of point in his career in Cleveland and then later on with the jets\nAnd one thing that I I think she came to the realization of was you know he needed to improve it is blocking and he might not be the guy that you're going to run to his side right if you got to tighten set one on each side he is not the guy you gotta wonder that side but it'd be much better on the backside cutting off\nAnd and he realized that there's other examples of that too I think as far as the guys like him Sonia gates who was a former basketball player much like Jimmy Graham who is is a better what blocker pass pro which they typically never use them in God's protection\nTravis Kelsey that you brought up earlier\nRight and then even him he's you know progressed I think of as a run block or you know that's something that we've never really seen from Jimmy Graham\nAnd Seattle was the best example of that because that was an offensive in a system that I think had he fit like what they're doing now will this lead\nHe could have been really productive he probably would have had a good amount of touchdowns maybe not as many catches and yards as they don't throw it quite as much but if you would have had a lot more protection that way and it just it never really fit with what they're trying to do and and that's where I'm curious to see if it's going to fit with Green Bay only because you know they're not run into football well\nAnd and I kind of look at what they do want to utilize the tide ends it typically is in play action pass it typically is sometimes some of that those that do the action and all that\nAnd you know if she mean Graham can't be that type of guy that could do any of that stuff to me it's just it's not as valuable as just a guy who's got tremendous size right because they've got some other tall wide receivers now too that they can they can kind of put it to the mix who are much faster getting down fields\nHere was Aaron Rodgers following the Packers lost in Detroit on Sunday\nYeah it was a couple couple of real bad ones you know I gave him a ...\nYou know we missed the rules honestly and turn over on the one you're online you put on together [noise] that's a lot of points we gave him a mismatch opportunities are definitely just running game not funding from the blood off ramps and not a ... and\nLet me ask you how many times when you were playing football or maybe even do it now to where you look at as our team is currently constructed or you look at the office they run and do you think damn I Wish I had that\n[laughter] [laughter] it's probably an obvious question because you're playing around [laughter] and I think about it [laughter]\nAll right so every single day okay [laughter]\nOh man uh yeah [laughter] that's the hardest thing or is is you see a lot of quarterbacks you look around the league in look we talked about a guy early like Matt Ryan that Ryan has had pretty much you know everything for the most for since he's gotten to Atlanta\nUm he's he had Ronnie White he's had Julio Jones now for quite some time Tony ... and do what's that Tony Gonzales Michael\n... turn or a bacterial the line's always been pretty solid the divisions gotten better especially defensively but with that their defense got better their old line got better um [noise] you dropped out like a democracy Freeman in the backfield seven Coleman or you got all these options and now they got Calvin originally\nAnd it's like you know he's always kinda had that that really perfect scenario everything else around him and when you look at this year and then\nNow really being challenged because they're missing some pieces on defense that he's got to win the football games\nIt just is is not really able to do it and I think that's where\nI always come back to this quarterbacks always get more credit they deserve when they win and way too much blame when they lose right because ultimately they don't have as big of an impact as everyone thinks it I I Swear it it's always a team sport it's always about what you're about around you\nUm the other thing is of course Aaron Rodgers is aware of what are the teams are doing and what's going on\nIn the NFL every single week as a quarterback you go and do you watch other teams and you kind of goes through their system who had a big performance you didn't like I I can guarantee you this\nEvery single team every quarter back room on their off they on Monday or a lot there off the day after the game\nThey're going to come and they're gonna wash Kansas City they would've what India.Arie joy to watch this patch homeless guy I can guarantee you that and even sometimes watch some some college too to see what other plays and things they can steal your also the ethical to copycat league for that reason\nSo he's well aware of what works in it the other\nOne other teams that other systems is well aware of all of that and that's probably the frustrating part is that why can't we do more of this\nAnd the one common denominator now that the ... coordinator they got rid of his quarterback coach probably bad poll right the one common denominator has been Mike mccarthy so because of that you know I I think you're sitting there probably saying to yourself\nOr that's where the frustration comes from is they made all these changes that he was not dealt with\nAnd he was upset by and they're still getting the same result and it's it's not really him it's the fact that they don't do enough creative things off ads they'll get other guys open or do some of the things that everyone else is doing and then I fell right now\nAnd it makes sense like people can look at Rogers and say he's being you know he's being spoiled or he's being a a prima Donna but to me it makes a lot of sense when you see other people\nWith a bunch of nice things and you can afford those same nice things and you you have the capability of doing that and you could probably get away with a lot more because of how good Rogers is but you're not and you look so stagnant like if you watch the Green Bay off ... compared to Kansas City or compared to the rams or even if say a team was not as\nGood as any of those teams offensively\nI'm telling it looks outdated it looks like we've been seeing the same thing over and over again and I just I I don't know if if it's Mike mccarthy just so used to having Rogers that he didn't feel like he needed to add that many elements to it\nBut man the clock is ticking I mean getting up there right I mean how many more ... can McCarthy get before the ... the organization says\nHey we're wasting an all time talent here we've got one Super Bowl appearance to show for it and and the prime of his career is starting to slip by us and also he's getting injured every single season I just wonder when they're going to pull the trigger on it\nYeah and this this may be a decision where like number one we saw the the Broncos move on from John Fox and they brought and Gary Cooper back and it's like well John Fox got to a Super Bowl or I did it when it with the ultimately knew they needed to make a change if they were going to get back to when when one and and that's the decision that they made\nAnd obviously like as successful as Mike mccarthy has been you got a wonderful organization like Green Bay or accustomed to that than they are measured by lumbar to use if that that goes through their mind like much like with the cancer the chiefs movie out for our Smith is there were like well we we've won that division\nWe've been to the playoffs is now about trying to get through a Super Bowl so yes we know we can be successful ... much like the Pakistan with by McCarthy\nWhat do we make a change to go to Patrick homes 'cause we're still like we have a higher silly do they make a change and go with another head coach 'cause if I thought to have higher ceilings\nBrady ...

folks to live anywhere in the country but there are so good at avoiding responsibility for the implementation and the results or their policies\nAre so good at blaming everyone but themselves\n... will black folk ever look at themselves and say look at our status\nOr do you have to lose whatever they'll get themselves in Los Angeles Chicago Cincinnati New York and saying wait a minute we have lousy education systems\nWe have no job creation we're rampant crime rapid abortion rampant welfare and the Democratic party's been here for fifty or sixty years and it's amazing to me you're going to have such little results blaming everyone else to take no responsibility like Maxine Waters\nAnd that could probably here that the isn't going to get better for them until they do take a look at themselves and so they have responsibility for their own lives and until they realize that the Democrats have been lying to them for Seventy years or so\nAnd uh they never intended and they never were doing the same for them\nThey don't want them better they want them brainwashed jumped out at a more live because that's how you control them you can't control a more personal and more people you have

that most of us will go into a hypnotic trance and walk right into the voting booth and vote for the Democrats that's why they keep using that and it's not going to change it till the glass take responsibility\nAnd until white people stop being afraid of the phony words black suffering not because a lot of racism but due to the lack of moral character the destruction of the family and living on a supporter of the Democratic plantation bill\nWell you know in Chicago ... was a young man\nWho was threatening large numbers of people with a knife they didn't know at the time he was with PCP which is a crazy drugs and then he was shot by cop who made a mistake the cop should not a shot him the way he was shot he was kind of walking away from the ... made a split second life and death decision\nThat was wrong cops are taught than if somebody has a knife within Twenty one feet of your being it takes less than a second for them to take a knife and stab you\nSo now it looks like one life in Chicago can be misused\nTo advance their political agenda which has said cops\nAt the same time seven hundred Americans living in Chicago will be dead this year four thousand are going to get shot and including out boy putting a barrel and put on fire there is no marching no protests milk can scream and holler none\nAbout the little boy and a barrel who wouldn't joined a gang and that that's like moves on but if you can find years ago and she got that may made a mistake that becomes the fundraising tool\nAs a matter of fact when there's a black or white or black cop or white or black situation they celebrate that they love it when that happened because it open up to as you just said is open up opportunities for fundraising\nThey can accuse white people making a lot and just see the black and white people and it's all for the purpose of more power and wealth for themselves they don't care about black people they don't care about why people they don't care about illegal aliens they don't care about their children\nThey care about gaining power and wealth and so that's why they jump on those type of situation pushed it alive that the cops are covered by the police brutality\nAnd they support a a like a cabin or a cat for they can put the dog to a deal and then turning their backs on the fly around the country are at the football games because they want the far right there that is why Republicans but it's about power\nAnd wealth for the Democratic party and no one else\nWell Jesse you and I have a lot more yesterdays in tomorrow's yes and uh I like to engage of us from Cincinnati in from Los Angeles has some minimal impact\nAnd the lives of those who might want to listen and change in in Los Angeles is now overrun with illegal aliens which hurts black folks can you tell us in Los Angeles I see a little bit in Cincinnati but in Los Angeles Chicago Memphis New York what is the status of African Americans in relationship to illegal aliens from Mexico\nIt's devastating if the world really knew how destructive is over there uh in South central LA like cops in watts\nIt will be here as they would you mind that the the the police officer the government do something illegal alien gang members of upcoming and have come in for number one they're taken away day labor day job some blacks who can't get rid of the job because they're not educated don't know how to go out there do or\nBlacks who can't get rid of the job because they're not educated don't know how to go out there do or the virus and drugs and the crime that has crossed the borders into south central LA is beyond\nA word is devastate a lot of blasts leaving south central LA they moved back to the south they move into a Oregon an average donor place like that they're looking for a safe haven because Maxine Waters and the black leadership over there would not do anything about it\nAnd the media and others are given a false impression\nThat blacks or Hispanics are getting all alone they're not they hate one another they hate the fact that these people coming in and taken over their schools and neighborhoods and jobs to it so bad that at one point to blow the trip to the law has joined forces to fight against gay members\nBecause they they are supported by drug laws from Mexico\nAnd the other thing and the Los Angeles school system is a hundred of Nineteen different languages and dialects yes\nOne cannot function in an environment where every student\nWho is speaking a different language or dialect is entitled to under federal law that if a person that they're said to translate everything happening in class one can imagine the chaos\nWhen you're in a classroom at thirty to forty students thinking maybe twenty or thirty different languages in which no one has understood in behavior in norms are not followed and mom and dad don't exist at the home front to back up the teacher yeah that's the one that's the reason black folks are being decimated Los Angeles\nAnd and I you know I work with a lot of black kids from those areas and a lot of them and just dropping out of school because they say that\nThe teachers are put into focus on the one that cast the events they put it into focus more focus on illegal aliens and they are the citizens\nAnd so and the parents are not paying attention because most of the kids\nAre coming from single pair hold a black women who were born in America those who are born in this country\nSeventy seven percent of their children are born out of wedlock so they don't have parents who are paying attention and the kids are feeling I Lived in ... at home and I ask who they're just drop it out and hardly a day goes by where there's not a fight between illegal aliens\nAnd the and the black kids there so it's a real it's devastating to because I Can't find or just random\nUrine educated men maybe a lot of self taught like I Am but I cannot imagine being a black kid in Los Angeles or Chicago or Memphis or Denver Cincinnati or New York here sixteen years old\nYou have no functional family you know you're a functionally illiterate you can't go to high school because you're kicked out or don't learn the damn thing nothing is being taught\nYou have no job future you have no capability of forming a permanent relationship with a woman and getting married having a family and having your own property

the big thing is Wednesday or this Wednesday Wednesday the fish talking of wall eyes\nThis will be our last stocking effort this has been going on for three years studying oh yeah I Do the properties in the spring and the wall eyes in the fall\nSo we're going to be putting between twelve hundred and fourteen hundred six inch walleye finger links center in the river in a river all cool and then next year the DNR as told us that they're going to take over the stocking effort so they are so we'll pursue that permit application and the paperwork\nUm that goes along with that so that that continues into the future yeah without us having to big people to buy a raffle tickets [laughter]\nThat's a lot while I Do yeah yeah\nAnd we hope that you know a lot of them we we already know that the crops are growing in an era that got a fourteen ... which is a substantial property during the alliance pushing to ask her big crappy there was no reason for him to keep it and bring it in because of the tournaments that they have is\nThe biggest ... biggest northern and biggest other yeah while you're going against a catfish and I'm ... so the little crappy at fourteen and scrappy wasn't going to win anything now so most of us feel that schedule stuff back but it just shows that the that age group there their inner yeah\nYou know maybe they're not in big numbers but that all takes time you know one one pair of a crappy is can produce a thousand little ones so really\nWow but then the northerners take their share you know yeah\nI don't think I'll be out of the wall and when you put them in their six ... six inch on your side that's how much they grow in one calendar is six inches six inches at him they start out as a little little bitty\nIt's just you know when\nThey start out as a little little bitty fry yeah yeah and they grow the six inches the first year\n\nWhat would what would eat while I think early northern northern bass I'm really whatever so darn it [laughter] there's

Oregon they're yeah\nThey're um yeah so\nA while and and I don't know what the scores have been like so far they are but that he'll he'll somebody Dolly hope all game no doubt that very much so\nSo again that's a big game uh and and certainly as again to keep on the or our team to keep them I think they're ranked Fifteen through sixteenth nationally yep ah last week so even and put up fifty points again last week's\nTop quality a competition here a pioneer football team on the road that this Saturday Saturday I'm at home next Thursday Afternoon and the Thursday Afternoon that there will be I mean we can All right hand that their final game of the regular season\nAnd that is I tap sky race that's correct or Thursday Afternoon in three is a mess October Eighteenth so I keep in mind a pioneer volleyball team out of that had a good weekend you know and and the and it's nice to see that after you losing the central lakes on Wednesday they came right back in the hands strung out him\nUnimportant they have those outings although the gathering on Saturday wasn't as strong as a coach normally would've liked or they'd be remaining three on friday night and then played Mousavi\nWould've liked a beat remaining three on friday night and then played methodically on Saturday and that game with ... on Saturday really was for pretty much second place ... going into the uh the post season which is just around the corner for them as well\nAt least a few weeks left but just around the corner and banned him winning three too but they did the hard way they lost the first two sets [laughter] and then had declined back and winning but they beat Mousavi for the second time this year\nSo as long as they can continue and get their wins over a over here being in and day\nThe teams that they have left to play yet they have a full week off now see this was supposed to be there a week to play find lack again and we ended up not feeling a team so they end up with a whole right in the middle of their schedule and have some time off before they play again\nOr maybe the time of year you don't want them certainly are\nWell coach coaches are always okay with practice weeks where you can recover health wise players eat these weeks because even goes ... Saturday morning when I talk to her on the phone from where they were over in ... in Virginia\nSaid to me she said yes she said I haven't been real real happy with our conditioning so when you use some of the time to come in and I went oh there's the word the girls want to hear what he wants to hear that that's not something the players want to hear this time of year is condition\nI it really nice to see 'em a players get recognition\nAnd the uh both minor football team and the buyer volleyball team have had players who have gotten on not only am I yeah but but national and international I commissioned a brand new lawyer recently there was a pioneer volleyball team was we play or the week for the conference you know and\nI before that Carlin cash was not only play or the week for the conference but for the national yeah and that that same week I think Craig Wills the pioneer quarterback was national player of the week\nSo I have some some nice accolades are and um I guess a testament to the quality and the level of which are programmed gleaned absolutely and I I quite frankly when I'm I'm a little surprised and I and I say that but I don't get out there as much as I should either\nBut it's a really a top quality game at the even at the junior college level much quicker much sharper in most cases and pretty entertaining a fans haven't had a chance to take any of their football volleyball or during the winter one of the wrestling or one of the basketball programs or try to get out there\nFor people who are skilled in that caveman mode of always junior college boards uh you haven't been the level of play is very high\nAids very intense I in football it's extremely physical or for the most part the volleyball game is fast yeah I and you get a chance to Saturday I didn't put this on our schedule cause I forgot about it\nUm and I apologize coaches I forgot about it but it's got to camp visited with me Saturday morning on coaches corner there first meat of the year is a Saturday afternoon wow how do they have that angle legends do all they have or they wrestle against former alumni who come back\nAnd this will be an opportunity for the pioneers to get on the mat for the first time and get the kinks\nLoose it up so to speak a very different pioneered by wrestling program this year\nIf everybody was there and right now they're not because there are three or four the guys that are football players including hunter roller who was a national qualifier last year um they would have twenty guys and the real wow which is a much bigger numbers than normal\nAnd they have a legitimate shot provided everybody stays healthy and some of the way it's kind of a filter themselves out they have a very real shot to feel the full lineup\nTop to bottom starting a hundred and twenty five and going all the way the heavy weight\nAnd that's the first time going into the sea and they've been able to say that\nI they've got some some familiar names as a young man for free Z on the team and we all know freebies wrestling now like now are there are two former the river falls wrestlers hunter roller who courses from Warren but wrestled for the river falls\nOr on the team and and another uh another former pro wrestler as well giving them to both of whom may nationals last year so they have some leadership back that wrestling pretty high level but this could be\nYou know as a potential to be one of the best served not be a ... not the ... most of the bass line up the pioneers of a report on the maps and say ... rather than\nYou know what you really is only a few years old now right but when you can start a UC that growth where you can start to feel the polls full team all of a sudden\nWell then you add to that that there is a former pro wrestler who is now a coach to camps assisting you remember the name Kevin ... you mean K ... so there's some experience there I Know one of the kids he got in was it I think he said to time state champion North Dakota\nSo got some good getting good bond and a\nAnd you know you knew your program starts to make a name ... ... people a a young athletes looking you know whatever specific education they're looking for in a chance to continue to wrestle and a great opportunity ah you're north one too yeah and that and that all factors in ... and it does\nA lot of things going on locally we're going to take a quick break and when we come back we're going to talk more about uh oh some of the regional and national sports again if you'd like to China here Floyd chime in on the pizza tax line at six eight one twelve thirty back with more sports monkeys in a moment [noise]\n\n\n\nLet me ask you should we rented wandering some home improvement warehouse\n\nHello we want\nLie I've thought defensively in particular they played much better this week than they have in the last couple\nYou know they they converted fumble into a touchdown or they\nPut a lot of pressure on Carson went so although I thought Carson sell them as a game on along I I think he did too but they put a lot of pressure on Carson went think created\nSome situations that warned not to just stand back there and wait for a receiver to break open I I think\nThey changed their ... enough where Carson once was able or had to get rid of the football quicker than he did early in the game right you know they they made adjustments so that that he is you know was a quake three step drop or a quick\nA slam pattern rather than than spending time because there was no time in the pocket the the biking certainly a game that I saw I thought I saw graphic one time\nAnd a half time of twenty eight passing plays when's had been sacked three times you know every every time you know Hanna came out and came out to like twenty out of the twenty eighth race plays a somebody who was on his face so\nI think the Vikings played much better than they have the last two weeks I still think they have a ways to go there and they're run game now Devin cook did not play again no but they're run game is anemic at\nBest ... that's ... yeah and it's going forward\nAnd what is the balance of the NFL teams there's plenty of games to play they've only got five sixteen\nBut going forward they're going to have to find more of a run threat consistently if they're going to be the elite team they hope to me\nYeah ah they'll they'll need more of the complete package I think are cousins has proven that if he stays healthy ... of the football and ... the hangs on the football but he can deliver the ball and we are between ... and feeling and even um [noise]\nWhat's his name caught the ball will yeah general against ... now that he's got a little pressure he's got a few bombs well although they haven't been down field my view and then they're gonna feel go get her doing twenty in\nWhile I apparently it was not a good day in the NFL for people go there was a lot to do that so that's a that seems to me something\nDid you did you watch any of the Green Bay no no I did not be the Green Bay kicker who's been in the league twelve fourteen years whatever and has been one of the more reliable ... the league\nHe missed one wide right he's going to run off the off the ... are we missed one why left doing thrown off the right up ... minutes wide right and then later in the game during an extra point out the letter of radio think\nDo you think that um I Know I Know kicker is getting into their own had you know uh when things go bad\nBut do you think ... can get into somebody else's had to I mean when they see what happened to the ... early in the season oh I think there's some of that um that in the back of your mind every time you strike the ball [noise]\nI I think there's some of that but he was scrambling so much even changed kicking shoes now button to say the kicker is are there they're like they're all dinners and football yeah well that's that's a good way to put it very superstitious blot there's been like ... people\nOn the ah the one thing I and I don't ... immediate just me and my perception I mean I don't ... watch\nA lot of NFL I I see more Vikings when I watch a ... it seems like we've forgotten how to tackle sometimes uh if people are and they're throwing bodies of people rather than tackling um and what shouldn't be a\nShort gain or a law that ends up being a big game because somebody who's not actually ...\nThis form tackling you saw Twenty years ago you just don't I should you yeah absolutely but\nEverybody's looking for that when a high impact highlight reel type tackle and because of it they are launching themselves they're reaching they're they're trying to do something special on every play\nAh I had a coach years ago you know these kinds of gave you played for a guy like this the the old style hard nosed and and my coach used to say if you make the right play the great play will come if you try to make the great play you're probably going to get beat\nAnd there's some truth to that he said if you do what you're supposed to do with a great place will happen on their own because you're doing what you're saying how to do them you know and there is some\nTruth to that I Am just seems that there's a lot of a walk in and that is a lot of speed ... last very fast you'd very fast but there are a number of even yesterday there were a number of planes that initial contact was made\n'em you know and if the other guy keeps them street he's still got you don't buy more yards or ... yards or you know where it's or if you just\nGrabbed on I caught the very end of the end of the uh Dallas and Texans game last night in overtime and at the top receiver for the taxes and a tie game\nDallas had a chance came down didn't get\nThe feel of all the ... and the Texans came back Houston or trying to get into feel a little rain to win the game\nAnd they hit I think it's the Andre Hopkins as their top guy he literally carrying a ball in one hand like a loaf of bread running down the football field\nEvery time he feels contact company ... puts it back out on one hand again\nAnd he's gone away from three four maybe five guys and ended up on one play putting them in the field goal range they ended up winning the game it was a great play in a phenomenal run after catch on his part but there were a whole lot of guys from Dallas when they look at the film today\nTheir coaches can be saying what happened [laughter]\nThat's a fine line that lie yeah how do you let that go you know ... million and I ... players are the young players are looking for big plays\nA certainly but a man you gotta make that tackle that open field tackle which has become a lost art form Oh absolutely absolutely had been in the end when it happens is you end up making somebody else\nOn the highlight reel yep you're on the menu on you didn't uh wrap 'em up I before we move on we're going to take another break your on sports monkeys again you can join the

[noise]\nAnd we we don't know what else goes on or what else lender best if there was\nYou know bad blood already between the news director on the reporter and that could be this one of the final straw that broke the you know but uh you know when we go on and public even even for Katie RIF radio we we have this unexpected expectation\nThat we'll see how we all act in public you know\nWhere we aren't we aren't going to go up there wearing\nAnother radio stations T shirt\nAnd moved to a public event sure but if you did I wouldn't have a problem that no no but but mark and I went to a new we wouldn't do that sure if that's the way we we've been brought up in the business we represent our station in public absolutely no I'm a ... but then there are no written rules either you know we don't have any written rules like\nThat no if you were working and you were doing that though yeah pretty down yeah but if you went to I say\nI'm ... and he was having a a a rally yeah and you showed up there and you ah through on a baby in a baseball cap or working or am I just there to just there you're hanging out you know you in the ... side of the rallying decide hey I Want to go check it out and somebody gave you a cap and said what do you think you put it on so we took a picture of you\nI don't care you're not on our feet methane showing it you're not on the radio talking about you know this person you just happen to be there that would be different you know I\nAgree with that I agree with that so if you did see a like at that debate ... at that debate let's just say there was one of the candidates that you've always been a fan of and you happen to be the uh you know holding one of their little flags you know even though you're off camera you're representing the radio station\nYeah we probably have a conversation the next day but you wouldn't be fired over it yeah it was harder reaction\nAs well as harsh but I Wonder if there were things that led up to it\nThey're usually are you know they don't they don't say that there's there's nothing in there or was it because of the picture was an historic trip\nIn that well you know you know and that could as the light of the state's biggest sure newspaper but here's the thing to as an employer you know they they fire him but as an employer there's certain regulations you can't then go in the median started telling everybody the other reasons why you let them go no\nYou know well this has been a long running a feud between the him in the company and\nAnd he's constantly been pushing the bounds and we we keep telling them don't do it and finally it got to the point where you how many times can we tell you to stop doing this wrong stop doing it before well that that might be the deal they may have said before you leave this morning now remember don't take half way where all the calf right now\nAnd then he's again yeah I mean I Do and I'm not\nAnd there could have been other things around but as a company you can't really report on that [noise] so [noise] I just think if this was that if this is the only reason why they reacted than they will take a quick break the news when we come back the last half hour a team twelve thirty on Italian [noise]\nI think she's by doing what she's doing I really do the only thing is I don't think she needed a call out the other one and say that she's not voting to say who you're voting for that if you really want to say that go I'm voting for Cooper and Merle is or wherever the other person is you don't have to then you know cause in her statement she basically and and I don't know if this is\nTrue Russian making matters she's giving her reason he was a reason for that her reasoning is is making the other person's say they that they don't they don't respect different races or different nationalities and\nAnd I don't know if that's true or not you know to make a statement like that team so harsh I ... I I Would agree she has every right to make a statement she does but whether or not as good for a career I don't know I don't know I wasn't I Am somewhat on the same political pain I was surprised there are things happening in this world\nThere are things happening in the ... I thought I thought ... was the only thing they were happening in the world here for the last two weeks and there's a whole bunch of other news because CNN and Fox has got all of a sudden there are people ... people missing there are storms yeah\nAnother oh yeah yeah and all that stuff no it hadn't been going on until suddenly cabin I was a confirmed and then think okay let's move on yeah there there was a slight moment where people thought this was just going to be crazy how many\nPeople are going out protesting and I'm very concerned with the whole process now yeah after after the fact you know it's just think about this\nRegardless you were a Democrat Republican libertarian wherever you are you should be outraged that this process finished and then as soon as it was officially done I mean even during the voting process they had a people that we're we're getting loud and and you know and try to stop the process\nAfter this was all over they still had to protest and people were blocking streets in Washington D. C. those people should be arrested and they should have a a record because of what the you can't do that if you and me all of a sudden we want to just go block the street down in\nFront of a a ... we've we've got a good look at them new Justice Center\nYes of course we'd be through and like okay you do last warning no belong there were protesting no no we won't go and then we get arrested in put in jail\nBut you get several hundreds of people that were pushed onto a bus and shop to all the way down from wherever they were and they go there and regardless of what was going to happen there we're going to rally and then they all go on there and over and over again in ... I have a lot of respect for him and I have three sisters have a daughter\nThe listening these people talk about um you know how outraged the art that a person that was simply accused not convicted not even hadn't even gone to court and I mean none of that stuff that happened was accused and the FBI did a bunch of different investigations and nothing was there was not enough information to go on\nAnd they were still outside calling this person the worst person they how do you do that if you don't have any ...\nThere's there's ulterior motive at all and there was no longer just that one thing it's\nAnd they're saying and during the ... again much respect for women but during these speeches are saying I hear you and and the people of America in this decision you know basically are saying that women don't matter what\nThey're saying there wasn't enough evidence that he was never charged there was nothing he's now going to be a Supreme Court justice yeah that's all they're saying\nAmerica's not saying that women are unimportant and then we we don't believe anybody that's been sexually abused you know of course not quite the opposite but you can't do that you can't lump all they need to the fact that he was now you're talking about the ... percent\nOr more of the Senate confirmed it yeah right yup fifty to fifty to forty eight right Fifteen Percent or more I mean ... to abstain show you know\nSo the fact that they did the the protests and then the fact that the police just let it happen rest people I don't care getting their tear gas is turns you know spraying rubber bullets whatever you got to do stop this because all you're doing is money is in Chicago the police officers found guilty crate he should go to prison\nAnd then he wrote that out yeah and the protests because he ... and then they stand out there and uh like the\nThe uncle or somebody of the the young man that was killed and again a horrible thing and then ... you know the man was arrested he was put in jail he's gone to prison he doesn't he didn't get a Bill Cosby he didn't get to go home until they sent him he was in prison you know\nAnd he's been you know he's now they um took away his bail and he's now in jail for years on bail now that was Bill Cosby he'd still be out on bail until the sentencing for three months but they put them away which is probably good he probably would have been in trouble if they could be on the street fighter\nYeah and then they protest and they still protesting the they're standing out there saying it is\nTime in America has shown that there are bad police officers and they need to come to justice yes if they shoot somebody they should come to justice but you don't say that there are bad police officers\nYou could say there's bad fire department people you could say there's bad medical doctors you could say there's bad attorneys you could say there's bad print or is he correct yes correct all throughout the country every single possible job there's going to be somebody who is bad\nAnd they are they are white bear black Hispanic or Middle Eastern\nYes into one guy shoot somebody and goes to jail great that is not a reflection on the entire police to come across the country whether it's state local national ... wherever it's not it's not a reflection on them so when they keep trying to make that looked like the one police officer except for construction workers\nIs a a arrested in and put in prison for you know killing can stretch all construction workers are bad construction workers are now on at all if a realtor do something really bad to kill somebody every realtor in America do you hear a speaking about it I mean that's that's how\nDumb that says you know when every time we let it happen if there's a protest because of this arrest people tear gas and rubber bullets stop\nThe madness to stop them as you\nKnow they shouldn't do much flowers get the full ... hours solve it was a lot of problem for thirty

[noise] liquor work their way to\nYeah Rob the first comment he was talking about was he lie manning first part of that comment that everybody heard uh he he was asked is Eli the problem is there a quarterback the problem and he said I don't know he's obviously you're not going to scramble you know you're not going to run you know ah\nI don't know it was almost an indictment and you know\nTo know when you watch it it sounds like yeah you sound like a good an indictment there's no\nQuestion because you know if it's not him is that when you say I don't know yeah you\nRelease considering it why is your question him but look here's the thing is is this what been Mac do got fired because he saw this he saw the Eli Manning was done bench team\nThe New York fan sentimental because he lives delivered to\nSuper Bowl ... out about it as you were in it will be a hall of famer because of those too and he was magnificently clutch in both so giving his props give them credit will remember that the right right and time moves everybody's not going to play to their forty one like Tom Brady most quarterbacks are breaking down\nAnd he lies age or a year or two after\nAnd he you know he still OK\nBut you and I are both said and this is not revisionist history this is not you know jumping on the bandwagon we both were saying before the draft do not take sake why Barclay nothing against him but take a quarterback\nHe's a quarterback rich draft get one of these young guys you should be set or could be said for your future but that's what they're saying a couple other things the second part of that interview he was basically saying that\nYou know the giants are not putting him in position\nThey he said do you use the term being out scheme\nAnd he said they're not putting him in a position to be the best that he can be so he really you know initially people jumped on his quotes about the team not playing with energy and not you know plan with heart but I thought the most telling quotes from him were one\nI don't know if he lies the problem he very well might be and to they're not putting me in a position to be effective uh as effective as I can be and\nThree Josephine athletes are you happy in New York and he said that's a tough question isn't really know I like the sunshine in LA\nAnd Rob ... let me just throw this out there after their game a loss remember

going in the most anticipated match or was the Kansas\nCity chiefs who record of course I live by quarterback Patrick my home and are undefeated again the Jacksonville Jaguars who had arguably\nFriends in the NFL changed and we saw that it wasn't much of a contest Kansas City rounded them when was this thirty to Thirteen I Believe are thirty to fourteen and\nI have one question for you will the jaguars be atop the park or power rankings this week 'cause he lost his don't seem to change your opinion of them\nKnow that there was a bad performance will be hard for me to keep them in that top spot the thing that I Love the most about them was as I told you going into that game it already given up for a talk they don't give it up for touchdowns period in the first four games\nNow this is this is changing but but you have up to yesterday had to give up to write\nSultan still that's what they already know that he thinks is legit that's six in what five games yeah that's an legit so caught up in ... no no doubt about and that's why I liked him so much\nDefensively and then more homes you had a good game over three hundred yards at a washing touchdown but Chris you got to admit here's a guy was lighten it up for cheap touchdowns to his first three games\nAnd he couldn't do any good because it's all touched out against Jacksonville that that's pretty he's thrown one in his last two weeks right all of a sudden this chain\nRide it jibes with what you and I are saying look nothing tells if he's not going to be a great quarter why we liked it\nWhat you and I are saying look nothing tells is he's not going to be a great quarter\nWhy we like we ... we both had he's good very good yup what would you have done the weights right on yeah\nI mean what has to stop all the all time compared us that's what happens I mean the discussions about Willie B a top ten quarterback of all time and stuff like that needs to stop it just I\nJust stop it until we have enough sample size especially given the history of what we think Chris is on the other guys will come on the scene been unbelievable we talked about Colin Kaepernick we talked about or G. three\nWe want to do their car was already ... lighten it up contract exactly do you know wait a minute Rob which is that his finger up what you're saying he's number one what was that up [laughter]\nYou didn't want to hear about their guard down right and and and look I'm a status and he has played fine he's play well\nBut Carson why it's not brand is coming off injury but still that's a factor\nHe hasn't been when he was last year no no no it's just three games but you know what I'm just saying that Prescott duck press got to know about her little example ... yeah you you have to relax in some ways Robin I guess this is the all time greats are the ones who are consistent\nWho are consistently great but in some ways this is almost reminiscent of baseball\nYou know where where it aired guy ... ... every year every other year it's it's a new guy that's that's like Christian yell it's kind of comes out of nowhere\nYou know Bryce Harper goes from envy pita hitting to forty to fifty whatever the you know like we're seeing some of that in the NFL is guys having a great year and then you know mediocre year or whatever so let's just slow down that's all we're saying\nAbsolutely and the other part is I don't know Blake borders\nI meant maybe I Know a lot of people say they can't trust them but maybe the worst and\nThen maybe I was thinking because just a couple of weeks ago against ah the ah patriots he was unbelievable what do you throw three Seventy seven three hundred Seventy seven yards he had four touchdown he he destroyed the patriots defense and then yesterday he was God awful he was\nTerrible I there was in the game yeah I don't know if anybody's ever thrown\nFor four hundred and thirty yards and had a worse game than what we saw yesterday and some of those turnovers were just horrendous yes I mean one he throw off the helmet of one of his Lyman a screen pass the through directly to a defensive lineman for Kansas City\nIt was bad all the way around and here's the thing I think look there weeks where Blake borders is gonna look great as you just said against New England yeah and then they're weeks where he is going to look like he doesn't even belong in the league is
