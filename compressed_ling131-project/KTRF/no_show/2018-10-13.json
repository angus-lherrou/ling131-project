meanwhile\nComing off of last night and we had a big day social media why show last night all about ... back him junior and\nSay Kwan Barclay it's pretty good for hours radios on al ... or something and and that big debate continued all day today about the giants and where they sit and we've told you no matter how good say Kwan Barclay turns out to be\nThe giants needed a quarterback you can have a guy like Barclay have\nTwo hundred totally are often last night get in the end zone and you'll still lose by three touchdowns that just happens that's just how it goes now I don't spend a lot of time you know just growing and growing and growing on social media went and taught to\nAn art project today based on the screen and and play a lot of deep dark disturbing music kids might have nightmares night no way to go nowhere to go down you add a little bit of land again a little bit of disturbed and said hey guys hang on I mean the the song is actually by a band called disturbed\nWhat's happened hang on how I was a child services yes yeah yeah I'm here yeah\nIt's the harm and guide yeah he kept show yeah you're crazy stuff he was playing black Sabbath through them and records were play backwards OK\nYeah we're here normal studio right by yeah I had somebody spending it worked out pretty well but what I I didn't she was an awful lot of folks raising their hand not pat surely it stayed in the U.S and the O'Dowd territorial\nAnd like you just ignore the fact that he said well we won't get older you like there's nothing that's easier said seemed to just get brushed by I think we're the we're the only people that really went after him\nOh boy well no no we had four hours a canvas to paint and paint we deal yeah well good job but finished with some literally literally water colors he like he lie manning on his status is the big topic of conversation we told you looked at Johns through the quarterback for two years now\nAnd that's why you draft a quarterback at number two because you need a franchise quarterback if you're going to do anything in the national football league\nThey don't have one which is why you can have steak one Barclay and you can lose every game by three touchdowns it doesn't matter what if you think he lived manning is losing his job patch or is here to tell you that's not happening\nTo change a quarter of a shame on you know well we believe in what\nWe believe in he lives\nNow I agree that they should stay with you lie manning why because it's not like they have somebody else that they can put in member they cut Davis Web before the season starts Gino Smith isn't is in Los Angeles you know Alex Tan is the backup really and then there's nobody else that they have\nThere's nobody else to say OK here's our guy there's nobody waiting in the wings\nDon't go sign colon Capra Nick or somebody else it's just a mess I'll I'll paint the sunny side up picture for the giants with Eli Manning tank\nThe rest of the season keep Eli out there and tank tank go one in Fifteen yeah the inside track the number one overall picking the draft tank and then\nYou can get Herbert wherever you want it number one overall and you have your franchise quarterback and you're franchise running back and back to backtrack as I've said things tend to work out for the giants and it's maddening Lee\nFrustrating to see that pose a novel it just happens oh no no giant you know just works out for what we do so I tell you take the rest of the season when you're not going to you're not you're the bad roster well\nThat should be on your auditor under its I hear your name and a half now trying to take its here ... keep going in with the same game plan because everybody's given your maximum effort patch or America everybody's given your maximum effort that's what you tried just so it was on yesterday I was concerned with that at all you know if that's the wind is a turnstile yeah but you can't get the same game plan is\nOkay you get the quarterback killed on one ready go really what it is [laughter] but that's the thing is that this is not a team that oh there are a couple of plays away or there are a couple of players wait no it's a bad roster\nEverybody wants to win every player the quarterback so defensive backs\nBut they all but the difference is all these other players find a way to hold their emotions in check so they're not hitting their head against the ceiling fan against the electrical fan or hitting a kicking net or leaving before halftime 'cause they're so pissed off they're not winning\nAnd I sit down and went on and on it because there is Antonio Brown too\nWell but I always get a chance to win say a couple of the examples Aaron Rodgers is uh going after his coach a few times\nBetter offers burger has gone after a team of you time right do they still have to get in such a way of stopping them when they get to control the football oh they'll still got to rely on someone to get on the ball and when the quarterback is clearly unable to do show what a wide receivers do they should always complain faces Europe\nAnd then there's many other wide receivers were great that don't get the football but don't sit there and say why did I get the football I'm going to now make a spectacle of myself everybody everybody wants to win but they find a way I Know they've been in a way that's not that's not going to take away from the team no sure\nWell in this particular case if you can get into football you shut up if you're playing well he'll shop he's a showman like oh no this is the first show\nCalled he caught a bunch of passes on Sunday night and then and he's still said you know what I'm going to do that interview before coming I mean look he's caught that interview was or or what I'm saying is he's caught passes the sure he has he touched down no but it's got passed but that still did that interview\nWhat many got to get the the red coat and the top hat and you can take over for you Jack in the greatest showman okay he's tried to sell your bill of goods here I Am it's all about me it starts by he's but he's also tell the truth that nobody else is a bachelor and everybody else still still going to try to pull the wool over your eyes\nAnd tried to tell you there's nothing wrong with the you lie and then everybody's working hard and everything is right the ship it was obvious problems at some point you have to address them and if you if I owed outback has got to be the guy is crazy is is it ... you're listening\nProblems or is it causing problems I mean he's not addressing drastic if he's if you get this is not if you're saying now he's trying to be a leader this is not the I'm not saying it's a good way of being a leader now there's a difference if you're\nTrying to lead and being a good leader in this particular way it's getting ready to lead no I I think he's trying to say look we all know the writings on the wall\nI used to have this conversation and I'll be the guy that said I think he's just trying to say look at me I think the only thing that we've been pretty good at that look at me I'm I'm leaving before half the other day that I Would say I was a pretty good movie\nThat I mean but again that's just that's just being a showman that's just that's nothing yeah but I I get but if that bleeds into how you're acting on the field at that bleeds into after my next touchdown I go insane and costs Fifteen yard penalty under kicked off because he's done that before because I Can't control my emotions there's just there's in

I mean that's a that's a the tend to be a head scratcher for a lot of hunter says because they you know they open them up in their dark neat and they're like oh wait this is supposed to be a Kraus\nWhat I Do this [laughter] [laughter] yeah they think it's because they open up like they're going to look at a rough cross on ... they actually have\nAn email from California now northern California and you get a lot of different types of quail in the wash that we don't have for my my dad was a marine and he talks about hunting quail on the camp Pendleton\nA Marine Corps base in Southern California and California ... uh with this golden retriever that eventually brought up here and and hunted are rough crowds with later but he really enjoyed hunting those those different price quail author\n... I Love the grass woods I always want to spend some time in the grass woods every every season up up north than a popular so that sort of thing is it's just a wonderful hot but hunting those western quail so good I mean in my local quail\nThat I can get on and forty five minutes from my house is denouncing quail which happens to be the hardest quail if you want to shoot the ... and really the only abundant in this year and a lot of California\nAnd that's happened to be our local bird and a little bit lower elevation you get the California quail that's going to come on its head you have to have those loans my dad yeah yeah exactly and then you know then I spend a lot of time in Arizona and you know you've got ... Quayle there and then you've got gamble square hole and then you've got\nBlue ... you can get three different species ... just in Arizona alone\nIn New Mexico kind of the same way and and the environments that they put you in are just really special\nTalent that yeah no that's fascinating too and of course you get further we used to print Bob what country\nRight like once you get to central Texas and Oklahoma Missouri it's an all the way to the Atlantic ocean tell by by it\nOkay now are some of the procedure your book going to help a pheasants from a ... a little bit about\nHeat so so the thing my fourth book knock on wood you know I'm a I'm doing OK and caught by them and I'm I'm really appreciative of that so I'm In a place where I can finally get back to the community that I'm a part of and so I'm a life member of quail forever\nAnd ah I decided that with a quilt cotton tale I could donate the portion of the proceeds in every single book so hold\nBack to quell forever and pheasants forever for for their habitat mission and uh it's something that's very important to me uh it's important I think for everybody who's a hunter to consider giving back to the environments from which we\nWe take animal data so you know we one of our strongest positions in greater society is that as as that\nAnd one of our strongest positions in greater society is that as as the as hunters we do so much for conservation and and I want to do my bet for that\nThat's awesome we're I'm very proud that we have for quail forever based here you know in the twin cities it's a great organization you've been at several of the past a pheasant fest film festival events are you going to be at the one here and a twenty Nineteen when Chicago land\nI Am going to be a I've been at every pheasants essence twenty twelve and I'm looking forward to be in the Chicago area than they've never done the ... event there right right\nYeah I'm hoping I Know I'm going to get down there to solve a coordinate touching you there and\nThe alternatives radio robs resigned chatting with Hank shock such an honor to have him in Studio check out his website hunter gatherer cook dot com he is on a tour through this part of the country in a let's talk about what you got to come up this weekend in fact you're going to be at the governor's functional opener excited for that\nCan really I'm actually it's funny how excited I Am about it because\nYou know I've spent a lot time a hunting up and birds in the last couple of two three years but guess what I hadn't been doing hunting wild yeah and and so\nI've been so grouse centric over the last two seasons that yeah man I really want to get in the ... I mean she's a couple of roosters and cook some pheasant and just enjoy that environment and I'm looking forward to a lot\nThat you're gonna you're gonna have a really good time and um you know it's going to be nice hunting whether it might be a little ... little rainy but at least they're not going to too hot that's been a problem and a lot of smokers and when you have any degrees is really tough on the dog\nIt is it is you need an Arizona dog well yeah and there you go\nWell hunting dogs absolutely now you've already done some hunting he got out with Bob St pure and in northern Wisconsin how natural\nIt went well I mean it really a head of kind of a last minute schedule switch in Iowa that allow me to drive up to his grouse camp and it and I was so grateful for it\nYou know they I got my my sticks in the woods and and I happen to be\nMarginally obsessed with woodcock so uh that would suck er here right now\nAnd we saw buckets of them and you know reasonably difficult to hit when the leaves are on the trees\nSo we got you know without a share a grouse we're a little bit numbers are a little bit lower um but there were there and so we got a few growl and a few more woodcock at I actually ended up finding a whole bunch of edible mushrooms while we were Hungarians through the woods so very successful weekend\nI won't come back I Want to point out the ... Peterson just file a block on woodcock hunting any set Robin you got to keep us from posted immediately 'cause we all know woodcock a they're here today gone tomorrow\nMhm yeah I mean if you really want to like spend some time with them you got to cut down to Louisiana which is that the end of the road\nFor the sure sure and I have you done that it that's why I decided to summer hunk it is emerging January then okay okay well that sounds that sounds compelling I'd tell us a little bit about this forging you know we we get so focused on on the hunting and the shooting in the fishing or you've written a lot about foraging and this is a good time time here for for a while mushrooms isn't this\nIs the best time of the year ... other than Merle right and that's\nThanks so many of us associate wild mushrooms with Morales in spring but those guys like you know that this is the best time of year\nOh yeah I mean in terms of the the diversity of species that are around and and it's cold it's cool it's wet and it hasn't frozen really hard yet so that is ideal for every mushroom that isn't anybody who can listen to this right now get out because a dime in it and it could change in a week\nProbably your premier mushroom right now is the head of the woods or you can buy a version of it in a store called ... or the animal is what\nMost of the ... call it and then there's the\nThe orange shelf mushroom the or the chicken or the woods and then there's a bunch of different bullied species out like birch bullied and ... their support Cheney here in Minnesota but\nThere is the last of the trails there's black trumpet we found them this past weekend so it's just a lot of different um really good edible species that are kicking around right now\nI was in the boundary waters last year at Lucas leave I don't know if you know looking he will do the shopping an outdoorsman and he he brought a pork loin up that he cooked and he found some mushrooms I don't know what they were and I mean there were flavors that I didn't know existed in a dish before he was down it was just phenomenal\nI mean that's a cool thing about all this like once you know about your wild plants are wild mushrooms as a cook in a chef using create dishes that don't exist anywhere else in the special\nNow yeah I wanted to point out one thing you know your book is called a pheasant quail caught and tail and I think rabbits get short shifted a lot these days by small game hundreds around the country I think at one time Rapids for like the most popular hunting Corey there was an he's just don't hear a lot of butter anymore so why was that important new including her book\nWell the ... the primary reason I started hunting actually so I started hunting here in Minnesota or as an adult I'm about Eighteen years ago and I wonder how rabbits and I just always love rabbits and I still love rabbits and in fact I'm going I'm going to fly down to the hill in Missouri this year just to chase swamp rabbit\nAnd their costs stellar jays are beautiful burnout beautiful bird that like a big blue Jay there has to lead to a ... blue\nJays gorgeous bird and and they were ... they were all in ... and it was fun to watch them because they get in the yard in the in the fight and then they try to fly away and I get up and then they'll turn to fortify the gang on pop right back down to the ground and get up and stagger a little bit in ...\nAnd they'll turn like at a forty friday gang on pop right back down to the ground and get up and stagger a little bit and look around like what the hell does out but yeah it's just hilarious because they don't know what's going on they've been eating these little crab apples all summer long and all of a sudden now they're loaded with alcohol and they're getting just yeah it only pay\nSome people understand these some of these barriers that you know hanging on the branches and and they start to ferment a little bit and then they\nMay be the droplet grounded the birds eat um a write off the tree and uh yeah they get they get a little taste of alcohol on insurance got a great anecdote where someone called her about it you know like a dying bird or something on on their stuff and churn\nHad I'm describing sure enough it was the year ... you know these these are one of the species that eat these things and she took it home and and uh you know gave a water and give it some some non fermenting grapes\nKept it overnight and then let loose and it I get to the kind of sat on a wire for a minute we'll come a little tipsy enough ... don't buy it in a kind of she called it to the plight of shame I host husband was hung over followed these other birds\nI tend to see it in the late winter I've got crab apples in my yard in in the neighborhood and we'll get these I've talked about it on air will get these gangs what I call them northern comedian Robin and say come through first and they seem like they're a little bigger\nThan than our Robbins has some summer here and there just surly there just rowdy they get into these these fermented berries and they just they're just running all over the neighborhood being of noxious describe it the sellers are fighting they're allowed their slammed into windows there they're all lit up on alcohol from crime apple berries\n... there was a video segments interview with our French Sharon that

when it comes to pheasant hunting to be honest with you I have never been\nBig on opening weekend and the reason why is because the weather has usually been marginal right up until the opener than the\nThan it keeps the crops are still right right so you you never get a real good pheasant opener what I like to do is I like to wait until the crux of impact you get some Indian summer roles in and you can go out there and when it's relatively comfortable and the birds are all concentrated in the grass\nAnd of course I really love the late season hunting when all those birds you and the cat pales all the ponds are frozen and you can get out there and really have some fun so right now opening weekend I'm not really going to miss much because I've never been a big fan\nAnd that's a pretty much exactly what she said\nAt the start of the show to my he's going to go out I mean he's he's pretty hardcore and of course he's from southern southwest Minnesota but I'm making the same point that

I they have him listed as a linebacker to me he plays the ... 'cause he's the ends up on the perimeter eye and he doesn't go head up with your tackles but boy how did he get in your backfield in a hurry and all night long\nRight I mean that's and and I do cause frustrated ... as he's getting their hands off he was on them and and and that is frustrating and and again that's an adjustment that you know we kind of just last night with it um but you know we play 'em again will ... will definitely have to\nHand we've got to account for him and I absolutely yeah he's he's a good ballplayer as good as much speech as much as we heard about voting Magnuson except for one kick return\nAnd maybe one ball down the sidelines which she either didn't catcher was out of bounds when he did catch a I don't know that he hurts you if you've read a ton\nNo and you know that's what all all week that we kind of game plan around him you watch film and um he's been catching Seventy and eighty and\nEven a Ninety and sixty yard touchdown passes and so um we put Rodney King on them last night and Robbie has just improved\nUm every game he's just done really well and and yeah I I he didn't manage and then catch one and I think you had about two runs a one run on a pretty nice run on them but\nRob you did an amazing job my dad even said he was like you see a junior because he'd be sure to see fun to see next year he's getting better and better and and I agree and so um but you know as a credit card defense you either defensively played as well and and we did we we game plan around number nine Magnuson 'cause he's that good and um I thought we'd contained him really really well\nWell and the other thing that you and I were chatting about where we went on the air here when you start running your your hand down the peak what legs roster among their guys that play except for maybe a couple of guys up front they don't have very many twelfth graders\nKnow oh yeah they're they're young team there they're not up and coming team that's for sure and um but you know I I just thought we battled so well last night um you know call Miller on defense that um he we moved him around a little bit but that was definitely his best game by far the year two and um you know we all those together and we just got to keep keep unproven no\nYeah for for folks who didn't feed her after last night this catastrophe kid who was there are other tail back thirty to even ninth grader yeah he's good um there there are six to six three quarter back whatever is even junior\nYeah and and he is what I had to you know he looks like a senior out there um I Know I was talking to coach mom after the game and you know that kids high five and guys after the extra points you know he's doing all the little leadership stuff that you you love to see and and your greatly respect when when opposing teams are doing that\nUltimately though it still goes down to the twenty seven loss and it's weird because with about a minute and a half left to play the first half your up seven six and get into football to start the second half but I figured if they could just hold them out or I put a drive to go to start the second half oh my goodness\nAnd you know that's been if there's been one Achilles' heel adding defensively it's been that because you go through our our our uh games throughout the season I think we've given up probably three or four\nTouchdowns in three or four different games right towards the end of the half and you know instead of going in twelve nothing or Eighteen not then it's you know it's twenty four and you know last night you know yeah I mean with five minutes left what up seven nothing and\nThen that seven six and we still have the lead and and then uh we go three and out forced upon and then they they run a nice reverse which we haven't seen and\nUm you know it's just a nice bike all I saw them all come out and I'm like it's a fumble and no it was an a lateral and\nUm but yeah so then you go down fourteen seven and then we could have been an easily had seven six at halftime so\nUm you know different is your locker Oh absolutely and in our locker room we're still pretty focused but uh yeah it's just that you know when you haven't had a lot of success it's tough and and that's where like last night you know if we can put to have like we did the first half will be All right\nLet's talk a little bit about Wednesday night now it's going to come up fast not enough time not as a matter of time to prepare\nThis going to sound weird again but maybe that's a good thing because we all know deals good and maybe if you have too much time to think about um uh it it gets into kids' heads a little bit too now you can just go play yeah\nAbsolutely and and went on and on and all the too is you know we're we're at war to succeed in our section\nSo we're traveling or the one and they're the one right and so we will um you know we'll take it as a as a as a preparation game for a playoff on on the following Tuesday because that's going to come up quick too and so we'll try a few different things and and and get some guys in the right places and you know unfortunately we have you know a few\nFruit feuding here and there are so up to play that by here too but um yeah we'll practice Monday Tuesday I'm senior banquet Monday Night which were really looking forward to and then uh at the aisle and and again that they that they're that they're the best team that we're going to see all year and um\nBut that's good at at the preparation game for to get is ready for that fall on Tuesday\nI may have been some others but the biggest thing I saw last night was ...\nYeah and then that's um you know and and and she had to have it again there's a great job from Sanford and then he's like we'd better hold them out and so um you know we'll see on Monday you know he's he's the he's the one that you know he's a great middle linebacker for she's hard runner and um but so hopefully it will be ready and we've got to hold them all for playoffs we'll we'll just have to do that\nOne other thing you been able to do as of late is spread out the assignments a little bit more of a year has gone along you've got left some left you playing both ways which I think it's part of why you've improved\nI think so and and and getting you know and and and unfortunately it took us a while to get where we needed to be but you know miles Johnson um you know everything he's gone through he's just been a warrior and and he's really hammer down that\nYou know everything he's gone through he's just been a warrior and and he's really hammered down that free safety position for us and so out of ... to corner which I think where he's more comfortable and does a nice job for us but miles runs that defense and he's getting the guys in the right spot and um you know call Johnson is a great job with that as well but\nTo have miles behind them and say no other side\nI really helps and so yeah we're getting the guys where we need 'em and and um again our our focus obviously we've got the game the ... on on Wednesday against DL but the focus is really on playoffs and and again the kids were not scared of anyone if we go to Dee Jeff we're going to give him a battle if we go to ... to east side it doesn't matter\nI think the kids are ready to to to get into the playoffs\nThe ah the we'll talk more in depth about it on our final coaches corner of the year after the season is over we always do a you know influenced your seniors and kids returning but when I looked down your roster\nI see a team that going forward in the next year is going to be somewhat similar to peak what image you're going to have some kids with experience but not a good ... seniors are right there is going to be a whole lot of opportunities for this year sophomore and freshman class to break into the line of if they can do the work is\nAbsolutely and you know I'm a meeting with the freshman seasons done now and\nExcuse me I've been really mean with them for a little while and and the kids are coming in and and that's the message you know you have an opportunity to play next year varsity um but we have to get in the weight room you have to do all the little things um\nYou know the the character peace we have to keep improving on and and making good decisions on the weekends when no one's watching and and um you know 'cause that's that's that's vital to a program and and we need to improve on that and we'll keep working with that but great opportunity for not only the freshmen sophomores to you know we're going to have a\nI'm a sophomore class was really impressed with them this year with their seats God's see squad schedule\nAnd um you know we're we're excited you know but we've got to finish the we're out here and right well we're not done yeah yeah absolutely but yeah that you know the the the future's going to be there and um you know we've got a lot of work to do yet but I'm Will finish strong here and and I just you know the the kids are believing we can get that playoff game on Tuesday and that's kinda where our focus is that right\nNow well in in all fairness coach and you're not that you and I have not talked about this at all because you're either on or off a year but when you took the helm a year ago we all knew this was a little one or two year project it was going to take three or four or five years oh yeah but you know and I don't want it faster right we all ... and you know and\nAnd coach mom is done in just a fantastic job with the weight room and we made great strides this last year and and you know we keep making those strides we'll start seeing some some will start ripping benefits eventually and um\nSold them to leave in uh when it comes down to zero your defensive line in your mind backers are going to have to Florida the football\nYeah it's sad it's counted as strange match up on both sides um\nThey want a pound or a fast do eat them in a rural place a hundred

of warm sunny days before we can get back in there it's not like we could flip the switch after the reins even after the soils dried enough to get these big machines and there we still aren't going to be ready to get in with soybeans so I think farmers are probably going to be\nPicking up a lot of corn plus a lot of corn stalk brought some problems with corn so uh I think the corners and a lot more dire um condition and the soybeans in terms of even standing in the field\nIn most parts of the state I mean I Know it it differs whether you've got snow or other things but most places I think farmers are going to be getting corn first but then when we get back to soybean uh we just have to wait for that moisture in the fall\nAnd again one way of wet soils um ... you know we get a real a lot of humidity causes service in the in the nighttime and our moisture they'll come up a lot during the night so we probably aren't going to be able to start as early in the morning even with good temperatures as we would normally like so\nUm it's just I think folks are going to have to be a lot more patient with soybeans overall is gonna be the biggest issue about when to get in and it's just

indicate corporate status just inconvenience with you as we break this went down and\nJust to start with some of the post comments by the head coach ... start with quarterbacks academics to two more interception today not three as we all know now are just the two more but that's five now in the last two games\nOverall I think everybody's still likes the way he throws the ball but overall what do you think of his boy\nI thought he played well especially if you think of the way he ran that plant route to tie their chance to most of the game complaining\nProbably multiple maybe missed a couple of them high throws but he played very well I thought in terms of the short passage Thirteen twenty three for two hundred and Eighteen yards\nUm well taken out a pretty strong rushed from Ohio State and and the days right if you think of those interceptions it such that person or satisfaction or shot Bateman needs to go up and make it'd be the fender writes a little young receivers need understand when the ball is not there you turn quickly to being an offender you knock the defensive back hands down and\nAnd you'd be you know and that that they'll play those kids will learn to put make those plays ads the season as their careers to go on and\nAnd again they'll learn that but I thought that play well I thought the play calling it was great you know I think of those third and medium yard situations thirty five thirty six but it looks like it's a known and very predictable path situation from Minnesota\nThey go ahead and finding inside Iran where they broke a lot of those for ten Fifteen twenty yards so I thought the play calling type played it in the favor of that great play calling great balance for the most part so\nThis happens you know to put up\nBut the final yard is three hundred Ninety seven yards against Ohio State deep and they did their job today and if you look out from from my perspective\nOne hundred Seventy nine yards on the ground it led by eyebrow homes\nI'm One hundred fifty eight you are on twenty three carries an average of almost seven yards you carry it off and then all sorts of wind was really good today and you can say a ... coming in maybe that was the difference but to me\nI think it's all my gosh the rest of the team does that got to play better but there's something about seeing one of your line may lose their job\nThat I think fires everybody else up\nYeah I think he's obviously a huge president that's sick but\nNine two four hundred pounds and and again that he I think from that right tackle standpoint albeit he's young he's a difference maker compared to the guy that he just took the position of but you're right you know someone loses her job at a competitive environment so I think everyone know that they need to step up because they don't they don't come in and play a week in week out\nTheir jobs at stake and everyone wants to be in that field but I thought that often blind played about as well as I've seen since ... mid point of that Jerry Kill era\nAnd so those guys have a lot to build from I get all the play caused a lot of times you know we're playing five or five down lime and we have a tight and kind of covering that rate tackle and we had a boy did that we found a way to get numbers on Ohio State um probably something I hadn't seen the first five weeks and so\nYou know great matchups situations there again who doesn't want to run behind that got us four hundred pounds I'm pretty good protection for the most part a team\nOh healthy if they came in with a number of stacks and I think they came in with twenty two sacks coming into the game so again they're known for getting pressure and a quarter back I think the most part that team did a great job that unit or protecting ...\n... they ... we'll all get along but missed opportunities they have to turn over three turned over to I Am to use on the phone bill\nAnd in the midst frugal and in those were after great Minnesota drives those were the kind of drives that I think it Minnesota who says we're going to be successful it's gonna be the ... play five minute drive cars just grime equality lined up

tighter Johnson you could go back and\nI don't know it's a fifty fifty I'll did he have that possession or not you know I think one of the pie bigger plays in this game was Ohio they actually in ... when they got that forced down you know it was a terrible spot by the referees it's obvious you can look at all the stuff on Twitter as a terrible by then of course they come back with ... on the next

moral victory even though everybody has said we don't do moral victories around here but you lose ... after ... Smith is already\nRuled out at the beginning of the game no O. J. Smith today on that front to for the offensive line and you get a tough fourth down spot and has to be honest even if they market correctly it's probably close they might still have the first time but they were yard off it we have a terrible spot\nThat Tyler Johnston one could have gone either way there were again to lots of reasons for this go pro team to believe but it wasn't going to be there today and they never not let that that\nAnd I think everyone thought I'd have to have okay you're down by ... within the possession here but I think everyone expected Ohio State to come out and\nAnd really get things that are happening that didn't happen I think the Minnesota defense responded well\nAnd you know forced to a pot and got the ball back and and then the one thing I take away from the secondary we gave up a number of yards throwing the football I think what we knew today corbu it just so you have to keep the ball in front of you in any time Ohio State really had momentum and his game he thought in the first has actually what the long strike to that right side\nYou had you know that they they can go vertical and the vertical in a heartbeat you have to keep your secondary on

Ohio State didn't shoot themselves in the foot right it well they didn't they didn't turn the football over\nThey they played Ohio State football but we played right with them so I\nI think there's a lot of encouragement here from the game and I typically wouldn't say that\nBut a team that I thought gosh this can really get out of hand if you think of Ohio State\nIn a year that they really get rolling this the team that can really put teams way and put them way early we did say this Thursday and the power trip isn't the team oh how said that tend to get off the charts but then they come on big time in the past and strong in the second half that didn't happen today so I feel\nGreat about where the theme of that again I mentioned that the thing to me that's the most concerning in these types of effort to make sure you can keep the comments your student athletes and I think they did that today\nHow important was it for Minnesota to finally stop Ohio State on one of those poor Duncan version they went for it a couple of times in the area to tell you I mean I understand one where you it's like it would be along field goal or you you keep going but then you convert at once and then it from the sixteen yard line I think\nOut for it yeah I got to be a ... I think it was huge I mean they were two or three and four down to again you can say all all those were very questionable and I correct the play calls by Ohio State but to go ahead and have Blake Aspen come through the metal and stop them was huge and I again I think that front you know we probably talk too much about the ... that\nFront seven on defense played amazing Carter cop an off the edge\nLooks like a draft pick and again just relentless pass Russian and collapsed that pocket well and may and they play the you know it's too bad that early some old that he forced Haskins he couldn't find a way to have that role into his arms and again that sometimes those bounces tend to go the way about how they knock toward the goal for those who come over time and so\nThe or the deep end played amazing again way too many are severe but then again the injuries to that group I think it's a bit understandable so at that group comes of age or get healthier and get some guys back like ...\nA booklet that group comes of age or get healthier and get some guys back like Antwon Winfield junior that crews can be a pretty strong\nAntonio Chanel today with third team tackles out of the defense of backfield Blake cash them and also with her team tackles including two for last quarter Coughlin seven tackles with three tackles for loss and who's back today\nAs you said in Thomas barber I mean if he's not getting double digit tackles you feel you're starting to wonder if they kept to saturate but even even issues with now I mean over all the players you didn't expect to play well did\nYeah I think that deep and played really well but again that the people are going to laugh at me when they say that could be the the passing yards but come to shut down a Russian tapping Ohio State run the football that's what they do\nAnd the obviously have a great quarterback to control the football but we forced into pro football that we put them in a lot of tough situation um me a number of third downs that they had to convert and again I feel great about the ... the defense of effort and\nJust peek ahead of the schedule you know I I ...

Panthers to the end who absolutely will be able to do it\nOut I'm real quick thing is you are you made reference earlier to who could have seen all these ties coming and I'm thinking now that I've watched that ten minute clock in the overtime we should've known bike there have been a bunch of other games that were really close and we're going to keep seeing that if they keep that ten minute clock are they going to get rid of that\nWell there's been no talk about going back to Fifteen I Know it came with some consternation some people complain plus you know you have to see the other thing is going with this rule the were the other team to get the ball back to tie it that that obviously is a problem when you you don't have fifty minutes anymore\nI think that's part of it I think that's why you're seeing these ties I lose an extra five minutes if it can make a really good point I think people should be talking about that more of the ... the issue now is around the league of it's going to be a big issue with the competition committee\nWith with a defensive lineman this was the one issue that coaches have guys that I've talked to how in the world could aid defensive lineman turned his body on an on his way to ... to hit the quarterback you just don't have the time to do that and that's something that the competition committee\nHas to do has to take a look at and I think they will after the season because right now it's it's it's been costly it it hasn't been the longer the head by the way that's up to the issue which we all thought it would be right it's really\nTaking two steps will sometimes you take a ... you take only once one step and you fly the quarterback what he's supposed to do how how in the world can you turn your body and the air and we saw what happened was a defensive lineman for the dolphin to wind up during his ACL he tried to do it and didn't work\nAdam really great stuff thank you for coming on today we appreciate it does suck

about what happened with people without it\nOr not my ideal so ah anyway but I've been saying for the last two weeks if you look down the road we know Alabama's already in the college football playoff because they're going to name it after him they are and then there were two other teams are always like\nThere is literally one difficult game left on the schedule combined\nFor Ohio State of Notre Dame and that's when Michigan right comes to Ohio State and by the way I Love the buckeyes chances in that game even though all be rooting for the fighting ... um and so if I was there was that game book it three of the foreign college football playoff slots are taken already\nBut I didn't hold on squawking about it you okay so you're at Notre Dame Ohio State Alabama\nYeah okay but it's sort of their lives like George a lot of it if a if nobody loses at home to pit this is going to put a ... a little bit of\nA a a hit you might get in there it was [laughter] it it definitely would um I mean I wouldn't say George a lot of it obviously you'd already down by six thirty in although still first half his diverse out you know what I Will say one last S. E. C. team can still get it no doubt\nHe lost in the ... the Alabama go six and six there in\nA way and I wouldn't even be mad [laughter]\nAnd I would not even I Would and then I Would go to the NFL and I would say do you want to put your worst team up against them right [laughter]\nSo no chance Nick I read your lips don't say that [laughter] do you think to talk of the law is going to be the NFL\nYes right okay do you look like you're going to be special\nAnd they have all these players all around the only issue where the Alabama zebras and not quite Alabama's defense now granted it could be because they're playing ninth stringer I kind of like this Alabama better I like all events of yeah yeah 'cause I mean we talk about this they've never had a quarterback that you go it's pretty good\nI've never ever watched Alabama and walked away and said their best player is their quarterback\nNo I mean ... was the best but that wasn't because of his quarterback play if you know what I mean it's a it's Brent yeah I didn't want to go all Britain on 'em\nBut he I I think it will be I think you'll be no backup and another ten years in a league I think he could play football uh what's the one that's called and games now forgot his youngest ... Mac or a\nOh a oh no I'm\nLike two years before McCarron gonna he's already calling game James yes is it back or\nNot McIlroy yet the Gulf or not McIlroy but it's something like that [laughter]\nI don't know I don't know I have for the kids come back here asking why they're winning and he's calling games\nNow I keep saying I'm a ... point is\nAlabama keeps winning all these years with no real quarterback right now all of a sudden they got to a nice day and I think the way we got to go\nBack out there you know [laughter] it's not free cob in the late logical your light law\nThat's already Ford enough and so if you give up a touchdown and say okay the only thing as the gamblers we get all upset and they say but\nThey will uh when they get extended everybody\nOf course they do that's a that's the nature of it okay for us down for pets but they're in field goal range so this would mean that the other day was going to need a touchdown still a lot of time in this game twelve twenty three to go but hit with an opportunity at a five point lead right now they're up fourteen to twelve\nAnd they've got a kicker lining one up from thirty six yards away a drag\nMcIlroy Greg McIlroy McIlroy oh boy he's calling games now a field goal is not good\nThat they'll go is not good I have a really good friends here in Southern California is at this game I got to figure he's really nervous because when you go to a game all the way out there in South bend at a team of six you know if they suddenly lose their perfect season\nThat's the kind of guy they would blame it on my back to Southern California and all the Notre Dame fans out here will be like that was your fault you went out there put the heat but\nJudy's on you would hope he makes it back right side will hand\n... good luck to them um I got another workplace question for you you don't like what we started off the show where you drive\nLike you're putting in the press you keep trying to be fired or something like I was actually just snap on the\nBus this one will be easier for you this one's a little less personal\nUm I Wonder about this this is the kind of stuff I Wonder about what I'm driving around okay\nLike if a friend comes over to your house got pop open a bottle of wine and he says I'm not happy at work what's the first thing you would say to them\nWhy and ask them what\nAnd then he gives you the reasons well I just the the co workers and I would just were not driving a my boss is a little bit\nOverwhelming over the top\nIt's just not the right fit for me and what I bring to the table and so I really would like to uh I'd like to work for a different company\nOnce that was established then I Would tell him or her to leave carry that can go to you know get another job yeah\nSo but we don't do that with athletes know that's one Jimmy Butler is saying that's what you mean butler is saying that is what Kevin Duran said three years ago and it's what Kyrie Irving said a couple of years ago\nAnd what we do in sports when someone does that is we immediately judge them to be\nPoor people poor employees a misguided or guys that don't understand the right way to go about business why\nWhy like I and I know sometimes it's difficult to compare sports jobs to the other jobs in the corporate world but the rest of us may may have\nBut I Do believe in this and here's how I can prove it I've made it very well documented here five sports radio that I'm a fan of the Golden State warriors Mets are defending Kevin to read a book ... for the last three years and I've often\nAnd Kevin to read a book ... for the last three years and I've often been backed into the corner by people say oh how would you feel if Kevin then left the warriors well guess what kind of sounds like I'm going to get my shot to respond to that next year and you know what I'll say\nThey don't want to go do something else when there's something else\nSee this is why I'm Glad I'm here sometimes and sometimes we got to bring you back down there [laughter]\nOh why oh why don't why your environment and you want something different as a as a working adult in America you get that here you go here and they tell you why is\nWhat is your why what is the reasoning behind it what we have found out is that Kevin Iran's reasoning has been about the validation of others\nSo it hasn't been just oh I simply hate okay see it's not my type of community or I hate my boss is no he actually has fond memory of all the people there at the time they're the city there everything\nHis was valid nation of I'm not great unless I win so he then took an easier route is that different than most athletes I think a lot of\nGuys like that they want they want ... NBA player won't raise but we'll get different things that I Want to be the guy to lead Eighteen God's will do that\nThat ... doing Kyrie said I was tired of being son I\nGot a ... you have in the Bronx brand those gas abroad and now the brought a number on it I thought what well although\nI was here so Kyrie goes to a team\nThat you know at the time we didn't think would be a super team now looking at everybody goes into oh he's going to be the leader of the team Kevin Durant was that'd be go join us you know what Seventy three wins who I was a free one on it should've been so again he

major league baseball [noise] people\nThe brewers are going to win the world series um [noise] that I and I I've been saying that for a week it out for the players didn't start the Bruins are they having loggers along you know the brewers here's what I now look out when I'm going into a layoff\nI look for the team that has\nThe look the look and sometimes it's not easy to find but there is especially when it comes to baseball this quirky it doesn't really matter if you have the best team\nBut you're right you know what I mean like somebody just went off the end of the bat in the ninth inning and it flows over the first patients had you're like oh my gosh we won the game that doesn't mean they're the\nBest team I'm I'm sure the red Sox are any Astros and quite frankly the Dodgers they're they're probably better teams than the brewers they're probably the fourth ranked power ranking team of these four teams but to me\nStarting with the last week the regular season where there's sort of magically found their way and do not just ah get into the play offs but somehow taking the decision from the cubs doing it at Wrigley Field um and all year long yellow which that acquisition\nHe's probably the MVP for me\nThey just have the look\nThey got something going on there may so they got some positive energy going on\nYou you know the team that a first of all ... without some say about that well they're all they're yeah they would ask them to say about it what do your point you know who reminds me of what you're saying that example of that to me with the Kansas City royals agree where they just had that look like they actually\nAre stupid enough to believe that can win this thing you know what I mean they didn't know there are too young they were just like it was going to lose weight you know way our way and we can wait and next thing you know they did what they would want to three years whether\nThey want well no the only one why would they wait two hundred three what Oh yes yes they went through the last one of the giants beat the Mets I think in the in the world series but yeah like they were ...\nThat's what I say my point was that I I I feel you were you looking at me like\nI just think they're going to win does this not fit the eagles last year I mean they lost their MVP quarterback\nAnd then there are backup came in and looks awful for two weeks and then somehow some way of like oh my gosh like just some sort of magic hit and they went on a\nFour week run and they want to sort of all I'm with you but I'm not ... not the the Astros I'm not sure that anybody all four of these teams are outstanding but the brewers\nAll you know they gave one they're like they're already man this game as fly by this game and the fifth inning right now and what a scoreless game goes into the late innings and you've got the best bullpen and baseball and you're at home I just I Would likely what is there going to find a way to describe this went out to\nSince we're in LA I Will say the Dodgers the last two maybe three seasons especially the last couple they always find a way where they're they're it seems are out of it and they keep fighting back no they do and so you got allied to the Dodgers credit man I mean that in there and the Dodgers stuff too man that pitching staff\nAnd I mean that in there and the Dodgers staff to man that pitching staff and obviously got stuck\nHer shop man [laughter]\nHow are you going to that you had a ... and arguably your greatest ... on my way out and I hate this for clay encouraged at all I'm like\nYou've got some great so here's the what are the greatest human being any as you're not so great dude any such a great\nExample and he's all of these things the only thing he's ... he's got a little bit of the might Trump complex where you're like gosh if there was a just some sort of I don't know popping personality trait that you had you'd be even bigger deal but I don't have any yeah you just\nHate mail out without the commercial it paid man do know what I mean like great great encourage does not hosting Saturday online I don't know I get carried away\nI mean unless they do I have an Amish skit ... other than that [laughter] oh sure thank you fell in ... the ... I Would I mean is who was the best quarterback for Fifteen Years it would I not only with including Tom Brady was painting may was that yes but when you went into\nThe playoffs you ever like who's the best quarterback you were like oh say\nThan it is\nYeah I think once there was a playoff game outside yep what I don't care where he was if the game was outside in December January like ... this isn't going to do well is\nIt and even I I did the biggest Peyton Manning fan and have an obligation let's go let's go who we play the ... the the patriots were five of us some right [laughter] that's roe [laughter]\nOh boy and my point is that screen Kurt Shaw or for the last decade has been no ... no picture that you've won over here and there is no pits you would have had the bombs they witnessed is gaining\nHis here what is it like two twenty nine for his career some outrageous\nOh Irish I saw that one scene that there was another one you're watching it on TV this is what I'm Talking about with the brewers you ever do this quarterback drops back everything's in rhythm\nLess it fly you can't see on the TV where there are things going yet [noise] but you could just feeling oh yeah you're like oh that was in rhythm this has got to get [noise] that that like that's what the ... that play for Notre Dame had the outlook [noise] the second he let that go I'm like you saw my arms get off I'm like I said that's\nYour little little concerning we high number of American ally like yes they're they're they're really good I don't think they let the national league Corey just help them out to the bullpen is good they look I'll give you this is the best player in baseball you know a common denominator\nIs is it's it's Cain I mentioned Cain was mentioned the the royals rental Kane\nIs a common denominator I don't know why but I just felt the need to say that 'cause he was with the royals and I said the last thing that has a book is good player um but that was a great pass a for Notre Dame yeah sure Notre Dame Peyton Manning was that guy though to me he had that Clinton curse all we manage the best ... and thanks to lead told me to thirty nine so I was close\nA career ER is that I don't even think it's a very narrow what she did and where you know guys hit the balls everywhere I mean this is the last three or four years every year the new\nHome run record no new home on right don't want one record yet clean cut or two thirty nine that's crazy I hate\nFor him the way his own fan base\nAt him because they love him they understand what you and I are saying but there is it yeah but\nThere's this you know it's a Nikki deny it but there is a thing in the back of their head whether it's just like\nYeah man we love ... man yeah\nBut it's just not you want it to be\nAll you know all the way there\nIt's not and it's it's not an artist you the reason why to mark is because who are the two of the Dodgers rival the giants what are they done obviously not\nLived most most recent oh the one they won three out of five years rivalry three rings in the last eight\nYears has some Bumgarner had ethic moments\nI saw the tweet last night as ready for the three was ready for this [noise] somebody said this out last night\nMadison Bumgarner could take the mound in a playoff game tonight and give up\nTwenty six run\nWithout getting it out and still have a lower playoff the IRA think late in ...\nThat was the most disrespect will stay with my like I was like oh\n... oh my gosh they're\nNot they're allies my point [laughter] looking out at first\nOf all I'm sounding like a genius right oh man because that's my point though the the brewers on was that ... was it a summit of just ... first of all these baseball players are on the line there did not aligned with the ice\nMelts the chance are getting carried away there I Do like they're getting used to be little gold chain that your grandfather was he was Catholic look like now if everybody can out of turnover in college football that's a key chain is what they call it an eighty huge God run dmc chain have\nPersonality in baseball please\nI'm not worried about the personality and I'm worried about that you're gonna you're gonna rip off you out of that well okay [laughter]\nThat's what I'm worried about it you're going to slide the to the second and you're like choke yourself these\nChains have gotten ridiculous um it ... by as has at least seven up it was our senior\nBy the way okay or steal a hit the homerun birth weight one nothing bottom of the south\nYou interrupted my point I'm Sorry go because my oil with Madison Bumgarner is he's Tom Brady\nWhere\nJust maybe skill level Peyton Manning still better like as far as I Know what you mean like back then like people were like what is it that was one of the greatest of all time like Tom is if you go back I'm saying is seven years exactly that's the way it felt like you just\nGet the job done whenever I Need I Need you to can blow complete game check gotcha hey uh I Know your pitch last night can you come in and close the game or give me an ending check I got you what'd you make that's it\nBecause I have a question about what Notre Dame just did I'm listening to you or they would I absolutely am listening to you know you're not but it's cool one hundred percent I'm listening to you know I definitely can be a hundred and got to be like at least eighty five percent while I'm never a hundred percent less than anybody but yeah like eighty five percent listening you out heard\nYou're right about that ... actually ...

seven yard field goal attempt\nAnd they will ice the kicker Todd I'll call by Oregon so we'll take a few moments before they go out there at attempt this kick\nThat work Ida I've seen the kicker don't talk about sometimes make you think about a little bit sometimes it allows him to take a practice shot you have do you call it something about it a real moment you don't want them to get to the practice I don't know I thought well that's a good point but I made some\nI Want them to get to the practice I don't know I find that well that's a good point but I mean sometimes they like to call\nThe time out right before the snap 'em and really mess with guys I figure I mean I'm a I I Love to play golf\nAnd and if you get the shot every single time I'll tell you what that I'm okay how are you not stuck pay did let him get a dog I practiced shot went right through the uprising came out it doesn't count but now he's in his own it's random\nThey feels good no you don't want you want to call it before he can have the run through\nYeah that that didn't uh that didn't work out too much by the way your dolphins of coordinator for the high school team I Want to ask you this what are you said you're calling plays and it's been a learning experience why\nBecause like it it it is so easy to sit from afar and looking games and just being honest and what you just call it play but there's so many moving parts um when you call them please you have to think a player to ahead of time so if his first intent\nYou send the play in in your mind you're already that start thinking well if the second law and order on this or the second shorter want to do this or we just need a great time to take a shot play happens\nBowler spotted you need to have the next year and so when we look at these guys with those big old play sheets and um it looks like the cheesecake factory menu ... ...\nOh the ice you know the kicker war him is that it won't hurt him I said he said he pulled\nOut the ads or going over time going over time here in Oregon twenty four twenty four between your job and the\nDucks how about that how about that I don't think it was because I think he just miss hobby you can say that but I Would say that they look they asked him he made when it was during the iPhone does that mean like he missed it okay\nIf I get a practice shot by definition I have less ice then I Would be if I had not swung my leg for the last half hour\nMaybe this like playing golf there were two walls okay so you're the first one straight does it mean to the next one is going to go straight\nNo it doesn't mean that but it also doesn't mean that that you asked me if it doesn't go straight and just means is golf and it's really hard which obviously kicking years as well based on what we're seeing happening around football right now\nNo so we're going to say that the ice ice work on and on the news the next thing you want your origin of mine but okay you can Jersey they're going to go\nNow I I the reason I asked is fascinating that you're calling plays the high school level because people were going the other night in New York\nAnd uh I think a lot of that is they want the giants and Eli Manning to throw the ball down the field like throw the ball what are you doing and you even saw\nA human saw the head coach at one point patch armor\nOr you read his lips throw the ball like he was holding a too long but by the same token I Wonder what you saw therefore through your eyes not only as a play color but realizing that many is not a mobile quarterback and hadn't zero time so what were the giants supposed to do\nIs hard because I feel for pets remember because what he's having to do is he's having a coach around a quarter back and that is something that is hard to do because when you're when you call it plays when you build enough interest soldiers really thing about players not place where the players don't want to get the ball to rather than the plays that are like and\nThe players you want to get the ball to stay cool and Barkley man that's kind of you can always handed to him oh they're backing junior that's a little more challenging because then we got to throw it to them where what are his best routes\nVersus what is my quarterback but does he still able to throw it so over the hill everyone took them to test about the interview and ESPN but he talked about push the button to feel getting over the top you would like to kind of a stretch to feel a little bit\nThose are the big place his quarterback can't make those big place so he's limited he's limited in terms of his impact on the game what he can do because defensive back no oh me your quarterback and thought of all the opposite right here hang on it so everything now is harder for him\nBecause his quarterback has in it\nI'm Wondering about solutions here because yeah the one in five\nAnd so the easy thought is you know to New York giants ought to do\nIs just get one of those topics again I heard the giants and Justin ... name only as old many sentences over the last forty eight hours a but you're not going to tank if you're the New York giants and I remind everybody there are two games out of first place Bucky I Know the one in five but there are two games out of the first place nobody's got a winning record in the NFC is\nAre there any hidden solutions out there three names come to mind when I Want I Want you to tell me what do you think it would take to get him and whether or not it would be smart to try to do it All right where we got first name ... Taylor\nNo he didn't play will in Cleveland I at the terrorists who showed up with a browser is not an upgrade over what you mean they both are bad\nSee I I think it is an upgrade just by virtue of the fact that he can move if you've ever been to the line\nWaiting if he's going to be oh scared to ride to play with the brown time he doesn't help anybody ... of all and he wasn't using his legs to create place so it's our ... going to play you have to play like the ... that we've seen play at his best at times and buffalo\nOkay so you don't like to ride Taylor how 'bout Derek car am I calling the raiders to see if they would like to get out from underneath that contract\nWill you can call them because they would love to get out from under their country really has to be oh man he\nHe is not being good now is that this this is it like I mean maybe they could get them at a bargain basement deal but for the raiders I think this is it I mean I hate to say ... or the parents with the little kids that went out and bought it was the number for Jersey [laughter]\nThis might be it for him that there might be it yeah jak ruined may move onto the next one\nUm if he does do you realize how much worse that makes the ... trade\nOh it's I mean there's all that all around it\nWas so bad it's been so embarrassing grew in ever since he did the trade continues to come to press conferences and say man we just can't find a pass Russia and people are like just I mean they want to yank their ears off of their head and throw them at the TV screen [noise] okay so it's been that\nThat do you realize how much worse it would be if they did that because if you understand\nThe genesis of why the raiders in Cleveland back even ended up in that conversation it's because you cannot go around the league\nAnd point to a team that is paying north of twenty four million dollars to their quarterback and has also decided to pay you know north of twenty two million dollars a year to another player it's very rare in the NFL that you get both\nAnd while the raiders could have done it they opted not to so in other words date shows they chose Derek car over Leo Matt right every three weeks later they're ready they're like\nYeah [laughter] oh my I mean so here is you're not have gotten worse\nIt couldn't have gotten worse than it is it brings me back to his position that I keep having over Twitter about quarterbacks in over valuing the quarterback we're very comfortable over paying for average performers that quarterback case came as a sixteen Seventeen Eighteen million dollar quarter\nThe one that carry around him and he's right here we\n... our girls [noise]\nBut knowing your breath to face it you\nKnow your girls for for the fact that your girls that\n... [laughter]\nThere's so many things that go off and you looked at it gives you the information\nWho are you and what are you doing these numbers twenty four seven three sixty five\nWere that trusted voice that make you smarter feels like you've never met when you're wrong so tell your friends\nOnly listen to them right here Fox Sports radio Fox sharks to think about that sports when added to pass pass why\n[laughter]\nFind out fast one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for details half past why [noise]\n\n...\nAll those [noise]\nOh man just flew out to the war to extract the NBA's [noise]\nThreat is then of course was with the Dodgers got that long ago [noise] bad\n... garden out a bit about the biggest nightmare the gods as a Democrat of experience but\nWe squeezes it we go to that night\nThe Dodgers lead the brewers for two three um okay great those quick way to save some money which the guy go go to guy go dark comedy fifty minutes you'd say fifty percent a moron car insurance are Bucky\nSo if I'm just taking because I've always I I Wonder there's sometimes in the fantasy draft mhm bass player available figure wiring on a second hold on because every NFL team does that too right they're all in every interview oh we're we're gonna we're gonna take the best player available All right so\nThen next year when the giants pick one two or three ... what is the best player available is running back you're going to take him when you just grab sake one Barclay\nYeah but we're dealing with that that's just that's not what is going to be out there but let's just say it\nCould be but it's just that we do know whenever they pay if we have no idea of the top guy on the board is one of his running back is not boating is not\nBecause they're not there's not a generation of talent like I said well it worked out but I'm throwing out a very okay let's let's say that is an area\nReal scenario yeah running back to their running back is fake one Barclay junior junior then you have a quarterback that is ... how close are those great art is similar to what is it similar to that was David quarterback what if you're not if there's ... who's the next ... who's the next best player with running so you're not\nJust taking the best player available you're taking the best player valuable but factoring in positions don't lead\nIt factors in but it only factors in if you're talking about similarly rated yeah if they're closely rated like say on the greatest skill one guy seven point oh and the other guys six point\nNot just ... I don't know if I buy this what okay let's say the grades are not similar what if the giants come to the podium and there is a generational running back a veil a bowl and there's no one else the grades all that close\nThey're not taking them they're not taking him they've got sick one Barclay Mm right\nI Will tell you [laughter] know this is what I Would say okay what do you tell me if\nThere's a guy the trees and the ... say tiger has the best player in the ... like it'd be up to and everybody else\nIs well below that you're calling somebody to trade you called you trying to find someone to trade right or whatever but in theory you always want to take the best player you don't want to see 'cause heres what happens when we reach up and we do those things\nBlake borders happen okay Mrs you're risky happens\nYou want to make sure that when you selecting in in the best way to do the criteria were you thinking in the ... the guy that you've taken the tough or should be someone who is a perennial pro bowler or someone that we eventually talk about being a goat Jackie guy\nThat's how the standard should be for a tough topic if you take if someone up there and you know they're not that you're doing it wrong because what happens is they always play to what you sold feel so when you see someone who potentially doesn't have that they're always going to be what it is\nWell here's something I'm playing devil's advocate for a while here I actually don't disagree with you fundamentally and here's something I've been wondering watching football so far this year one thing I Wonder watching\nAnd wondering watching football so far this year\nOne thing I Wonder watching football this year is are we getting closer to removing the idea that the quarterback is the most important position and spores\nAnd here's why I asked that it's not that the quarterback has suddenly any less important but did a good quarterback just start to grow on trees\nIran is that by Calvin earlier before you got your ... okay\nDo you think and I wonder if you know where do you think this year Tom Brady ranks in terms of passing yard which\nUh I mean he's he's down like I Know he does that adoption history of it's up to him or\nHe's outside the top Fifteen yeah he's outside the top Eighteen he is nineteenth and the league in passing so therefore because of the rules and because of the way things are being slanted toward the quarterback\nEverything is all of them are good all of them get up\nThere are exceptions Eli Manning is not an end Derek car has not been but I can give you twenty guys Ryan Fitzpatrick came out this year and looks like a hall of famer\nI could give you twenty guys that look like really good quarterbacks so doesn't that denigrate the quarterback position\nIt does I Want to pull the man I'm hoping I can pull up just a\nPacket of whatever we have research they they give us this research stuff this is a lot of work research yet but I I thought I Will suffer and here I saw this I saw this thing that\nDoes it kind of knew that come under like ... I mean it is like duct tape closer to lock and key like how do you get the same delivered\nTo you or I mean it comes it comes it comes every week comes in email okay sounds over but I saw some of them they're like twelve quarterbacks with a passive rating over a hundred\nOh I hear I pulled up right here I got that they are there are a lot of them allowed eleven quarterbacks have a rating of over a hundred ... which means they used to be sacred ground ... that mean they're they're how many and I I I realize we're talking about a small sample of five games\nBut I mean how many quarterbacks have retired\nWith a rating over a hundred oh not many if any other ones are like I don't know too yeah like lead then quarterbacks right so think about that efficiency have a rating over a hundred and some of them are not ... one of them is Ryan Fitzpatrick another one is Mitch trivia ski\nAnother one is Jared golf who's actually number two in the league who a year and a half ago people were asking if he could throw it out route\nI mean it's some it's unbelievable when you look at it I'm\nAll right Tom Brady is not one of them you know so a lot of any quarterback separating about a hundred tolerated not one of them\nSo thinking as Lee ... first five weeks to Eighteen season most touchdowns in the first five weeks of the season in NFL history most points and the first five weeks of a season in NFL history\nThat's what we're talking about we're talking about\n... points are coming off I mean that people are lighting up the school board like replant pinball and so the old metrics where we used to measure quarterbacks and all the other stuff\nWhere the throat though those skills out because everybody's going to be a pass with a high passer rating um\n... what does it look at a dairy car I was taking their car to test um when I was writing about him potentially being on the way out the door and Oakland uh-huh his pastor ratings still above a Ninety\nIn the old days\nA couple of years ago we were say oh that's pretty good rating that's not bad\nUh-huh it's changed now and so as you talk about the quarterbacks\nThe evaluated to chew evaluated will be able to look beyond this debt sheet looked beyond to completion percentage which skews everything I'm up in the last week leak what average in terms of completion percentage sixty five percent\nSixty five that changes the way that we have to look at these quarterbacks it used to be a big deal for a quarterback\nWhy over sixty has not just looking at the way we look at the quarterbacks how about the way we look at winning\nDo you need a superstar quarter back to when I got Aaron Rodgers I'm two two and one I've got Ben Roethlisberger I'm two two and one\n...
