missing one score from the section eight a tournament the go to the wire subsection\nAnd here we go any more up the number one seed defeated the northern freeze tonight to free the nothing kits and counting central a number of fines heat lamps it sent a ... river tonight\nIn green Bush by a final score of freedom widen seeming are now looking for an oil drowning three to one and Sacred Heart a

volleyball action we do not have a score on that\nAs of yet it's also one game going on that is interesting\nTo us NHL Hockey tonight after two periods of playing the Minnesota Wild\nLeaving Los Angeles kings by a score of two to nothing\nAnd and the NFL we've got one game going on and uh that game I Believe is now into the third quarter a play\nA they play in there it's uh actually still in

and I can get a dollar and they are and I\nAsked I asked you know I'm here at they actually were on break down even further than brings kept going off\nAgain in action and the pilots are gallon that go on an airplane that operates\nThis is Don over a present and but I was no different they are the number two seed or just ... percentage points behind the eight I'm more of\nA heading into a post season seeming so a number to the veterans banquet chargers the number seven seed and the chargers having to when I'm playing games maybe it'd be the grumbling balls\nEarlier this week bans on the\nGame that was the third meaning of a season and in a band playing a in a tournament where sacred hunting it'd be the chargers students that's denying it and then also uh they had to go there and you're going to go at three sets tonight bully balancing break but uh this fall also saw\nVideo game show boards of ice volleyball action was a girl\nAnd handling the go over in Stephen tonight we had seen him in ... for a new middle ... dream is insane German was there in the dream isn't I got a chance to listen\nTo a little bit and fertile will dreaming they pretty much game Steven our girl only one and I actually one game winning that's the message tonight\nAt um the gave all they can handle obviously quite a much different ballgame versus the regular season\nAnd a bird about ... laid out probably best effort that I've seen them in the last few years and they wait it out on the table and how the forest you pick but I guess the number three stormy hey came out right away firing on all cylinders finding holes in the storm event\nAnd it route with that one when and I just think each team some upset in the past but you know ... ... that would still be a very big upset and brought up about ... except one step to nothing we need it just makes me think well here we go even our guy to make the\nMajestic theater as part of a ... a obviously all white and they'd be twenty five twenty in the number one\nAnd set to Leah was back and forth all the way until about mid ... when I got to about Fifteen points\nOut for each team's even our golf started to pull away a little bit of fertile dealt China would always just seemed to rally back here and there is storm ultimately has been twenty five Twenty one and another closely white that and then it's even up to one she\nAnd I tell you what do those to set you know you look at some of the top performers in terms of chill or bowl games off of them senior was Shelby Dunbar the fertile electronic talking\nAnd that she played outstanding could I get to her final numbers are just a moment as did Abigail McLean but as Steven Argo store and they just went back and forth kill after kill\nIn terms of uh just racket up the point where each team but there were plenty of players on both sides that had I was scanning efforts tonight in terms of racking up ... points and just overall great up\nMoving into three we are again this time Steven ... a primary owners go up early\nAnd it has to be going to buy as many as ... and that when the tide really started to look trashy called both of their time people that's two and three much like the storm did that one\nBut the storm just at the end of the beat them twenty five said at the end is that three so now the falcons were on their heels after ... three trailing two steps to want to see that our galaxy is taking well\nOne of these teams obviously had to go to one if the lower speed but part of me at this point now you got to play with your back against the wall not how you want a white\nBut obviously it could be the last step of the season and which it ultimately ended up being as even our gal would roll ... for ... kept inching a little bit closer each time the storm or give it up by about five or six\nSoccer but only get within three at the lightest but the storm would end up taking this one twenty party scene in route to re one match when and we'll get twenty two it's fun to see the Balkans finished so we\nEat clean and ten and you talk about it it eat with an Eighteen and nine record coming into this market I mean that ... teams right there with at least Eighteen when in the ... ... one\nOf the section that's pretty impressive\n... actually they went on the road and one of the first set and you'll ... scores and\nThe other three cents on the match I mean a second a sin twenty five Twenty one pretty much any moneys man sent but he's singing to list even or ground and you said you know they're in tune in June than a good volleyball team\nThey did and uh you know they do help but for seniors two of them back started wave considerable minute they mentioned Dunbar and then also Bailey okay what's the other one she was their main better and\nThose who will be very ... but at the same time\nThey have a whole mess of juniors coming up this fertile about traveling I look back now a part of a trampoline brings back one two three four five six juniors and a handful of those juniors at a lot of playing time this evening so they bring back pretty good in your class going into ... season\nPlaying time this evening so they bring back pretty good in your class going into ... sees\nIt that they'll have so they'll they'll have a very formidable team I Would say and then they even had a freshman and sophomore book it should be quite a bit as well so they offered about Johnny pretty well ballot\nAnd they'll come there'll be there'll be good again next year I have no doubt about that ... the season and for that team\nBut one looking at even ... nine senior but I think that's the most seniors I've seen their volleyball in our in quite some time they're lonely or mostly pretty loaded with juniors sophomores well obviously those get gotta get older at some point\nOn ... for all of us we all get older each day but that\nBack to the store and bring back the juniors and stop was the only one junior rather that they've got so quaint that but I Do like a a\nR O U may and and also a you know they bring back a couple of more says we're all a great Tom singled out quite a bit of time that I did all the ... they were a real pain contributors by getting the scoring department for the storms like and then again just benign seniors they have quite a year those seniors that white\nConsiderable minute tonight as well for both teams were you gonna have to ask them top players to a place like\nEven before the storm move on\nThey get a tough matchup again tomorrow night at north way what part of our family again uh fortunately that Eighteen an animal storm moved to twenty to stick with the ...\nAre you mentioned Steven argue out and now they have to playing as St Bernard\nYou don't get any time do rash\nAnd you go to a neutral site that will be held in northern gallons tomorrow night playing in the second match tomorrow night at seven thirty they're going to blame the Sacred Heart team that you know they got a just to launch is on the season\nBut the one most of those matches this is going to be exciting ... tomorrow\nBut it it all you know you look at as a wrench factor for Sacred Heart a again as\nYou said both of their to regular season losses coming to Steve in Arkansas and ah I think it was three two weeks even at two ... also in even though I was at that prospect turn on that just a couple of weeks to go see that as well let's take a ... type that even now again like you said neutral site and see the see tomorrow night\nAt about I think seven thirty good that'll be the late match 'em\nJust two teams that are pretty even but in terms of experience a sacred hearts a whole mess of sophomores upset mess about ten times but I like I could I Need to pick a new one out of my area but a\nVocabulary I should say but sophomores in juniors friendly I met him only to seniors even I only got ... seniors the experience level\nGoing for them in terms of a favor and pay for it but the state or hearts boy a lot of youth but a lot of you is what I've noticed\nMost even are gone with those nine seniors they're built to win this year\nYeah it off the ... you look at it that this could be a year while they of course they still have to take your heart and kept in Comedy Central ... he was still in their way as that you know they're going to be a tough ... honestly ... anybody you know you like to play\nThe who's the favorite factor and all that but at the at the grand scheme of things that it just shows up and that's cliche but\nYou know heard about traveling showed that they were not going to go Down Easy that I Am a shirt proved it and I'll go forceps what the storm and\nUh you know five or match up there that I Know you're going to talk about with mark and all that but that that was a while I'll listen to I understand as well and so again we I think are ultimately if anyone section you know it's just especially the west side because of how that the west side is that you\nWrite a Steven argue out and the Sacred Heart going on can Steven are girls being twice and it's always tough to beat the team three times during the season you've also got the argument\nThat Steven are no matches up well with St bernards\nYeah 'cause I heard that argument to make as well\nOn terms of size they both have a couple of players at least standing at five times Bible level with my Glen Johnson and Carlson for the storm and he sent me a lawyer and uh also married missile for the eagles the bulls Janet five ten five eleven so\nGod's life pretty similar but uh\nIt's all going to come down to our I think in terms of who invest one that's going to be pretty even killed ...\nAnd again like you said that we that eating a good team three times back that definitely comes into play in this match and being as well as we bombed out tonight anything can happen and so I expect that want to even do five that\nIn terms I decided a victory and now\nAll right Steven Argo wins tonight free to run over ... ... the when Steven our ground labs are record now to twenty two in six with the lines for little ... in their season and the team than Tim\nMan a dreams and you're going final words anything any kind of the courage rent for a seaman our ground for tomorrow night's\nBest of luck obviously it'll be fun or for whoever covers that game and for all the fans of listeners but staying and attending as well um yeah it's been a fun\nSeason for all the teams that we have the privilege of coverage\nAnd I I just know that uh I'll be following along much as they can even though all the it was made you it sounds like tomorrow covering red lake county central so I'm pretty excited for that one at the most things got there with overweight a Mac and I saw it will be fun to venture into the stopping ... I went to college at issue so it'll be fun to go cover\nSo um and all I joined I Need that need to get and you could get one of those kerosene lamps you know how you always used to be prepared to kerosene lamps\nAnd yeah yeah yeah okay I Am not prepared to kerosene lamps although candles we do have candles going right and I and I have my phone but I Can't charges of dies of dies so [laughter] but when I can tell you is this\nYour right it was a two teams they split during the regular season um kids got central one back in early September in a in a tournament\nAnd then be jam are one just the most recent game in uh in five they want to three games to two so uh these two teams are very good both of them are very good very equal and I think when we talked with the coaches before and we thought you know ever comes down and making the least amount of mistakes or hadn't the upper hand\nI don't know so much that it was that was the play of Marley turn it she was phenomenal tonight she played extremely well at the net and not only ... she gets she gets the accolades if she's fantastic player and she got stats\nOr does she uh she had a twenty nine kills that was more than anybody or did the whole team of the gators they had\nTwenty I think it was twenty five on the papers that\nThey had like twenty five papers or twenty five ... kills 'em\nSo twenty nine for [noise] for a Marley turns you had more than the whole team in the gators she was phenomenal now in order to get those of course [noise] um she needs to get the ball so she needed to be set so give credit to the rest of the team because they were getting the SATs to her\nOn the night nice ... and uh that would allow her to get some good swings some good kills and she was dominant at the net and they bear cats after the first game was twenty seven twenty five a great first gained the gators actually built a little bit of a lead and then I ended up winning it a holding on because it was called us all the way down\nTwenty seven twenty five gators one the first game\nIn a second game they'll kissing county's central built the lead and never relinquish debt and they wouldn't win and I don't remember the file but they've won the second game and actually pretty handily [noise] game three was is your favorite game because now it's a game of peace and kissing just capital and they came out from a game\nThat hinder game three coming out again to and kept rolling they kept the momentum they never let down they just kept playing strong all night long they played well at the net they've got good sets\nA it was fun watching these two teams because uh there was ... both ways and it was fun it was exciting Jim was or what the student body was getting into it I mean it was just a fun atmosphere\nKissing really showed the Tonight Show that the their team to be reckoned with and and I think they can give a give her a run or\nA on a tomorrow night now certainly they got their hands full because they got the best team in the section eight or so they will have their hands full there is no doubt they'll need a not only the game they had tonight or they're going to need more they'll need Molly turned to play a strong she will they'll need to have no airs tonight they had some service error is that it come back to hurt them tonight\nBut uh if you if you can play to blow up and you have the service areas you might not be a so forgiving\nSo tight they played well they won the next three after losing that first one twenty seven twenty five they cruised on the next three and they win at three games to one so a minor upset here the number of five seed beach the number four seed\nSo again kissing county so moves on day will win the gator season comes to an end that as a phenomenal night Marley turned up the mess and I and kissing ... with the upset win tonight are the\nGators John Twenty one in six years a\nBadger Greenberg minimal or river would have been losing your\nOr who did the ... oh gosh I I'm a plane again I don't have high I well I don't have\nI don't have my feet for me but I I can tell you a topic that I'm pretty sure I Alicia ... is a senior trips to leave work as a senior I think any Jacobson is a senior I'm tests any Peterson I Believe is a senior\nUh [noise]\nOff the top of my head um [noise]\nUm [noise] who who\nAll McKenna ... a senior\nUm so yeah they they've got a

struggled over the last few years just to find a when writing and coaching change a kid is starting to buy into the system\nOr some of the younger kids getting older maturing playing better they got Paul and they've got Bernstein who really play well at the net or this is the candidate that is planning a very good year now they each side I in my opinion is not as strong as the west side\nUm Boston the number one team is a good team for LA county central when they are playing consistently\nUh they're they're good team they can play with themes David will run into problems if they can't get their passing down if they can't get the SATs to Bernstein into pollen or getting frustrated just seem to find themselves in trouble in a hurry with Boston however if they get their passes down if they do some good ... stay with Boston early\nThis is the teen and maybe can can make some things happened but yeah they got to be happy or a nice one over when after they lost and the regular season

six six five oh five or six to ... I can remember the last roller coaster I was all this was at a at Opry land as I recall and they have a a thing that the twist you through I guess a like a three hundred sixty degree\nI think it's kind of like a model rail and I'm sure that our gifts to pay tribute go knows what it is I don't remember it was very brief I remember that I mean that that it felt like it lasted about one second do you do you know what ride that was\nYes I Do actually a as one of the first rides I actually was on it it also had a little bit of a what we call a corkscrew which pays yeah he's just gave you exactly\nOn that that was a ... I think it was called the ... or something along those lines\nAnd was very short it only had that one little uh the one that one little area but yes I'm very familiar with it and uh uh in today's standards it probably like a kitty ride but back then it was a it was pretty good and and of course ... was a great place to put an amusement park right next to the er the opulent hotel and the and the grand old Opry\nAnd I have to admit it was a how shall I put an exhilarating\nAh I ... it definitely woke me up but I remember that that uh we had been quite busy we're doing my show from a from Opry land and and the couple of our staffers are over there with me and uh I guess you could say that I was a a little bit tired at this point and and uh\nHe woke me up Yes sir [laughter] that there'd be no doubt about that [laughter] certainly did [laughter]\nIt was actually called the ... if I ...\nOh yeah all that uh well anyway I'll put it this way it did lead me say this is off will just be saying well\nIt was okay and since you know as as a gift to the park I got to ride for free okay that's fine but I paid to do it again no not really victim again of course that's a that's just me what are some of the place was out there when you think Halloween and thrill rides\nPete tribute go what places do you think about\nWell there's some great ones out there that started a actually a a a in I'm In law actually started a I guess it was around September late September and go all the way until Halloween some of the places that comes in light of course the universal studios\nAll went to their hallowed Harlem Nights at universal studios and that's all based on a you know pretty much American horror story the walking dead the shining\nGreat place to go a pretty scary now if you want to go the reverse and so the place where he doesn't have to be totally scared and and now you know they they do some good shows but it's a great place to go with the kids of course you've got Disney World\nAnd Disneyland that have the Mickey not so scary Halloween a I guess a parking off for the kids and of course you got the booty you a Halloween parade and of course the fireworks to happy hollow wishes\nOver the all the uh some of the better ones are as we just mentioned to that of course Six Flags and all the Six Flags locations had the ...\nWhich is your Claire classic scare zone all you know where you go into these mazes and stuff like uh the sewer is this the the sewer soles in er which is layer and places like that\nAnd of course the the point has got hollow our weekends all with the great pumpkin or that stuff that goes on there\nI don't think strongly we'll plus they changed the names of the rides sometimes\nUh for example over its heroines a which is a terrible wins in Charlotte North Carolina all they've got an actual fleet street\nUh where you can go through the cobblestones of the street and of course demented scare crows and zombies and the and of course uh you know uh the the age old uh you know Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde or be be found there as as well as a you know a bunch of other characters\nFrom a lot of the novel is a great place to go so there there's a whole bunch of places that I Would say there's about maybe two or three dozen or that actually do this and now they're just a you know the rides is still open the weather's fairly decent and people have fun\nLet's talk about the term age appropriate over how many of these are places you wouldn't you wouldn't take your kid even if your kid loves the scary rides\nWell the good thing about all these places whether it's universal studios knots berry farm which is in a ... that's not ... basically Anaheim all we mentioned to the ... lights over any would a palace screaming Williamsburg Tampa Busch Gardens are and of course ... and and make you not so scary Halloween all\nThese places that we've mentioned plus others\nUm during the day you know during the day it it really is it like that\nOr it all happens pretty much when the sun goes down and there's ... awake and that's pretty much uh most of these places go if you you have kids and they're and they're pretty frightened you probably don't want to go at Nike these amusement parks but if you do there were scare zones their actual zones\nWhere you'll you know you'll be scared and there'll be people that will jump out of corners and of course the ... and and and all the different things that go on the actual entertainment themselves in the places that are non scare zones\nAre are very family friendly\nAnd very age appropriate so uh and and of course they they normally will or will tell you it it it it is easily mark where these places are where you can bring your kids even at night or just to see the shows are we just have a good time on the rise and not have to worry about\nYou know paint totally you know scared or or having a kid had a traumatic experience with that\nPart of the way that the lawyers who have made sure that none of these places are going to subject your kids do something that might make mommy and daddy call the lawyer\n[noise] absolutely I mean at the uh the people that are here you know and again my daughter actually did this for several years she loved it and she had a fun time\nWhile going through college and and I'm a there are rules and regulations that they follow you don't normally if you're an older person you know they're probably not going to try to scare you as if maybe or a teenage gal\nAh or something along those lines so you know there are different marks and different people that they'll they'll actually go and give the full one hundred percent presentation and others\nThey know when to back down and do they know it ... if if they scared you\nThat probably the leave you alone if if if it's really really bothering you and again that's all part of the training program one of the reasons why I I liked uh he's in he's in parts of what they do and how they train people in order to make sure that it is a very good experience for for many\nUh and again there are there are there are scarce zones and there are ... ah you know if you're going into a scare zone then you know something is going to happen\nAnd when we come back and that big a look at that in greater detail in just a moment\nJim Boeheim show on ... ... am twelve thirty veep River Falls Minnesota [noise]\n\nMm Mm not on my watch our military service members saying as they volunteered to serve\nNot on my watch they say and they leave their families behind to keep the rest of our

actually getting a simulation ride or maybe out in outer space or something or or some other planet or or some other situation where now all of a sudden that ride that normally only goes twenty or thirty miles an hour it goes up and down maybe a little bit\nBecause now more intense also that seems to be another way that they're revamping some of the old rides to make them a lot more interesting\nHere's a call from Rita in Dallas on the jumbo headed showed one eight six six five oh jumbo and our guest Peter tribute go Hi Rita\nHi I just wanted to share something with you or we're now in the last week of the great month long state fair Texas and my daughter took her four year old grandson to the fair and she told me that our state fair now has an information desk\nOr they put a bracelet on the child which the child can I take off\nWith the child's name and the parents' phone number and it's on the inside the brave it so that someone could not come up and pretend they know that child and found it yet they're me because of the names on the inside but if a child gets lost\nThen it's easy to find their parent company\nThat's an interesting thought utterly of to say the least uh and encouraging one of the safety in general a beep tribute goes that some people it's practiced at all it leaves a major theme parks and ah and scary rides\nYes it absolutely has to be because of course the the life blood of any amusement park\nIs directly proportional to the amount of accidents incidents of problems that occurred at a particular place or again you very rarely hear of a roller coaster incident and when it does happen\nIt'll be on CNN or MSNBC or Fox News or one of the major networks because it becomes a big news kind of like a plane crash so it doesn't happen very often security has been a stepped up especially at places like ah you know as a Six Flags or Disney Busch Gardens are\nCedar Fair or they do that on purpose because obviously we want them to everybody wants\nTo have a a a good outcome now the the carnivals and the fares that the state fairs are starting to come on board with the same\nAh security and and technology with the blade bracelets and so on down the line which is a very very good thing to have because these days you never know what's going to happen and you know we always tell people\nThey don't always go and pears always tell the parents where you're going to be in more than most importantly don't go alone especially on on your age or you shouldn't be doing that but if that does happen there are a lot of security or devices that that are at these parks or that can help you find a a lost one\nBig tribute go and to continue our discussion about some of the great ways to enjoy the Halloween experience in

over some kind of North West Minnesota and a little bit of Manitoba is a good size area\nOr John ... served as a district governor the oh OK his term expires June thirtieth so he had a dream that time so we\nNow because he was governor but we kind of stepped up the push for we hosted the conventions that was a lot of planning out withheld ... because of the country located and you've got the convention facilities you know there's just some stuff that you kind of and\nI'm not sure why we we looked at the whole thing here we ... we just don't have a convention facility to really cap hotel you know sharing diner together\nSo that was a lot of work for a lot of members a host of that and then we have a fishing tournament\nAnd now we do get a Halloween party so I think after the Halloween party we might be ready for a loan\nApple [laughter]\nGuidelines meat or a once a month we meet weekly weekly against me we we are one of the ah\nI don't ... might be the only one up in this part of the state that meets on a weekly basis a lot of gotten a monthly a lot of the smaller towns and we meet weekly at the American legion on every Wednesday at noon every Wednesday new and so if you're interested in our club or want to find out more with as well just show up at noon\nAt the American legion and say you like to visit and be a guessing will will make you feel okay how do you become a ... I mean what what what do you have to be to become a member\n... really the lines of evidence just by invitation male females you know there used to be I think a one time they all there are a lot of them were men only gone away okay and I think it might be a perception that\nIt is all male dominant we don't have any female members currently a lot of that so it is a male dominant the reason in the very 'cause we do have a pretty strong alliances club okay and a lot of the spouses of our members are in that line up called\nUh we've talked over the years of merging them ... ... but they like you know they had her own anybody out there so it's that's probably one reason why we're doing how does anyone in okay ... well I'm probably not going to go to\nA meeting that's full of a hundred percent women a weekly\nThat and you know I mean that comfort level you know you'd have to have like as much as you said you saw you know they'll maybe our last full\nTime female member was a lane Larson when she's superintendent oh sure yeah and then when she moved on she you know but\nWe have had some of it is a ... every president's come through Bruce ... our current president and say we like to increase that membership sure makes sense how many members do you have any idea the four to ... unfortunately fifty four now we are horrible Hansen\nWas a member for over sixty years or ... passed away last week and everybody knows horrible has gotten more than one raffle ticket [laughter] I don't remember\nOne time at a lion's meeting a couple of years ago I think it open up my wall just to\nPut in my dollar for the week it off and he ran out there with the risk of being at the golf course on Wednesday all of a sudden you just ... and you know when we when we me and my gracious looked at our our our fishing ... when we were looking at the financial after the fishing turn and we kind of\nHow we're down on a raffle sales will or will he wasn't feeling good he hurt his back but I Am I going to be a single ... it wasn't really peddling is much tickets which he still was even though he was laid up but he was your king around yeah we did and I so just to his funerals on Monday [noise]\nUm and we and he was still pretty active show most meetings I think in the past year he was in his son in law my organs of member\nA what we do at our meetings and we have a what's called the tail twister past summer cowboys are tales west they're basically he kicks off the meetings\nHe tells me what he calls the best jokes ever\nWill put that in quotes I Will not be fined twenty five cents next week and that just kind of kicked off some of the fellowship and then he finds people\nFor various things like walking in late to the meeting and maybe advertising your business when he shouldn't be at the meeting me making fun of pastor mark on the radio now probably costs twenty five cents\nAnd then we do happy dollars something happening here my kid got a goal of last week hockey game or my daughter did a nice job and ... just the way we take that money and that gets donated to a cause that are called president wants to put to him\nWell we kind of did a little challenging the challenge to everybody to\nBuy one more raffle ticket from horrible and we collected twenty dollar bills and just where the guys are there that day we\nGot almost four hundred bucks and while and we're going to talk to my family and and see let them pick one of the lions causes put that to do that that some of the little things I just pop up on the spur of the moment if you want to become a member just to come in and to a meeting and learn a little bit more bottom and become a as active as you want to I guess right now I mean we have fifty four members\nAnd I would say on an average week we average probably twenty five members and now the is probably twenty thirty five guys that are pretty active shark week would that make up that twenty five and we got some people that had south for the winter so we don't see him for months and we get a pretty good though that we have a guy that are members but they're not\nYou know they're not able to to make a weekly meeting you know maybe a Mac Kramer that's out on some rough putting on an air conditioner on can't get away you know there's you guys like that but they they still help out in other ways in a club\nI checked London are our guests today I was talking about your a Halloween party now what uh what's going on next Wednesday would've lines but not on the lines on Wednesday we're putting on her Seventy fifth annual Halloween\nParty it's like we said before the ages will say birth through fifth grade\nAnd it will be held up to ... in the lobby we did this last year because we needed a facility army mostly years there's always an army well when you when the army was going to remodel we held it at Franklin or\nAnd then we've kind of a new home with the city at the un ... to ... um and then we'll this year ... last year was ... all ... this year we're going to move a little bit out into the concourse I got a little congested\nOkay so the goal of the festival is to kind of spread the word still yet or or ... celebrated or\nBeyond spreading the word were were spreading information so each extension office across the state operates as a you know a local campus of the University of Minnesota I'm so each county office um connects the resources university to the needs wants desires\nOf the communities that they serve so Pendleton county extension hum is like the University of Minnesota campus here for all of the residents of the county\nAh so this extension festival uh is is connecting you know the resources knowledge the data that we have with the people at the county\nOkay um how long you been with the extent you know I started in January so just a few months and do you basically failed there was a van Swanson that's right yeah ... okay um how was that because van of course been around for a long time or some big shoes to fill in that\nAbsolutely yeah he he left some very big shoes to fill it's been it's been a whirlwind experienced this is not only stepping in that position for someone who's been there for so long and made such an incredible mark on the program\nA this is my first time in four H too so this is a learning curve and and you know both directions learning both what banded and what for aids is all about where you originally from I grew up in the city's\nCat and move away with a few different places the forefront of my way back up here and what brought you up here um I'll I'll be honest the job when I was looking at my heart's in northern Minnesota and I wanted to find a job working with kids anywhere in the northern part of the state and this happened to be the one call\nGo okay Bob looking back here and this year now 'cause you'll be coming up soon to your your one year anniversary here have you learned a lot\nAbsolutely oh yeah it's been a very enlightening experience\nAt the same time you want to pass on information too so uh this extension festival a good way to do that um they know when does it take place tomorrow\nYeah so the festival runs from from noon to for tomorrow a but it's it I Know there's a long period of time but we have a lot of little events going on in during that time so I knew the one we have a panel discussion kind of our keynote event um\nWe're calling it growing Pennington County and we're examining you know how things are changing in Pennington County both you know qualitatively what what characteristics of the county or changing the people who are living here who are moving here we're moving away um and also qualitatively what what our number is looking like population growth or decline and you know looking at jobs the economy and our school systems\nUm we've got some great representatives from the community who are going to speak as part of that uh um ... the city administrator Don Johnson a county commissioner or\nActually near who's who's the director of the chamber and uh I'm Bradley Bergstrom superintendent of schools are all going to be on that panel and one of our own ... going to be moderating the panel huh yeah yes it will be making her triumphant return to the extension here\nShe is a good one to ask is yeah yeah I thought about it a\nA very much a it was similar to have on and so the panel will do this discussion and and um I mean like here who you're having on the panel um some very good people here are some very good thing so as a is open to the public then to come in and here this thin or how does it does involve the public\nAbsolutely it is completely free and open to the public this is being offered no charges as what the extension does we connect the resources\nUm directly to the people who can use them and and we try and in charge as little as we can and for this one there's no charges all to attend so anyone who's interested in hearing this panel discussion and actually work on a conversation because at the end we invite the public to ask questions and and get involved so those conversations completely free and open to anyone who's interested\nThat's excellent goes uh usually when people are doing some discussing people are getting questions they all want to ask them quite right or right getting involved that after they have their discussion will be good then ... and and the actual discussion starts at starts at new revenue and then so that will be the first thing then that Noone\nOkay um how long you you have a rough idea and how long the discussion will go on the panel yeah we're\nWe're aiming for about an hour to an hour and a half um we have one of our panels west to leave a little bit early but ah but we'll keep hoping most of them there for the second parts that that last half hour we're hoping for some great question and answer sessions where we can get a lot of interaction between you know our audience who they're and they're in our panel experts\nThat um who should be in the audience\nAnyone who is interested in learning about how Pennington County is growing and changing that we have some great representatives of you know from the school system to to you know businesses to our local governments\nSo it really is getting to know your community who lives in a park at it okay so in that starts at noon and again for those who don't know where again is is taking place\nThis is happening right in the courthouse a and specifically the panels happening in the main courtroom on the top for the court house\nThe new corners of the old ... old court house yes All right um so that's a and that's this Saturday moral ready tomorrow yes it's here to hurry moral okay center Noone um after the discussion and after the discussion fades down then what's next on the air\nAnd then we have a series of 'em were counting education sessions there half hour long sessions presented by a few different experts volunteers and staff within the extension\nI'm so glad he's Johnson with home council is is going to be leading a session on declaring house and and cleaning up for the winter um our master gardeners Kim Swanson and Linda how they're going to lead some sessions I'm a camera I think we'll be talking about putting plants away for the winter and Linda we'll be talking about um caring for ... indoors during during the winter months and you know throughout the year [noise]\nUm we have some great egg sessions to bilk rag with the with the extension is going to be a revisiting the soybean data from the summer of the the trial plots that they hadn't presented and information for anyone who's interested in a and a done Nelson from up north on who's going to be there to\nTalk about agricultural myths and and uh you know best practices now and also a how to uh uh what is it animal nutrition she's talking about how to take care of animals properly and give them the right guy\nHe's got a lot of ... a good variety there to cover oh yeah the information all of this and this is the breath of what's\nAnd he's got a lot of ... a good variety there to cover oh yeah information all of this and this is the breath of what extension does here this is all the services that we offer right here in Washington County and um and again you can come and go as you like to hear right I mean it's a tried to come in for maybe to catch something you want or or just see what's going on if you have other commitments you know that's right the whole time\nAnd these are just how far along so you can pop in and and uh yeah I get the half hour session in and and get on with your day or or you can attend as as all of them if you if you want to want us to do that\nIs there a for those that want to see the schedule is there a schedule on line or something\nWhere they yes if you visit our Facebook page and so there's a Pennington County extension Facebook page and there's a pending county for each page that we've listed on to uh you can visit you can visit either one of those um I think the tank for both them it's just\nA Pennington counties tension or Pennington County for H. okay and those that take your right to or where he can say to schedule otherwise you can stop at the office and and we have some paper copies there\n... um or give a call I I'm guessing that phone number down

this is a four H. carnival right that's right yep um tell me a little bit more about that\nShould have carnivals been going on for years I'm just talking with Bob out in the hallway here before

session and then go pick them up after you're done\nUm but yeah you you just you show up to the auditorium and got the game set up all around\nA it's there's no cost there's no admission of games costs it's twenty five cents to play a game but you know if we give away prizes to more than more than I'm more than making up for it for for the cost of the ticket yeah\nIt's it's one of those things where uh for kids that have never been part of rage and really the younger kids and get a kick out of this 'cause they they come and see what it's about they see the kids are having fun helping kids and enter and bringing on games and stuff so it it gives them a kind of that for a sense of being involved with something doesn't it\nAnd that's right yeah yeah we see a lot of are a lot of our older kids will take over leading these activities and like you say it's kids leading kids and and the older kids helping the younger kids and and also like you said getting him connected into something

almost a relief because\nThings were certainly attacks at around there wasn't any\nViolence or anything so it was just [noise]\nLack of love or something like a black hole [noise]\nStarted going wrong

ready to go and a toddler you paid attention okay just wanted to make sure it [laughter] they're all on the other side\nOf the game on the air is I'm a little she's already nerve I Know I'm Sorry [laughter] so let's kick some ass this Friday night man and I'm Still waiting you to get that right to be around you saw the rhythm\nAnd one of the other side of the glass now it's time to you know I'm not going to take your catchphrase white just trying to help her bra that I got\nYou know I'm trying to get everything will get there but yeah so I Am coming from Dodger Stadium and it is hot I could just imagine the players Chris who played in Boston for the first two games remember game one was rainy game to just flat out\nAnd not talk to somebody the other writers who were in Boston too and they said it was miserable wow it was miserable and uh I Wonder what that will do to the Dodgers in their bat you know being back home being in your own bed\nA you down to you can't come in nervous thinking that uh you know you can't fall behind because that's what happens to crowds\nIf the Dodgers fall behind two or three nothing you know what I meant this route goes silent yeah like it's that they're out of a ... at a funeral and then you can lose at home field advantage ... so I think it's imperative that they get off to a good start\nAnd uh you saw the line up right the we get to line up\nWe got it well they're going to have their homerun hitters in there and not because they're skewing the analytics like they've been getting criticized and questions around like the whole series right and I don't think they're paying attention to that\nBut because Boston got right hand pictures of our ... you're going to now see max Muncie in Cody Ballenger and that's ... do you like to interact with for him all the starting lineup held up for\nGame three so this is big I felt that the energy from the early fans who were there and they were hands early 'cause I was there early and ah they're all I I didn't really see people feel like oh woe is me their work site it's not all the world series game exactly\nIt's not overlook I Do think Boston is probably the better team I mean they've been the best team in baseball year long they're playing lights out or what oil in every facet but yeah I mean what are the same data no none of them ... and we've seen certainly come back some two oh and of course\nA in two thousand four day Roberts the Dodgers manager was a big part as a player for the ales and yes yeah coming back from three oh down so it can happen I'm sure he's used told stories about that too is all you know it to get them hyped up\nA and here's another thing the Dodgers had this year they were never actually been against the wall they have come back now whether or not that will mean anything the nightmare series we'll see but what are they out aims under five hundred\nEarly in the season rallied\nTo get back into the race you know stop their total again kind of mid August then came back in\n... like they weren't going to win the division every day one like the last four games in the ... the one the wild wild card or the the one the play off one game playoff and uh when the divisions within they weren't yet while I'm game playoff\nSo they are that's something else there probably telling themselves so we'll see what happens of course you and I both picked the Dodgers and willing they were a team of destiny will keep\nYou updated too and uh so Britain tend to use out of the line up I you know what it was saying that they might put ... best at second base up so they want to get JD marceau they drive Martinez is in the lineup for the red Sox and been intending he's the guy the odd man out with no\nDeal they leave in Jackie Bradley juniors incentive to be a lot of people thought Bradley junior will because we can stick\nYeah yeah well he he lay and he's made some big hits in the postseason not always been attending I mean he they\nThey got a tremendous outfit but he's the glue in center field you don't want to mess with your right he is in the day outfield and offensive player\nSo uh yeah I get it and you got to get JD Martinez in there so I understand I understand it's not quite the analytic type move that [laughter] that ah the Dodgers have been making but we're in LA\nAnd of course last night Rob a there was a big game in another sport and it was basketball and it included the best player in the world LeBron\nCurrently currently yes currently and a guy who many thought was the best player in the world at at some point and some even out here in LA think he's the guy you really thought that code and I don't I didn't want to\nKnow because I think the bronze been the best for in a world for a good ten million ...
