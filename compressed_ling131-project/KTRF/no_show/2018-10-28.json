phones forecast for the overnight towers mostly cloudy skies with rain like laid low temperatures dropping back into the mid thirties and the day but I'm Glad you were paying attention when we were doing our show last week I make very happy yes they beat wakes sixty three the three a few weeks ago now you know Wake Forest or I don't know they could probably be\nAble to those what you've given me doesn't even that that that doesn't even quite if that's like starving and you're taking a radish and taken a bite out of it that that even close to what are you my appetite\nRight now wow that was a amongst all your analogies that was amongst them or showed what now that was terrible but the point is is that they're just not just beating teams but their blood shooting them and I think to me the differences\nYou remember two three weeks ago we came on air we talked about the kid that decided transfer out Kelly Brian starting quarterback right I think we're finally seeing why dabble made that move this could trigger Lawrence on how close did you watch the game because I'll tell\nYou I got to be honest I I was watching it up to what was heroes zero in the first ... a little bit more at the end of the first I Know clubs and got that seven nothing lead the next thing I Know before I think it was twenty eight nothing at half time I'm like I don't have time to watch the second half of this\nFor you too busy watching Purdue Michigan State I mean you could just complain that there were no good games you got to a dominant cleansing team making their case we already for bam up okay that's a little bit much but\nBy the way towards twenty or thirty seven though also so it's not like he has his numbers of two or anything like that\nYou know he's got to use and I mean is his third career start but she has a rocket for an arm\nI mean I I Can't there's not many guys that have had this big of an arm in college and I just look at what he brings to the table that defense is phenomenal I Know we don't have a a draft expert readily available to us rank they got like four guys that people were protecting his first round pegs now if they can move the ball through the air\nI'm just saying I think that they are finally starting to look like the team that we thought in the pre season that could match up with them a bam obviously has a tough this next week but I just think Clemson looks really really good and maybe they're ready to compete with the big boys\nI may give you some of the stuff on the earlier games I Hope you're not putting a lot of stock in the what happened in this for the state gave\n'em once it got rolling it was all downhill after that and\nThings are not good at Florida State you understand that thought sure that it's it's pretty ugly down there and foreign for is not an acceptable record in Tallahassee I I can only imagine what the fate for say about that so I got to a field and I guess some people feel like the team's gotta quit on today's game I I could certainly feel that way\nAlso will cleanse it or if she'd be Florida State had won three of their last for the one loss was at Miami in a game that they were up by double digits and completely fell apart\nLook I'm not saying this is a good Florida State team this was not a we're not gonna be telling our grandkids about the twenty Eighteen knows here but I also think that they are a a improving team athletically they you know they recruit well\nAnd clubs and just made them look like a Jay Z inter squad scrimmage you didn't come out of that game impressed already I Know for the state's not the bees need\nBut let me ask you this do you always talk about Alabama how great they are ... you know what's the difference between Clemens in beating Florida State by thirty nine points in Alabama beating a Missouri or or Arkansas or an old missed by the same result\nNo I I Would say you're close to that also I I I Would say there's a lot of similarities but um you should know and I think you would agree with me up for the state is in disarray and\nUh you know they're probably not as bad as the foot fifty nine to ten score up there I mean like I said once Scott rolling against them but was all downhill it'd be the ones that got the what ... what are you gonna stop keeping count thirty five forty to forty nine I mean they just rolled up on okay\nGood victory there um there is no doubt about who was the better of ... not good that's not the argument there remember Alabama's out a whole different level most so why ... why is Alabama on a whole different level well first of all as clubs in face to the sense like Alabama's ...\nNo I don't think so and I think kind of the top Fifteen that's probably a little reflective of where they are I mean they're they're not a finished product yet I Know they beat Oklahoma on that neutral field by the way\nAs your buddy ... Chris plank knows as I'm sure you guys talked about on your show that led to Oklahoma firing their defensive coordinator and they've looked a lot better so I think even in just the last few weeks Oklahoma has re assert themselves in the big twelve\nBut yeah no Texas will not be in the top ten going for it and I look at trying to knock on 'em it's Tom Herman second year it's been so long since they've even been this nationally relevant I think the key here not to go corny like coach speak but don't let this one\nI think the key here not to go corny like coach speak but don't let this one last if if if Oklahoma State holds on don't let this one last turn into two or three because oh by the way you got something called West Virginia coming to town yeah\n[noise] um I don't know what's going on in Tucson but my Wildcats rep sixty nothing in the second uh this is a very good Oregon team yes they do have to laws as a and I believe what was the what the Stanford we talked about that game uh which was a was it the ... the email to downsize write better right they have a ball\nAnd they ... they had the ball and I think staffer was out of time outs with like a minute to go and they had a bumble but they're not only had a fumble Stanford recovered it they had to drive like eighty yards and under a minute and they did it and that's how they lost\nA we know Notre Dame well we don't know or expect you know what to do to be one of the teams in the top for by the way when we give our top four are we giving our top for what we expect we think it is going to be what we expect the BCS hope for is going to be or what we expected to be at the end of the year I mean what what are we going to do out of the three\nWhat do you want to do on it how about we just do both we do what we think it should be what the\nBCS is going to be what what would I Would I Do I think I think might force probably going to be the same as the BCS but anyways I said do today forty four twenty two and\nThat is obviously you're going to be one of my teams I figured what are your teams are inside that top for a Notre Dame just taking care of business do up twenty seven doesn't get out of time I'm sure coach Kelley not happy that the maybe score twenty two in the suck it up\nAnd are those are they going to get a you know a a fun time it practice there that's for sure\nI Will say Brian ... doesn't strike me as it got very happy about pretty much anything so I Would not be surprised if he had some uh\nSome things to say I'll be interested by the way when he talked about that top for in a minute just about how the the committee we talked about Clemens in\nI Will agree with you that the schedule is a little bit underwhelming does it a team was one loss like LSU like Michigan start a head of cleansing just based on the fact that they play tougher competition I think there'll be a fun thing to watch as they reveal those teams on Tuesday\nNight we'll finish up the top twenty five when we get back we'll see what the Dodgers did um I ... into the game bases loaded into out oh well the Dodgers get out of it all the red Sox break it open all that's coming up next he's era tourism already Spanier and this is Fox Sports radio [noise]\nCollege for\nEvery humble when it comes to the LA football coverage on your radio\nWarning shots so\nThis is Fox Sports radio\nHey it's been matter here everybody's got to do list drop off the dry cleaning pickups to melt\nHere's an idea let's that save hundreds of dollars on car insurance and the good thing is you don't have to drop off or pick up anything all you have to do is go to guy go dot com and in Fifteen minutes you could be saving Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance\nThat extra money in your pocket it just may be the most rewarding to do that you do today\nIs your job sucking the life out of you wake up you can do something else information technology I\nKnow what you're thinking but I'm not a math and science person no problem no excuse is it's not rocket science it's my computer to rear go to my computer career dot edu and take the free career evaluation today\nYou could start your new life as an IT pro in as little as four months my computer career dot edu that's my computer career dot E.

insurance what are you got to do visit guy going to come for free great quote Aaron tourists aren't you spend your great sports talk radio night on the Saturday Night\nDodgers tried to make a comeback was nine for the bottom of the night now nine six but nobody on one out um if the red Sox pull this game I Will quit my job Aaron tourists\nI Will I'll Try it this way I Would walk away from fought for just no\nWay they could blow a nine point lead and I can say well the Dodgers blue and ate for leads or a for nothing lead so I think it's possible why not come on we got nothing to do here for the next two hours I I'm Down to watch a little extra baseball\nYeah that could you imagine the Dodger fans just going crazy if they're able to pull this off and uh right now they get they get a to a single by Turner of our broader on first\nStill with what out they have got a little bit of hope will keep you updated by the wouldn't let you know what's going on we'll give you our top five a little bit later on other segment also what were you say are\nAre going to say really quick Arnie I Will say uh we've been working together now about eight months and I I can count on one hand the number of things you said that were smart but you'd wow you did say they got to keep this lead to five to four imagine if they had Dodgers would have won by now I like that wow\nYeah but then you never really know and I was ... but you know what they did bringing kimbro kimbrell did start of the night which would have been the move had it been five four or nine for um well I don't know if I would've brought emitted nine for that would that's my personal prerogative but they brought him in any way so they definitely what do you use them at five four so we'll see if it pays off and\nWe'll keep you updated and we'll see if uh if the Dodgers ... one of the biggest comebacks in in World Series history or they just said Arizona sixteen aid over Oregon about three minutes left in the first half their Arizona with the ball and they're driving and Fresno Hawaii back on track Twenty one ten\nFresno reading it still in the first half there of anything in the top twenty five I'm Out of normal that kind of surprised your tummy obviously Oklahoma State with just one final their victory over Texas thirty eight thirty five\nPretty much and Texas is chance of that four team playoff but does it end bigger things for Texas has been down in the dumps for so long is still have so much to play with obviously with big bowl games on the line and and a certain finishes in the big twelve they they have so much more at the finish out the season\nAbsolutely by the way kind of one game we didn't touch on in the first hour we can get back to the the big ones the ... and the royal urges and everything you see the end of the Kentucky Missouri game\nYes how about that one how was that a little bit of crazy what'd you think about that one because Kentucky when said Fifteen fourteen low scoring game was actually fourteen three going into the fourth Kentucky gets to touch on what the two point conversion to go ahead and get the victory Wilkie to pull that without huh\nSo what happened was as you said they were down by double digits they get a hunt return late in the middle of the fourth quarter\nThey it just feels like they they're just not going to the office just is not moving the ball at All right they get the ball back with about a minute and a half left\nThey drive the length of the field they get one play to win the game they're down by five points they get one play to win the game incomplete pass but they call a pass interference and it was kind of a questionable call because\nIt was one of those throws that it wasn't abundantly clear whether it was actually a catch all ball where there was too far to bounds but\nPass interference not review bull so it allows a Kentucky one extra play they throw the game winning touchdown was euros on the clock when the game and now by the way they're playing Georgia next week the winner of that is going to be the FCC's champ\nI'm and I'm I'm started just kind of change is real quick because I don't we have a lot more college football to get to there is a runner on second and and a writer Ryan helped me out that I just see that correctly did did many Machado\nJust pull the same baloney again first of all it's not my name's second of all I don't think it was on purpose stopped calling me right around and it's not my name I don't care what your name is ... just step on me first basements leg I don't know how can I start calling you that you you just he hates me Eric because he thinks it's my fault that the Dodgers\nAre are losing but I think banning but China just at the same thing when he got a ground or the first space\nStepping on the first basements leg or which in this type didn't have it in the middle of the bag had it on the side of the bag and it didn't get them in the ... like a back of the here already but it did get him in his shoe I I'd have to see the get out of ... I just kind of caught the end of it but it looked like does it all over again\nYeah we're watching the same thing here Arnie um I'm trying to piece it altogether as well many Machado by the way not a very good couple of days you saw yesterday when he [laughter] that it looked like a home run off the bat had yeah stopped running it ended up being a single\nThey also showed it didn't end up mattering because we hit the homerun earlier in the game but when Cody Ballenger had the hard hit balls that looked like it was going to be a double play Machado stops running starts running he thankfully got to third which obviously help them get that for nothing lead when we didn't hit a home run\nBut ah he he stopped running it was a disaster\nNot the best couple days for ... by the way\nI I Wonder if this maybe I'm Crazy here but other teams watching him because he's been a kind of a low platform in Baltimore but other teams watching him\nTeams watching him because he's been a kind of a low platform in Baltimore but other teams watching him that are thinking about investing twenty twenty five million whatever it is a year for that guy I Wonder if they're changing their tune after watching them a little bit\nUm because of the lack of hustler or the way it's because of the way the incidents at first base or just\nOverall yeah I mean if you're going to pay a guy that much money to be the face of your franchise to be the guy that um you know look I mean when you're paying a guy that much I mean at the very least you would hope that\nHe would run hard to first base when he hit the ball right um and so obviously when you're a well you're paying somebody that much it just feels like whether they're a true leader or not they're going to be looked up to\nAnd I just don't know look somebody's going to pay him don't get me wrong but I just don't know if this is going to change how people view like is this guy ... we we pay him this exorbitant amount of money right you know what I mean like it just feels like one of those deals where if I'm a GM and I'm about to commit\nA couple you know a hundred hundred and fifty million over however many years I may be having second thoughts just based on kind of some of the attitude in decision making that he's had during this World Series\nAll right this is what it's going to come down to um right now there's a runner on second with two house but it's a full count on balance or or it was three one if he somehow gets a Walker gets on pace to put to runners on and they're done nine six who do you think comes up to the ... are representing the tying run\nNone other than a tweak who obviously had the big three run Homer earlier in the game so ah could you imagine Dodger Stadium going ballistic if he comes up with a chance to tie the game and a couple of runners on so we'll see what happens but it doesn't look like that's going to happen\nBecause of the red Sox have just one game for nine six passenger flying out I Believe it was the better attendee it is over and the red\nSocks of take it they did the one we want more and there'll be World Series champ Dodger fans have to do with it\nOr nothing but then again\nIt ended up nine six so can they say that they had the game and for nothing\nCan they say they slip away what do you think there and\nThey let it slip away I mean you have a for nothing lead lay in the game too it wasn't like it they got up\nWell please clean the gutters just be careful on the ladder horse race\nTo the NBA is a [noise]\nLooks to me the most type season ever shoes for [noise] are you in\nBecause we are\nHaiti to reason simply use [noise]\nBut here it's we covered this new seats on Fox Sports radio ads as one\nMan\nTo find out fast one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for detail pass pass why\nHi good afternoon or good evening how about that oh wow\nWow wow you there in ... and your um\nUm let's go right out\nThe guy go Fox Sports celebrity ... why joy to tell you about it the big moves dot com that's the big moves dot com or you could read them in Greek underscore get bored that's Greek underscore gambler it's our buddy biggest wrote or how you doing in Vegas runner\nNever better Arnie never better busy day a week and of course we have World Series action college football NFL tomorrow big underdog covers on the money line Oregon State being Colorado Colorado was over three thousand favorite meaning you had to put up three thousand\nTo win a hundred or on Colorado win the game outright a hundred guys get back around Fifteen hundred on Oregon State and that they were able to get the winning overtime I don't know anyone that had that chicken in their pocket but it would have made a nice story\nOh that's for sure let's get to the world series first uh if you have the Dodgers and you're younger you are looking pretty good it ended up with the red Sox the over water turned around um I don't know if the way the slide came out on what you'd better the Dodgers when the next three games in a row or what but it's not looking good if you're holding a Dodger ticket right now\nYeah not at all I haven't seen the the adjusted line yet they haven't put one out um it's going to be high I mean when when Boston went up to games to none\nOf it they were about minus\nFour four fifty um to win the world series and even when the Dodgers one game three uh Boston will still higher than a tutor one favorite to win the world series like even historically\nTeam that when that first two games at home they went on to win the world series almost eight out of ten times um that's a pretty high clip even um when they lose that getting three they still been able to win almost seven\nAnd um when they lose that getting three they still been able to win almost seven out of ten times I'm so I'm getting the wind today\nI think that that adjusted series prices going to be really high I doubt there's going to be any value a on Boston and I don't think it's worth taking a shot on the Dodgers either\nA this was a game they had the when and I I just can't see them winning three straight against the Boston Red Sox right now I just think they're better than him and every position and pretty much a you saw that the betting syndicates lined up and blast\nBoston up or to series they better game one they banned them again in game two\nAh so they've been doing well and books have been doing OK to in the world series and then there'll be playoffs as a whole\nNew biggest runner if a team hypothetically had four players arrested at four AM over the night before game how could that potentially a hypothetical what's going on there\nThe first thing they're going to do is pull the number off\nAnd he plays a wage earner on\nDays oh yeah that that they're afraid to take a Batman I Wish I could say differently but those days off of\nWanting to be the first they put that number out in and take a position\nAre gone and what they're going to do is they're gonna rip that lying down off the board not let anyone bet into it try to quantify what those players are worse and then put that adjusted number back up there now granted\nSome guys will get that information probably before the books are able to pull that number off and they usually get down on them at a good number\n... more times than not in today's betting markets they're just not willing to take any chances and you see that even with some ... key injuries\nWhere they're just take a game all the board or even a future off the board um until they they know for certain what the situation is\nBiggest rather what's going on with Green Bay and the rebels Rogers never been such a big dog now the rams opened up as a tipping point favorites I saw nine nine and a half now he's like you may be possibly do the ages ... to ... you've gone everybody all over the Packers on them\nYeah and I'm going to tell you why I'm surprised Arnie because as you know I put my banning accounts for multiple different groups that that when long term and right that that's what I Do um and I see what these guys back and I have a good relationship and I see Powell ratings from some of the top guys and I can tell you with one hundred percent certainty\nThat I Know most casual batters and I got tax\nFrom a radio segments I Do and from friends asking me if it was a mistake when they saw that line the Green Bay was get nine and a half whether it was an error you know because sometimes don't put a mistake up on the board and then they'll they'll fix it\nUm and I said that's just not the case in fact most power ratings of of wise guys show that the line should be even\nHigher um oh I thought\nWhat would have happened was the betting syndicates would sit back the public would that Green Bay the line would come down and then Sunday the wise guys would come in and take the rams thinking they're getting the best of it I got surprise because uh yesterday I I look into the accounts and pretty much every\nGroup took a piece of Green Bay plus nine and a half plus nine plus eight and a half that's wind down to where it's sitting\nRight now that's not public money that's wise guy money that force that that line adjustment now tomorrow I think the public's probably still going to come in on Green Bay is well\nYou'll probably get a lotta wham 's teaser for them not to lose the game at home but I think Green Bay get more than a touchdown is going to be very attractive to casual batters so it's going to be one of those cases where you had the white guys in the public on the same\nSide and that leads the books with a ton of risk a on that games are going to be huge rams fans tomorrow that's for certain\nThat Sunday night game Minnesota opened is about a point they really looks like it's one of the other way in favor of the things obviously we know how good the the seats are but the Vikings have won three straight what do you make of that\nYou ... and here's the situation there in fact if you wanted to bet that game a week ago um the the line was around new uh Minnesota minus three um and then they brought it out at two and a half and that two and a half lasted off twenty minutes and they open Minnesota mine's two and a half\nA groups betting syndicates were lining up taking that two and a half on the saints most believe that the saints are probably won and won a what the rams as the best teams in the NFL\nPowell rating wise meaning the only team that would probably be favored over the rams over St Louis ... excuse me over New Orleans on a neutral field would be the rams every other team New Orleans would be favored over power rating wise um and I think that's why you saw them take a\nThe saints tomorrow night and the thing is Minnesota's bitten money I mean the one thing you could depend on it it seems it remains been that coach\nZimmer excuse me they they they really covered spreads\nI mean they've been a money maker a silk from to see that short money coming on New Orleans is a telling sign and usually when the team's covered for in a role like that and there are a high profile fence a juggernaut like New Orleans\nYou're not getting down to be with them you're usually asked to pay a premium but because you have a Minnesota teen that's also coming in huh having won three and a real having covered three in a row\nUm I think that wasn't the case your premium wasn't attached\nAnd they took the value in New Orleans I think the only ones is the right side I mean usually back in the day it was easy you bet the saints at home you said I'm On the road you're going to cash six out of every ten bats year after year it's changed this year they play three games they've won all three ... three\nSo they're playing just as well on the road as they are at home um I think the total voted to hide a guy I spoke to they're hoping the public comments on the over like they do on most primetime games and if this total gets higher I think you're going to see by orders come out from a lot of the shrimp\nAnd they're going to take that under I'm expecting a more defensive game because you don't remember\nIf you look the saints I mean over the last three games\nThey have allowed an average of of less than twenty points um and in Minnesota you know there are good defensive team especially at home\nSo I could see this being a lot lower scoring um then that total reflects so I think there's some value on the under and I got to agree with the Sharm federal New Orleans I I Do think this is the the best if not the second best team in all of the NFL\nWas before we let you go what's going on with the raiders or it was a pick up the Indianapolis known with reborn favorite all the money on the legs but RINO for obviously the raiders or in turmoil what's going on here\nThat's exactly what it is Arnie and this is a simple case of of of shark money getting out ahead of the biting market because when tomorrow comes and that's when Ninety percent of the public that's NFL on game day you're going to the seven to eight out of every ten tickets written on that game on the Indianapolis site\nUm and if this if the books are forced to come off that three which they probably are because right now it's three minus one twenty five\nThey end up the Yankees make this massive rally Aaron Boone hits home run and win the game and it just felt like after that last they couldn't bring 'em back they didn't they brought in Terry friend Conan ended up winning a World Series the following year\nI just I mean how does a Dodgers fans feel confident that in the big games Dave Roberts going forward is gonna be the guy even if you get back to the world series\nI think the Dodgers going to have a tough decision ahead I can see your point Ernie I'm not going to argue with you and say you're wrong you are often but not necessarily on this one but I I'm kidding but I could see the argument from Dodgers fans than I Can't look at this guy I Can't watch this guy why is\nThis because that he loved one guy in two long or pulled one guy too short or you know I'm not I don't know if I'm following you because of what happened in today's game that you're based in the last two years on is that what's going on here well\nI think it's the totality of the last couple years and and I know look people are going to say that that he is\nA you know working on behalf of of the the front office in the front office hired him because they want it to work with somebody that really believes in the analytics I get all that\nBut I mean when you go back to last year starting ... fishing game seven when you have claimed her shot obviously it would have been on short rest but you know your drivers had struggled in the world series and then this year obviously pitching reviewing game too when he has had so much success at home maybe a bump them back to start bringing up rich or whoever it is\nUm you could go on and on down the list by the way we were on the other night when he brings in Clinton Kirsch off for no particular reason in a mass when they have a massive lead against the brewers it just seems like\nThere's all when we were asking for oh ... that's what I brought up the point that um he was playing shenanigans and bring him in when he's and he ended up studying queen gr saw what a couple of days later I think a\nMore exactly and so the whole point is it just seems like ... and again I get that the reason he was hired was because he understands the analytics he's working in conjunction with the front office\nBut you can't tell me the front office has gone down to to the to the um to the uh to the bench asking him hey change this guy have changed that guy pinch run this guy\nThrowing the lefty here he is using the intellect provided to him to make these decisions and I just think he's made too many bad ones on too many big spots\nI just I don't trust them if you think he's got to

current odds on the team to finish with the worst record in the NFL and we're talking about this a little bit earlier and so right now the team to finish with the worst record in the NFL is the Arizona Cardinals\nThat these are the odds Arizona followed by the giants the bills the forty niners the raiders and the colds and so if your to just go back and your to reassess\nThe pre season with all of these teams because as it stands right now the betting favorites are these are the betting favorites to be the worst teams in the NFL viewer to go back and re assess all these teams what are we looking at and and how far off for me\nAnd so if you go back and you look the Arizona Cardinals before the season there over under when total was five and a half\nSo Vegas clearly got it right I clearly got it wrong because I'm pretty sure I took Arizona to finish second in that division just based on what they had on the roster and I thought wow they're going to be better quarterback they they they should do better\nQuarterback but it's not that hard I Lived Josh Rosen I I still think I'm the same ... got some ability to to to play well at times and David Johnson's there and lay if it's Gerald and Peterson and uh Chandler Jones in ... I was wrong but Vegas got it right um the giants\nAre at seven that was their over under when Tony before the year that the New York giants were seven and what's funny about that is people before the season there were some people out there who liked the giants is a sneaky playoff team\nA team that could surprise empty people because they did have talent there and everybody assumed that the biggest issue with the giants was Ben Mac do and so now\nYou resurrect Eli Manning's career\nYou hire an offensive minded coach\nIn ... you get rid of the ... you know hanging over their head a discussion of old out back him and whether he's worth the contracting you pay him and you bring in what a lot of people felt like was one of the best players in the draft and said one Barclay it seemed like it was a quality fix\nAnd one of the giants done this week traded away two players on defense I think the giants completely misread their team much like I misread the giants because I think I had him to win the NFC East I think they misread the roster\nBecause if the giants were all about this rebuild and all about the future why didn't they take the future at quarterback when they had the opportunity and the draft\nI think the giants thought they were better than they actually were when they went into the season and now we're seven eight weeks in and the giants are looking around going\nGod we're not any good and it doesn't look good in the future is not as bright as we thought and now we've got to start slinging ... is selling a spare parts are ... snacks Harrison he lie apple I think the giants totally missed read how good they were as a football team because if\nYou're if you're looking at him right now I don't know how they're getting to seven wins so I actually think Vegas got this one wrong with the giants now the bills are six and a half that was the over under when total amongst the teams right now that are projected to be the worst teams in the NFL there were six and a half\nUnderstandable um you know Josh down rookie quarterback ...

Minnesota over the course of the last several months today we're looking at the impact\nThe epidemic is having on rural Minnesota\nI chatted with Ruth merit director of the Minnesota Farm Bureau foundation about the effects of opioids on farm country\nRural America is being impacted a we have actually even come up to the levels and surpassed the impacts that are happening in our urban areas\nSo that's a concern for the Minnesota Farm Bureau so we feel that it's really important to get out and talk about the issue find out what's going on it from a from a a a legislative standpoint from a the kind of what's happening with health officials\nEverybody's having a conversation within their own departments and their own areas but we feel that needs to be a bigger conversation with more players and the community so that's really what we're striving to\nKill me Ruth what do we know about why those numbers are increasing in in some cases surpassing in rural areas what's happening in urban areas\nWell ... and they'll remember we're talking about opiates so you know there's lots of different drugs and drugs that are being abused out there when we specifically talk about opiates um some of the reason is is that you know farmers\nWill get injured um the prescribe are often times has prescribed more than the needed amount and that dependency on that Dr happens ... you know quickly\nSo rather than um take time to go in for physical therapy or take time to really heal from an injury\nWhat what happens is they just pop another pill and then eventually that dependency happens so think of a farmer you know not often does he you know he wants to leave out farm you know that that crop needs to be harvested outside of the needs to be done in this amount of time I got this to do this to do I don't have time\nTo heal my body or to go into that physical therapy I'm just going to take this so then that dependency happens and oftentimes it's a it's a hidden problem\nThere is not resources available to the ... the individual to um take care of his his dependency we don't have the treatment facilities in our rural areas oftentimes they have to drive\nA long ways to um find a treatment facility or even just get medical help and so we think that those are some of the reasons that this is happening we we're not exactly sure and that's why these conversations that need to be happening\nUm the American Farm Bureau did a survey with morning consult and we found out that through that and this was a national survey that specifically targeted farmers and ranchers across the United states\nIs that forty five percent of ... farmers have been directly impacted by the opioid crisis\nAnd that's a staggering statistic Seventy four percent of farmers and farm workers um they've been directly impacted by the opiate epidemic so that's three and four farmers so we know that we need to be doing work\nIn our real communities um the other statistic that just really jumped out at me was that three and four farmers say it's easy to access large amounts of opiates um without a prescription what that's telling me is that people are leaving unused opioids and their medicine cabinets\n'em or you know in in some cases kitchen coverage or wherever\nAnd they're saving it for a rainy day they're saving it for that time that they don't have time to run in\nFor that nice brainer that ankle spraying or when they might need an a of a pain killer and they're accessing those unused prescription and their medicine cabinet in the state of Minnesota there were over three million prescriptions written\nUm and in terms of and that was in two thousand sixteen so I think you know we're in two thousand Eighteen so\nHow many of those prescriptions that are left on use and that's a big part of what we're doing here and Farm Bureau is that we're distributing we received a grant through\nA partnership with farmer and we're we're working with a group called a plan to get the message out let people know about resources available to them um by using a website called farm town strong dot org again farm town strong doubt dot org\nAnd also we're distributing a deterrent drug kits\nWe've given out about five thousand we have another five thousand to\nUm safely dispose of prescription drugs that are in medicine cabinets\nThere are drop off points but not everybody has access to those dropout off point\nMaybe those drop offs are during certain hours and or on certain days and that opportunity to go in and dispose or those prescription drugs may not be available ... well for ... the rural farm family that may have unused prescription\nYou know you mentioned a little bit earlier this hidden nature of the problem and I imagine the one of the aspects of the other one of the challenges is the stigma associated with it would probably make it somewhat difficult for some people to come forward and say that they need help\nIn I don't want to generalize too much but I Would certainly anticipate the bill would also be the case with farmers is that what you find\nAbsolutely I'm In one of the things that was pointed out in the um research that we saw was that sixty eight percent of Americans and and believe that increasing public relations ah which we're we're doing here at former we're trying to make that\nA public relations happen that those conversations but also reducing the shame and stigma are key to solving the opioid crisis I'm view or not you know farmers by nature\nUm have a reputation of being a strong and resilient and\nIt's that perception sometimes has hurt us because while we want to maintain that were afraid that they're of that stigma\nOf walking in to a recovery center to walk into a doctor's office and oftentimes even saying to our loved ones I have an addiction problem\nPlaying soccer and being involved with his friends in soccer really help them re acclimate to a

was really worried about him because they didn't think students take her son had a lot of talent in that area and so she was really hoping really praying that ... that things would go well for him and and so she came to pick him up at the school after\nAfter that day knowing that that either he was going to be really dejected are really excited and what you saw his face she knew it was good news because he had a really excited cited looking at least so happy it was just beaming and and he\nGot into the car and his mom said what part did you get and she said he said I get the clapping cheer

one another\nAnd that is so hard for all of you because you're Norwegian [noise]\nNorwegians just don't do that stuff doing we don't we\nBest we can do many hit somebody on the back and that's you know that's about that's about as far as we go right yeah well you know what it's okay to get out of the comfort zone every once in a while and say you know you're doing a great job [noise]\nI Love

pastor Amy as I Am saying some maybe all a passer ... wonderful you could encourage them with that right clap and cheer you've been given a gift by God and that you don't if you don't know what your gift as you can certainly clap and cheer\nRemember that you've been given that gift remember also that you've been given a gift for the Holy Spirit pulses flam a flame the gift of God\nFlame the gifted in other words let us let it really exploded fire up you may not know exactly how God has particularly gifted you you may not again it may just be clapping and cheering I don't know but God has given you a gift\nFirst steps alone in five ... therefore in ...\nBut God has given you a gift [noise] first steps alone is five lettuce is therefore encouraged one another and build each other up the gifts that God has given you we often we often they collect them don't let them use those gifts for God's glory found them into flight\nThe third reminder that I Want to give you this morning when I Want to leave with with you today is remember what God has given you he has not first of all given you a spirit of fear if he has not giving you that there are times when we can be very fearful situations\nRemember that God has not given you a spirit of fear he is he has given you his spirit is Holy Spirit\nAnd I don't know what situations you baby face that you are fearing right now I often fear for my children fear for my grandchildren that shouldnt fear I should just be praying for them gods as remember I've not giving you that spirit if you're a member of this\nA woman young and she was a small little woman I'm twenty some years old\nAnd she was a teacher or in Rochester, Minnesota I talked to her a couple of years ago\nAnd I don't even remember what the situation was I just remember her story she ... she was talking about her experience that she just happened had the the week before\nAnd she was still fresh in her mind so she is sharing it with a with a bunch of us and this little woman I talked about the fact that she had she had this group of of students and she was monitoring them and there was a disruption\nSeveral gang members I guess they had gang problems in Rochester, Minnesota of all places several gang members crashed the event and and and they were causing all kinds of problems and she kicked them all out all these gang or she just kick them out and five minutes later the leader of the gang came to her with a knife\nIn his hand and this\nThis young woman said to him I assume you've come back to apologize [noise]\nAnd the gang leader just smiled and it turned around and walked away she said that wasn't me that wasn't me saying that is it that was that was the spirit of God within me giving me courage right there she said yeah that's a God that is what God\nWill do he has given us remember that you have you have the spirit of\nWhat what pulses you have the spirit of power he has given us an inner strength to handle these situations it's not within us it's not something that we have in our cells that something I naturally have something to God himself gives to us old people young people in between people if you're trusting Christ\nYou have the power and the and dwelling of the Holy Spirit remember that Paul says remember that\nAnd then Paul says also you have a spirit of sounded judgment Denver seven you have the spirit of and power of love and a sound judgment which means essentially that you have common\nSense God has given you a reasonable cents to make decisions that need to be made\nListening to what God said to us in his word he says this dude round me thirty I said before you today life and prosperity death\nAnd destruction command you today to love the lord your God to walk in his ways and to keep his commands then you will live and increased and the lord your God will bless you he has given us all of that\nAnd so he is telling us again fight the good fight fight the good fight which means I'm not going to live\nBy the law I'm not going to live the kind of life that is filled with legal ism and full of the law because Paul ... and Romans chapter seven it was impossible\nHe tried to do the right thing over and over again and he was unable to and finally said Richard Band that I Am who will deliver me from this body of death and he said thanks be to God to Jesus Christ who's getting me victory so noisy of Jesus Christ\nAnd then run the race we have a long distance race to run run within during the race\nAnd this race that we run is run again because of the powers Franks of Jesus Christ why because we are fixing arise on Jesus the author professor of our faith before the joy stuffy forum endured the cross despising the shame\nHe endured the cross because of you because he loved it but the last step before you were the love and you were the joy that was set before him\nAnd then he says finish the race keep the faith\nAs you keep the face remember it's not something again that you can do on your own I Can't hold on to it but I can remember what God has done for me see that's keeping the faith is essentially it's remembering what God\nHas done for me is remembering what God has done for me to Jesus Christ on the cross and we remember that remember that we are we are the saved\nOnes and then as save ones standards it flamed the gift that God has given you whenever gift God has given you than into flame that the F use it and if you don't know what your gift might be\nYou can certainly clap and cheer in this day where men like Adam feeling and LeBron James are considered heroes I Want to suggest to you that\nThey are really the heroes\nHave great ability but the heroes are the tendencies of this world who have kept the face relying on God trusting him\nThose who have made a commitment to live for him for the rest of their lives those are the ones who are the real heroes and that means that you are the ones who are the real heroes as you're trusting in Jesus

we're about to watch mixture been skiing Sam Donald get it on in Chicago\nBaker may field and better office burger will continue what was a tie a few weeks ago so we're going into quarter six between these two teams and they set it up and we arrived today rich already with a game and the books\nAnd they go all the way across the pond the eagles game they absolutely had to have kind of a grounded out when and that's the way you do it against the jags eagles beat them twenty four to Eighteen and for Jacksonville a team that was just a touchdown away from the super bowl\nA year ago to play these eagles\n... back to the drawing board as far as what they can do all offensively and how they can become a relevant team in the NFL\nBut one of these two let's just call whether they're both of these teams played in conference championship games and what was on the line is one of them dropping to three and five so the eagles improved to five hundred record and that seems sub par considering where they were\nJust months ago winning a championship and the jaguars were minutes away from beating the patriots and earning entry to play against the eagles and the super bowl not months ago so this all seems very odd to to the I I don't think any football fan would've expected such a steep decline by either side\nBut the the you have to figure this out\nAt a football no Super Bowls around in September I said all the time but this it and you can start to smell the turkey it it's a roasting somewhere in the distance like very excited to beat up by the way this where football\nMatters the most part of the season of five hundred record going in looking sloppy does not bode well I'll be at that division is down ... looks looks pretty abysmal\nNo doubt at all I'll give it to Carson went though as by the way will also pass along underway in Pittsburgh Cleveland wild the ball first get a really nice kickoff return out timid field but hold everything there is a fly down so we'll check that\nOut but Becker may feel might be starting off with really good feel position were awaiting the call bear the jets are going to have the ball first in Chicago Alex Smith in company\nFirst with the ball in New York to take on the giants today Denver will have the ball first against the Kansas City chiefs in a game that we were just discussing we'd really like to watch it while that seems to have the ball and maybe the channel while the Broncos out the ball I I just the Broncos off ants I just I Can't get into it it's just not very far\nAfield Lindsey is the only good thing they got going right now and he came out of ... a dirty and he's been one of those low key fantasy leaders at the running back position but outside of in this up and says locked any dynamic a case genome look starkly different than he did a year ago and Minnesota and so yeah the struggles\nContinue offensively for a Denver Broncos team which still has a pretty viable if they get out or figure it out they may have a cheap\nAlright so uh we'll pass along that penalty was on Cleveland so they're backed up now inside their own twenty for\nThe first session but back to that eagles jabs game I I Do want to give it to Carson when the guy that we've been watching a health wise do you look the same are you playing the same as you did did you change a little bit\nWhen you're going against the Jacksonville defense by the time I woke up check this came out we're getting close to the end of the first half\nAnd at that point the score was six to three for the ... and ... had been picked off and hadn't done much but he really found a way this was a find a way a game for when\nThey open it up finally in the second half he finishes with seemingly the exact same numbers he finishes with every single week which is somewhere between two hundred and eighty yards and three hundred yards three touchdown throws you might turn it over once you did in this game but it work\nHe's finding different ways to play against different defenses and how it worked out I Know they've lost some of their games late but I feel like this was a game that could springboard them do a better second half of the year\nWell you just mentioned something about the Denver off and said I think is a it's a clear issue in the NFL when we look at ... teams in general the one that we are the most excited about are the ones with the wheat level pastors and then it trickles down from there of course a month is a week\nOr ... injured and he's coming back and he has rehab through an off season there is some Ross that needed to be knocked off the spoke to that we'll before he really could get going\nBut he threw for sixty percent or better in this game and that completion rate was well under duress you was sacked four times he was harassed all day long you only turned over the ball once in a game where you really can't do that a lot you can send opportunistic jaguars team so\nReally nice day for him also overseas and that\nAs a whole another wrinkle to the preparation\nSo Carson months maybe maybe the upsides on the other side of the gate\nAlright are looking at some of the games that are now starting to develop\nA the jets or stopped on a fourth down and so now there'll be kicking in a way to the bear so we're gonna see Mitch trip is key in company for the first time no Allen Robin ... for them today\nThat got announced late last night yesterday so they're all fans um is down a weapon however you have been touting this all fence all year long and they are starting to\nPort games together string a few nice performances together a wire you such a believer in Mr based in this office this year the\nIt's just the the genesis of this happens I'm such a believer in India you read and it's because he's such a terrific situational coach he's also again planter\nWhen he puts together an audience of game plan is looking at the defense not just for what he does well that works again it's against the book for what other teams did well against that defense and then adopting that to his own off and that's what Andy Reid has always done and now ... as the head coach enough into play called for the bears\nHas done with this astounding we counted Chicago Bears a skilled position group\nAnd Mitchell Trybulski better athlete them\nWe'll beers a skilled position group and Mitchell Trybulski better athlete them people realize someone at the un seat and it's on full display right on\nCue opening play they do or read option ... takes it runs it for about Fifteen yards and really showed some some great speed\nYeah no ... and these big and he's got a Hollywood surfer an arm and\nHe's coming along making appropriate reads improved Russians learning a new off and all these things typically take a lot longer he's not a really nice job working year one with this new coach who's completely gentrified this neighborhood which looked a little dilapidated but you saw the promise\nAnd here we are we gate and this thing starting to really roll\nYeah no doubt about it means Todd Baker Mayfield buys a little extra time finds a receiver to a convert on a third and six\nAnd the browns on their opening job are going to move into Pittsburgh territory see if they can do something we're also about to see the giants office now for the first time much maligned all year they stopped the Redskins after one first down so here comes the you lie manning in the group\nAnd you wonder you know Monday Night they were going against a a really banged up Atlanta secondary and they were able to do some things to typically they moved the ball they still didn't win the football game\nBut today back home but another test against a pretty decent Washington defense I I'm Still not sure exactly what to say about the giants all fence and how to get out of the problems that they have it seems like something they needed to address last year and they didn't\n\nThat's why I\nHome goes most some of those ones [noise] [noise]\nWhy it was the eagles broadcasts eagles radio network all day he goes if you are just rising in guiding especially in the west [noise] eagles defeat the jazz today ... twenty four Eighteen and that wasn't the only bad news that came out a lot and for the jagged [noise]\nBunch of guys also decided to go out and get arrested the night before right what have you know you're only London one well unless you're the jak venue there every\nYear well right yeah sometimes twice a year [laughter] if you're a job guys but offered a yeah look yeah I mean this is the fear of every single coach shopping some coordinator defensive coordinator you know the expectation is\nWe may get beat because the other guys are getting paid to you know sure you're going against the competent defensive coordinator or likewise an OB GYNs coordinators gaming giants you\nYou're going gets another had coaches getting millions of dollars but together as good of a team as he can and set the emotional tone and then when the off the field stop occurred\nIn whatever capacity and you're limited from that standpoint you will never get more happy tosses Ina coaches office then you will when they get upset with police blotter that says you're starting defensive end or you're starting running back or star receiver kick do today because he's in silver bracelet\nI got to wonder about this and let's pass along a couple of stores Alex Collins a touchdown run for the ravens they strike first seven nothing Philip Lindsey touchdown run for the Broncos they're up in Kansas City seven to not think a ... got ... they're off to a very good start 'em\nBut I Want is there something mentally\nThat goes on and I think that there probably is not just me and athletes I mean people when you're on this huge trip I'm thinking of UCLA Basketball team why I went to China right guys go to London we've seen it if the super bowl yup what a trip and I know these guys go on trips are almost every week every other week\nBut when it's a big trip would have something special there's almost this thought like hey I'm what's maybe just a little something extra we might stay out a little later we might go out a little bit harder the group might be bigger there's some sort of mental thought of like hey let's extend it a little further today\nI'll give you the difference so noticed the two things you spotlight it was UCLA in China and the Jacksonville Jaguars in London\nThe difference is these guys typically spend a lot of time with each other but it's relegated to work they go to the facility they train together they practiced together then they go to their homes and they go to their responsibilities their families etcetera well\nWhen you're on a trip you're going back to a hotel filled with your buddies\nWhere you're all supposed to be responsible adults and figure it out as best you can but you get together in ways that you don't normally have time to because everybody's got kids or other responsibilities that you don't you can't a tent you when you're overseas in London so it becomes\nBoy we should get together and we never do this and poor decisions get made that way and so that's the difference it's still work trip the retreat the ones Daniel where Debbie from accounting all of a sudden bang do at the gym and you're like\nWhere Debbie from accounting all of a sudden bang to what the gene why and you're like\nWell it's because normally she's got to pick up the kid through soccer practice after work in this time you know she had much time on her answer was my ties later you're making choices in what happens\nIn London stays in London a er except for sometimes not um so I I haven't filling this is going to follow these four or five guys\nAre around a little bit even though of course it all happened so fast everybody was still able to uh to go out there and play today right not well enough to win the game eagles over the jak All right very very early we're only halfway through the first quarter but you mentioned a couple of minutes ago hey\nThe Broncos still have a very viable defects are we've gotten used to Patrick malls and the chiefs coming out and just looking like an absolute show especially when they're home like they are today or they have not even so much has gotten a first down yet right and suddenly they look like they're struggling\nRight now well and think about it [laughter] it's like so you have a job who was the first round or right yeah von Miller as a pass Russia who was the first round her and these two guys screaming off the edges rocketing a mobile quarterback and the guy who as limited experience playing the position\nThat there's a lot to deal with when you don't have the experience and so some homes is going to be under duress today if uh the cheese shop and someone doesn't protect them well\nAll right uh we've got a huge touchdown and this is something we've gotten used to saying it's Mitt strip is key to to recall and four Seventy\nYards while and can I say that was about the easiest screens have Seventy yard touchdown like three Cohn is really fast he's really good at making people mad he didn't have to on that one he went through the line he turned left are basically like Hi how\nAre they turn around and he went straight up to me over Seventy dollars for its outsell screams works best when the defense isn't expecting them to be around there really truly\nHe'll play it same withdraws all of a sudden you see somebody Rochefort eighty on a drop play it's like well how does that happen when everybody's thinking you're doing one thing which is you're inviting the past rush up field and then you're off into my ... and then lens the convoy in front of a player like a three Cohen who has tremendous vision\nAnd the lead speed that's the outcome so that was as much gain planning as it was just a just having the though the horses and the rate\nWe're also got math Stafford hitting a Marvin Jones along touchdown play or there was a broken play the lions hosting Seattle today\nIn a game that I feel like kinda nondescript not a lot of buzz about this game it's a really important football game two three and three football teams that are laying in the weeds right now\nAh and I don't know Seattle's in the conversation but the division because of what the rams are doing but absolutely these teams are certainly in the wild card conversation big game today lion strike first\nAnd and there are two one at home and the lines actually have looked better uh then they have in years in my opinion I'm I'm a big believer in math Patricia\nOr the work ethic that he brought to the table when he was on the team that I played for the patriots I use the defensive coordinator this guy you couldn't beat him to the building he was just always there that big bushy beard and the pencil behind this year and the backward hat\n[laughter] he was a workhorse just like Bill ballot jak heaps falling off that tree as far as the sort of tough misuse trying to implement in Detroit\nAnd it's starting to persevere this defense is real and Matt Stafford look I I you know he's he's been great the stats say he's great it's kind of approving a couple of years he has coming up here in Detroit because\nYou know another coaching change what are we going to have a gym about good or it's called the nice often defensively they've left something to be desired if not Patricia can change that culture and they can hold teams especially in in that very very uh offensive driven division that if the north we should see more success out of Detroit\nAll right as soon as we said the chiefs we're looking a little sleepy to start off the game they're they come and they move right down into the red zone mobile homes to refill inside the five\nAnd so right now they've got it first and goal set up trailing seven to nothing now they're nice run by the age was one Adrian Peterson has the Redskins all set up at first and goal as well in a scoreless game against the giants\nThe first thing go play from the non from Alex Smith will be a hand off the Peterson he'll gain a couple down to about the seven yard line I Can't believe what we're seeing from that guy this year to leave a ball\nI you know I I Would say it's unbelievable if we hadn't seen it before now he he's just proved time and time again you can't count 'em out\nOr comes back from a vicious ... and he's the league MVP you know they just see his op ed piece of output in years where you've decided to write a mob has always been impressed and so this year is no different all of a sudden you have a situation in the Redskins backfield where it's looking fairly bleak\nAnd they he comes in and he's looking like a guy who's what eight ten years younger than he actually is\nSecond goal from the seven now for washing thin and Smith is going to dump it Adrian Peterson makes a move and there he goes into the end zone thinks they pay that made our conversation sounds super smart\nYeah you know see how a bunch of formation down low and it was well covered they had men coverage on and everybody had their responsibility hand up Alex Smith looks back to the single receiver side\nAnd that's well covered too so what do you do you go to your outlet and that's the running back but just ran like sit down route over the the left side of the formation he may one man miss and that's all it takes in the red zone because the spaces are so small that difference has to make those tackles we've given an opportunity\nAnd they did not he converts for sick\nAll right so six nothing Washington my home's out to the right side is going to\nThrow a bike or Karimov will fall out of bounds and about the forty hour lines of Thirteen goal coming up there for free winters daily go to Vegas covers dot com that's Vegas covers dot com the extra point for the Redskins is good they are up seven to nothing\nAll right sorry for my doubts their jail without a hat on the ball right there from the browns defense the ball came flying out on the run up the middle from James Carter but on the Steelers are able to recover the ball and keep it but a lot of turnover so far\nIn that game and the browns did add another field goal and now lead this one sex denouncing stick with us we got it all covered the gate and

and him seemed to have some chemistry and he is incredibly talented it takes some time\nTo build trust with the new receiver\nOr this is happening in New England with a board in the end Brady Brady was giving of use of praise the Gordon saying typically it takes a long time for a receiver to catch up to the team how to get open and our team\nAnd then just comfort from a comfort standpoint throwing to receiver when he's opening or open just knowing that he's going to be there the same happens when it's a rookie or or younger more inexperienced player who's being dependent on more in

going to join us shortly Packers rams later today on Fox may fields going for a lot of it throws deep down field intercepted intercepted by the Steelers beautiful cats right there are on a on the part of the db for Pittsburgh so no balls going right back the other way\nAnd now may feel en route those burger had both been picked off today\nBut you know and they say this all the time about a throw to the sideline give me a chance you know if you're a receiver and you beat coverage you know and and quite frankly what chief stacking his defensive back\nNo but towel away was running down the sideline and he had some leverage there if you throw the ball and give him an opportunity a high point it or you overthrow it instead of under throw it you have a chance here see breathing give them a chance on the throat\nThird down for the Redskins coming up uh in giants territory by the time out on the field first so we'll check ... coming up in a little bit and first it gives us an opportunity to

great another game I didn't look good at all to Detroit ... weeks ago [noise] you know they've had a lot of the weapons and there's often hurt Randall Cobb has been out on a more Allison that out\nBut you know the one thing that they have done I think better than most people you know even though I'm not going to be a hardcore fan 'cause a hardcore fan but do it but they were all pretty well when they decided to run but all this year\nAnd and I think that they would have a chance to do that but yes what do they have to do to keep it for being a blow out\nYou know keep the rams office off the field and the best way to do that is to hang on to the author or a while and so if they can find a way to do that I think they have a chance that it's\nA kind of unique question here just about the

Aaron Jones now the guy I have on my fantasy team who ah I had a decided not to play today just ripped off the big touchdown run so they that's just I never yeah again I mean not\nPlay fantasy football for a while I I I just I have sort of a formula and it's really been working for me but this is one of those days when everyone on my benches piling up points and the guy a blade or not how do you deal with that you've been at this for a while I'm ... ...\nYou turn to phone off or don't ya [laughter] and till Tuesday and then you just focus on the week coming up next week focus on the\nFirst time this happened to me this year where I'm looking at my pension there just piling up points\nWell the good thing about that as you know you have the talent on your team right when I go to the biggest thing in fantasy football is being able to manage your talent [noise] that's the key\nI mean this is just one of those days I mean for instance so the lions lose big today right I mean they lose at home to Seattle but I got Marvin Jones junior\nDidn't play um seven cats is a hundred and Seventeen yards two touchdowns Mm [laughter]\nI'm Crying right [laughter]\nThat may or any way or the south or to get through this er meanwhile where the two minute warning right now the raiders who were tied at twenty eight against the cold\nSo now that I'm forty two twenty eight a and once again it's been a pretty good day for a Andrew Luck twenty to thirty one two hundred thirty nine yards three touchdowns meanwhile their car hasn't exactly been shabby Twenty one at twenty seven to forty four three touchdowns and know picks but the raiders are about to fall to one\nAnd six is one in six\nHow would you value uh do you do you believe that John ... and ultimately will get this thing turn around or you you're in a couple of years\nSo you think crude and still has what it takes to be successful well in this day and age well we'll have\nTo see if there's a method to his madness because to me personally the movies made in continued to making a statement right they've all been Bush league wow we'll we'll\nHave ... because of the way he's he just has handled the situation is properly but kind of effect does that happen on your team would they devised your team if you want to come in and you want to be divisive as a head cold you get rid of your best player but then you make light of it\nRight guys in the locker room you know a guy that people respected in the locker room not only for his abilities on the field but his work ethic and practice in his work in the community you get rid of that guy and don't even give him the courtesy and the decency to talk to him\nRight that's how you start to alienate guys in the locker room\nSpeaking of a locker rooms divided because of a individual today the Steelers and I knew they cover against the browse watch out brown says is where it starts to unravel on um Steelers when thirty three Eighteen and\nIn this game James Connor twenty four carries one hundred and forty six yards rushing my guy and two touchdowns not to mention the old said sixty six yards receiving that's two hundred and twelve yards that's like a guy that used to have let me on billions to put up those kind of yeah so what is\nGoing to happen and if you were a Steeler right now what would you make of a levy on bill situation\nThey don't make anything of they've ... they've moved on\nBailing literally this coming back here I Am move they moved on whether he comes back or not they moved on and he's not on the roster he's not on anything so now we have a chart\nThey're not going to activate him or anything out there may\nNot use them I mean James Connors is is given you everything that you need if you look at the stats them with\nA living on bill and without him their numbers are higher right there\nAnd I are these you build a moment I'm writing a building\nMomentum having games like he's he's been having this year right has made them completely forget about a ... bill they're sitting here for two and one in their number one in their division so they're moving forward there they're not even thinking about you know what's gonna happen when ...\nWell let me ask you this and by the way that's three consecutive one hundred yards rushing days for James Connor I met you an ad on the sixty six yards receiving\nAll right so if he has no future in Pittsburgh there is Lenny on bell recognize over the last four years certainly is if not the best all around running back in the conversation right what kind of market is there for a living on\n... should be a huge market for him because he's someone who can you can add to your team and they can you can become dynamic right you\nAren't you concerned about a guy that comes up as a me first team second guy\nWell no because as long as there you'll be paying players to play there'll be hold outs and contract disputes right\nSo you look at the money to tide girl is making you look at the money that the other top tier running banking and then you look at the insult of a contract that\nAh the Steelers made to live your own bill right I I mean they offered him ten million dollars so did he did he might stay where they are in the it was only ten million guaranteed right\n... so our girlie is obviously set the bar would you offer girlie type money for a levee on\nBallot he's that type of running back right so why wouldn't you I mean the market value is market value\nThat what you see a lot of people are listening right now are you from there saying yeah but you're rewarding that guy rewarding essentially quit on and just not what\nHappens when you're in a contract dispute it's not there's not as simple as oh he quit on his team is not like that the only power and the only leverage a player has is one he's made himself a top tier caliber athlete\nThen he gets to demand his market value that's the only leverage we have\nAnd if you give in to the liver you sign that ... terrible deal that they offered him that was it five you're Seventy million dollar deal with five or ten million guaranteed that that's that's that's an insult that's actually less than he would make if he signed the tinder\nThe uh the the um um\nFranchise terrier I say well I I Will say this one one lady when let the bill first said he would rather retire but at that and and that he was going to set the standard for the running back position 'cause my legacy\nIs far greater a less than what I Do on the field on how I conduct myself as far as the money I'm being paid he said that I mean he set it up front no one believed him like really you're going to set out half a year lose all that money\nBut he's walk the walk man he was he ... and the talk no and he may end up not plane at all no for the Steelers this year with a\nTray deadlines coming up um\nWould be a team right now I mean there's a lot of teams up so here's the problem you know the the rams were able to afford the Gurley an air and Donald contracts because you have a rookie quarterback deal um same thing with the bears and get any clue Mac would forbid ski a quarterback on a rookie quarter\nYour home for the best football coverage on the radio waves right here on Fox Sports radio\nPat Pat's why\n\nYou'll find out fast one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for detail pass pass while\n[noise] yeah yeah that's right yeah\nYeah yeah All right\nSteve already from so um he was a guy go says just Fifteen minutes can say Fifteen Percent or more in a car insurance means you probably should have gotten a guy got out of ... Fifteen minutes ago I updating your right now on this game between the\nPackers and the rams went into the Packers had a ten nothing lead ramps came all the way back took a twenty three Thirteen lead seemingly and control except Aaron Rodgers is happening now the Packers have a twenty seven twenty six plead we've got seven and a half minutes ago the ramps have the ball and they are moving\nBy the way ... Nineteen thirty for two hundred Ninety five yards three touchdowns nope ...\nGurley in this game as a hundred and forty six yards a total yards from scrimmage a Aaron Rodgers he's good he's good as well Jamie ... even the ... the average average\nWhat what is it about him I wouldn't you I mean obviously you've been around a lotta quarterbacks over your career is from when we talk about different dynamics shapes sizes arm strength all these different dynamics we talk about it factor what is it about Aaron Rodgers when you watch them play that sets him apart\nHe doesn't panic he never panics\nNo matter what the situation in the game or the season whether he has weapons or not we've seen it all mhm\nHe just doesn't panic he stays the same and that consistency\nIn teammates know that they can count on him and things like that so it's it's comforting for your teammates were being hit the fan who knows the\nBest quarterback went on all the years you played in the league who is the one quarterback that when you gotten a little you had the most confidence\nIn his teammate\nThe guy that you know in the huddle I mean we talk about the radius of the world the Aaron Rodgers when you have that confidence in the huddle that this guy can actually get it done did you ever have a quarterback like that\nI did I um my my rookie year Chris\nChandler was like that yeah he was ... you know you might need a bottle yeah\nI'm a pro pro bowl that year I mean he was no matter what happened well we\nKnew we were going to win a game but that's just how it would do the super bowl and then I don't I don't know what\nGuys showed up there but it yeah yeah uh having three ... in a row that will pretty much take you out of a\nThat was up in the huddle when you've seen a guy do it like he did all year long and all of a sudden in the biggest game the magic gone yeah\nIt was a you're looking at them like [laughter]\nWay to make me really live on the air [laughter] yeah I started my friend sorry about that I sold the rams head of the ball seven minutes to go right now now tonight or the battle for who is the second best team\nIn the NFC Vikings who had a lot of hype before the season with the additional Kirk Cousins as their quarterback and it saves team that was victimized by fitzpatrick in that opening game but since then that safety fences come around and\nThe states had a lot since that opening game or the ... second best team in the NFC right now or are the Vikings in a position where they can re assert that so by the way the wind in this game tonight rate for this open as the Vikings a one point favorite now the saints or a to point favorite people are counting the saves\nIn Minnesota\nThat the right place at night or the Vikings still again the companies they ... they're\nIn the conversation 'cause that defense when they're at home is is is\nFerocious right I'm the tough place to play a ... Drew Brees is one of the three big quarterbacks ever play in the world of quarterback period so you can never count him out especially when you have a weapon like Alvin ... out of the ...\nAnd the ball off to them it it doesn't matter\nWhat what's happening with Arizona San Francisco I let's keep you updated on this one Arizona trailing by five there is under a minute to go the game this has been the worst game one of the worst games which you know you're in the NFL to want to six teams the forty niners leading Fifteen\nTo ten but here's my UCLA guy Josh Rose in leading the cardinals nobody else is going to be a winning drive\nFifty seconds to go and they're inside the yard light\nBurn left which often goes off from the coordinator I play with a yes or play would lift which in Jacksonville\nI show by her life which you took over for the fire to Mike McCoys still running that John Fox up and sort of Nineteen Ninety three running up the middle so they're at the aid yard line right now and the cardinals are who are dog at home I guess a one in\nAnd right now and the cardinals are who are dog at home I guess a one in six forty niner team\nNow have a chance to win this but they're going to need a touchdown Josh Rosen have you seen anything Rosen a so far do indicate that maybe there's a future\nA talent is found that there is just it's tough when it seems like the world is collapsing around you right and and that's what we're getting\nSo I'm\nA dummy go right I didn't even know who was on a on the staff of San Francisco\nI ... going wild on the forty niners sideline not quite sure why again the cardinals had the ball there's fifty seconds to go first and goal Rosen is out of the shotgun and so we'll keep our eye in this game as the cardinals tried to pull out of a rare victory Rosen thrown only eight on NGOs\nThat out of the un's food to someone who was ordering popcorn\nAnd he was for Larry Fitzgerald can you imagine what Hillary fish just trying to operate after this hall of fame first ballot hall of fame career and I'm stuck with this right now is\nHanging on is there a time when you just say you know I'm going to fall back on my University of Phoenix or a degree and just move on [laughter]\nYou know or you might as they may or maybe I stayed one year in year two long mine near too\nLong I second goal continue arches game right now again the Arizona Cardinals are trying to pull out a rare victory ... pass that's going nowhere at actually lost the yard so we're now the third and gold and nine year old I'm kind of call was\nThat I don't know it ... which [laughter]\nByron ... which has never been an office coordinator anywhere any level All right so you throw by the end zone then you throw a shot to David Johnson that loses the art unfortunately he's on my fantasy team yeah come on come up with something here I Will continue where\nA judge ... goal we're now at thirty nine seconds left Josh Rosen the rookie out of the shotgun a third and go again this is for down territory there don't Fifteen to ten he's going to throw again he's looking he's looking and\nHe got in touch down their ads\nRushed down to that beautiful beautiful pass by John Rosen on a roll [noise]\nLook at that he's got he's got a can I mean we know that about him Larry Fitzgerald given a big hug right there [noise] I don't even know who that is we've got that fast [laughter]\nI've sort of was dragging the cardinals roster any any clue there everyone has like a cow Shanahan\nChristian Kirk there you go caught the past that was an absolute missile thrown by Josh Rosenzweig over to a show the lead is sixteen Fifteen they're going to go for today is send it to a three point lead thirty four seconds left let's ... we're looking at the end this throw in the\nRams game because it's Ms Hill the room game five minutes forty nine seconds left it was thirty and six yes Aaron Rodgers drops back to pass the ball gets ...\nKnow Aaron around him up the middle all my eyes so fast how do you say\nYou don't is there any question he's the most dominant defensive player in this league no no question for sacks last week as influence of tackle for X. or defensive tackle\nAll right and they to boycott version is good to Larry Fitzgerald Barrett is so the Arizona Cardinals get the two point play to Larry Fitzgerald the future all of it like a Josh Rosen he striding right now Eighteen Fifteen cardinals so\nThey will kick off and the forty niners lump precious little time thirty four seconds left to try to get a time feel go at the very least meanwhile the Packers leading Iran's twenty seven twenty six and the rams have the ball back\nSo he got pulled this one out\nI think you can you definitely have the necessary or ... weapons to pull it out of any as we all McVeigh calling the ... yeah All right\nUh we're in the guy go Fox Sports radio studios let's find out what's trending right now is it for a play by\nPlay isn't evidence

you again or the cheese better than the rams no they're not ... but ... says horrendous they did shut down Cincinnati ... to go but [noise] yeah they didn't go over by the way against Denver today that was a temp point spread\nYeah they didn't go over by the way against Denver today that was a temp point spread and they only won by seven or ... or ... All right so you don't you buy the cheese at all I Love the G O love offerings will let me ...

about making adjustments right on the fly right period\nBut is there I mean you hockey we're always talking about hockey it's ... it's not even the same sport\nRight in the NHL regular season versus post season is the same in the NFL known is it a different game and the postseason that you have to be able to play to be successful so the rams are again are running out the clock or trying to\nAnd
