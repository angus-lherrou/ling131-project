S. right now Astros three red socks to Red Sox padding in the bottom of the seventh\nNobody on nobody out and not one and so many other things to get to but the boy what a crazy day\nIn college football today absolutely already by my calculations we had what I'm trying to do the math in my head I met this not my strong suit here we got for top ten teams five of the top sixteen if you add in Miami which just last\nWhat am I the way what what what about Iowa State was Virginia\nI said five top ... teams I Would say I didn't I didn't hear that go ahead I said for the tops and Ryan ... if you include Miami five of the top sixteen and I would add by the way Notre Dame almost sauce Texas almost lost Ohio State did not look good it was a wild day in college football ...\n... ... let's get right into it first thing I Want to ask you and I'll give you a while I'll give you a four or five upsets Tennessee over Auburn was a big one obviously LSU Georgia Michigan stay with the late score against Penn State Oregon and Washington that the going over time I just part of Iowa State\nAnd West Virginia which was the one upset that we should have seen coming and matter of fact I think I told you last week that she was going to win but out of out of the most five which is the one that we all should have seen coming coming into that\nWell I Will agree with you on that aren't you the one that I think we should have seen coming at the very least a close game it was about a touchdown spread was Georgia LSU\nFirst of all LSU has late so many tough games to this point they played Miami they play Florida they played all burn they played a bunch of big road games they finally get to come home and if you kind of look at what George has done they've struggled\nThey they won by about two touchdowns at Missouri but they had a couple of non offensive touchdowns which made the final score look bigger than it actually was\nThey struggled until late against Tennessee scored a couple of touchdowns late to make the score look bigger than it was I always thought this one was one that that could be an upset I don't know that I could ... I I that I Would have said it would be twenty points though the way that end up you\nKnow I I mean how could you even think look if I thought it was she was going to weather that I did pick that gave I would've said it was coming down to a few goal or maybe they won by a touchdown\nThey they just dominated they did whatever they wanted to do against Georgia they went forward on fourth towns they scored a touchdown that kicked field goals of a shutdown that George ... for the for the most part that was that was the first of all around ... issue right now\nI totally agree and I was thinking about something you know we we spend a lot of time on the show kinda crediting at or drawn because frankly has a lot of these big wins\nUm a lot of people don't notice when he got the job he took less money in salary to pay for the best assistance that he could get\nA LSU defensive coordinator is at the very least the highest paid defensive coordinator in college football he might be the highest paid\nAssistant coach period that guy earned every dollar that his salary kind of includes today I was just thinking about that today as we gifts to us so much credit to the head coach but it's the assistant coaches in in today LSU as you said Arnie a complete team effort\nShouldn't we have seen the Michigan State Penn State upset I mean a look it's obviously a big conference battle between these two uh Penn State's had a phenomenal year coming in but they all have lost one game\nA Michigan state's had some troubles though I mean jeeze I I\nThought at least Penn State which looks a little bit more often than Seventeen point you know\nYeah and the thing with Penn State was they were coming off a bike too right I mean that's usually when you get a team's best effort actually Tennessee today was coming off by they look phenomenal\nOther teams have looked really good off that by\nSo that was the surprising thing they're at home they're off the by their arrested but I'll tell you this I mean I think people forget Michigan State one ten games last year they were top Fifteen team coming into this year they haven't had the results that we would expect but they certainly have the talent capable of pulling off something like this so I Do agree with you Arnie\nOr that I Am not really surprised by this one even though Penn State was at home and a big favorite coming in\nNow that just leaves what Ohio State to represent the big twelve or the or the Big Ten although I Do well\nWhat about our Michigan ...\nYou know I had ... wrote them off after that that first week the block or the first couple of weeks or when they weren't living up to expectations now they're cutting back on track I'm not so sure though that they're good enough like some of the other ... uh upper echelon teams in the top for\nWell I don't disagree with that I don't think look I don't think they're Alabama I'll be honest I don't think that they're Notre Dame 'cause Notre Dame already beat him\nBut Ohio State hasn't look that great over the last couple of weeks and you look at Michigan the the the rest of the seasons in their hand I'm not saying that they will make a run but there are six in one right now\nIf they win every game left on their schedule they are going to be in the playoffs that that would obviously me by the way beating Ohio State beating Penn State beating Michigan State next week and then having to probably beat Wisconsin again in the Big Ten championship game it's a long way away but Michigan\nI think it's still very much in that picture although I Do agree with you Arnie that Ohio State is is clearly right now that seem to be\nI should I be impressed with what Michigan today I mean Thirteen seven to have I I couldn't I be quarterback in Michigan after when I saw who only broke do seven for twenty hundred ... I don't know if I could do much worse than that I either this guy's up or he's down and today he was really down\nSeven of twenty for a hundred yards today ...\nWow Arnie as I Do not answer that you could\nDo you think you could do better 'cause I I I I'm not positive you could but I'm not a lot of close to it I was going to say I'm not positive that he could have put up similar numbers\nUm I just don't know how you could do that I mean jeeze I Know they had a little bit of the running game I think I'd run every time but again like I said Michigan scored Seventy points in the fourth I'm not so sure if I'd be says so impressed uh the beat up a a Wisconsin didn't that couldn't score to get out of their own way\nWell but football is played in three phases often defensive special teams and I will say Wisconsin look I think they're pretty limited offensively but if you look at them defensively they are really really good team they came into the game\nAre ranked in the top twenty five nationally in defense and I know they're not a kind of the team that you think of you know what do you think ... do you think the highest that you think Alabama but they know what they're doing over there at Wisconsin and I think look if you want to make a point that Michigan piled on late that's fine and if you want to certainly make the point\nWent to school on time pressure whatsoever\nFor the brown fat is a lot of jobs\nWe never waffle we always give you the skinny [laughter]\nThe NFL is going job\nHe's boxer sports radio he tried to pass pass one\n\nBy one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for detail half past why [noise]\n\nHi good evening everyone era tourists only spend your mother was a segment brought to buy for miners daily go to Vegas covers dot com that may suffer covers dot com [noise] great Saturday Night great night to be on the air if you want to go and send\nUs a tweet Aaron underscore tourism ads thinking genius one white Gary says in you guys are amazing I think you meant to say I was amazing I think wow typo I think that's the type\nOf how he said you guys I mean I think you meant to say Arnie is amazing yeah I think he meant when he said you guys I think he was talking about ... I I mean are you guys that's the type\nOf that that's got to be a ... not the only thing I think it is a trust me I wouldn't say it was a tie for for what I did the um [noise] I was\nI was really good Darren ... on Twitter he uh put up the top ten coaches that make the most money in the record\nAnd of course ah ah you know the normal suspects up there on top urban Meyer seven point six million of course he's seven and Nick Saban seven point five million I'm sure that's hurting him up you know what I mean that he's making a hundred thousand dollars less in urban Meyer a gym Harbaugh seven point five million these six in one\n... jumbo fish or day them seven point five million and then you get to number five ... six point seven million for three that's not going to cut it at Auburn is it by ... you better start picking it up because er at six point seven million going for three is not going to cut it\nYeah that's not going to cut it get when you're the or its highest\nPaid coaching college football and by the way as eminent pointed out to me before the show second straight lost at home they looked miserable man and and and it's\nCrazy to because if you remember he had the chance to leave last year Arkansas he's from Arkansas they wanted him and he they they had a lot of money on the table you decided to stay at all burn and here he is obviously the fans very unhappy I Would add they still got a lot of tough games on their schedule you still play Georgia they still play ... it's going to get worse before it gets better\nWell then what do you say about some of the other coaches that are making over five billion let's just straight to Scott Frost owing six for Nebraska um and I feel bad about it because a lot but I actually feel bad that there was a North West or do they ...\nThey had that thing in control let it slip through their fingers I I don't know what what exactly is going on here I Am not saying it's the coaches you can't be the coaching or they just getting far inferior kids here I ... that never happened to the brass 'cause there's so many good college football players you can't get your fair share of Nebraska\nThat a lot of guys transfer when he first came in and look I mean they went foreign aid last year so it's not like they were that good but then he had a bunch of guys transfer\nBy the way he was down to one scholarship quarterback the yard of the season that kid gets hurt so they play two games without him right\nYeah more Keenan says back right marketers bag yeah he's back true freshman right things will get better but yeah can't get worse and it always sick strike at it I Know I Am I correct me well you don't even have to correct me but ah I it is the worst\nStart in school history which is saying something by the way they still have Ohio State on the schedule which means that there is no way they're going to a ballgame so a pretty forget about well it's it's it's unforgettable in a way but it's also pretty predictable year for Scott\nBrown and white as Libby Smith on this because I always [laughter] I'd and Illinois a three and three I Believe um look I don't even know what to say they've been so down and not for a long time a three and three I take it if I was a Illinois fat I I don't know if that teams ever going to turn it around or look\nFirst one of the year it gets to the beat Kent State\nYes I was there were ... they were losing their kids they should have the upset in that game I was watching that\nGame Seventeen to three at halftime of Korea box or I'd be lying if I said I remember it really well but ah Kent State home of a shake Spanier\nYeah my son who got his first big three is a goalie today so I was very happy I start he got well I I drove to us we go yesterday okay to watch the game because I thought he was going to get the start he didn't he got to start on Saturday\nNo no yes yes coach coach must hate you you must be a a patriots fan I think that's what it\n'cause yeah probably so uh yeah he won a three to one girl a good to get good to get his first college victory how there was about how real quick how is the\nPizza situation going for people who don't remember he won like a year's supply of pizza or some\nYeah the my son ... was a picked out of a crowd when are you\nYeah the my son ... was a picked out of a crowd won a year's supply of pizza or but at the restriction was he could only have one pizza a week so that was fifty two pizzas\nFor the entire school year are you going to have fifty two in one week or once a week um he's gone through the fifty two so it's already it's not surprised I mean a a ... weeks ago he was halfway through I mean just surprised on this\nWhile I mean he's a he's a he's an athlete I Would assume that they would\nWell the other athletes you know where they throw a party it's like get ten more pizza that don't even know that they don't they just get ten more ten more like that more\nThat freshman Fifteen I mean maybe that I Know how it's going to say something inappropriate yeah well you need a block shots or I don't know how much space there isn't that goal if you only do anything and pizza\n[laughter] ah I anyway Ohio State they wouldn't Thirteen fourteen I was watching this um Minnesota did everything they could especially defensively\nThey really hampered Ohio State in this one really opened up my eyes was Ohio State scored a lot of points this year and a dominated as pretty much scored it will and asking sue for over three or four hundred yards at three touchdowns but when you see me thirty points just setting yourself\nThat you know it's not match up here a Seventeen fourteen ... it was up by three uh then it was a a still a game going into the fourth or it was just a Minnesota could muster up in the ... and the second half of of this one so they drop it thirty for the but the fence I thought they did a real good job\nYeah and I know PJ flex a little bit I've talked to them about this team and and he said look we're really young this year but we think that we have a bright future\nAnd I'll tell you I mean you saw that just on display today they were really good in the trenches they played heart Ohio State you know doing Haskins was awesome but struggled in the ... game Ohio State I'll tell you this I don't we just kind of ... are just pushing Ohio State in the play off and they're going to be undefeated in represent the Big Ten\nFoot two weeks in a row now since at Penn State and they've been a little bit sloppy I mean last week against Indiana they won going away but it was another one where if you watch the game it wasn't as dominant as the final score and a kid I felt the same way today and I feel like you it sounds like you did as\nWell yeah but I think it's more of a one game thing I'm not going to say OK let's throw up the warning flags and maybe this is a sign of things to come and still like I said ask and had over four hundred yards so um it wasn't like he wasn't and he was one thirty four forty four so it wasn't like he was a complete and passes\nIt was just that it was just one of those weird games where at the end um they should have won by more but again like I said give Minnesota a lot of credit defensively they did a really good job\nOr through the first three quarters of this when I I thought it was remarkable so I wanted to go out and set up because other than that they they could it was just like fifty six to ten or something you know\nYeah no they played heart and I'll say this is that early in the year we're talking about the big tent potentially being the best conference in college football\nI I don't think that's the case because of the way the SEC a shaken out Texas and I'm really good Kentucky really good Florida really good but the Big Ten we are now starting to see that it really is a dog fight any given night obviously with Michigan State beating Penn State today Minnesota plane Ohio State tough\nNorthwestern coming down to the wire against Nebraska even though the brass 'cause when they played a bunch of teams stuff so I ... the top isn't as good as the SEC but day in day out outside of Rutgers pretty much everybody can can ... at the very least is competitive\nNobody had by Bob says or we could have added a six and I thought we were a because Notre Dame was losing the pet it was seven sixes have pit was winning was fourteen the six I Believe that it's still do today paid down scored bits a to point or a and then got the touchdown and the fourth they wouldn't Nineteen fourteen\nPit really couldn't must are already up in the fourth quarter in this one I mean there were four points total or not in a professor impressive performance by\nBy the Notre Dame Irish and this one a book was good twenty six thirty to put the two interceptions is what killed by a ... not a great overall performance they're lucky to escape with this one because they lose this baby they kiss a goodbye that four team playoff totally agree\nArnie I'll say this all defend Notre Dame because everyone look Notre Dame is kind of one of those teams everyone kind of always assumes that they're overrated and so when there's a performance like this there oh well this is proof they're not very good\nLike Notre Dame was coming off to really really emotional wins against Stanford at home at Virginia Tech last week a game that we you and I were watching during this game and you come home they have a by next week and you play a team that frankly you know you're better then right I I I don't know where you stand on\nYou're my favorite you're my favorite I\nI Love you hear such this tower the silver dollar for good luck\nI touch it he puts it in any way puts him three hours a day

Virginia is it like playing it you know LSU\nAnd Virginia is no object could move the ball to save their lives\nI agree a hundred percent so to me that one was weirdly the most surprising I wasn't surprised by West Virginia because they really haven't played anybody all year\nRight um Washington I don't think they also were men handled by Iowa State yeah the way that that game went down I Would say for sure I was surprised by Washington I don't think it was an upset I Vegas had a ... I think it was about a pick 'em by the time we kick off was I don't even know if it was considered an upset\nA in Michigan State Penn State we talked about like Michigan State ... they were ... Fifteen team in the pre season so I don't I don't know that anybody was surprised by that one I I think Miami to me was the most surprising and then the other one how it happened\nUm Michigan said Penn State Michigan State scoring late in the game and he goes what a twenty two yard touchdown\nA that was the difference I thought they were going to pretty much just to get into fuel goal range try to tie this thing up go into overtime\nAnd civil things from their ah I'm surprised at Penn State I had a little bit of laps there and gave up that late touched down or you know that's got to be just destroying them or is that that they had that game in their hands and to let you could say come on down and get the touchdown that's just horrible the do\nAbsolutely and for people don't remember this exact same thing happened last year Penn State had a devastating loss to Ohio State last year it was by one point this year was by two I think or vice versa whatever\nUm and then they go to Michigan State last year a and losing some crazy game was postponed by whether all that stuff and the exact same thing happens this year you lose by one to Ohio State you have a game that you should have one that you could have one you're off of by you have no excuse\nAnd you lose to Michigan State and now let's be honest the seasons basically over by the way schedule doesn't get easier they still have Michigan in Wisconsin unscheduled\nWow wow uh Roberta greetings from Okinawa it's one Sunday here\nBut you can't lose me while one PM Sunday I feel like that's like back to the future and she's going to tell us who was suddenly escape were burned recalled back later in Libya or sweet sweet later let me know when the Kansas City ... game so hit the ... there\nThere's an NFL game in London tomorrow has that game already happened or does refer to know about it there's so many once you cross the international dateline I voted for years about yeah so she\nI mean once you cross the international dateline I voted for years about yeah so she's in the future in Okinawa um so do we not I am very confused as to what\nIs that means ... NFL suddenly football's NFL Monday football over there\nIt must be yeah Monday I don't know if\nI liked that all day Monday did and it does make Monday pretty exciting then I mean think about that but you got to go to work and could you imagine it's ... o'clock on the east coast or ten o'clock in the west coast and all the games left or to drink I gotta go toward my job is horrible like VW tournament or something\nYeah I guess it makes sense why football hasn't picked up a bigger and some foreign countries because the games are going on during their work week I guess I never really thought of it like that but thanks to Roberta from the future you know that most NFL games in Asia and Australia or played Monday and I wonder if people those don't watching their\nI Love it I just uh through some of the other games that are ... that ... top twenty five ... no ...\nShould I say no problem with Missouri it was thirty to have time though it was in doubt they took to out because of uh what was it the me on the side that was hurting about you before he went into the slide but he was seen laughing\nOn the sideline so it didn't look like it was that it you know that that much of a problem twelve a twenty to sixty five three touchdowns\nNot great performance or for God that put a better numbers of that\nNo we saw we saw him walking around on the sidelines that for like you said he's joking I think you'll be fine Ernie\nI Will say though I Will say this I listen I'm not calling and upset because I'm not a crazy person but all of a sudden I don't know that I'd be that confident you go to Tennessee next week you better hope\nTo as close to a hundred percent and I know how to see who won their first FCC gave in in two years\nThey beat it ranked team in the row jeeze ... and by the way they play Georgia tough a few weeks ago too I'm not ... they're not going to pull the ups and\nI'm just saying all of a sudden that game looks a lot different on paper especially if to uh can't go with all due respect Janet hurts like he's a good player but we've seen this year why he got beat out last year why save and put them in and who the better quarterback is\nNo I I agree with you on that also by the U.S scored a touchdown mayor now a fourteen seven all over Colorado or we also political higher state over Minnesota this was a seven teen fourteen game at the half\nThe men and women to risk their lives to keep us safe [noise]\nWounded warrior project [noise]\nWe never leave a fallen warriors behind\nLearn more about what we do as a warrior project dot\n...\nNot on my watch our military service members saying as they volunteered to serve\nNon on my watch they say they leave their families behind to keep the rest of our saying\nStand firm take fire ...\nSo not on our one year we sent to the severely ill or injured veterans who can't get the care they deserve the therapists they need to walk again the treatment they need to talk again\nThe lifetime of day to day help they need to live for independent lines\nWhen there's no more government funding or nursing homes seems like the only option or everyone says\nWe won't leave one warrior behind not on our website and\nFind out how you can do your part\nThat sign W.

underscore gamblers that Greek underscore gambler edge Vegas runner I you know in Vegas runner\n... bank college football couple of big upset you know you saw a at LSU be Georgia that was huge there that was eating good for the book uh there was a lot of Georgia teaser sway you know what\nGood for the books uh there was a lot of Georgia teaser sway you know where the number two team in the country pretty much just had to win the game\nAlbum right that's what I wanted to ask you which one of these Tennessee a shoe Michigan State Oregon I always say oh which one of them had the biggest money you want to tell you\nYeah there were there were some some big I'm\nOn the dog that that came through today in in college football\nI ... the most of them that were around that\nEighteen point range tend to the race they were giving about fine but the one who had them on the line you know it was a nice little score for sure I you know but nothing tuition extravagant\nExtraordinary because it wasn't all bad high um but if you saw a lot of even around that touchdown favorites not get their California lose an outright thirty seven seven to UCLA\nSo there was a lotta upsets and that usually is going to result in a really good day for the sports books anytime they could wipe out a lot of those exotic wages that are a large part of their handle now those Caesars and money line parlay is\nIt's going to end up being a very profitable bay for them\nOne team that did hold on obviously didn't cover was Notre Dame I think I've asked you were biggest runner but I Apologize if I have one of his biggest think of Notre Dame because they're always perceived to be just over hyped very public team but when I watch them even though they struggled today I see a really really good football\nYeah they they are really good football team you know right now they're a little bit over valued meaning that they're they're not a top five team in the country they're probably top ten team in the country if they were playing Alabama on a neutral field\nAlabama would be to touchdown favorite over Notre Dame ... even though they're the number five team in the country yet that that's for sure if that was on a neutral field\nThere was in Alabama forget about it um but in on a neutral they'd be able to touch down favorite now maybe they shaded a little bit lower because the book\nTrying to protect their you know themselves and their their their manage risk so they're going to want to a accent\nAnd Notre Dame getting to touch down to number five team would probably look to appealing and a lot of public money one sign it so they might bring it out at like eleven eleven and a half but then the wise guys would be on ... and you get the public on Notre Dame but yeah most our ratings of of odds makers would make Alabama to touch down paper it\nAre the biggest one of ... let's get right to it or let's get the ... the big in Kansas City of New England um first of all how much one of the credit do I have with you because you're going to told me I get a team that's perfect the five ... and you're going to give me not only three points but you're going to give me three and a half\n... you're going to be maybe the best team in the NFL puts the patriots deepens I got a lot of question marks also the over under fifty nine and a half to like one of the highest over the regular season about job or numbers I've ever see them my wife and how much money is being picked on this game\nFifty nine and a half has left the building ... already in most thoughts my friend\nUm yeah that that line was only gonna go walk but listen this is the year where we're seeing points scored we saw it at the quarter poll more points have been scored this season than any other and if there's one market that the fish in on this planet it's the NFL betting market\nAnd it's going to evolve quickly um and that's why you saw some really high totals even as as early as last week by week fine but all of the NFL season you saw Pittsburgh, Atlanta total fifty seven last week\nAnd all of a sudden this week you have a sixty in Kansas City New England you have a fifty seven on the board Tampa Atlanta\nWhere when I first came out here Twenty years ago is run around the start us at the start us if you saw fifty one and you had the green light the bed under in the NFL and there was such a high probability of an under game if they saw fifty most betting syndicates fired on the right away so the fact that here we are Twenty years later ten points higher\nAnd you know if people are actually betting the over\nTells you how much the game has changed as far as what you're saying I understand what Kansas City but here's what you're going against with New England you're going to get a lot of trends and the fact is this New England teams only lost nine games at home in the last nine years while\nHe had very very strong home field advantage and more importantly ... if you'd is bet them in twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen nothing else but woke up in New England um whether they were at home or they were away you're twenty four and eight against the spread\nOf the five percent um it you know that's a\nPretty good a winning percentage especially on a public team like New England that the books no are going to get money weekend and we count and supposedly there's a premium attach\nSo they find pretty much telling you that on a neutral field it's about a pick on 'em you know maybe in a New England about I Am not a wouldn't even say half point better because they private three three and a half point home field advantage when the strongest in the NFL season\nSo I think the lines kind of right uh so for books are getting good to an action Arnie believe it or not and there's going to be a lot of New England money I think even though Kansas\nCity's been that public team getting love bleak in and week out five ... five and more importantly against the spread 'em in the world the will of land that you'd have in the when the ten I still think new England's that team at home that people are going to bed so I think books are going to get a ton of volume and pretty good to an action\nChargers at Brown looks like yeah openness to pick now the brown slowly favorite ... biggest something or is it simply the public loves bigger Mayfield in the ...\nYou know I actually a sad scene betting syndicates on opposite sides on this game uh early on the chargers and and later in the week on the Cleveland\nSide um I now I was surprised to actually to to see on the Cleveland signed because most would would make a the chargers power rated over a Cleveland at least on a neutral field\nOr a lot better but the way Cleveland has been playing a blade and more importantly against the betting market is I think why you're up against the betting line is why you're seeing this um I think when when the money comes in from the public and most don't bet till Sunday\nI don't think Cleveland is going to be the sign that that ends up getting the money I think the chargers will get money from the public so I wouldn't be surprised see this line drop some and I think that books are going to end up needing Cleveland when this game kicks off\nA again I it takes a while for the market to change their minds on teams and and when ... you know a team like Cleveland some bad for so long even though there for one against the spread very profitable this year um they haven't really been getting money weekend we gal\nVegas runner um Chicago was one point favorite author wrote a by I mean we know Miami has a lot of injuries now with the miners for if you want to take the Chicago Bears or you lose you lose if you miss up but uh still profitable but as one of the big wide changed\nReally is and here's what you have to remember on if you wanted to bet this game last week um you could walk through the window seven six days ago and they gave us at Miami minus one\nNo no I'm not I mean I it sounds a little anti central Florida\nI mean you know ... it's getting to a point where it'll last today by the one you got to appreciate the Nineteen once in a row and by the way I Would add this when you play the little sisters of the poor how much of how you know we we gave them all the credit in the world because of Scott Ross last year\nThey've now one seven straight without Scott Ross maybe it wasn't Scott Frost maybe they just have a really really really good team Scott brush it abroad that team with another rascal\nOr should have stayed in central Florida 'cause it's not working out in Nebraska\nI mean you know I look I don't know how many teams have to lose in what everyone's record has to be for them to be a series playoff contenders\nWhen he wouldn't Nineteen in a row I mean we kind of give them a little bit of credit right by a big boy they had they been offered him the peach bowl last year the tigers you love over [noise] I Wish they would play Alabama and let's see what they got they played all burn last year who beat Alabama\nAnd they play the you kind of huskies to open this season we must be one of the Yukon huskies [noise] kinda careful what you say five\nThere you go our top four plus one nuts my top four plus like three or four or whatever was on you look I don't know what more I could say about the white man and I know everybody's piling on um I Love you I I think he's still a hall of fame quarterback but the last couple of years have just been intolerable\nI suffer I Can't take it anymore [noise] I'm not his fault that they kick the sixty three yard field goal a couple of weeks ago\nOr against him to win that game or care why did but um it doesn't make a difference at this point one of three one for one in five\nOr the law says just keep piling up the season's over just like last year the season's over um I think oh del Beck and juniors or a clown I Would have not signed them were traded him um before the seasonal before I give them the big money or\nYou could lose with ... ... if you think you would with um you could certainly lose with them because that's what they're doing\nI just I'm losing respect for this guy but it's a complete debacle in New York right now and\nI agree with everything you said in my only real thought on oh Dell is I just so disagree with what he did with the uh ESPN interview with little way by aside\nUm you know my my whole thing is like look it's not like he's in the middle of a contract\nHe knew what this team was going to be coming back this year\nAnd he chose to take the money and by the way a lot of people every day choose to take the money choose to take a situation where maybe they know there is a better situation where they won't get the same money or they have to risk giving up something he took the money and now he's the proverbial guy that wants to have its cake and eat it too and you can't be that way and so to me\nYes we can talk about how disappointing the giants are how bad Eli has looked\nBut I also think that when you're the highest paid wide receiver in the league and obviously one of the highest paid players on this team\nYou got to be a better leader you can't be walking into the ... the to the to the locker room with time left on the clock you can't be throwing your quarterback under the bus I mean but again that\nThat to me is inexcusable how you let him walk away and not make a big thing about that they don't want to hear about he was the hydrated and all that ... that's just disgusting that he left his teammates out there by himself by by themselves totally\nAgree and I just think that you know look I Know Charles Barkley once said that I'm not a role model just because I'm a professional athlete\nBut when you make that much money you have to be a leader in the locker room and I think he's totally sending the wrong message good for a young kid likes tae Kwon Barclay just put his head down and play football and not get caught up in all that could say corn was phenomenal and he's very clear to the future that organization regardless of Eli in regardless of whatever else futures\nBy the way I think I saw a good start on that are that the giants are foreign Seventeen since uh oh Dell was on the party boat or whatever that was\nOh yeah [laughter] I Would say that's why he's dehydration spending too much time I go out there that I Love\nIs such a bomb or just the way that overall will come back we'll check it on the weight scores late news and notes gas God will have

on that but from a coaching standpoint he's always adapting he's always trying to figure it out that's what he does weekend\nAnd we got and he doesn't get enough credit for that for all the criticisms that Bill Belichick gets for his personality he deserves a little bit of credit for being able to adapt to today's NFL and he's been spot on and he's been doing it longer than anybody wants to acknowledge\nThe other guy who's doing that and the other guy who I have so much respect for based on how we approach to this season is Andy Reid\n... let's let's not forget\nWhat the Kansas City chiefs wore a year ago\nRight let's not forget that the Kansas City chiefs\nOutside of the patriots and the Pittsburgh Steelers have been to the playoffs in consecutive years more times than any other team in the NFL outside of Pittsburgh in New England after them it's Kansas City\nAlex Smith playing the best football of his career a legitimate MVP candidate has the best season of his career and what is Andy redo yeah we'll see ya\nOh we're going to go ahead and send you over to Washington and I'm going to go with this Patrick ...\nWe'll see uh uh we're going to go and send you over to Washington and I'm going to go with this Patrick ... guy who's a little bit of a wildcard ... got a great physical abilities got great talent nobody knows where he's throwing the ball from time to time but I'm going to take my shop with this and I love it that's a ... pick he could play it safe\nAnd he reads always been accused of a guy who plays that save\nA guy who's got this shutdown often and he's got you know it's just yeah you know what the chiefs are they get to a certain point and then they just can't figure it out you know what the eagles were they got to a bunch NFC title games where they could just never get over the hump\nAnd finally Andy Reid at this stage of his career I think looked around and he said to themselves you know what man I've tried it I've done the safe thing I've gotten as far as I go the only thing left for me to accomplish the head football coach in the NFL\nIs to win a Super Bowl I clearly and not going to get it done doing what I've done and I've got a great quarterback on my roster a guy who's proven a guy who's playing the best football of his career take a walk I'm going with the young guy\nIn Kansas City for everybody that's surprised by the by the development of Patrick ... homes and what he's done this season Kansas City was on ... homes for years their general manager was sending Andy Reid film in and sending him tape on pasture bought homes because they had their eye on them for a long time\nThey moved up in the draft to take Patrick ... homes that move was determined years before that because they've been watching him and he got with the right guy because he got what the coach who also\nOur coverage with clay trap and\nEverybody's hands to appraise a major deal when it gets done when he signed that five year deal I

little disco fantasy it's where you can actually watch the show almost feels like a sign will cast\nA almost feels like we're one of the Fox sports one shows except not even close um but we do have a disco ball in the air I Will I Will direct you to the right place to go we want to watch that but my comments got some\nInteresting fantasy advice on a couple of games including a game involving two quarterbacks\nWho may be the worst in the league right but it's important to you because it's an opportunity to make money in your fantasy leagues lab that four year uh ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio speaking of quarterbacks or this popped up out of nowhere over the past couple of hours um according to Ethan ...\nWho ah covers the Miami Dolphins Ryan tannahill is dealing with multiple injuries including a sprained ac joint\nAnd there is serious concern about whether or not he's going to play on Sunday as the dolphins host the Chicago Bears\nSo you're probably thinking to yourself All right so if the Miami Dolphins don't have Ryan tannahill\nWho's next step in line to play quarterback for the Miami Dolphins right now if we have a little bit of a game show music out there if we can fire up some game show music here on Fox Sports radio we have any game show music\nOn a theory [noise] so who would be next in line to play quarterback for the Miami Dolphins [noise] some of you out there looking around and you're thinking a lot more [noise]\nThat is incorrect [noise] it is not bad more we have no idea where ... more is that but he will not be playing quarterback for the Sunday some of you are probably going way back thinking about a return\nFor the Sunday some of you are probably going way back thinking about a return a return from the great ... Fiedler is it J Fiedler who's going to be the backup quarterback who will play against the Chicago Bears on Sunday [noise]\nNo no no no it will not be J fees or some of you out there are going way back talking about some of the great dolphin quarterback play from years gone by and you're thinking to themselves or what about Cleo Lehman is it Cleo Lemon playing quarterback for the dolphins [noise]\nNo no that is not that is not correct but if you [noise] did guess amongst yourselves [noise] ... [noise]\nYour\nAh the hunt for Red October could be taking place it Ryan tannahill is not available a as the Miami Dolphins Sosa Chicago Bears when you factor in all the office of line injuries\nOr it could be a blood joining a in Miami at hard rock stadium or hard rock CEO whatever hard rock cafe cares wherever they play football there that they ah did they give away free tickets 'cause nobody goes\nUm but that nonetheless we will keep you up to date as to whether or not Ryan Tannehill will play they're going to give it to go and warm ups reportedly um it could all be a ruse though it could all be an illusion Adam gays trying to get even with the team that he feels like he should have been the head coach for the Chicago Bears and he was assistant\nCan be some of that but nonetheless the reports are Ryan ... sprained ac joint multiple injuries they're not sure if he's going to be able to go\nUm they'll give it a go and ... and warm ups and if you can't the great rock Oscar Wilde will be the quarterback for the Miami Dolphins uh the game that I I really really am interested in I'm interested in all these games but\nThe rams and the Broncos um and it was in one of my knocks locks picks by the way knocks locks I was five and oh we could go see can go ahead and poo poo it and move it along and say oh it's the typical gambling ... say well where do we hear that before not everybody is eight and two through two weeks right I Am\nBut one of the things that I was talking about is\nThe rams haven't left the Pacific time zone\nLike they've they've they've they've just recently uh went and played in Seattle and that was a close game ... a game that you know maybe Seattle wins that game if not for some questionable decision making late by Pete Carroll\nBut they've never left the Pacific time zone this season so they finally do and they go to Denver and report the latest is\nThere's going to be a bunch of snow in Denver it's currently snowing right now and it should stop around kicked off but nonetheless it's a team who is not used to playing in the elements like that they do have a ton of injuries on that team\nThe defense is not anywhere close to what anybody thought and so they go they're they're playing in Denver all of that and you've also got a Denver defense who still has talent but it's been exposed a couple of weeks in a row\nAnd I'm I really am I think last week for the rams was their most impressive one of the season among all the things that the rams have done all the performance is that they put up whether it's the Thursday night game\nAnd the rams put up that huge huge huge performance against the Minnesota Vikings um whether it was a as a you know showcased on Monday Night\nFootball in week one where the rams came out and they beat up on the Oakland Raiders late and close the door and the Oakland Raiders either get last week's game\nA division game\nOn the road maybe the toughest environment in the NFL they've got a battle back several times there are two best wide receivers Cooper cup\nAnd branding cooks are out of the game knocked out with concussions\nAnd the rams when it and it's not just that they won that game in Seattle it's how they want it because their coach had the balls to go forward on for fourth down to seal the game I think it was their most impressive one of the season and then they come back a week later and they've got to go to Denver to take on the Broncos I think the rams are gonna win that game\nBut I think the elements are going to play a factor\nUh I I think they are banged up\nI think the secondary has been rattled I think there's going to be opportunities potentially for K. scheme them to put up some points who knows maybe ... is still a little pissed off that he's not still a member of the rams but I like Denver getting the seven points in that game so I Do think that's going to be a fascinating match up\nBetween the Denver Broncos any LA Rams are coming up four oh five ... eastern time kick off on Fox so that should be that should be if I Want to watch um\nThe other one that I I Can't help but notice\nIs that sea hawks raiders game in London\nThe one eastern time kick off on Fox\nYou know John ... not dumb I Know people like to pick on him and and do you like to take your shots at him he's not dumb he understands what's happening he understands what went on last week\nThis didn't get discussed a lot because it was again that was played in a soccer stadium and there are a bunch of other more important games that went on\nBut you remember when Derek car laughed at the idea of not giving the Baltimore Sun lunch at the one yard line like Seattle didn't do in the super bowl a couple of years ago what happened\nThey get to\nAsk the goal line against the chargers a week ago and Derek ... throws the ball and it gets picked off by moment Ingram and Martian Lynch made a comment about it and it didn't get discussed a lot but he made a comment about it after the game not to a pool of reporters but to one reporter who caught it\n\nI think John grew in is going to make a concerted effort to get Martian Lynch the football as much as he can and I think he's going to do for a couple of reasons one it'll be a make good the marsh homage\nFor last week to it's an opportunity for marshalling Lynch to stick to his former team\nWell when you look at the falcons they their defense is bad enough that we're going to get into scoring fast every week so Mohammed says new\nNormally a fringe third fourth wide receiver becomes a must play in this type of situation alongside Ridley alongside Leo Jones will eventually scored a touchdown it has to happen mathematically and asked her ... seven Coleman again pushed to the forefront as divergent Freeman back out with an injury\nSo you're all offensive weapons Hooper it's a\nFlip a coin depending on what else you got a tight end on the other side you know when you're talking about the the Redskins Smith is a high and\nNumber two and probably a decent daily fantasy play right if you're going to go die dive you want to look contrary and I think in some of those situations where it's not an obvious like cars Carolina certainly not an easy defense to navigate a but Adrian Peterson coming back probably get to play as your back and\nNumber two why are running back and making them all white out since he's catching bass does all of a sudden this year and they have nobody left that tells me a cars up whole Richardson probably going to miss the gift you that's that's we're starting to get dicey so Smith more number two guy but on a roll the dice that he does find someone in a day daily\nAlright last one from my arm and Fox Sports radio is fantasy football insider or you can get him on Twitter at swollen dome\nA it is ninja time I'm going to pick a couple of position they ever ask for under the radar ninja picks guys that people aren't anticipating having a big week that you look at it and go that might be a spot here the to position okay never one running back I Want a running back and then just somebody who is probably available and a lot of leagues and number two\nA kicker ...\nYou're going ... yeah this week I'm going kicker somebody out there who you can grab 'cause you know he's going to be available that you like to put up a big spot in in in in the game that he's performing in on Sunday my comment to potentially when somebody a daily fantasy and we get mock kicker is all we want\nWe tell you something I've won games in my fantasy leagues because of a kicker oh no that's it once you start getting into bonus die right that's why I like Justin Tucker\nChina goes against the grain where you may go around earlier All right we're going to take in what should be a field goal contest against Justin Tucker will get Ryan ...\nOh oh right yeah it is because we can say Ryan suck up to forty two on the west coast share a and then we go back to the running back position eventually Green Bay has got to realize Aaron Jones is averaging six yards the carrion actually give him the ball\nA and then you go a little bit deeper or we're going to go with the tag team you got Lindsey is gonna be the leader\nRush Bream and still going to have him so probably eighty Ninety total yards are going to run the ball against the rams\nThere is my comment Fox Sports radio is

disaster\nOctober twelve Nineteen Eighteen fire in northeastern Minnesota that burn towns to the ground and killed hundreds\nOf people barb you mentioned before the break there were a number of spot fires along the railroad in northeastern Minnesota is it fair to say passing trains sparked fires along the tracks\nThat's a really interesting question because there are there was a lot of discussion about it afterwards but none of the fire a couple of things the fire had burned all summer I don't remember what the causes where but there were a little spot fires caused by the railroad engines just all up and down the river lines and people just kind of lived with them and there was always smoke in the air and that sort of thing\nBut it had been a dry summer and then on October twelve atmospheric conditions changed and the humidity dropped and became very low and there's actually a map and one of the\nBooks that were a number of analyses done you know after the fire I'm mainly among other things to determine cause and that sort of thing and the atmospheric conditions change that day it was a beautiful beautiful warm sunny wonderful day\nNo rain had fallen for some time fires were smoldering in the woods and up and down the river attracts about one PM the wind began to blow\nAnd the humidity was dropping animal is law and so suddenly the conditions we came right for a disaster as just said everything together in the early afternoon of October twelve by four o'clock Gail had become a sixty five to ... mile an hour\nHurricane of raging flames is the way it was described at the time\nYou have is the perfect storm so to speak yeah and I'm embarrassed to say that I it was like I said it was brought to my attention this fire but I don't recall learning about this in history class or anything anything like that I Know and\nWell and that's a good ... there's an interesting we think of that ... you know I I think we all are aware of it um but the the the call to the looks like Kobe and dilute it was part part of it's kind of called the call came was fired because those are the towns that were completely wiped out\nFor a couple of reasons one\nIt happened in October close to the end of World War one we're coming up on armistice day and that was war knows all over the place and that was dominating there was a flu epidemic going out and that was dominating the news there was a lot going on and so even though this was a terrible fire was worse than the ... fire\nIn a way people say it kind of got lost in a rush of news of everything else it was going on nationally and internationally especially nationally\nAnd I think it's fair to say that the aftermath of this fire was felt for years and years and years after\nWhat happened you know there were lawsuits reparations\nCongress was involved at one point in our toward the end um that the politicians were about how how are these people once they signed up and said yes we've lost everything we survive but we've lost everything then how you know what were the there were a lot of court cases and they went on for Seventeen Eighteen years Seventeen years something like that\nSort of working everything working its way through the courts and tell people finally I think it was in Nineteen thirty five the co pay pine nuts and I and others too but there were the railroads were considered to be the cause of the fire and reverted ministry and it was a nationalized administration at the time because the war\nThat the individual railroads were running heroin railroads\nAnd sell it reverted administration and the railroads were you know considered to be the cause of the fire and held responsible for reparations and that went on for a long time to the courts with appeals and the Minnesota Supreme Court upholding decisions on such and such and then they're paying\nAbout fifty cents on the dollar and then people going to is the\nCongress to the Congress people they're kind of their representatives and senators and saying is there a way to finish this off and\nOn August twenty seventh Nineteen thirty five a bill for a resolution of the fire claimants gauge this past Congress and was signed by president Franklin Roosevelt\nAnd that added ten million dollars to the reparations package of the of the people and so I'm\nAt that point um the reparations the amount paid the fire suffers came to twenty three million five hundred and thirty eight thousand nine hundred and Ninety dollars and twenty nine cents and so you know about ten million from the government and the rest is from the railroad through various offices\nAnd the check started going out to people and on December six\nNineteen thirty five to ... pie and not put out an addition with a headline again big black letters things that that is paid for\nIt took a long time this fire burned fast and then everything else documenting the clams and then you know working for the courts to make sure people receive some reparations\nFor this disaster and it was a a long and an interesting story\nThings begin to my guest by summer and independence scholar oddest mendota height in\nMinnesota matters on

from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ\nAt this time I invite you to stand as you're able as we turned to Matthew chapter nine and read the gospel less than a sign for the twentieth Sunday after ... cost Matthew chapter nine versus one through eight\n[noise] Jesus has just\nBeen minister being in the region of Galileo and he's crossing over now the sea of ... to his home city he was born in Bethlehem raised in ... and and Matthew chapter for we learn that he's settled in ... which is right there on the sea of galley\nThat truly forgive you your forgiveness was one at the cross and it just continually distributed\nThrough God's word\nThe word of life and forgiveness is the product is in the proclamation of the gospel on my lips right now it is in the waters of baptism as God gives an infant faith and washes away sin\nThe word of life and forgiveness is in the body and blood of our lord\nJesus Christ which you will receive as you take the bread and the cop today\nIs word of forgiveness for you create and sustains face he who is without face is without forgiveness and righteousness and life but he who have faith has Christ\nAnd every spiritual blessing\nForgiveness of sins came through the mouth of Jesus and Matthew chapter nine and the teachers of the law were appalled how can forgiveness come from the mouth of a man in verse three Matthew rights at once someone described said within themselves this man blast team\nBut who was really blasphemy blasphemy is when someone insults the holy God\nDescribes her Jesus forgive the paralytic and instead of rejoicing that the messiah has come and he's saving his people from their sins they take offense they wrongly accused the son of God of blasphemy as if God could insult himself\nMaybe they would have been more impressed if if Jesus would have pulled out some kind of tricks some divine military power play and defeated the oppressive Romans and then pulled out some magic forgiveness Dustin sprinkled it on the ... and their friends\nBut that's not how God works the victory and forgiveness of\nGod come through humble means his victory\nOver sin death and the devil came through humbling himself to the point of death\nEven death on across his forgiveness comes through something has humble has words\nFirst Corinthians chapter one verse Eighteen says for the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing but to us were being saved it is the\nPower of God what is God's powerful way of saving you it's it's the word of the cross be of good cheer your sins are forgiven you\nWhen Christ delivers the forgiveness of sins through his means of grace through the words through baptism through the lord supper and through the absolution will we take offense at these humble means\nLike the heresy or will we rejoice will you be distracted\nBy their most by the more impressive and interesting parts of your day or will you treasure his\nBy the more impressive and interesting parts of your day or will you treasure his word forgiveness as the most precious gift Jesus knew the blast\nOf a mess thoughts of describes who in their hearts we're accusing Jesus of blasphemy inverse for he asked them why do you think evil in your heart's for which is easier to say your standards are forgive you or just say a rise and walk but that you may know that the son of man has power on earth to forgive sins\nThen he said to the paralytic arise\nTake up your bed and go to your house and heroes and depart into his house so the paralytic was healed after all\nParalyzed no longer\nBut notice that even now the focus of this whole event is not on the healing itself but on the forgiveness fins Jesus loves to heal the sick in the lame and so the fair season scribes hadn't been there Jesus probably would have still healed this paralyzed man\nBut they are they're\nLook at verse six and sees how Jesus frames this miracle\nHe says but that you may know that the son of man has power on earth to forgive since he said to the paralytic arise take up your bed and go to your house\nMatthew tells the account so that it's as if the great miracle of a man no longer being paralyzed is just a supporting detail\nTo the greater actual climactic miracle of Christ's absolution son be of good cheer your sins are for giving you\nThe visible miracle of healing was done for the stated purpose of backing up the greater invisible miracle that Jesus could truly for gifts and by the word of his mouth\nSo friends what ails you do you have physical relational emotional mental suffering let you pray for deliverance from continued to pray\nPerhaps God will have mercy on you and deliver you on to health\nAnd perhaps not if he doesn't then you must hold fast to his word promise that you need not fear any evil for the lord has with you even if you must walk through the valley of the shadow of death\nMy father for example was not delivered from his arthritis or from his heart problems or from his cancer but he was delivered\nTo heaven and when the lord returns and my dad's body is raised in corrupt trouble he will finally be delivered on to physical health what ails you\nIn this world you will have trouble but take heart Christ is overcome the world he has overcome the world by saving his people from their sense\nWhen you receive the bread and the cop this morning here the words the body of Christ given for you the blood of Christ shed for you and remember that these are given and shed for you\nFor the forgiveness of your sins\nMartin Luther wrote a small cat it gives them which we use and confirmation it's a small summary of the teachings of scripture but he also wrote a large cat it gives them which is fleshed out further in in his large cat it gives them he made reference to the lord supper saying\nThose who are sensible of their weakness those who know their sin\nThose who are sensible of their weakness desire to be rid of it and long for help should regard and use holy communion\nHas a precious antidote against the poison which they have in them for here in the Sacramento you are to receive from the lips of Christ\nForgiveness of sin which contains and brings with it the grace of God and the spirit with all his gifts protection shelter and power against death and the devil and all misfortune\nThe absolution of the paralytic should not be forgotten details of this story it is the climax of the account\nAnd the forgiveness the comfort of forgiveness from Christ's lips in the Lord's suffer should not be taken lightly but received with great joy\nAnd

scholar from mendota heights\nAbout Minnesota's worst natural disaster\nOctober twelve Nineteen Eighteen fire in northeastern Minnesota that burn towns to the ground and killed hundreds\nOf people barb you mentioned before the break there were a number of spot fires along the railroad in northeastern Minnesota is it fair to say passing trains sparked fires along the tracks\nThat's a really interesting question because there are there was a lot of discussion about it afterwards but none of the fire a couple of things the fire had burned all summer I don't remember what the causes where but there were a little spot fires caused by the railroad engines just all up and down the river lines and people just kind of lived with them and there was always smoke in the air and that sort of thing\nBut it had been a dry summer and then on October twelve atmospheric conditions changed and the humidity dropped and became very low and there's actually a map and one of the\nBooks that were a number of analyses done you know after the fire I'm mainly among other things to determine cause and that sort of thing and the atmospheric conditions change that day it was a beautiful beautiful warm sunny wonderful day\nNo rain had fallen for some time fires are smoldering in the woods and up and down the tracks\nAbout one PM the wind began to blow\nAnd the humidity was dropping and all these little and so suddenly the conditions we came right for a disaster as just that everything came together in the early afternoon of October twelve by four o'clock Gail had become a sixty five to ... mile an hour\nHurricane of raging flames is the way it was described at the time\nYeah it was the perfect storm so to speak yeah and I'm embarrassed to say that I it was like I said it was brought to my attention this fire but I don't recall learning about this in history class or anything anything like that I Know and\nWell and then there's ... there's an interesting was that ... you know I think we all are aware of it I'm at but the the the call to the looked like OK Andrews was part of the fire is called the call came was fired because those are the towns that were completely wiped out\nFor a couple of reasons one\nIt happened in October close to the end of World War one we're coming up on armistice day and that was war knows all over the place and that was dominating there was a flu epidemic going out and that was dominating the news there was a lot going on and so even though this was a terrible fire was worse in the ... fire\nIn a way people say it kind of got lost in a rush of news of everything else it was going on nationally and internationally especially nationally\nAnd I think it's fair to say that the aftermath of this fire was felt for years and years and years after\nWhat happened you know there were lawsuits reparations\nCongress was involved at one point and toward the end um that the politicians were about how how are these people once they signed up and said yes we've lost everything we survived but we've lost everything then how you know all over the there were a lot of court cases and they went on for Seventeen Eighteen years Seventeen years something like that\nStarted working everything working its way through the courts and tell people finally I think it was in Nineteen thirty five the Cole case pine nuts and I and others to that there

Gurley as much as you would think in the back they're not necessarily ... are receiving\nEnd now call whether you're in Denver and I'll just turn now to to do you turn around and say hey tod do what you do and now he goes wherever two hundred yards I mean this team is ...\nThat's a hell of a luxury um because it's tough I played in Denver it's tough for teams especially you know warm weather teams like the rams to come and play in those uh those conditions I think this is the coldest\n... game in October since the sixties or or something where\nThey came out of the blue I was listening to the rams are driving and listen to the game and they were talking about how it was sixty two when everyone landed like I'm their locations mild and then dropped dramatically so you mean you see all everybody with ... and long sleeves on it and the ... some people even have gloves on so definitely this is when you need to run again\nAnd and the kudos to the rams in a show McVeigh and just to have this team ready to go\nA ready to play up in the elements the altitudes usually wears down on you but they are you know they definitely have their boot on on you know the Broncos neck right now and they're headed into the score now it's a fourth and go inside the five sort of settle for the field goal\nBoy that's an accomplishment to come up to Denver\nOr who's in the tourists they had the best home record\nOr in the league them in Green Bay and to to to just dominated like they are\nAnd it credit the Broncos were hanging around you know staying around me I mean there are only down seven obviously this this physical looks like because he is that you mentioned that like the five yard line they should be good about it for some reason he was the mist is I mean they got a chance during his game\nBut I mean how would you approach beating the rams of what I mean I Know it's virtually impossible but what is the way I mean what have you seen if there's one little one chicken the arm or is there anything where you can say well you know if you can do that we're taking\nThe quarterback they given up five sex a so far so if if it's anything but guess what\nWhen they can hold up in the past and game they have the luxury of the beast to hand the ball off to the takes the pressure off of that off into line now you can play action you can do all sorts of things so\nIt's it's really like hey we can't protect the quarterback too bad well we don't want them throwing the ball a bunch anyway so it it it's kinda like\nYou know if you want to stack the box if you had to stop the run then of course you're going to have you know Brennan cooks and um the rest of those weapons that they have in woods in\n... it's just it's Cooper cup is just too many weapons\nAre speaking of too many weapons my goodness this score has gotten out of line that Dallas Cowboys up forty seven over Jacksonville\nUh I mean there's been turnovers galore a me that this has been a dominating game for Dallas and by the way all of a sudden they go to three to three after this game get a victory I mean and you look the Redskins are leading the division three into but then fill a stranger in Dallas all of a sudden is right back in this thing and they want to know in the division so\nUh the cowboys it's not been a great season it hasn't been the season that you you you know look forward to but all of a sudden they're five hundred and and kind of can maybe\nIt off and reset and say All right let's let's go there the next ten weeks here and finish the seasons strong\nThe problem with the ... they just don't have any talent on the outside so don't disrespect cold I'm not at a fantasy ticker okay you know you got a couple of tests do that so that's one guy\n[laughter] yeah but uh I don't even know how that below average\nA receiver or in terms of height in stature\nGreat in the slot as a bubble sitting up here to there and ... and into my bow you know I'm a ... man tell me the town that you guys have outside the receiver\nI'm waiting and you can wait for a while [laughter]\nAs a cowboys fan I can actually say you're going to wait for a while I mean think about this\nKobe easy has nine receptions no other person has more than two\n... at this is not going to work it's not going to work\nRight now big jumped on Jacksonville so Jacksonville is kind of ... but if you're in a fight and you're in a match up and they take Coby easily away from you\n... what are we doing what what are you going to do\nWell forty seven that game a few more minutes left in that game Broncos are trying to score by the way they feel go was good so that put the ramp up twenty three to Thirteen again but under just under three minutes left for the Broncos and this is where they just showed him on the uh on the television and now I'm a consumer and this is when Aaron Donald endemic to ... years back\nAnd get busy and as I said that he almost got their nice split from K. scare them but this is where they do what they do rockers sue Donald begun after the quarterback and then they take care of business and it's usually make a game winning play\nOr expect to see that from them\nGame that's going on right now Twenty one and nothing ravens just dominating the titans not a great game for the titans All right when I look at this uh what is talking about passing a hundred and Seventeen years for Mario to but if you take away the sixty two from ... I mean that in the fifty five from the ... the only have sixty two\nYards passing which by the way you feel like that should be taken away from the rush\nNo sex no because you you can't get a sec if someone running the ball or in the garage running backwards ours and you know now that doesn't work like that and then look at the ... the rushing as\nWell they only have forty nine yards so if you take away the ... fifty five yards from the sex that sixty two passing forty nine rushing that's a horrible game\nIt's not going to get it done [laughter] it's it's not going to get it done and you know\nThe titans are three into and they're scrappy and and they fight and they do all of that but when you run into team was the\nPeriod talent and you get behind it's hard for them to catch up because they don't have the type of our fence or our personnel\nTo where they can air the ball out and you know get large chunks of yard is through the air so with that being said Marquez Mario that\nHe's been injured but he's had some success in the league he's had some games where you are okay is kicking play and then he's had some games where again he is not effective\nLike today where do you come out on markets Mario to a few season you know three or four seasons and now\nI'm I I think is inconsistent some game last week he had a tremendous game\nCame out through the ball around\nThen you look at this week and it's just like a whole cage so which guy or we do our two weeks ago a against Philly which they want an overtime he uh was thirty for forty three attempts\nOr the better chance you have to recover it well ... oh okay okay the little semi\nOh yes oh he had a shot at it\nA shot at he skirted on the ground that you help in the air and then you have a chance at a ... a recovering team to running underneath it\nSo ah just to kind of give it to you how it's just I played out the kicker did a little move switch sides a little sent me a little dance and then not kicked it but Robert Woods almost caught but then about sort of bound so the game is essentially over now\nUh as the rams well hold on the rest of the things that I don't know what he's saying\nAnybody noticed that I Know it is cold out here are running out of their own out so we were just the word I are going to play the game because you don't want nobody here\nSo I don't know what they called a\nOh it's over it's over ... formation for the rams great game by the Broncos I hung around but they're going to follow the two and four and the rams will go through six you know as they want twenty three to twenty over the Broncos and I'm telling you as you mentioned this team it and say you don't have the team that they remind me of\nI mentioned this a couple of weeks ago when they were playing was the uh\n... there was a Ninety eight Minnesota Vikings\nRemember that team yeah of course you remember that you know of course you\nEnded their hopes of well have a winning a Super Bowl\nOr they just raised even better team that though you know they've been you know they they were a powerful off it you know but they just ran into a better total team did I say about a month\nFor that day I don't know if I agree with better team I think you're going to better that day I mean ... we had a bit of the [laughter]\nThe better team okay well we had two thousand yard receivers we also had a ... Eighteen hundred\nAnd forty six yard running back pay you ... your dirty birds got down\nSo we also had the number two defense in the leak there was a lot going on so when I say we had a better team yeah Randy Moss was the best young white\nOut on the money that was ... when he ...\nHe had one catching the second half for seven yards so like I said we had a bit of pain [laughter]\nYou got down to the lady like that you don't try to play me guys got down there I expected to run the last little longer\nIt will fall off literally live Jamal Anderson's wheel fell off I mean he was\nWho had a better come out of the blue tie or like a emergence him or nature on means\nWe're out of the blue you're like whoa this is special the team gets\nGoing on was pretty good in Germany it was pretty good but\nYour mall because we do mall had\nPersonality to go where they started a crazed the dirty birds so we had shirts and dances and all kinds of stuff that was a that was a movement\nThat was a movement it it it wasn't long movement\nBut it was a move sometimes movements don't have to be alone you know for them to be impactful\nAre ... they're they're showing it right now Josh Alan I'm left with an elbow injury when it's throwing arm\nAnd enter Mason how am I in the NFL Peter my hope you had a stats that we were going over during the break is hard to lease share with the people Nathan Peter ... so is it in his two year career\nHe has a passing rating of twenty five point seven is a forty three percent completion rate they saw his average pass of four point one yard they suck yes two touchdowns in seven interceptions they suck\nSo I ask you a and I don't want to make this a big you know collusion case and they're trying to keep my beliefs but there is no way by\nNow somebody doesn't Koch happening right now I was thinking about the driving and I was there you you can't put this kid out there again if if something happened to judge down and you can't he can't go out there's quarterback\nNo 'cause they're all bill fans will be riding in right seemed all bills fans be like saying this is not\nAn option but this is ridiculous but he can't do\nIt you know he he's proven that he can't do it\nRight so it's not a knock on him personally I'm just saying like it's just too big for him because he doesn't have\nBad games but he's ... he was in ...\nYou're going to win this game like he ... the one thing you couldn't do was turned the ball over what he did it twice back to back not only the first time we turned it over for touchdown do\nWhat I was like what he\nThat though as you mentioned that that's what he does he can't so he so I just I again I don't want to make it a long conversation about it it just boggles me there's no way that you're saying\nI Need a quarterback I'd need tobacco we see things happen guys get injured guy guys get hurt if you're in San Francisco as we're talking about earlier I think I was lead I mentioned that the San Francisco or give Comcast whatever cause a man that we need a backup quarterback or maybe even a potential started but ah there even if you took capital inside there has to be some\nOr maybe even a potential started but\nUh there even if you took ... there has to be some other quarterback options out there are other than\nThey did I just look at him I did when you look at it as just the last two years at that\nHe had good years mhm\nBut what a lot of people don't realize is\nThe speed in the NFL especially defensive wise is so much greater than in college so those roles as a quarterback in college that you made and you made him look easy and they were terrific\nThey'll never worked in the NFL guys are way too smart\nAnd way too fast and I think that's the whole he's in he's trying to guide the ball into places where defensive backs in line backers were concede a mile away\nYou can't do that you can't throw someone open in a small window if you don't have that type of a law city on the ball\nWhich he doesn't he does not we we definitely have seen that so I mean I just figured out to be somebody else out there um\nHey do you\nI I mean I could throw an alley to the other teams ... live just say hey here's what you want this goes Gore six he's\nHad a total of\n... let me see sixty one a ... year may pass and attempts he's had in his his brief his ... his brief NFL career and being sixty seven passing the gyms\nYou can do that you you can you can be better [laughter]\nI feel like almost go out go maybe just a bunch of screen passes but I feel like there would be a chance for me to do\nThat yeah he's twenty nine for sixty seven for two hundred and Seventy six yards you can complete more than forty three percent of your past sketches off\nBut I don't want to I don't want to talk about him like that I just you know from a professional standpoint he's not the quarterback for you buffalo no matter what's going on with\nWith um I was just watching it that was on my album he got in there yeah ... that crazy ... while you're watching a lot\nIt's Evan Bayh trying to get back in the end zone and win the game and they almost pulled it off it was pretty decent better than most of the tips that you see a game or to get through quickly before we get to a trendy a and that is the charges made and for those who are just not listening or just joined so first off we appreciate it thank you um but\nThe Cleveland Browns we've been saying that this is the team that can be five in August the team that had a you know from flu plays that resulted in Las Vegas that ... that would have won the game they had even the NFL admitting that play was that the wrong call in a play so you felt confident about the browns going into that maybe they had a chance against\nThe high pulled an office of Los Angeles chargers and that's not the case man the chargers\nI think if you did like some semblance of a power raking I mean they are to be top five right I mean there are now at forward to thirty eight fourteen victory of the brown\nA and it didn't have to be all on the right arm of Philip Rivers you only through twenty attempts and Gordon it was all Melvin Gordon today the to be a hundred and thirty two yards three touchdowns and not to mention Melvin Gordon coming out of the backfield catching as well\nA couple of catches for Eighteen yard so they they had they had a game offensively became offensive that is and all of a sudden now may start to look at the chargers who's the better team in the AFC\nWho it was a good question um I mean the the patriots ... radio they're gonna do reach we'll talk to will in a moment of course you have the Kansas City chiefs yep\nOutside of them but we know are better than that they that that's the one team\nThat is the ... and ... so I might even though they are better than\nJust a year but nobody's believing in the dolphins even though they're four and nobody's going off the ones I'm what\nYou know what I Will say this the return of ... this could be this could be something different now as as bad as broad ...\nHe is you see but all of it was did you see he threw three are passed over eighty are doing in Iraq I swallowed airing it didn't matter ... ... to that game and through for three hundred and eighty yards down three touchdown and like two hundred\nAnd something other yards were just little ... that were turned up field doesn't matter but they are for two they are foreign to give them credit for that but I took the charges over the dolphins yes I Will anything I'm going to trust for the rivers\nOver many day every day but it's still lives there he mentioned this there was the uh of course the sewers understood but I mean the charges right now man it's it's difficult to stop them\nYou know 'cause everybody we were talking about the other quarterbacks within that people were not bringing up Patrick ... could throw the ball man when they got rid of the Alex Smith I was like wait whoa\nThey want to go down with him in the game last year but Alex was having a phenomenal year so the decision had already been\nLike they were going to get this kid on the field and rightly so\nThey were going to get this kid on the field and rightly so we're seeing everything that they saw breakfast when they brought him in so I mean this kid is just phenomenal\nHe must be when you were talking about earlier the cheers of quarterbacks mhm and you said Alex Smith is like that that chair below the you know there are Rogers breeze in bringing up here so for him to get rid of the vigor about that they got rid of a top second tier guy for a twenty two at the time now twenty three year old\nThat's great and it's paying dividends for sure they're one of the only two undefeated teams in the league and this is gonna be a great game I Can't wait I Can't wait\nTo be a bunch of fun and I got to start going the cheesecake factory menu because you know how big it is it'll take me to next week
