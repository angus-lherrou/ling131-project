I Know what I did say uh-huh you remember what I said\nI said we ... we're going to buy two games for the next time we talk mhm they could be you know at the bottom of the barrel partake you'd be back at the top I did put that out there would be that accurate\nYes that was the fine print though ... [laughter] you had to get the magnifying glass out and everything\nBut I did see so you did with me was that out there you did\nBut you are doom and gloom I was a the patriots ... no no no no\nYeah well so much for so much for what I Know [laughter] oh hey man I\nSo much for so much for what I Know\n[laughter] oh hey man I've I've gotten plenty wrong myself so I Would not throw stones and a glass house [laughter] but I'll tell you what\nIt's not just that the patriots have recovered it's how they have specifically in week five because they beat up on the ... last week in week for or I'm Sorry that would be weeks three goodness I'm getting really confusing over here so it was\nIt doesn't matter they beat up on the dolphins and wait for then at the beginning of week five they crushed the cold but you get Julian Edelman back and then you also had this touchdown reception on WB the FM in the patriots radio network\n... sake [laughter]\n\nWhile [laughter]\n[laughter] they got Julian Edelman back from his ... suspension ...\nAnd he's had Ninety plus receptions three of the past four years the only year he didn't he got injured right and so to get him back is a big deal and Josh Gordon his first touchdown reception as a patriots player\nI mean those are two big assets to go along with ... yeah and it's only Michele looks really good\nToo does the guy that running game that they've been missing a almost broke a hundred yards but\nYou know\nYou really realize how dominating Rob Gronkowski is when he's when he's out there yes you know and\nYou literally ... defensively you have to change something like I it's only been one person that I've seen cover him one on one\nWithout the help over the top and that's a barrier for the ... ... he's the only one they robbed can't physically dominate when it's one on one\nUm but just watching him manhandle in in you can when you watch them you know he looked a little ... on Thursday he because he takes hard ... hard man he's she's so big when he hit and he falls he falls hard\nAnd I'm I'm just looking I'm like man can he last the whole season now that they have other officers of weapons they can take some pressure off of him because they were going to run him into the ground yeah\nAnd they use them in the running game a lot yeah he's a very cities will dominate yes yeah\nVery dominant run and pass and I was just watching I was like man if they do not take some of this pressure off of him then this is going to be a short season for Rob Gronkowski videos it is\nYeah and I'll tell you what it helps the patriots next Sunday you get the additional raft and on Sunday Night Football they're hosting Kansas City ... who is hosting Jacksonville on Sunday you know that helps the patriots when you face one of the best defenses in football\nI think that game's going to take a toll on the chiefs and for them to turn around and then play a road game nationally televised Sunday Night Football\nCan be heck of a batch of but the sheets of playing the jags tomorrow helps the patriots next week\nIt does um because that's going to be a ... game that's going to be a hard fought game and like you said the ... going to get a lot of time ... going to be able to get his hamstring together with the extended rest\nOr I mean there's no promotion shoots or anything right right if you um and then what you look at they are offering some in the pages of last week they've average thirty eight points a game\nYeah right and the vintage shown up and so now it gets interesting\nIt gets interesting so now you're looking at him like okay the three into three into it home\nRight\nMiami was a fool's gold you called it yeah I hated to do it once you do you call it in which was you know\n[noise] it was there were not worried about buffalo we're not worried about the gym\n[noise] is this kind of like the equivalent of the forty that you kind of still a little bit out for the ... that are no longer with a\nReminder remember a D. or as this bones dedicated this songs dedicated to my home is with the game still live in rural [laughter]\nMiami's gangster leaning right now a man\nThey're well they're leaning I don't know if it's ... and they're just leaning based on the patriots just you know putting on weight on them yeah ... what's\nGoing on and they they weren't ready they weren't ready for that they're not ready for primetime no no no no they weren't ready for it they thought they were but they're they're definitely not ready for that\nAnd then you look at the patriots and well we know they're ready yeah you know we were we know they're you know gearing up Kansas City bears those are going to be too great games and they get a break\nOr go into the bills so\nThis'll be the next two games for the patriots are really\nKind of show us who they're going to be for the rest of the season\nYeah and something else that stands out you know Bill Belichick jak after the game he throws his five hundred career touchdown pass and for\nAll that's been talked about Brady and ballot jak not on the same page there at odd they aren't getting along here's what Bill Belichick had to say\nQuote a touchdown passes to a lot of different does too so [noise] toms [noise]\nNo quarterback I'd rather have an poverty so this is a great job we kind of wake up you're in a year off all situations is ... ... [laughter]\nAnd tax but it's just funny to me from if you look at both the patriots and the Packers after the Packers didn't play well offensively against the bills Aaron Rodgers questioned the\nPlay calling and there was a little more subtle\nOf hey Rogers and McCarthy aren't on the same page exactly over a year\nBut it wasn't anything crazy it wasn't like candy to co exist it's the beginning of the end\nNothing like that but with Brady and belly checked throughout the entire off these and that's all you heard which tells me it's so emotional for fans\nAnd they just want the patriots the fall of ... that everybody's emotionally driven but that is definitely at the base of a lot of these hot takes in terms of the patriots unravel\nYeah yeah I mean he was clutch he will absolutely money on clutch and it was just pretty it's very similar to you know how Justin Tucker what the ravens yeah it just is so strong rate the way he\nKicks and that was more than ... than it was just on a line leading the upper right\nPeople are still do it right now it given the state of the kicker is in the league now man Morton at Seventy five [laughter]\nWhich I'm estimating him being right now because I'm forty two he had to have been in the league Fifteen Years when I got to the league\nBy the way you probably knew this I didn't he told me he played at two hundred and thirty five\nOh yeah yeah oh yeah he was in the small by any stretch of the imagination but I didn't see him at two hundred and thirty five it was solid he'll let you out to man yeah he was\nFound though he was that big he's ... he's put on about twenty pounds we're talking about tacos and all kinds of stuff that was said all this stuff they put on his tacos 'cause it was national taco day on Thursday\nAnd so we're having this random conversation and I'm like how many pounds have you back done since you're playing days more than you've thrown on like coleslaw on TALK those you know as I Am about twenty pounds about two fifty five right now I played at two thirty five I was like what he played at two thirty five that's crazy\nOr he hid it well yeah I use in good shape\nSo so limited ... Morton came into the league in Nineteen eighty two\nMiles drafted by the saints I got into the league in Nineteen Ninety eight [laughter] here if I eat short changed him a couple of years right yeah\nYeah and he left the league in two thousand seven so from eighty to two thousand and seven Morton Anderson was in the national football league yeah come on man let's\nThink about vinegar theory it's very similar with him he's been around since Ninety six\nCrazy yeah that's that's nuts man\nIt is and for both of them to be so good ... good ... ... yeah that's ...\nThat's what you want from your kicker though like you want that you want the don't worry about the guys I got it\nThat's right that's right a lot of teams could use that right now there's no doubt are coming up next the guy go studios it's one of the best individual match ups of the football weekend I'm Brian no easy from ...

tomorrow against the jets\n[noise] um it's possible like well I I never liked to that's a tough that's a tough you know gamble or ... for me because anything can happen in those games right tipped pass perfect parents receiver tips you didn't do the air\nIt to ramp these hand so it's not like you know do I think you'll grow a clean pigs six or ... or a clean intercepted and he's been very cautious with the ball kind of like we saw jak press got his rookie season\nA window I'm I'm a\nCarson went to his his rookie year just very cautious with the ball and a lot of people who are considering\nA more homes as a rookie not realizing that they know it but it doesn't feel like it because he didn't play at all last year except for that last game but he\nIs playing the way he's playing because he had a full year under a good quarterback and he was able to learn how to be a pro\nThat in itself is valuable for young quarterback and it it I mean it it means so much for him to get all of those represent entire season of reps in learning in film study\nSo where he's out here now we're like oh okay well we know why they drafted him we'd get why they wanted to remember they wanted to put them in the in the game but Alex Smith was on fire last year\nHe played great yeah ... ... I think it's funny because I agree with you eat from where\nPatrick homes that helped him to sit a full season and it's just funny to me because some people are calling out ... Jackson for not starting Baker Mayfield from week one\nAnd it's like if we're going to praise Andy Reid and attribute some of the success that Holmes is enjoying this year to him sitting out every game but one start last season why would we turn around and crushed Hugh Jackson for not starting Baker Mayfield a couple of weeks earlier\nI um because no one considered derived tailor the caliber of quarterback sure that should be studied\nMy ... my I have a right but I myself have thought Baker could get some valuable information whether even if it was what not to do\nRight we know ride was cautious with the ball you know he didn't ... and his career as a starter he didn't turn the ball over a lot right so there were certain things that you can take from his plane that you use and and learn from it just so happened that the injury happen\nAnd you know they were just on the cusp there were close this was a good situation to get him in the game now an acclimated it's his team now hopefully for the next ten years\nBut when you have someone like a Alex Smith that you have your quarterback blame a high then yeah you want him to to learn right because it's one thing about Alex he's professional\nHe's accurate and he's a leader we know throughout history even in San Francisco even when he was position was taken from Mumbai hardball\nHe was leading league in in a bass and completion presented it just what he was he was very accurate and he was very protective of the football those are great qualities are young quarterback can learn from\nThey are they definitely are and I just started thinking about that where\nSome of the quarterbacks that have had success sitting for a little bit you have to look at who they're sitting behind\nBecause you start thinking about Aaron Rodgers behind Brett Farr if you think about Phil Rivers behind Drew Brees it's rarely a good quarterback who's ... a year or two behind a ... you know normally I rarely good quarterback that they're behind\nSo you like like Josh Allen sitting behind a native ... that's when that's not doing anything for right\nYeah I there is something to be said for a kid you're going to learn the most on the job I think you can go the other way 'cause they're the David Carr situation when he goes there with the\nExpansion team at the Houston Texans and he's just a ping ... back there\nHe developed a lot of bad habits so it's a whole set of circumstances whether it's good to start the guy right away or give them a little bit of time on the bench and let them go that way I just find a dynamic interesting where my home that we give we attribute some of his success to that\nAnd yet you Jackson will get called out for not starting Baker Mayfield from the get go but let's move on from that from and I think that if you look at this week\nThe week that was the Baker Mayfield loves fast is officially out of control [laughter]\nAlthough I think all the people that went from the Jimmy ... bandwagon there like I don't know if\nThey had a home where they have to we go we are jump on your ...\nSomewhere [laughter] but no one driving that are gay where\nDo we go [laughter] oh but they're the bedroom I feel bad when you go yeah on it that's exactly what has happened Brett Farr\nOn serious XM NFL radio he is on the Baker bandwagon\nSort of winners they just have it you know some may call it talking as somebody call it over confident some makeup you call it whatever you want but two winners have that little bit of air about him and how they care of themselves and then they're probably making ability and just held to me are equally as important\nAs you could just see a heightened uh enthusiasm when that players in the gang\nHe's now he's not wrong that's a tangible thing like really really is it is but the thing I I Would point to a couple of players in terms of confidence cocky notice that didn't do anything in the NFL I Would point to same CBO mhm\nAnything in the NFL I Would point to same CBO mhm who just ... it into the Florida ring of honor he\nDid that I'm being in the NFL he\nDid have a I mean you can minimize it because it was a small sample size\nBut he did something no one thought he could do now we know he's not a good thrower of the football\nThat's ... ... we ... we know that but it was something about him that his teammates and his head coach\nBought into\nThat allowed them to get to the play offs and then when they playoff game against a ferocious Stiller defense\nI hear you okay they we have six game\nWhen you hit it varies you can argue that like so no matter how you feel about it that is what happened like it's not\nLike nothing came after that because he was pretty much out of the league after that but we can't we can't as much as we didn't want that to happen or didn't like to watch it we now we can't take that away from it I thought it was fantastic to watch but that guy was the first round hit that the thing was crazy you can\nGet the return on that and then it was he the twenty fifth overall peculiar takes after the Mary in St Thomas and you know that you didn't get the return on that I'll give you a better example\nConfident talking is didn't do Jack in the NFL Ryan Leaf\nGuy yeah that guy exude confidence\nUntil he couldn't play and all of a sudden just fell apart so I let you make your main field and I say yeah he's got some of those tangible qualities\nHundreds your family hunting camp or club with the specials this month of universal screen friend with hunting caps regular in camel six Seventy

playing\nIt doesn't matter who they are playing what we know where it will always know where's for effect is UCF will not be going down and as a matter of fact they will extend the nation's longest one street to Eighteen games\nIn a in why would that be because they're playing hot garbage especially if that's what they're doing let's I Want to look at their schedule real real quickly here I'm just ... alright hot trash hot garbage smoldering mess\nI don't want to say what I was about to say right the view that red beret [laughter] I'll just censor myself but it's a terrible schedule man it's brutal and I hate to say that because I don't want to take credit away from UCF she loves taking it away from them though you hate them\nI if they played a legitimate schedule if they beat one team\nThat was highly ranked I'd say that's a big time when right there but then we have to wait until the bowl that's the problem [laughter] I I Can't give them brownie points and act as if they're playing a schedule I understand that would yet but you also can't take away from a team\nWho hasn't lost in a year to I like ... can based on who the no no you can't do that I can and I am\nNot because every same players I mean they you know you can't do that if I if they go on to read it again this year and it's two years in a row where they have lost the game you can't just be I mean that's hard to do no matter what type of Alabama can't do that\nIf they played UCF scheduled they [laughter] they could here's this then you also\nHave to recognize the the level of talent UCF doesn't have the level of talent Alabama has they don't have the right name recruit Alabama recruiting NFL players out of high school\nOkay great so when the F is is it ... they have a budget to maybe a three star guy and that shows you how bad their schedule is now but I'm Talking about putting the team together and winning every game\nThe talent pool is the same for that conference this the same ... Italian POWs the same no why not ... the talent pool for the SEC is the same for the big twelve for the\nSoils you this is hey everybody recruits the same you think Ohio State recruits the same as Illinois you think that no they would want to Illinois would want to write but ... Illinois will remain players that does not get what\nThe the they go visit those same kids right and you see after getting the kid or what I'm saying is the talent pool is the same they're letting the kids from that area in from that's what they're recruiting just like everybody else in that a conference\n... but I'm telling you said although they're fishing in the same lake like choose knows the fish are they actually using they made is that they're using bait [laughter]\nRight there used to be actually ...\nThe ... yeah you've got like ... SMU just yeah I said all lower their ... or ... I mean you're off this piece of my shirt and let's see if we get in trouble\nWith well there's a the ... I don't know what's going on uh\nUh uh gosh I'm not ...\nBy the way real quickly we'll get back to the college football I wanted to say this to you from so I'm going to be doing an NBA three points shooting contest this week so this goes back a couple of weeks were Gilbert Arenas he took a hundred NBA three pointers and hit Ninety five\nAnd I had said something like I can make a good thirty thirty five and so my producer with out of work crazy audio ... out of a hundred NBA shocking Moshe\nI don't think like a legitimately get to forty no lovely Christina now we've gone out we put in the work [laughter] forty is within reach big man\nFor [noise] where do you tell me you're going to shoot forty percent from the three point line in the NBA yes what'd you say above average by a mile average I think is right around thirty seven percent\nYeah but those dudes are running conditioning comes into play there being guarded\nHere but they're they're ... they're that's what they're shooting so that part of it is is what it is it's part of that right but\nDo they do is if you gave him a hundred shots uncontested they're going to be drilling shots left and right now it'd be hitting thirty seven percent you know it's different\nYeah I'm saying that to say that [laughter] it is not a shot in heck\nWow that what\nVets you're going to hit forty percent of your threes I don't care if no one knows when no it I don't ... you know [laughter] when are you doing this it'll be Wednesday oh I Can't wait are we going to film this hour we\nYes it'll be film he documented the whole thing has rebounded for you ... ... if Christina there I think she has to work that day as of right now\nYou have a ball Iraq or you just off the ... or you know will\nBe a couple of people from the from the studio\nOkay well but what I'm asking is it a shooting off the rebound are you shooting off\nShe marry ball wreck you out I mean gotcha yeah like it is in a timed type deal so but not the time what rebounded pass it out okay see\nBecause it's a difference between catching a ball and shooting then picking it up and shooting there's a difference yeah so what's your I was asking what what are you more comfortable with\nI'll probably get the rebound in a row you know if I'll think about if I take a dribble are not\nBeing what don't what what'd you shouldn't do with triple because there's going to throw your rhythm off so if you're just if you're just a stationary shooter you don't want to dribble\nI'm good either way men nominate drill no you're not or what\nNot you're not good any either way but I'm going down I'm just trying to give you some tips man right find out if you want a stationary ball rag or do you want to catch an issue in our\nI find out if you want a stationary ball rag or do you want to catch in shoot and are we standing one position or are we movie\nI can go wherever beyond all three point line what it is you're just try it on a favorite spot\nWhere straight away by the straight away okay\nThere in the short corner three is the easiest right but that shooting from the shore corner you it takes precision because they can look\nThere's no bad boys no yeah no guy no base right right no backdrop really right man ... how many I say you get twenty if that money come over Fifteen and twenty\nWow do can we bet on this ... or you know I don't you always some candy bars\nSo I I think that's what we should do I'll just throw out the nicknames in terms of the standings and we'll say whether it's in the running or it's got to go okay mountain years guy in the running or gotta go gotta go gotta go longhorn yeah [noise]\nOkay in the running suitors no I don't really know what that is yeah [laughter]\n\nBears Baylor Bears of course

end of a twister you see that movie twister where they tied themselves or whatever it was with like belts and stuff and they're looking up into a twister if that just headed into your living room there was no live beyond that anything can top that\nIt's pretty [noise] yeah because [noise]\nWhen you look at the wildcat yeah and then you look at the bear yeah\nThe one thing that neither of those things those animals could compete with the cycle\nThat's right hey you guys leader does it does there have to be an asterisk next to the Iowa State psych loans because their mascot is actually a cardinal it's not an actual cycle and I I understand it's hard to pick a psych loan as a mascot but it's this side of the cardinals\nWill we go more nicknamed the mascot I think you're saying if you ruined by name yeah it's a ... okay we all know him as the cycle like look at Stanford they're the cardinal but they've got a free yeah can't wait to get to the pack twelve\nGuys that Steve here uh

psych loan ease all day long\nAll day by the white Dexter Williams Ninety seven yards ... yeah\nAll right there you have it why do you think this is where we're going\nYeah that's where it's progressing towards um I Want you to listen to this this is Eli Manning and take it for what we're talking about listen to what Eli Manning is talking about in terms of forcing the ball down field\nWrist is not what you want to take you can do the ball down the field whether it's a risky and then there's force than things and that that leads to peel turnovers it leaves the mistakes and I'm not like you know having shots down the field that I'm not taking it just a matter of you know kind of way and those options on top so it's just kind of have in that field and\nBuild a rash and having a good understanding of it when you can do it when you can't\nOkay so I look at Eli Manning in terms of the reaction to you can't hit the quarterback you can still hit um the main reason Eli Manning isn't getting the ball down field is he doesn't trust his offensive linemen and he's been sacked Fifteen times oh no back um junior can get open down field\nSo you can still hit the quarterbacks granted it's definitely being down sized terms of what you can do legally while hitting a quarterback but you could still knock them around it's not like all those fifteenth tax wouldn't a gated because of all rushing to pass or penalty\nThere'd be zero sacks given up\nSo it can still happen but I think we overreact to some of these calls because they are a noxious ... wait tends to be you can't touch him at all you can you can knock them into next week it's just you can't land on top of them and it better not be late\nYeah but you can knock them in the next week with the four or more you helmets so like you know knocking into next week Riley yeah in ... words you can't read enough force anymore to knock them into next week because you can't use any of your ...\nRight so it's a hug you hug them to the ground are you a hug them\n... you know and go for the ball like you know by Miller and I'm\nGonna ... you they are just going for the ball if you hit a ball out of a quarterback him without him getting hit its effect\nThat's right right up to go out and now you have to go for the ball which bodes well for quarterbacks because those who are in the pocket and who have great ball awareness in control with in the pocket that served him better be good guys aren't teeing off on them now they can ... you know move within the pocket step up took the ball\nPeyton Manning was great with that took the ball away step up Tom Brady is great at it you know what I mean Aaron Rodgers\nThese guys no arms are being swung getting all of that so if you're just going for the ball chances are you're not going to get it\nBecause those quarterbacks who have pocket awareness aren't going to let you get it\nSo you know that's just another problem you're teaching guys who go for the ball then you miss the sec\nYeah well you can still sack the quarterback\n[noise] but you\nReally careful [laughter]\nLike run through Wilton being judicious while running the football ...

Notre Dame of thirty one sixteen\nUh over Virginia Tech that was in the fourth so\nI'm as a score start coming in and we started getting the vitals will pass a blog a Washington knocked off UCLA thirty one twenty four UCLA hung tough though they're arid I mean it was it was it was a a tight game for a little bit there at the end if they would have scored that touch on which I did get the cake but they weren't able to do that\nYeah I'll say this is that first of all I I and I'm a guy I think you are the same picked to Washington to play in college football playoff yeah um that often Jake Browning the quarterback I think he's gotten worse every single year\nAnd we've had a last year he was hurting oh it's a shoulder and this and that will he'll be healthy this year\nHe still has not played up to kind of the expectations but I also think part of it is chip Kelly is a good football coach now is he ever going to reach that success level he added Oregon where they won four straight packed twelve titles that pack ten at the time probably not but this guy is going to get things turn around he's going to get this team competitive I\nKnow that right now they're sitting here and oh and five but they are going to get better and they certainly showed\nScience I think they'll have a lot of patience I mean obviously this is in his fault this is the team that he inherited and you just don't turn around things overnight but I don't know if I even expected that this team was going to go out and start off or when five or or be in this situation um I\nI mean really doesn't make much of a different style if if you're not competing for like a nine or ten when season what difference does it make if you have five wins or zero wins for the most part\nYeah I I and I think in like defensive chip Kelly first of all they lost to Cincinnati early in the season nobody thought Cincinnati Cincinnati right now is sitting after today at six and I believe\nThey were actually the first team to become ... I could be mistaken on that\nBut there are six you know Colorado is undefeated I don't think anybody thought they were going to be that good\nFresno state by the way is foreign one and so you sit around and you look around and it's not an excuse for being when this at this time and I agree with you I expected him to have a winner or two on the board but some of those teams on that schedule maybe a little bit better than we thought they'd\nBe but I mean you talk about a system where you actually need the right players um you really can't plug anybody just any person into that system and and it starts with the quarterback ... with chip Kelly so next year obviously they'll get better they have no ... they can't go down\nAnd I expected with about two three years be right back up there in the packed twelve I mean is it it's too great of an institution degree at school and two great of a program right to the heart of Los Angeles\nFor not them to be significant and it'd be relevant in college football here and\nWhy would I think you get the last person most important too good of a recruiting base I mean there are so many players right there around UCLA by the way especially with us she kind of struggling you think maybe they can sneak in get some players that they normally wouldn't if us he was on top of their game\nI agree UCLA is going to be fine and oh by the way they play in the same divisions the Arizona Wildcats the you know they got one went on the schedule every\nAll thank you speaking about my Wildcats Arizona ten cows seven I'm I'm I'm In the semi good mood was my team's never winning when we're doing the show together which seems like Everytime Rob yeah the game's going on so at least by wild cats have I've always right now or let's give it\nTen minutes we'll check back [noise]\nAh they several of lead over fourteen Frank Stanford or that one at the end of the first but we've had some upsets but a starting early today we set the pace with some really really good games and that Texas Oklahoma game when Texas was up by three touchdowns\nI pick up my phone and I'm saying to myself okay what do I put on Twitter right now do I go after my Sunday partner Chris plank\nDo why wait till the game's over\nA ... not that I'm worried about him getting upset mind you Erin I'm I'm worried that if I put suddenly got on Twitter\n... getting bombarded with tweets while he's working at that on that to happen you know what I mean how does fall you know would constantly go off or something like that wow what a classy individual you are aren't you know not just about being thoughtful I it'd be in softball so I I gave it some time afterwards and then of course I\nTweeted out what are the odds of him coming into work tomorrow\nI think I I put it at a no a minus three hundred which is the big favorite right now um but I never thought that they allow Oklahoma to get three touchdowns and get back into staying tie it up and then Oklahoma that's Texas come down\nAnd get in field goal range um and and oh jeez Dick or the kicker everybody's talking about it what ... what was it a forty order Aaron\nUm it was just I mean ice in the veins\nAnd nails it and they go on to the victory that so when that propels Texas maybe back to national prominence it's been such a long time Oklahoma I'm not going to say they're out of it but wow that that hurts big time right there\nYeah I agree on all of it a first of all yeah Texas certainly back in the thick of things I mean look there five in one everyone kind of points to that opening lost to Maryland\nBut there haven't been many teams since that game that have been better than Texas I mean look they beat us see they beat a good TCU team today was obviously the signature when look you know obviously you want to when\nGodly weekdays he's much\nMore well rounded box\nThat come with clay trap and I'm\nNot a hundred percent sold the patriots being back even with that almost coming back even with that off and starting to show a lot more flashes I only to even very good for the patriots so big time swing games the next two weeks for the patriots we'll find out whether that ate and ate prediction that I toss out had any possibility of becoming the truth out kick their coverage\nWith the ... tribe and they say surgery I'm back on Fox Sports radio fled the overreaction continue\n[noise] overreact\nWe react\nWith us for pressure whatsoever\nFor the ... that is a lot of jobs\nWe never waffle we always give you the strength skinny [laughter]\nThe NFL is going\nThese boxes horse radio driving away pass pass why\nMan\nTo find out that it's one of your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for detail pass pass why\nTargeting everyone for free winters daily you go to Vegas covers dot com that Vegas covers dot com good evening he's air as far as I'm only spend your great\nSaturday Night I mean so much going on what they do what's happening on and baseball Yankees\nLooks like they're going to go ahead and even this uh best the five series at one gave a piece of six to read right now over the red Sox um yeah said just standing at home plate watching his whole rotten\nOr like it was the last home when he was ever going to hit there's life I'm sure the red Sox are not happy about that but since the playoffs or they were throwing that anybody so All right that was six to Yankees lead the red Sox I like I said if you want to get a hold of us Aaron underscore tourism at stinking genius one\nLike this one Aaron that says part of the appeal of the red river a well rivalry I'll say is the game after losing\nA fan base gets to play got a town in the winter stays at parties in Dallas all night Mike in Jacksonville says trust me fans don't want a home and home for the Georgia it is awesome that there's one rivalry per season that transcends ... a conventional scheduling so\nI guess some people I see a neutral site out there and got dumped on by well or as his rights\nSpanier is wrong wish I'd relegate you for the rest of the show you you go sit in the corner and think about what you\nDid I think it would I rather well that can you imagine if you see a way in USC was neutral you know neutral site instead of you know beat at the rose bowl and at the at the coliseum they you know just put it it's a neutral site place would you like that that'd be horrible\nNow but it's not the tradition we said I said earlier I said the thing that makes college football great is the tradition\nUm and so obviously every rivalry is different\nUm every um you know it's just everyone is different look there were times that the iron bowl was played a neutral feel people forget that so it's just that would be horrible that's terrible it was played in Birmingham every year for like thirty something years I don't know I'm like well look at is\nAmong the wicked PT are right now yeah it was played early on in the Eighteen hundreds it was in Tuscaloosa\nWell that's what I was first on the air I think yes I Know yeah that's what I mean just to the ... that I Am so proud of that joke quickly\nSo from Nineteen oh for until Nineteen eighty eight it was in Birmingham there goes your to the British it out the window then right\nBefore they realize that they realize that tradition Stockton they put it on neutrophils actually I'm looking at it now yeah it looks as though it remained alternating between all burned in Birmingham for a number of years until it finally went over in Tuscaloosa just in the two thousands\nWell ... let me out just what are you you're the college basketball but I also do like neutral site college by but I Love the tournament but I mean do you like when they have these like pre season tournaments in Hawaii and Alaska\nAnd places like that because I I just love the fan base I Love when games are played in North Carolina a or at Duke\nOr you know at at one of these great places great venues that the fans go absolutely crazy I like them both I mean I think that's a great thing about college come on I like both well I mean look that's like your dating two girls I ask how old are you like better I like a ball stop at\nFirst was the first of all that's not a terrible thing that if that's the problem I got his picking which one of my girlfriends I like the most that I live in a pretty charmed life but hey I'm engaged now I'm joking about don't get me in trouble\nYeah um so I mean when I was going to say was so this year college basketball age brackets\nI mean when I was going to say was so this year college basketball hate to brag coming up soon ... Kentucky open the season the first game of the year is Duke in Kentucky wow that would never happen if it was a home and home\nBut they're doing it on a neutral court it's in Indianapolis I think it's going to be mostly Kentucky fans 'cause it's like a forty five minute drive from from the state but the point is is that\nI don't know if either of those teams is willing to play that game if it's played on the road and so to me and and obviously look when it's Duke Carolina then they play in Chapel Hill then they play in Durham will get good or out of conference games in the I'm On a you know in in true road games Israel so\nI don't know to me I think I liked the balance I like the difference I like when sports kind of mix things up\nIt it doesn't always have to be at one place where the other as long as you get a good crowd as long as the fans like it I have no\nProblem with tied the top twenty five right now Notre Dame thirty eight twenty two or this game was Seventeen sixteen at the half Notre Dame and taking a Seventy nine lead on a fumble scoop up at a touchdown with about two minutes up Virginia came Virginia Tech comes back\nGets the touch outta totally Seventeen sixteen it the half of them said to myself while while I got to put Old Dominion in my in my top five was one in five right now but I'm Notre Dame now pulling away all and the second half\nA look ... Virginia Tech not as bad as they saw not Old Dominion game\nNot as good as they put in the first half against Notre Dame\nThey'll lose this one I don't think those are they going to lose any spots over this to be honest with you I think a little stay number six or move up just slightly because there was a couple of upsets one of them are in the Mississippi State Auburn gay but other than that I don't think there'll be any penalty for Notre Dame for that the Virginia tech him\nAlthough definitely move up they're ranked ahead they were ranked are behind LSU in one poll and they were ranked behind LSU in Oklahoma in another poll right that was true of course he hit I was going to say I think the story with Notre Dame now as you look at the back half of their schedule\nThere are not a lot of good teams on that schedule now there is up they play a pit navy at Northwestern FSU\n... watch out for northwest of look how they play tough to you know the Michigan State game um you know they have the Michigan game but the other Seventy nothing lead you gotta watch out for that team\nAbsolutely but I I think to the broader point they're still gonna they're gonna be favored every game going forward and so I think what becomes interesting is if they win the games are supposed to which is everything left on their schedule\nThat's the team that's going to make the play off and that's going to shake things up from the perspective of does that mean a cleansing gets left out of Big Ten champ gets left out Oklahoma I mean imagine\nWe're we're going to get two teams left out if Notre Dame ... not one to two conferences\nOh yeah I mean yeah\nI mean if you of Alabama and you have Notre Dame what's to say those two teams are in their um now you're going to have you have an independent and you have an FCC team oh so you know you you still got what uh for the coverage has been over two spots open there\nAnd I'll tell you this ... this is already something that people need to start thinking about what if Georgia goes to the SEC championship game undefeated or Alabama for that matter they both do and the loser of that game is twelve in one and they're only lost his to whatever the number one\nSeems to be two teams from the SCC and Notre Dame and everybody's going to be a all upset about that it probably Ohio State of discontinue\nYou want the fastest way to get to eight teams in the college football that's the way to do is leave three power conferences out all those commissioners there'll be sitting around on New Year's eve\nThe drinking champagne not not\nHappy Sam champagne sad champagne dog twenty twenty champagne yeah there'll be without a pay check it out of a paper bag saying well there is we we are leaving a ton of money on the table here look at this Notre Dame is in second year in a row hypothetically in this scenario that we'd have to SEC teams\nOh my goodness I think I think before the end of the play off we would already be an eight for next year or that is the fastest way if you want if you're a person guy or girl that once that Eighteen play up I think that's the fastest way to get\n... let me give you an analogy here or there what are you Cindy Crawford is that an algae beautiful beautiful woman but she has that mall now some people go oh why don't you have the more removed I think that bowl is sexy\nAnd that's part of who she is you understand what I'm saying well Nick Saban said that his team very upset with his defense they gave a thirty one the Arkansas\nIs that just hit nit picking it to like the beautiful girls that hit ... pick you get a team that is destroying everybody but they've scored sixty five or there's a real blemish on this Alabama team\nYou know I I'll say this first of all you gave Ohio State crap for about four weeks I gave up thirty three to Oregon State and I got just ... yeah same here that's going to give Alabama pass for given up thirty one though to Arkansas\nYou when it you know I always say this and I I think it's stage true in this case with Ohio State it was a little bit sloppy they still ended up winning by three touchdowns and then the bigger thing is\nDoesn't matter get the wind move on to the next one nobody's going to remember if you were sloppy this week or you are good that week or it doesn't matter just get that winning keep racking up wins because you do that you'll find yourself where every Ohio State fan wants them at the end of the year which is competing for national gyms\nBig upsets one Florida will not big but for the did beat LSU twenty seven Nineteen um\nThat Trump's she's not a five and one good good\nTwenty seven Nineteen um\nThat dropped out of five and one\nGood game Florida when a head got the pick way to put them up that made the difference\nUh from one to eight I Believe it was still tried to come down tried to get the touches a to point are um turned over yet or I I think it was actually\nA turnover turnover on does not sure but anyway for to get the big three at Mississippi State we're not talking about this up they beat ... what the three not waved goodbye to our bird or they're going to be nowhere near the top ten after this loss\nNo they're not an Eminem brought up a good point before the show that Washington who's obviously probably in the best position to win the pack twelve yeah does not look good that they lost to operate in week one real quick on me I Want to go back to Ohio State for a sec yeah with Alabama Alabama is going to be such a heavy favorite against everybody\nWho do you think is the the team that matches up best to get like if if you had to if you had to pick one team that could potentially pull the upset against Alabama's only college football team's not the Buffalo Bills\nNot the Minnesota Vikings like like who is that team because we're talking about Ohio State and they looked a little sloppy today and between them and Georgia I just I don't know who that team is going to be before the in the year that steps up to challenge all them\nI thought it was George I liked Jake from you know I like the leadership he gives George's I'd certainly like the defense um but if you're asking me if it's just going to be one team and I know they didn't look like today I think that Notre Dame ... you know they got that X factor um they got a really good defense though at times they don't show it\nI feel like they've got a good op eds but at times they don't show it also and when they're put on all cylinders they're not that far off from Alabama but just sometimes you know they can't get out of their own way uh especially with penalties so\nYou know I guess is that type of team that you never you never know what you're going to get the intangibles but I Would I I'd say Notre Dame of I was just going to pick one\nYeah and I I don't know that I Would disagree with you on that I mean first of all I Know staffers and not looking very good right now but overall you look at Notre Dame resume they they have that went over Michigan early in the year that when looks better every single week they beat Stanford last week to ... this week that game just one final\nBut since they switch quarterback since they went to ... book the quarterback who's been starting from here on out they put a fifty six points at Wake Forest they beat Stanford thirty eight Seventeen and then today\nA a twenty two point when at Virginia Tech he seems to be the difference maker for them and I'll say this I Know Notre Dame traditionally they they they're overrated there are ... are there are a public team and Vegas everybody loves to bedroom\nThey look like the real deal to me they have the size of the speed the athleticism defense I really like what I see how that see\nI was checking in

I'm listening can we do the cliche thing of hey once it basketball season yeah can't come soon enough my friend\nUm I Want to say this real quick because I mean I was bombarded yesterday\nUm which tweets taxed uh you know a smoke signals I guess there was a viral video I don't know if you saw that ... ... ... and everyone well no no no just people like oh my God or why are you at the Golden State warriors your\nPractice facility oh because there was a old guy shooting a jump shots there\nAre no that wasn't me this and that was Steve Kerr and I understand that we have the very same similar shot because if you go\nOn my Facebook page I just posted my or pick up game which I'm sure it's the same as playing in the NBA Finals I heard that and you'll see since we went to high school together we have the same exact shot we kind of looked like the same\nExcept he has a little bit more hair you know pretty much the same way\nBut um no that wasn't me that that was Steve ... yeah when I when you heard when I heard you see that video did you see it\nI didn't uh students some shots making some shots just like I Would you know\nOkay yeah see see I thought I thought when I heard Arnie Spanier warriors prejudice I actually thought the possibility existed that you were there yeah remember Arnie or you know ... that restraining order has been put in place for that reason Mr Kerr does not want you calling him I don't even know if we should be talking about him on the air he\nI got to say he looked good shooting I'm not as good as me but he wasn't shooting three pointers but he was he was moved it I can understand them moving in or make it easier for him um but uh yeah going by Facebook page ever to go see be students some some reporters playing some pick up ball against a Vermont's best you'll see me dominating however\nMuch best over my God my friends were Vermont's ... basketball players that are like I said who is out here and I'm like saying the ... that's like saying the best a snowplow hours in LA yeah yeah come on\nAnd I mean call me crazy I didn't know that Vermont was this hotbed who is the guy who's the best player from Vermont\nThat's in the NBA right now ... ... that would be no by hope Coby Coby Coby was from ... that'd be no Katie Katie\nWow you pick it up you pick it on my new home in Vermont or what\nEven Connecticut produced a great Andrea drumming NBA all star but Vermont I mean you really might be [laughter] from odds way back when I hear this but my best that sounds like a coffee that does I don't\nI don't know this to be true but they keep telling me this that out of all the Vermont high school they've always said one guy um one player to NC double a division one football ... confidence like over like the last like fifty years or something like that\nWow and it was a quarterback that what the un Elvie who came back it ended up transferring back to Middlebury College wow\nI'm looking right now I Googled the NBA players from Vermont\nNot too many on that list I'm pretty sure so I got ... baseball players though we have our we have baseball players that that's for sure\nWe got Larry ... who was born in Nineteen twenty two okay just surprised that I saw yeah rest in peace\nWell it was like I said about breeding Vermont's best I didn't say it was the very best but it is Vermont spouse what okay\nWhat about Chris Kelly I don't know are you familiar with him no I'm not familiar with that one of the I played at rice memorial high school in South Burlington yeah I Know where that is where my son when he went on drafted yeah and then he uh I'm having trouble finding an end\nWell there you go well maybe I'll be the first to get back into the NBA at the age of fifty five so go lower my Facebook page I Know where you go to a lot of like being steep gr um especially with our shots I mean we're we're dead ringers but go check it out real quick you know we were talking\nWhile we were talking about this last hour when I I I kind of not Charlie mentioned you know I'm not too crazy when we mentioned about the river Red River rivalry\nAbout that being on a neutral site I think it'd be a lot more exciting if we did home and home and I and I said the same thing about um you know Georgia and Florida of course\nA or used to be the world's largest outdoor cocktail party\nWhat you're missing Aaron is that sooner or later and this is we're college football drops the ball\nIn college basketball at least for the first couple of rounds you're at least clothes or semi calls um were fans can traveled to the games to some of these neutral site games in football you might not have that luxury and if you're going to go to eight teams you have to have\nHome field or at least for every round until you get to the championship because fans can travel that often or if you win more than one game it's tough to do it around the holiday time because it it gets expensive\nAnd three you don't get the real football fans the real students um if you have these big neutral site games that are far away so I think you're going to miss the boat if you don't have home field advantage Aaron\nYeah if we spend eight I totally agree and that's another reason why\nIf we expand eight I totally agree and that's another reason why I don't know that expanding to eight is the best thing by the way another thing that nobody wants to really admit because everyone wants to make the ...\nEveryone's so anti NCAA yeah but the reason that there's that big gap of like a month between the end of the regular season and the start of the bowl season slash playoff\nIs because kids actually have like finals in classes and stuff like that\nAnd so I think from what is that it's it's the classes you know on my list and I know you never got a seventh grade but you know the rest of us that went to a real ... why not a college that they hand out their degrees uh macaroni\nBut but the other thing is too and that's that's another thing reason why I'm against expanding playoff is\nFor that reason and I think it gets convoluted too with the idea of if you keep a conference championship game because like I said\nSome years you have two or three teams from one division that are clearly better I mean look at the Big Ten this year it's very clear that the three best teams in that league are in the Big Ten east it's ah Ohio State Penn State of Michigan and so I think that everyone just wants to go to an Eighteen playoff\nBut I think the point that you bring up the point that I bring up it will create a lot of headaches that nobody talks about be at home field be it neutral site be it figuring out how to get to those eight teams I don't think it's his moves everyone thinks it\nRight there you go he's Aaron underscore tourism ads thinking genius one if you want to get a hold of us I'm a couple of the things I Want to get to before we finish up looking at the top twenty five\nThousands and thousands of college football player ... me of high school football players you got the great state of Florida Pennsylvania California Texas I mean some major hotbeds\nFor some high school football you up thousands of kids to choose from for NC double a division one simple question why as Alabama though head and shoulders\nBetter every year than everybody else it's not like they get every good player but because there's so many to choose from Salt Lake they're dominating a quarterback before this year because Jay Lynn hurts wasn't crushing it statistically even though he was like what forty and to start or something like

get into the patriots exec but also because\nUh people going ballistic up here like the patriots are back to winning the super bowl ... they've had a couple of wins in a row over the tough dolphins and Indianapolis call to the coast they'd be the worst team in football I I actually think they're worse than the Arizona Cardinals or they're they're horrible\nI think you're making excuses 'cause you're hot takes are were on fire you were running Bill Belichick outta town sending Tom Brady to their retirement home here they are three and\nTwo as I said\nFirst place in the division [noise] they're like we all know they're going to finish forcing it to get the number\nOh stop it they're they're not but you know let me tell you something you will get into this segment but you're getting a false sense of security if you think\nYou know let me tell you something you will get into this next segment but you're getting a false sense of security if you think of this team is back on track\nWe gotta we gotta get that going over under ... what is what is so you think they're going to go eat and eat\nNo I'd I'd probably think boy like at night and seven member they got Kansas City coming up the Chicago coming up that that's definitely two losses you put that in the book that that's going to be two officers right\nThere yeah and you said the dolphins were definitely in the last I don't want no points\nDo poor as to how I feel that your wife out right\nYeah a little bit older and crank year but other than that\nThat I I've been out by warm milk yet so I'll well yeah I tried to get that at the ... tried to go ahead and do that we ought to get\nAn over under back going in and it's got to be for something because I'm going to win that that and I want something good All right well here's some food to eat fresh table table to rush maple syrup or\nYeah where do things like that farm to table you gotta send me some of that or a farm to table you love that you're just love that I Do I Do well when a listen next segment will will hash out of bed here because the patriots are going to win the division as they always do get to ten wins that I don't know when something good for me\nA couple of games to go on Washington state now forty nine thirty over Oregon steakhouse there with the fourteenth ten lead over Arizona but they're driving now and your child looks like they're going to pull off the upset I Know it's still in the third but Utah twenty seven\nStand for seven separate coming at it in the inside the top fifteenth of the country nine forty looked into thirds will still plenty of time um but ... has done nothing a Utah now with the twenty seven seven lead I'm surprised about that when considering I Believe it's ... the home team on that one and they're getting manhandled by Utah\nYeah Utah is always one of those teams are so tough in physical are you watching this Arizona game oh let's go yeah\nLay it out I'm a I'm well I I just kind of looked up because I I Can't watch the game and do the show because I get cranky put Arizona intercepted they were running it back then the ball got smacked out of the guy running it's a back out of his hands\nOne flag in the air and another Arizona Wildcats player picked it up and read it the rest of the way for a touchdown\nYes that was the most I Would say the most bizarre touched on the day but Alabama actually had a very similar touched on against Arkansas\nI'm waiting for like you can't advance into where the guy fumble that that that this and that I Am waiting for something like that to happen\nI sure hope so man I'm like hello in this game so thank you\nI I Know you're just going to get an aggravate the hell out of me I'm not so um that's still some of the or a top twenty five still going up I'm editing really surprised I mean of course there was a major upset it's we not got we got into a little bit in our number one but one of them being LSU going down to Florida a lot of people were jumping on that issue bandwagon\nAnd coach oh um they've had some really good victories though I get all this against that they played this for the deep tough isn't this was a pretty good for the the ... that a good game\nYeah Flora looking better every week under ... and it's amazing they went for an eight last year which ... there are already at five in one right now and I'll say this with LSU too is that it did feel like I don't want to say unless he was on borrowed time or anything but\nThey they had those two wins over top ten teams first of all I think we can all agree after tonight all British nothing resembling a top ten team I don't even know if their top twenty five team at this point right and we were fooled by that Martin with a hundred percent and if you looked at the stats on LSU specifically on often\nThey did not look like a team that was going to be able to run the table that was going to be able to compete with Georgia who they play next week Alabama down the road when they play them in November\nThey look like a good seven five eight and four kind of team but for whatever reason they were getting those big plays when they needed them specifically against all burn a but I think the kind of the magic we're out today I think to your point already the better team Florida one\nToday a Texas wins forty eight forty five now Texas at a forty five\nI'm forty then it's a three touchdown lead so what was it forty five twenty four\nAnd then of course Oklahoma scores three touchdowns in a matter of like five minutes they tied up with Texas give them credit Ellen Ellen gr just phenomenal and that was Dr they get the game winning field goal\nTo get the forty eight forty five victory in this one otherwise if they lose this oh my goodness the Texas faithful I mean who knows what they do after the game if they're going to drop something like this but big victory this could go ahead and change the landscape a little bit I mean Texas has been on hard times for\nEver since ... background was gone so massive victory to get over Oklahoma here\nAbsolutely and it's funny with Texas and in any team and we see this in sports all the time is that sometimes\nWhen you've lost for so long you kinda have to learn how to win right and I think this was one of those games where they were up so big and they were even talking about a Gostin joke that we're talking about during the game\nIs they kind of changed their strategy they kind of changed the way that they were approaching things specifically on defense they weren't they weren't as aggressive on our fence they weren't kind of playing at the temple that they normally work\nAnd all of a sudden you give that game a basically a way by giving up all those um you know all those points late\nI Would that had also with Texas is that um you know they just got so sloppy obviously that big collar Murray run which is what I saw something yards\nHigh you let him get down to ... I'm not I have no idea\nWhat it is so random but you know everyone is is kind of a well known thing but he's a he's a baseball player he's already been drafted in signed by the Oakland A's he's a millionaire first of all I'm Amazed at the Oakland A's let him play baseball let him play football\nPut to Oakland I write what I say Oklahoma yes yes go ahead whatever sauce but no the Oakland A's drafted him this year obviously they had some kind of agreement that they were going to let them play football I Wonder is kind of baseball player is his Chris plank ever mentioned it's you know kind of curious become\nWell you know what's interesting about that whole thing is\nI thought I was going to be able to watch them this year because the uh Vermont lake monsters here in town or the or they're not that they're like the ... like I don't even know what they call it for the Oakland A's oh oh so I'm assuming once he does decide to get into baseball he'll be coming up to Vermont and and start to hear what the Vermont lake\nMonsters yeah I'll just say I ... it's not out okay I I Would assume Chris plight that would make more of a sense for Chris play kind of deal but one you know I'm Down I Love my my east coast my New England\nBut to a he must be a heck of a baseball player if he's given a football and by the way it makes sense baseball longer careers more guaranteed money I get why he would do it but to be so good at football and to basically be given it up it you know they're basically everyone's saying at the end of the season to focus on baseball he must be really\nOh look I'm a big deal you know when I went to high school or high school quarterback was a pretty damn good baseball player also okay so\nYou know so you just are or high school quarterback\nWent to a Super Bowl and was also the number one pick of the baseball draft I bought that who is that a J Schrader oh I think he told me that he was the number one pick in all of baseball and uh things didn't work out what you see a way to play football\n... the Colts are worse than the uh the the net result them\nYou're out of your mind here's the deal with the ... first of all that opening week against the bangles they were leading after three quarters couldn't hold on to win the bangles maybe a lot better than I think a lot of people realize they lose by four at Philly they lose by three and overtime against the Texans we know how that came went down last week add\nSo to me the culture like two or three plays from being\nThree and two for one instead of one in four so I just don't buy that they're that that\nThere were so banged up for that patriot game do you saw that like five or six guys didn't practice and they were dropping like flies during that the culture yeah they're against the patriots\nExactly so then how can they be the worst team if they weren't even healthier a hundred percent going into a road game on short and I didn't ...\nHow how do you get the patriots credit for winning the game against the colds and the dolphins that\nBecause you got to win the game that you're supposed to in the NFL good teams listen let's not forget Minnesota got blown out by the Buffalo Bills rightly or this year\nI'm you know a Philly has lost ugly games this year\nPittsburgh got embarrassed at home last week by Baltimore Baltimore is a good team but at the gate Pittsburgh supposed when I'm not going to discredit the patriots for winning the games that they're supposed to out at this as well you look at those two lost his first of all Jacksonville I think we're going to find out just how good that seem as this week when they play at Casey\nBut they are unquestionably the best defense in the sport I give the patriots have passed that was the jazz about Detroit ... what's the past there that Patricia he knew everything is all over his head he lets his hat around and the the ... back to them you know so\nNo I mean look it was on the road it was a Sunday night game Detroit needed it I just think we do we do this every single year with the patriots they always lose games in September\nThey always learn from it they always get better\nNow I look at that team Edelman back they don't have to rely on ... every single possession to make plays James White was obviously phenomenal and oh by the way I don't know if you saw some guy named Josh Gordon five hundred career a touchdown pass from Brady to Josh Gordon the patriots are back then\nThe McGregor fight is about to start what are the chances that this is still going to get back from the break we'll let you know what's happening or as the savior stops on Bible gets caught up with the fight all that's coming up that he's there in Torrance I'm already Spanier and this is Fox Sports radio\nSocks over the M.

M. I'm whether algae meteorologist Jeff\nKnown each coast on a um twelve thirty Katie already feet River Falls and you're listening to a little bit\nIs for a couple of reasons one which is very logical\nBecause you can expect that team to play at that high of a level the entire season there's going to be pitfalls every quarterback has them\nSo that's one and that's pure logic I mean that's your thinking clearly very logical I also think that the reason that people look at Patrick ... and the Kansas City chiefs I think the reason that people think\nThat they may fall back to the pack is because they can't get the image of Andy Reid typical Kansas City off ... out of their mind\nAnd so they're so used to seeing that and because they're so used to seeing it\nThat's what they go back to that like like that that's just how they think about things like I think that applies in sports it's like when you're in high school\nYou could be a like you could graduate high school it could be Twenty years later you could be successful with money and a great career and a great family\nBut people in your high school are still going to remember you for the kid who made arm pits fart noises during class\nUm ah through trash people a snack booze on the campus a ditch third period\nI'm putting gum on the back of people's locks when they would try to go and open up their locker like if you're a goofball in high school or if you're just one of those kids is always pulling shenanigans or you're the class clown\nIt doesn't matter how successful you are afterwards there's still people in your high school that are never going to get that image out of their mind\nThey're never going to get that image out of your mind if you see somebody you hadn't seen in high school for years and years and years\nDo you kind of just ... and maybe it's just muscle\nMemory kind of revert back and feel like you did when you're seeing him when you were sixteen Seventeen years old\nAnd high school I mean you just it's different like it it is there's just you ... it's hard\nTo get that part of your life away from you full time you could do whatever you want but like certain people remember you for what you are I think certain people are always going to think of the cheese has a limited often who does really\nIt's going to think of the chiefs has a limited off ants\nWho does really well in the regular season and then gets to the post season and they hosted in early post season game and then they probably lose and if they don't lose they're going to lose the next week a New England I really do I think that that is part of why\nPeople have reservations about the Kansas City chiefs that they just can't get the image of Kansas City losing\nIn the playoffs early on with a limited off fence that doesn't translate to the playoffs I they can't get that out of their mind\nAnd I think that's why there is sort of a expectation of either going to fall back to the back of this is fool's gold ... homes isn't the real deal\nThat can make every throwing the book he's got one of the great office of mine in the NFL coaching him he's got town around him why would he fall back to the back I mean\nLike everything's speaks to I'm not doing that but we can't get that image out of our mind I think the same thing has happened with the Cleveland Browns we can't get the image of the browns out of our mind\nSo we just assume everything's bad\nHow many times have you seen people send a tweet out over something happening with the Cleveland Browns and somebody will send some tweet out saying Brown's going to brown\nHere you go there's the Cleveland Browns we remember it's just muscle memory so being a goofball in high school\nLike that that's just what you assume that they are they're always the class clown Twenty years later completely different person to believe the different lives successful money in the bank family all sorts of fortune now still the kid a who used to bring a Whoopi cushion into class and a and fill it up with cat urine and make people sit on it\nVocal narrative because the media voted him for the two most prestigious awards one in college in one in the NFL the you're going to have to try another route that they're just against like knowing that we didn't realize he not inaccurate pass jog godly\nWendy's in eastern he's much\nMore well rounded song mocks\nShe didn't win Mike harming\nWhat teams want now in Showalter in and Matt this is a is a great segue here because madness thing on his show officers fired neither of these guys or what the next wave of managers aren't major league baseball and like it or not saber metrics has a really big deal and front office\nNow they like managing cases man when\nMike harm it we panic [laughter] ...

McGregor last too could be nearby made off in the fourth round\nOf a a an okay fight it wasn't that great um buddy lost in the fourth round he was submitted by could be but\nAh that's not what the story the fight is the story of the fight is can be jumping over the cage to fight Connors corner man and then\nIt could be a a corner men jumping into the cage the sucker punch Conor McGregor guys were arrested momentarily kind of a gray refused to press charges uh they you know Bruce bumper had did announce the winner and neater guy was in a cage 'cause they were being ushered out by security because they were afraid for their safety it was craziness\nUm and so Conor McGregor is sent a tweet out that says a\nGood not looking forward to the rematch so so there's that kind of McGregor has spoken\n\nSo I I was expecting Conor McGregor to to do something more along the lines of ah I don't know some of the go to some of the classics some of the hits these guys are\nSo right Jonah stocks Fox Sports radio I'm\nComing up here in uh in just a a a couple of moments in and actually I Do want to get to this year let's go all the way to ah let's go to Kansas City whereas back is listening

football insider an expert will be with us here coming up a less than ten minutes from now here on Fox Sports radio um\nSo I legitimately feel bad for an NFL team\nI really really do because they were set up for success man like they had an opportunity to to have a I I Would think a really really good season like they were they were totally set up for success and I think that\nIn the NFL and you've seen this happen in years before where you\nHave an NFL team of gets a lot of breaks one year or a lot of things go their way or there's a lot of bounces and a lot of things happen and it works out fortunately for them if that goes down usually the next year doesn't carry over\nYou saw that happen with the Oakland Raiders a couple of years ago they were Thirteen and three they were rolling through the NFL there were winning all these close games all the shootout and then you got to the next season and it actually happened later on in that season Derek car suffered an injury\nYou don't get the balance is you got the year before and everything starts to fall apart\nAnd so I don't think that that stuff carries over in the NFL I just I I think that in the NFL you've got to cash in when you got an opportunity\nLike you've got to close the deal Philadelphia is not the same team they were a year ago it's clear um New England consistency\nIs what's most impressive about 'em because they won the big game they've won in multiple times they've gotten to the big dance they're always they're always in detention in the NFL it's different most teams you get your shot\nAnd then you step aside and you've got to capitalize when you have the opportunity I legitimately legitimately feel bad for the Atlanta Falcons\nI feel bad for their fans I feel bad for the team I feel bad for the organization if you just think about what the last couple of years has been like for the Atlanta Falcons you get back to the super bowl you hadn't been in almost Twenty years\nYou've got the patriots on the ropes that game's over\nThey're closing the coffin there are pouring the dirt they're laying the rose they're saying they're go goodbyes they're giving the eulogy it's over for a New England\nBounce here\nBad play call here Julian Edelman makes a miraculous catch here next thing you know they go to overtime you're\nOften doesn't even get the ball and doing goes right down the field and they win the game\nYou blow that kind of lead you come back the next season\nNot only do you rebound you get back into the play offs and then you win on the road against the rams in LA\nAnd you dominate them most teams you lose the super\nBowl like that you're wearing that for however long it takes I mean like ... like some teams don't recover from that\nThat is devastating did the Houston Oilers ever recover from that thirty five to three a lead that they had that they blew against the Buffalo Bills no in fact not only did they not recover they moved to Nashville a few years later\nLike it like you think you you go through something like that traumatic you can't expect the you're going to be back and not only were they back\nNot only did they come back\nBut they go into LA and they beat the rams in a playoff game then the next week they've got Philly on the ropes it looks like Atlanta is going to beat the Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia\nCome up short the red zone they lose\nYou fast forward to this season\nAnd you're the Atlanta Falcons and I even picked the Atlanta Falcons to win the division I thought man this is I think the foul 'cause you're gonna have a strong year I think the falcons are going to be the real deal I think they're going to rebound from this you open up the season and you're at the eagles again\nAnd you've got five opportunities down the stretch to get into the end zone and Matt Ryan just couldn't figure it out you can blame Steve Stark he's you know you want\nYou can you can try and say that it was play calling Matt Ryan threw the ball out of the end zone five different times so you lose that game and you probably should have one then you lose to the New Orleans saints in a game that went to overtime ...\nA high scoring forty three thirty seven Drew Brees on a rushing touchdown\nSo you'll lose that game a close game at home game you probably should have one then you lose a week ago on a last second touchdown throw by Andy Dalton to AJ green at home so that's two straight weeks in a row so we're looking at three losses\nAnd the combined point total of those losses is Thirteen\nSo instead of being three in one or even foreign oh you're sitting at one in three and now you go at\nPittsburgh in a game where Pittsburgh's got their back up against the wall Ben Roethlisberger is a much better quarterback at home and he is on the road and Pittsburgh's trying to rebound from an ugly division loss on prime time TV\nOh and by the way\nAll that injury lock that you've had in the past several years in Atlanta there's this injury metrics that they do to where it's um you know a players with the most value that you lose the injury the past three years\nJust a week of yellow and we will recreate Nineteen Seventy five classic jaws another type ... dramatic reading\nUh the the the U.S as it did apple is because they're men went into the water saw my friend went to show up and I'm On the shoulder shown me turned upside down he had been bitten and have a modern\nAnd I want to go to bed bobbing up and down or in the water\nOr by on that Pittsburgh side of things you want to get an interesting way James Washington their number three wide receiver the Rickey out of Oklahoma State push him in towards the table as well advanced McDonald the tide in\nA novel after coming back from injury he's taken over for Jesse James one of our favorite named guys right of course you know whenever you get your Jesse James\nOr with a big ... you know catch or you know shoots the lights out or whatever the case may be we get him in but you know James Carter we regret is a bit but in a match up like this everybody plays everybody wins what are we up to fifty eight at this point is your\nOverall I think that was the last I saw yeah um but but ... notes that there was a college football game\nThere yesterday and apparently the field got real torn up\nGo figure why didn't they played uh played on some pretty crazy yeah so the NFL or for all the money pumped in their makeshift dubious choices they go back to that Cleveland gambling\nYeah and you point out of baseball diamond you got it off I just don't get it on my ...

a total of seven hundred Fifteen overdose deaths that's an increase of nearly ... percent over two thousand sixteen\nI recently chatted with region hospital neurologist Dr Brett hockey about the continuing devastating impact of the opioid epidemic and what his concerns are as officials try in reverse the trend\nBecause I'm very close to the work and and what's going on in this area\nUm I also concerned about something that's a little bit more nuanced\nAh which is that uh we are in the midst\nOf um decreasing the amount of prescriptions that we prescribe the amount of prescription opioids that are hitting the market and we categorically of bent the curve on that and I'm a little bit afraid that as we have restricted the amount of prescription opioids going to the market that other people are turning to\nOther ways to get their opioids and those other ways include um less predictable routes um you know they get medications on the street and some are not the amount that they are used to or no and some of them sometimes are laced with other medications like ...\n... in terms of prevention are trying to sort of reverse this trend that's been going the wrong direction for years now what what sorts of things are proposing\nWhile my interest has really been trying to change the way we treat pain so that we don't put a hope you always end of the market and so one way to think about that\nIs that over time and particularly up through the seventies and eighties about zero point five percent or why not a two hundred people in the United states we're using opioids compounds after there was this change the way we were treating pain and there was this I'm\nI'm a movement from the government from Center for see a mouse that they wanted us to monitor pain on everybody and there was data suggesting that opioids weren't so dangerous and the risk of addiction wasn't so high\nAll these prescription opioids hit the market for pain and now we went from a point five percent rate of the opioid use to five percent\nAnd so my um interests has been to decrease the way we treat people on the front end to decrease the amount of hope you always hitting the market by Ninety percent and get back to kind of the baseline levels of opioid addiction are habituated and\nI'm now in the context of the fact that as we start to move to\nI'm not giving hills which is the right thing to do for acute pain or people that aren't on opioids we have to be careful of the people that are already on chronic opioids are able to get the um ah opioid treatment or addiction treatment that they need\nIn with regard to that treatment I Know one of the options are the folks have been talking about is the ... more a distribution of of that in terms of helping people out what do you think about that\nWell and the locks on is a lifesaver and for people that take a too high of a dose of opioids or they get an opioid medication that they aren't anticipating that creates to higher dose they they're breathing slows down and and the worst case scenario that breathing stops\nAnd the locks on the reverse is that in a second\nSo no one has a chance to save people from overdose deaths and is imperative in people that are on opioids 'em every day\nUm but so that's the unique setting for the locks on the other things that um are that need to be done or just helping people that are on the top you always everyday to figure out what a safe weaning program is or to maintain them on save\n'em a opioids everyday we call that medication assisted therapy\nWhere we use medications like ... box on where we maintain them on a a safe stable dose of opioids while we work with them on what it looks like to wean their dose overtime and get treatment for coincident behavioral health issues and general life issues\nYou mentioned a little bit earlier that in large part or doctors are prescribing opioids less than sort of gotten the message from this epidemic that we have here but I'm Wondering are pharmaceutical companies still pressuring\nUm medical establishment doctors to prescribe these things obviously there's a chance to uh pharmaceuticals can lose a lot of money by not having these things prescribed\nI have not seen that kind of overt marketing that I was seeing as recently as three to five years ago and that but certainly for decades um a lot of the verbal around opiates are\nSafe the risk of habituated as low we we as a society need to treat pain better a boy if someone gets addicted to a medication but their pain is improved and they're able to be better in life that that's a good thing\nAll of that is kind of pharmaceutical marketing and it was extremely prevalent through the nineties to thousands and then even after the turn of this last decade\nUm I think that a lot of that has been a little bit more subtle now um I don't see it as much um I'm I so I Can't comment on where it still is out there\nThere certainly is still a lot of misconception out there but we're we're doing a lot of um learning that has happened over the last twenty to Thirty years\nDoctors we wrap things up here a friday it's international overdose awareness day and I'm just wondering if you if you had a message out there to listeners that are either suffering from addiction to opioids are maybe family members that are caring for loved ones that are suffering from what's your message to those people\nWhile for people and paying a we have a ways to help them not be in pain and that includes getting them off the opioids that are actually worsening that pain\nAnd for people that are on opioids that are feeling that they are stuck in a pattern that they just can't get off at a they should seek out treatment we have abilities to help maintain them in a way where we can get them off opioids or maintain\nOne of the things that we want to do again is that we want you to be proud of it and one of the reasons and one of the things you can do as a loan ms if you care

U. S.\nThat means that he is love with you and he he's he loves you excuse me in his pleased with you a park\nIs love with you and he he he loves you excuse me and if pleased with you apart from your marriage apart from your deserving grace it's God's on merited favor\nIs great isn't given to you because of anything you've done to deserve it his on merited favorite toward you is on account of Christ so what do you think about\nThe Christ he's the savior of the world is yours\nWhen you hear a lot of God do you shrug and brush it off or does it pierce your heart and do you find yourself calling out\nFor mercy imploring God for forgiveness through Jesus Christ his son because you are a sinner friends dot is merciful\nWe've not love God or our neighbors as we ought we've not kept the great commandment but Christ did he did love God with all his heart with all his stole\nHis mind and all his strength and he did love his neighbor as yourself you are Christ neighbor and he laid down his life for you so you would believe in him and have life in forgiveness in his name [noise]\nThere were two questions in the text today for you to consider one was a test and one stands as an invitation so test your heart with the question which is the greatest commandment\nThey're all great but we turn to God loving God we turn to our neighbors loving our neighbors I pray that\nGod would work in your heart and mind first sorrow overseeing for how we have not lived up to God holy law and then as you are pierced by the law of God take refuge\nIn Jesus Christ what do you think about the Christ is the question which invites you to answer with face Christ is the savior of the world and he is yours\nHe is the son of David is the son of God he is your righteousness and the piece of God

in order that he might touch them\nAnd the disciples spoke sternly to them\nBut when Jesus August he was indignant and said to them\nBut the little children come to me do not stop them\nFor it is to

the CDC estimates there were four hundred one overdose deaths from opioids in Minnesota last year out of the total of seven hundred Fifteen overdose deaths that's an increase of nearly ... percent over two thousand sixteen\nI recently chatted with region hospital neurologist Dr Brett hockey about the continuing devastating impact of the opioid epidemic and what his concerns are as officials try in reverse the trend\nBecause I'm very close to the work and and what's going on in this area\nUm I also concerned about something that's a little bit more nuanced\nA which is that um we are in the midst of um decreasing the amount of prescriptions that we prescribe the amount of prescription opioids that are hitting the market and we categorically of bend the curve on that\nAnd I'm a little bit afraid that as we have restricted the amount of prescription opioids going to the market that other people are turning to\nOther ways to get their opioids and those other ways include um less predictable roads a you know they get medications on the street and some are not the amount that they are used to or no and some of them sometimes are laced with other medications like that now\nIn terms of prevention are trying to sort of reverse this trend that's been going the wrong direction for years now what what sorts of things are proposing\nWhile my interest has really been trying to change the way we treat pain so that we don't put a ... into the market and so one way to think about that\nIs that over time and particularly up through the seventies and eighties about zero point five percent or one out of two hundred people in the United states we're using opioids compounds after there was this change the way we were treating pain and there was this\nI'm I'm a movement\nFrom the government from Center for see a mouse that they wanted us to monitor pain on everybody and there was data suggesting that opioids weren't so dangerous and the risk of addiction wasn't so high all these prescription opioids hit the market for pain\nAnd now we went from a point five percent rate of opioid use to five\nPercent and so my um interests has been to decrease the way we treat people on the front end to decrease the amount of opioids hitting the market by Ninety percent and get back to kind of the baseline levels of opioid addiction or a ... and\nI'm now in the context of the fact that as we start to move to I'm not giving pills which is the right thing to do for acute pain or people that aren't on opioids\nWe have to be careful of the people that are already I chronicle you always are able to get the um uh opioid treatment or addiction treatment that they need\nIn with regard to that treatments I Know one of the options are the folks have been talking about is a ... more a distribution of of that in terms of helping people out what do you think about that\nWell in the locks on is a lifesaver and for people that take a too high of a dose\nAnd so on is a lifesaver and for people that take a too high of a dose of opioids or they get an opioid medication that they aren't anticipating that crazy to higher dose they're they're breathing slows down and and the worst case scenario the breathing stops and the locks on the reverse of that in a second\nSo no one is a chance to save people from overdose deaths and is imperative in people that are on opioids 'em every day\nUm but so that's the unique setting for the locks on the other things that um are that need to be done or just helping people that are on the opioids everyday to figure out what a safe leading program is or to maintain them on save\n'em a opioids everyday we call that medication assisted therapy for were use medications like ... box on\nWhere we maintain them on a a safe stable dose of opioids while we work with them on what it looks like to wean their dose overtime and get treatment for coincidence behavioral health issues and general life issues\nYou mentioned a little bit earlier that in large part or doctors are prescribing opioids less they sort of gotten the message from this epidemic that we have here but I'm Wondering are pharmaceutical companies still pressuring\nUm medical establishment doctors to prescribe these things obviously there's a chance that a pharmaceuticals can lose a lot of money by not having these things prescribe\nI have not seen that kind\nOf overt marketing that I was seeing as recently as three to five years ago and that but certainly for decades um a lot of the verbiage around opiates or save the risk of habituated as low\nWe we as a society need to treat pain better a boy if someone gets addicted to a medication but their pain is improved and they're able to be better in life without the good thing\nAll of that is kind of pharmaceutical marketing and it was extremely prevalent through the nineties to thousands and then even after the turn of this last decade\nUm I think that a lot of that has been a little bit more subtle now um I don't see it as much um I'm I so I Can't comment on where it still is out there\nThere are certainly a so a lot of misconception out there but we're we're doing a lot of um learning that has happened over the last twenty or Thirty years\nDoctors we wrap things up here a friday it's international overdose awareness day and I'm just wondering if you if you had a message out there

Mike grim we're going to delve into what's going on in the north Star State if it matters in Minnesota we've got it covered [noise]\nThis week a closer look at the opioid crisis in the state of Minnesota state colleges and universities are on a mission to help skilled workers still open physicians and former go for basketball star Quincy Lewis takes on a new role to keep former go for a letter winter is connected to the EU\nBut first important news on the healthcare front this week in Minnesota and surprise surprise more politics in the race for Minnesota attorney general feminine bill Warner updates us on both as he joins us now\nScott good news for those who do not have health insurance through their employer and have to buy their coverage on the individual market officials announced this week that for the second year in a row there will be significant decreases in premiums in two thousand Nineteen ranging from about seven percent or nearly twenty eight percent\nCommerce commissioner Jessica looming says Minnesotans will receive health care tax credits for men sure we'll see less of a rate reduction but\nThe greatest highs and the impact will be for minutes at least for not eligible for tax credits and you might pay the full cost of their own premiums he's people should significantly lower premiums available to them when they shot for their health plans\nActual premiums depend on a person's individual situation and what coverage they like miniature as Christina Wessel\nWill have those are new rates up in our online pat comparison told by mid October so consumers get kind of do their window shopping before open enrollment starts in November first\nAnd then there is the issue of access in other words and people keep their doctors lawmakers have been watching that closely after some major HMOs dropped out of the market a few years ago at a time when premiums were also skyrocketing but state health commissioner Dan Malcolm says for two thousand Nineteen known network service areas will be reduced\nMost counties we'll have two or three available provider networks and associate of qualified health plans only two counties in our state will have only one available provider network that is like in the woods and maker county\nOfficials say a lot of factors that contributed to this relative stability and Minnesota as healthcare market over the last year or so but the most politically significant is their reinsurance package that the legislature passed and governor Mark Dayton somewhat reluctantly let become law without his signature\nWell obviously concerned about previous jobs and health insurance premiums governor warned of the impact that reinsurance would have on the state budget reinsurance means the state pays the cost of health coverage for the most seriously ill Minnesotans would presume effective holding down everyone else's premiums\nNothing that did happen in two thousand Eighteen and will happen in two thousand Ninety\nBut the price tag is in the hundreds of millions of dollars and the governor said this week the steak quote cannot sustain\nAnd Minnesota taxpayers cannot afford to keep footing the bill for big insurance companies Dayton proposes any Minnesota not just low income residents be able to buy their insurance through Minnesota care of the state run program he argues the pool buying power of the state\nWill mean significantly lower premiums as much as twenty eight percent less than commercial plans\nBut the political reality of this is to be Frank Dayton will have little or no say in what happens next year because he will have left office and Minnesota will have either a democratic or Republican governor and which it is will make a big difference on what happens with healthcare\nSenate Republicans pushed reinsurance through the legislature but they seem to agree with Jane that it's not the way to go a long term for twenty twenty and beyond hand like Senator Michelle Benson it the GOP as healthcare point person in the Minnesota Senate\nBut we're going to do is look at\nWhat kind of fix actually had\nThe if there's a better model that we can you really didn't want to optimize any time on your taking taxpayer money we want to optimize its impact\nOthers has started to its markets that like I should tell us your lawn and make sure that we are I'm continuing Minnesota from like I said I being inundated leaders in health coverage on healthcare\nMark Dayton will not be governor next year but one of the two people who could be\nIs Democrat Tim Walz he has come out in favor of single payer health care although his campaign stresses it would be phased in over time to buffer the impact on the state budget\nWalls skirted the issue in a statement this week saying his vision for healthcare quote focuses on bringing down the cost of care and expanding coverage from a variety of angles Republican senator Benson says\nUnfortunately a candidate while hasn't had to stand up to a lot of scrutiny on this issue it easy and they found that says it has to actually pay for the promise that seemed like\nLet's switch gears now to the race for Minnesota attorney general domestic abuse allegations keep dogging democratic candidate Keith Ellison and top analysts say tactical error is by the Minnesota DFL party probably made that situation worse\nParty officials hired an attorney to do what they termed an independent investigation the attorney concluded the accusations by Karen ... ad against Alison were unsubstantiated\nNot surprisingly that report did not convinced many people so party officials asked Minneapolis city attorney Susan Segal to review the report presumably trying to improve its credibility Segal refused citing possible conflict of interest because Allison son is on the Minneapolis city council\nSegal asked Dakota county attorney James Baxter to review the case back strum responded he would only do so\nAttorney James Baxter to review the case

conflict of interest handling university professor David ... steak\nThe entire investigation that the state the failed that seems very odd I ended up the results seen even more perplexing and what I mean by that is that they say that Keith Ellison the charges are unsubstantiated\nBut not could released a report what they want to send it off to some police department to confirmed the results before they actually released a report or anything else and that's very odd because generally unless there is a criminal complaint out their police are not going to investigate and they're certainly not going to verify\nOr or double check an investigation somebody else did\nI Would assume probably what they're doing is trying to find a a credible source to ah to give them the conclusion that they

assumption\nThat again it doesn't really look like it was an independent investigation I think many people are suspect ... the fact that the DFL did it suspect the guardian who did the actual

I Know but nobody cares about the record because they're like I've got a Antonio press that I got holy to Jews have now been written in the market free and that's\nI mean that's that's what we're doing and and there is excitement\nTo that because I think as we all know as we've seen the flags or out of the occupants of back fields and socks are now legal in the NFL\nOr we were getting used to this and this new big twelve look that than it fell has taken off let's go shot guns for why just\nAir raid the soccer Pittsburgh Steelers in Atlanta as big band takes the field yeah the first\nTime they lived with the ball first just walk on the ravens habit first in Cleveland where we will check yet on Baker and his does in a a little bit later as he takes the field and then let's check in on what I think might be the most fascinating game of the day on Wall bowl I'm a little bit bombed a bet it is pouring their Kansas City hosting\nJacksonville this\nWas going to be the ultimate off ... and again the ultimate defensive weapon\nAlthough the jags have the ball first we all want to see what happens on the other side of the ball is jailing gonna pick off pat and all of that but it's pouring here uh and expected to be a steady rain throughout the entire game which is kind of an equalizer\nYeah you know this actually to me uh gives the advantage to Jacksonville in this game there's so much speed on the side of the Kansas City chiefs that defense\nI just wanted one of the best but we have seen a aside from this year being the top defense in the week\nI think that this equalize his home field advantage slightly because this is the type of game the Jacksonville Jaguars like to play they're going to throw the ball close to line of scrimmage a lot that bleep morals I quarterbacks\nThey're going to run and pound the rock and then defensively you can mark it up in the mud and so I think that this really does bode well for Jacksonville against all these weapons on the fence a that Kansas City has at their disposal\nMeantime in Carolina today this one is really interesting to me the New York giants are kicking off and they've got the ball first right now\nAnd already you're starting to get the low rumble oh del Eli Manning what's the problem or Dell colds and the banking Duncan he's questioned the heart and then earlier today he was asked is Eli Manning behind the fence it was\nAt his answer was I don't know this is an interesting answer from one of the biggest personalities in the league at a quarterback who has been on and off question for the entire last year\nWell right and do back in the junior is one of these guys where his behavior has been a concern for giants ownership for a while now what did they do to handle that well that they they paid him a lot of money so everything oh del says is expected and quite frankly encouraged at this point so this doesn't shocked me at all\nThere goes James Caan or on a little dump off pass from Ben Roethlisberger and then he breaks a couple of tacos and into Atlanta territory so right on cue offenses are looking good right out of the gate in that ball game with Pittsburgh hosting the Atlanta Falcons um and then also right now Green Bay in Detroit\nI'm this is going to be a desperate or Detroit Lions team after suffering outlaw in Dallas last time out\nAnd a very banged up Green Bay team and I keep thinking and feeling like everybody housing quite gathered yet the Green Bay is not the Green Bay that were used to seeing even with Aaron Rodgers\nOn the field you look at what they did last time out they shut out a Buffalo Bills team that doesn't offer a whole lot even though they won by twenty two points Rogers was really upset after the game it's highly clear other that often is not clicking at least not yet\nThis is an interesting tweet from Adam chapter a Aaron Rodgers leads the Packers into Detroit which has been good news for Green Bay last Tennessee north divisional games\nRogers seven one in one and he's thrown twenty three touchdowns adult picks so in his own division he does a tremendous job doesn't matter home in a way and that's over the past what nine games that he's played in division so this is a Green Bay a fence especially led by Aaron Rodgers\nWho seems to know when it's time to click in and play hard ball and everybody knows mission numeral who know when you start a season when your division at something the Green Bay Packers have done it on a\nJags opening drives stalls they'll kick it away and the driving rain and so here comes Patrick moms and Tariq shell and jailing Ramsey and age a Bouvier and miles jak and all these personalities are going to be on the field when the chiefs out the ball and here they come and they're going to take over or\nShort of their own thirty yard line just start also an interesting game going on in Cincinnati today where the dolphins how the ball and today might be an interesting story\nDon in Cincinnati today where the dolphins how the ball and today might be an interesting sort of a introduce yourself right on right on for the Miami Dolphins because they go through you know\nAnd nobody really believes that but some eyebrows raised and then they go into New England and everyone went well that'll be that'll be the end of that and and it very very clearly was\nUm but I still am not a hundred percent sure like I don't think the dolphins were as good as three at all I don't think they were as bad as they were in New England last week a and with the way Cincinnati played at three in one I think today will be a day that we learned some things about the dolphin\nYeah because this is in a a turnover type defend Cincinnati I think I think that they are are going to pose a decent threat this game is in Cincinnati today\nAnd so the dolphins have a hill to climb here ten they do it I ... I I always look at the first four games of the season and we're just on the other side of that now\nAnd people have all these really rash opinions about what they've seen through the first quarter the season anybody who knows football knows this\nUh nobody season is won or lost in the first word games we got to get through this hump this no October and November tumble where we get to see who is perseverance we've seen it many times also you can sneak into the playoffs with a lower record and make a ton of noise in January so a lot to learn about all these tent\nOkay James Caan or with the ... the\nDay he's going to pop in from five yards out for the healers what I don't know after review is whether or not it's going to stand it's going to be close as to whether or not the knee was down before he reached across on the goal line also it looked like Detroit just scored a touchdown however I think\n\nBy one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for detail pass pass why\n\nWhy do you when you can rotted Patrick whoa\nWoman headlong guy [noise]\n\nYeah that's definitely that's not going to hold up\nTo strike first shots of el ... in Detroit the lions ticked up all the way the parks accidentally touches a Packer the lines get the ball inside the five like Garrett was turns it into steaks\nExtra point guard seven nothing all over the world that is bad ball that is bad ball\nI mean you're supposed to be shouted\nEverybody get out of the ... the pawn it should never happens he says yo Peter\nMy name was Peter I wouldn't dirt road why I got so popular but every show you the heater when the punch\nLanding to make everyone aware that it is not couch or get out of the white\nRaven threatening Baker may feel just picked off moral ... coming up in a second ... yards us live our nose and forty niners later on this afternoon on Fox alongside Dick Stockton and Jennifer health we look forward to this day marks a thanks for doing it let's check in on the forty niners first\nAnd they've gotten out one game under their belt since Jimmy gene went down what is your sense in terms of the emotional stability of this team are now having to move on for the whole season without their guy\nWell you know I mean I think anytime you have that how do you try to rally around the\nYou know see get better and to get better grades probably his best game had a couple of interceptions\nBut one of them off the hands of his receiver so the other one was a tip ball you know to drill so I'm\nReally played well last week I think the biggest thing that that so many injuries across the board on both sides of the whole public health care and he's like we don't know what we are right now because we wanted to be a control the middle of the football field team\nYou know they lost the Kennedy and they ... a jerk pretending that they've had so many injuries they've got some receivers that are out today so um they're just trying to figure it out right now so it's been it's been kind of ... but also it's one of those things they rallied around the you know they ...\nWhat about the NFL is ah you know microbes you talk all the time they're ... I don't care\nYou know you've got to go up there and you got to play because nobody's going to feel sorry for you so you're going to recover wound Margaret came back to work and are ready to go so we'll see what happens but George Seattle's really well and did you go to Idaho Iowa together gives me and um\nAnd they've been together for seven years so they've got a great chemistry car won't touch down last week um they put numbers on the board last week so that part is exciting\nYou know mark I I Know you watch a ton of film going into these games they have a rookie starting at center my buddy aid to ship we goes down with an ACL during the pre season and so they're left with the rookie under center and a rookie center how's the offensive line looking in front of Rosen\nA they you know what they make a lot of mistakes in the ... center you know is is like most ... is there not quite ready to play it and he's got a good job for knowledge um knowledge of what he's supposed to do of physically get pushed around a little bit occasionally um so but that's going to happen to\nYour most guys or they get in the league and have to develop strengths and everything else so that's been part of it um mental breakdown so crunch or have been a part of it um you know they've tried to be\nThat is what breakdowns up front or have been a part of it um you know they've tried to be a real gap team double teams the point of attack that haven't been great you know when you get six hundred three hundred you should be able to move those guys and\nThey haven't done that on a consistent basis or really hurt their running game of edge presents hasn't been good enough they're tied into not or get jobs and both on the front side and cutting people off on the bad side so it's really been tough on David Johnson you know on and\nThere are there comes a time even for David Johnson when you have to just embraced the ugly for your ... ugly for your Ron and try to put your ... and people and um see if you can wear 'em down a little bit so it's something that they're going to have much better job of um but just Rosen was Josh frozen his stats you know just look at the stats\nUm Fifteen and twenty seven yeah five legitimate drops for over a hundred yards of are probably a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty yards um that he would have had had those drops not been made so he threw the ball with great or a ... great accuracy is deep hole was\nUm incredible everybody that we talked to going into this game whether it was on the court will stop on a nine or staff their eyes lit up when you talked about Joe ... frozen so he's a guy that they have a lot of uh they have a lot of excitement about especially in Arizona\nAlso I Would imagine Arizona excited because it finally looked like they at least started to get David Johnson going last week one wants to talk about that and how can they get him even more involved [noise]\nYeah well I think as they continue to go on I mean they're going to want to do some to back stuff in and bringing chase Edmunds the rookie running back as well to David Johnson locked up outside um you know try to find some one on one match ups with linebacker so\nThat's part of one of the things they want to do they are they really felt like um the games are dictated I'd love to give him more involved in the past and get get him more\nUm ... and use it more as the receiver but\nUm you know it's hard when you have a bunch of three announced and there are a bunch of third down a long to get some of that stuff done so they're hoping to get that\nUm that they gave money twenty two twenty three carries last week so they're hoping to get them a little bit more involved in the past and game but\nYou know they're gonna they're gonna working hard there's no question about that\nA back to the forty niners CJ bathroom to me he uh he shows a lot of grit when he plays football for the forty niners that was a to point game in LA it's a good defense as far as the charges are concerned\nWhat does she mean to this franchise now that ... down do you think you'll have success after all head coach Shanahan called the great often\nYeah you know it's ... about him you know he's got rate up and she's got Supreme toughness and as you mentioned Supreme grit and and it goes usually what you felt that you say that about a quarter back it means they should be coaching I'm not so with CJ bath or he he actually very skilled guy\nAnd it was interesting to watch the difference between last year when I called the game and and watch the film is Egypt rather than watch them this year I ask al ... like what's what's the difference because he throws the ball with more authority it's out of his hands quicker it really said he was just late with his feet on everything last you're thinking too much skeet\nHave caught up to him and his arm and he goes he just is really really throwing the ball well right now because he's in a rhythm used to do it all gets rid of them\nUm and so he's a skilled guy now he he needs to take care of himself but his top this comes through his grip comes through and the guys rally around that isn't that great they really appreciate like if he's going to take shots like he took his last week and\nA George Kendall was all going to about a game last year in in uh Philadelphia where they hit him so hard to talk to them so hard issue flew\nOff you know like you know so if you get a standing\nThere and take that kind of feeding for us um the least we can do is reciprocate so they they really actually likes Egypt ... he's earned the respect because of the way he plays because the toughness that he plays with\nMark great stuff cardinals forty niners coming up later today on Fox will be watching thank you\nThank you guys take\nOkay cardinals and forty niners it's interesting we're going to go check it on the rams and sea hawks coming up in a few minutes as well that NFC West has really been I don't know if this is too strong a word for it but it it's just shaping up to be kind of disappointing\nBecause the whole thought going in was going to be hey the rams the favorite let's see what they can do but the challengers are you know Jimmy ... forty niners\nOh let's see if Arizona led by defense can do what they can do and Seattle was maybe a revitalized running game or can may maybe squeeze another year or two out of on whatever they've been doing for the last decade\nAnd I feel like the answers across the board on the ramp shore ah ramps challengers have just been like in ... no no no\nYou know it's funny when when you think about the NFC West there's so many similarities right now to the AFC East of old obviously rams replicating patriots as far as a ... juggernaut and the defense says point top notch right now and then you look at those niners\nAnd you think to yourself oh my goodness they finally have their quarterback how many times have we said that\nAbout burying teams across the agencies didn't pan out obviously you're going to see first round quarterbacks like tannahill a it was for for the dolphins and it it just never really caught fire and to me that's the Josh Rosen story in Arizona\nI I just see so many striking similarities between these two divisions I feel like the rams are about to go on a roll of dominance in that division for a long time\nYeah I'm In the larger you you you look at what they're doing I think the saving\nGrace is from a financial standpoint\nOr can the rams do this for a long period of time it it looks good but they've spent so much money guys like ... there are going to be pieces that over the next couple of years will go away I'll drop below in theory will be healthy I mean the story will take it to turn I think about this year looks like an easy year\nAbout Jared golf though his career was going one way and then all of a sudden showing McVeigh comes in revitalize his him could this be a situation where a head coach really has the you're the player to the point where buddy if if you can take less and we can get more we can keep this train a role and think about Tom Brady yeah\nJoy great stuff great job you great to talk to you thanks so much for doing it today\nBanks heavy are well we're alert and that's what I\nI Am I well in fact you joy Taylor are up there for sea hawks rams coming up later today on Fox them rose

nothing that's set up by about sixty five yard a catch to a chimney golladay I'm so that made up a little bit for the touchdown but he didn't jet earlier and we're already at least in the early going seem to have an answer to one of our big questions\nCasey all French greater than Jacksonville defense Patrick malls and the to solve that even in the rain or just the top defensive football they look exactly the same ...\nThey're just doing ... and quite frankly I guess the shooting surprised me used to playing announcements being in Kansas City\nAnd you know Andy Reid is going to prepare them for whatever forecast is on the docket for a weekend uh football uh yeah so the rain has not affected them uh Jacksonville looks uncomfortable as the the chiefs are in the red zone again\nYeah first or

these\nEarly games but right now take a look at the big game that's coming up later on today\nA with Joe Buck is the Vikings an eagles get together in a game that is a rematch of the NFC championship from a year ago but a much different scenario today Joe thanks so much for coming on let's start with the Vikings running game what is going on with Donovan Cook\nAnd and just the Vikings running game a ... in total what are they saying about it right now\n[noise] called Donovan cooks not gonna play um\nHe's not going to be active for this game as we've been told so that means more on ... and then I've got two rookies behind him and I soon and rock Thomas you know one thing they said the U.S is we're not just going to run the ball because everybody says ... or\n... so good defending the run that if they're going to win this game\nEspecially with the way their defenses plan they're gonna have to throw the ball roll well so are they going to try to establish Iran yeah I think they always come in to every game trying to do that but but they're going to have to throw the ball to win this one in Philadelphia\nI look at the Philadelphia Eagles are ... much of it centers around Carson wins obviously but Zack or it's just such a weapon and against these linebackers those are favorable matchups I'm curious how do you see this game going are they going to try to pressure once or play more coverage to make sure they keep a tight end up bay\nAnd I think they're going to try to pressure once I I think they they have to you know get him on the ... see what his he\nLooks like see how he physically response to pressure in his face and that's always been\nA one of the strong suits of Mike Zimmer you know he knows how to pressure quarterbacking outside of the guys the pressure of pre snap and and typically when they're going good and they come from all different directions right now they're they're linebackers do not have a sack\nOr in two thousand Eighteen and it's a pretty good line backer group\nBut the air sacs right now ... that's got a couple of McKenzie Alexander has won a blessing from the slot the other sects or up front so I I Would think one of those linebackers will end up with a at least one in this game I I think they're going to try to pressure once and getting to space\nJoe Block where those microbes eagles later today on Fox Joe so much expectations for the Vikings coming into the year and they get their week one over the forty niners and then after that it's just been an odd a journey for them that trip to Green Bay that ended up in a tie\nOf the game that none of us can explain with what happened in home against buffalo and then they just run into an absolute bugs on Thursday night a week and a half ago against the rams but that leads to a one two and one record and now really hard assignment\nToday it is it panic time if they can't get a win today\nI don't know I mean I I look at that division you have to be a real firm believer in Chicago I think that they're going to run away with it you know as as ... go to the giants I don't think any of these teams go into panic mode\nAh but I I think they have become navy desperate desperate to better word these guys like to use but I yeah\nI just don't see anybody running away with the north and the same can be said about the NFC East\nI mean you've got Washington on top of two and one they play on Monday Night at New Orleans a Dallas who knows where they're going to be a after a after the night game so I I just ah I just don't think there's a team that's going to dominate the division which means that Philly andme Minnesota\nYou know ... to into in Minnesota is one two and one I just don't think that that this becomes a must win because I think there's still time to do something in the division\nReports out Iverson Griffin not returning anytime soon because of some of the the mental issues she's dealing with you mentioned the aggressiveness of Mike Zimmer as a defense of coal plant for the Vikings I look at the Vikings past Russian they only generated one sack against Jared golf\nIs that more attuned to a great sense of one in LA or is that something that the Vikings are struggling with\nFour\nI think yeah I think there are struggling with it I you know Jared golf just pick them apart and you know he exposed the corners trait waned doesn't even playing in this game is out with a concussion so they get even\nBetter than I have a rookie Mike Hughes out it\nLeft corner Xavier roads will ah will trail around after our son Jeffrey for the for the better part of the afternoon\nSo you know to go back to an earlier question you've got that hurts Dallas got her tied in Philadelphia a Nelson Aguilar that worked Jordan Matthews back in ... this is still a very good op ants in Philadelphia and it's not what the rams haven't LA but if you're a soda defensively\nAnd have struggled the way they have you know they let the league last year given up less than sixteen points a game now they're given up twenty seven and a half the game so he's got basically twelve points going on the scoreboard more this year than last\nAnd you're on the road under five hundred and you're trying to you're trying to win this game with the defense it's under band against an op ed that at home it's been pretty unbeatable so\nI I think the Vikings have their work cut out for him I'm not saying they can't win I think it's going to be a really good game but\nBetter figure something out here fast defensively and I think we'll be saying that this early and a year\nAgo I Want to know real quick about your trip to Philly or the fans there I absolutely love them all but I Know also or does not take them long\nTo let the shine kind of wear off like they can find a pessimist within really quick so even though they're they're still got the super bowl glow to into now or with a you know come from a head last last week how the Philly fans doing\nI think they're All right I mean I I think when you look back at at the way last year and it it was storybook and while this is a rematch of the champ game that was case cane I'm against that polls and\nNow we've got her cousins against Carson when\nI think they they are willing to give Carson a chance to settled back in the soft Benson opportunity to to get back into a rhythm get back into a slow their defense is still very good the problem is the secondary a defensively\nI think if there's one area that fans are out there talking about they took the corner position especially jailing bills to struggle so they've got bodies back there or they lost riding McLeod they're free safety\nSo that they are going to have to mix and match\nYou might see a von ... says five nine hundred eighty four pounds plant safety or in this game for Philadelphia So the secondaries an issue that means that Jim Swartz going to have to get fresh year up front get pressure with glitches whatever it takes to try to take the heat off that secondary I think that's the area that fans\nTo try to take the heat off that secondary I think that's the area that fans around here talk most about right now Joe it's always great to have you with thank you for taking the time All right guys thanks\nOkay Joe Buck you're getting ready for Vikings and eagles later today on Fox gosh this game is just about\nAs delicious as they call\n'em and is it a entirely possible I mean not not possible I mean it's possible that\nIf the Vikings win this game both of these teams come out of here with a record that they're not very happy with after five weeks uh but no matter what and nobody would have predicted this the loser this game after five weeks the NFL season got a losing record and where were these two teams no one would have seen that common\n\nWind up I Want to have your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for detail half past ... [laughter]\n\n\nVery busy out already [laughter] our giant sub founder quarterback in the future [noise] and they call him all the B.\nY. U. wanted quarterback money wired it out\nI mean seriously how annoy you use it probably on the sideline right now but like\nThe you lie that say it's all about else failed fifty seven yards only ... on the giants\nAre ah hanging in there is I think the best way to say it hanging in there and Carol White or are they still trailed this one twenty to ten but hey they got to the end zone and it was not courtesy of Eli Manning\nNo no it was in uh the New York football giants amid another controversy started by number Thirteen\nAre now in a ball game because the number of Thirteen and we have a missed extra points in Cleveland well by their new kicker Joe support we is a rookie who'd they brought in tractor they fired their kicker in New Orleans yes for missing a field goal in two extra point\nLike I don't think they even let them onto the team plane but you know with Joseph can do which is the same thing like a brother and sister do when they fight and mom and dad come in to punish both of them and they're like look at him over there you know what Joseph can do he can say hey you got to see what Beijing Crosby did today\n[laughter] so uh this guy just admitted extra points but based in Crosby has missed all three of his field goal tries to do some of them from short range yet no laws we've got the yes yeah you might\nIt might this happens a lot of talented people not just not just checkers golfers when when you're pitchers sometimes you have to step off the rubber this happens in the spotlight positions and kicking is one of those where you need to have ice water running through your veins\nOr we also have a real problem in Kansas City and this is the problem\nUm if the defense is going to play well\nWell then just forget about it is over we got to pick six of Blake mortals was trying to throw screen passed for God to throw the ball over the have the defensive linemen uh he catches it goes the other way for twenty yards piece of cake walks into the end zone touchdown gene ths Raul dissolved squandered it often do minutes to go to the break\nI think it was deep for that is one of the guys on the defensive wind the chiefs absolutely need to step up they drafted him in the first round and there was a high expectations and it was all it was all just in Houston for a while a generating the past rush so it's good for Kansas City they're finally seeing returns on that product\nAnd they're playing inspired complimentary football so they kick it off\nAnd go figure they make a great play on the cover team so they can\nThey pinned the opponent deep again I I just the Kansas City chiefs the Los Angeles rams those are two teams that in all three pages\nThey really complement each other well no I'm not saying that she says ... have looked outstanding defensively they have been but complementary football means when you have a nurse you're rolling your way the other features don't screw up the nurse ship\nFree winter's day they go to Vegas covers dot combat Vegas covers dot com by the way we mentioned that rounds touchdown we should mention who got it Baker may feel to restart agents touchdown round suddenly in front of the ravens six to three and a defensive struggle but it's not very surprising it looks a little dreary in Cleveland today when these two division teams match job\nThis is usually what happens like even when the browns have been dreadful for the last few years ago when the ravens come to town it seems like a low scoring defensive struggle and so that's what they've got going on today can also add and here's a little bit of an eyebrow raiser\nOther dolphins have now taken a poor Jean to nothing lead in Cincinnati a Kenyan Drake has touched\nGene to nothing lead in Cincinnati a Kenyan Drake has a touchdown catch I'm trying to\nGet info on where the other score took place um but I think it was a a punt return touched down though yes\nI should grant I think it was yeah it was a\nWell we're going to get this info it was a grant ... for Seventy yard was it a punt return though I'm that's what I'm looking at a will try to get more information on what happened and what we do know OK Seventy are pot return touchdown dolphins are up fourteen to nothing\nAnd or any dog's been having a really good year and having a really good year today a level of sixteen a hundred and forty one yards that seems fine no touchdowns he does have one perception Joe mix in his back not doing a whole lot Nineteen\nYards with his ten carries and again this is the head scratching\nThat seems to go a week to week with the Miami Dolphins even quarter to quarter you look at the games remember the raiders were beating them in Miami the whole game and then all of a sudden the fourth quarter there like boom bang bang we win\nAnd even at three you know no one believes in and they go to New England seem Miami's a fraud Miami's a fraud on the road in Cincinnati blanket the\nBangles listen ... and and here's the funny thing about the other side of that same and Andy Dalton is a good quarterback and and that surprises everybody when you say it out loud it doesn't seem to make sense but last year twenty five touchdowns twelve interceptions year before that Eighteen and eight\nAnd he's thrown for over three thousand yards and those in those back to back years he's been ... she's been Harold did for his efforts you sign up and some weapons although they lost diaper which is hurting them today clearly\nIn a a in a in a a a game they're putting up a bagel so far\nBut but this is this is this is bangles football they they when a bunch of games every year and everybody's scratches there had at the end of the season going how they make it into the wild card well it's largely attributed it Andy Dalton this Steelers game finally we're seeing a little bit of defense being played in it's in the lower ...\nYeah I tell you what though this was just an incredibly ill advised play by a veteran quarterback and you have to wonder if the locker room shattered didn't lead to it than rothfus burger on a second and goal from the south and bought himself some time rolled outlast\nAnd just out all kinds of time ah but as finally defender started to\nConverge on him he just sort of tossed it up you know sort of fluid up in the middle of the air attempted four who Antonio Brown and so I'm not surprised that he's going to try to force the Baltimore Antonio Brown after all this chatter what happens to Montana case he picks it often the Steelers tape points off the board\nWho by the way it's filling in for an injured John O'Neill and and I don't know if everybody's following this kid at the Monterey case Z but he's he's looking like a ball or that's a ball hawking the secondary the falcons really\nTheir only shot at stopping anybody in the passing game is when this kid gets turnovers warm he's been doing a fantastic job earned his way into the starting defense\nGranted with an injury but he shined on special teams as well so I Am very least one of the forest secondary players or can get some things done for the Atlanta Falcons but the falcons largely have been leaning on Matt Ryan and company offensively to saying game\nSoccer lining up to the game in Cleveland those ... it is blocked it is blocked by the Cleveland Browns\nHalf time is here the browns will hang onto the lead six to three let's go back to Kansas City I Want to check in on something here our Blake portals his nine of Nineteen had to pick six a short time ago every time I start to want to believe in this guy\nHe has a performance like he's having today and I don't mind if the defense just if they're doing something to you both of those is throwing the ball to places where his receivers art ... he ... he looks awful today yes\nBorn born owes is a very borderline quarterback and so when you have an early lead against the quarterback ooh struggles pumping the ball down field who struggles playing against more coverage or basically allowing the defense to spend the wheel they can get in grass when they want to\nThey can they can do what they want there's ... there's no need now to worry because you have a twenty point cushion this is what Blake's going to struggle he gets exposed in these games Jacksonville Jaguars much like almost every team that has a dominant defense and they pour off and they have to play with the lead otherwise it gets ugly fast\nAll right I also mentioned something just happened and I came that it never happened in the\nIn the NFL this year uh and and I can't even remember if it's ever happened in history and that thing is a patent homes interception us other jacks picked him off all but the Blake bottles picks six came just moments later it's his first pick of the year I don't know if he had any last year in the one game that he played against that run after look it up\nA but it has just been all touchdowns notice from all of this year the jags finally get one on him and then they turned it right back over and that's why you're seeing Kansas City have such a comfortable\nLead right now it's what it is I think and oh by the way Sam Donald is found his

know how different they are I simply know they are way more exciting than they used to be well they look\nAnd and I think that's a fair assessment to make they definitely look different I I I think believe there's a hell of a thing in football if you don't have it you don't have much and I think that Baker Mayfield has Brown's team that is largely the same in complex in as far as the ...\nSo how's the browns team that is largely the same in complex in as far as the personnel they have around this team from last year but what they have now is belief I think they truly believe they have their quarterback in the future and guys are playing harder because of it\nAll right and so far today for Baker may be old Thirteen of Nineteen for a hundred and fifty to one touch down one

Baker may I really I really do the more I see them\nThe moral like on a he's dynamic he's got a team believing who did in a year ago actually ... rounds played tough last year but I just think they have a future now and I think it starts with number six and ... and that's been trickling down to the rest of the roster\nAnd we are coming to a live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios fifty minutes considered Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance guy go dot com for free read quote are there we go Packers uh let's see uh what's the scripts I think it's a fall down twenty four to nothing\nAnd then here comes Aaron Rodgers a leash he's not quite limping enough for my taste or can you have the producers talk to our Rogers and that in limbo a little bit more here in the second half as he starts to engineer this coming back to ... age are in Detroit\nYou know it is funny that you mentioned that because she quarterback\nThat you'll see are both playing right now do this you'll see them\nMaybe throw a couple of more limps in the in the gate after throwing a touchdown pass I Know who you're about to say Aaron Rodgers is guilty of this but big Ben Roethlisberger I mean almost on a near constant basis it's like ... been questionable week with an ankle we don't know if he can go and then he throws for four hundred fifty yards and for touchdown\nAnd every time he was coming off the field is doing this he's doing\nI talked to somebody get well let me put my arms around you I mean it it great Hollywood it's box office but I'll tell you it drives me nuts [laughter]\nStart at the plain parade why you would think during a plane yeah like\nIt's kind of a football physical version of what happens to the British accent when they sing\nLike where's your accent go like how come you can live all Irving she can't even walk but once the ball snaps all of a sudden you've got four four feet again it's like\nPeople are like okay listen so Aaron Rodgers has a nice so obviously they're not going to be doing bootleg then it's like Aaron Rodgers rest for Ninety seven years to Josh down and he was limping after every\nSingle one of those yards well here so good that somebody named Marquez Valdez gambling who I really am suggesting a herd of gets rid of this gambling because I'll find his Marquez Valdez [laughter] that's a very very marketable sounds like a European come keeps the door and I came to the New America is in search of grain and hope\nSounds like a guy who's got a touchdown catch today and then\nJamal Williams gets the two point conversion reception and it is twenty four to eight in favor of the lions but here\nCome the Packers and speaking of your guy big band I you know what his act just brought to the table upsets down past to Antonio Brown and so the wife fire apparently seems to be working rather well for the moment in Pittsburgh editors twenty to ten\nFavor of the Steelers and by the way it's been you know good ball movement good scoring likely expected but more Steelers defense than I thought they been able to get to not Ryan some on the past Raasch\nOr they have not been able to do that a whole lot this year and in fact they're force in another plug right now so uptight and about to get the ball back two fifty to go in the third quarter\nYeah Matt Ryan's been sacked four times during this game and that's what's been missing out of the Steelers defenses pressure on quarterbacks and that's how you generate turnovers that's how you get things going where you are getting off the field in three down and you are having more success our fence away because you're given more opportunities\nIn this special teams just blocked upon and the falcons will turn over on down hang out with a partner got the ball and he's running around like crazy\nAnd there's not enough for her first out a while or the punter broke like three tackles ... so the fish will even if they're okay today the serious effects is that well because the punter groceries Achenbach sure\nThe punter for Atlanta has now more force miss tackles hunter and then I fell however they generated a sum total of negative to yards on his uh his attempt there now yeah this was great edge pressure by the Steelers\nA punt return team uh they they sucked up a bunch of blockers and then the interior rush got the ... they were able to tackle and so they get fortuitous field advantage here\nGoing in or early in the second half\nYeah they're going to have the ball I think somewhere in the neighborhood of about the twenty yard line\nA so already in the red zone already up ten here come the Steelers are the chiefs on the move again they're already appointed to nothing at a big cats from Travis Kelsey has just move the ball down to about the Jacksonville twenty yard line a main signed the liars lions are now going to try to\nAh keep the pressure on the Green Bay Packers\nWho are threatening to make this one a game second intend for the lions just shy of midfield\nAre what are you what do you see going on up here in Cleveland right\nNow well in Cleveland ... this is getting to be what we're what we ... what we've seen out of\nBaltimore over the past couple of weeks they're pretty balanced team great defense really solid often says well\nSo they're going to go down swing that's for sure uh they only trailed by six there but I I'll say this about ... homes and then we're going to get to a fourth down play in this Detroit Packers game ... homes or with all the window dressing that this happens does there are occasions where you are broken plates on these play action so that long path to Travis Kelsey\nWas impressive he works the pocket as good as any young quarterback I've seen in this week in a long time\nAll right a person go for the Steelers from the Ford yard line James counter will get the Kerry he'll go nowhere so second and go from the for coming up except it's not going to be first and goal from the two did you see what just happened here in Pittsburgh take a look at that James Caan or get stopped\nAt the for your light on first and goal all but the linebacker are pushing back and at the end of the play watch him on the road James Caan or to the ground\nAfter the whistles had already been blown wide\nCome out of value a lot of they throw their arms up in the air like why why did I didn't even mean to\nThrow him violently on the ground as well those were blown yeah a couple of bone had play is happening in two games going on that one in Atlanta and this one in Detroit sustain\nThe drive for Detroit because of a personal fouls on the Packers on Fort down so Stafford in the offing back on the field and they're charging down the field right now it's second and aid\nFor the lion's often send again twenty four eight over the Packers at Ford Field\nAll right so that one is definitely adventurous a lot of time lapse seven and a half to go here\nIn the third quarter Aaron Rodgers and the second half at Ford Field feels like something I've seen before right off but they are now as you said in talkers territory after thirty nine here Stafford on second in a looking to throw and it is going to be incomplete or a ball that was dropped by his tight and had it momentarily\nAlso let's not forget about the New York giants game they were not supposed to win a game it didn't look like they were going to win but all of a sudden they are really hanging close they've added a field goal here in the third quarter Panthers twenty giant sixteen and\nYou know you almost feel like a a golfer who's struggling all day and then finally just stripe went off the tea sometimes it just takes something to rattle you as a team and get your attention and maybe that trick play in the first out without a doubt back in the hitting sick one Barclay for a touchdown got the energy going for the New York giants\nWhen you need to look at those conditions and onto the really competing with the ... ...\n... she's been able to dance with all the farmers mostly kind of conditions and enhance their salaries they twenty than our power inside when\nHe really knows they kind of you with the highest eighty eight degree as well how ... with ... ... when they when they need to answer those twenty seven kind of conditions and that's how it is freezing conditions and on the beach the highest paid ... billion any the plane the Afghan whether I'll genealogists corny\nSounding more training [laughter]\nAnd be delayed college football\nWhen it goes down in your town promise you all talking about football for you is that uh we're the ones that you do\nThis case Fox Sports radio sports when asked\n\nBy one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for detail pass pass why\nA lot into Troy Green Bay in the red zone now down twenty four to eight but it's that getting died at the lives they're seen better for\nThem five for just outside the nerdy moments ago Aaron Rodgers ran for it now he throws and that is complete down to the Y.\nDown to the zoo is Ian for a touchdown he is this is going to get reviewed six ways to solve the man once again it's our buddy Marquez Valdez who's got a third last name as well I Can't blame\nBut even cost of all what determine what you see your catches the ball to pour it serves [noise]\nWe've got me an elbow\nAn elbow terrible blah blah ... comes out and then he recovers\nIt himself in the end zone I say he's dealt with the one what do you say I think\nYou're right I think it's like a down by contact elbow touches before the ball slip through our world\nNow yeah and so I think you'll be down by contact that the half yard line um\nBut if the ruling on the field as the touchdown unless there's\nYou know completely complete\nConfidence and that costs still touched down right so we'll see what they make about but yeah I agree with you I think he's down by contact the half\nYards I yeah I think that elbows down before the ball squirt out and then he recovers it in the end zone so we've either got a Packer touchdown or first and goal or inside the one either way things are look it up for the fact\nAaron Rodgers ... just a moment to go on this Dr fourth down situation you've got to go for your chick who's been ice cold even though you're inside of Detroit ... Detroit territory a decides to run it himself and he gets it all on his own man he just saw a wide opening in the middle of the deep end\nScrambled Aaron Rodgers is one of these guys who you can trust them if you're paying a there is no complacency with this man he's buying injured and he's playing inspired football he's largely the reason why the backers of anything resembling a season right now\nI'm also of interest in Cincinnati picks Dick bangles tie game seven feet off\nDolphins let this one Seventeen to nothing but a year come Cincinnati they've even things up just under twelve minutes left to go giants only down by four in Carolina air driving right around midfield\nIn fact call it now into Carolina territory as Eli Manning just early shepherd they're just shy of these thirty yard line so the giants suddenly on the move and doing some good things the Steelers of rolled away from the ... falcons a little bit about what is now twenty seven to ten\nIn favor of Pittsburgh and we are waiting of course uh the answer all the review in Detroit a with regard to whether or not Green Bay has another touchdown logo for two or is it first and goal the one and if it's first and goal of the one uh may I suggest Aaron John it's just a thought it's just a thought\nUm oh by the way just as we were saying nice things about the New York giants Gerald ... has intercepted has intercepted Eli Manning and I want to know who that was was that Eric Reed\nWho will just intercepted the ball for the Carolina Panthers\nNo that was not Eric read okay but somebody district ...\nHe said I'm Chris Jones part of the reason why the chiefs are ranked so high in fantasy football right now with their ah their bumper return for a touchdown is the fact or I should say entered in intercept you return for a touchdown as Chris Jones big number Ninety five on the defensive line rumbled in for a score now\nHe's in the locker room he's taking a shower early so we just saw an example of al ...\nOh he's in the locker room he's taking a shower early so we just saw an example about river on the new authority or jak players from New York He's in the command center\nAnd a personal found she's Chris Jones initially it was just a Fifteen yard assessment river on reviewed it saw a punch thrown and sent the message to the Kansas City officials get them out of the game wow wow so his days over\nOkay I'm All right so more on that coming out indeed it was Mike Adams on to pick the Packers do get called down at the wand so it is first and goal at the water a and instead Aaron Rodgers will fall into the end zone\nThat is a touchdown a who got that one uh\nKendrick last cat directs okay Kendrick the second tied into the Packers so one way or another they're in and now we're going to get another two point conversion try for Green Bay meantime uh the Atlanta Falcons Smith running one across\nThe goal line right now don't go away there yet still very early in the fourth quarter it's now twenty seven to sixteen with an extra point\nTry on the way All right here comes green base to pour try to get within eight my gosh it's not even the end of the third quarter yet the Packers lost dead\nOr if they get it right here there are only down by a score Rogers are All right that is going to look back to his left that as you get a throwback to the right that it is incomplete bad play just didn't work uh the whole time that one that one was a little while but\nI Will say they're still great play called by Mike mccarthy you have your play maker in space with protection doing what he does best improvising there were two routes running to his side\nAnd a solo route all the way back to the left side occupying the corner and so what you have is a situation where Aaron Rodgers can either run it himself it's there's room improvising the passing game no team or the streets to scramble drill better than the Packers\nSo well unsuccessful on the two point conversion you don't want to put in your place kicker he struggled so mightily this game and you got a lot of making up to do right\nRavens were inside the five yard line when we last left you they ended up settling for a field goal they've now got the ball again I'll start at the fourth quarter Cleveland died of Baltimore's sex and you just watch Brown's games we've done this now fifth we should've raw we get to the fourth quarter\n... it's either coast feels like it's usually got a small lead and you just start thinking to yourself what are they going to do now\nWell see this is the thing about an Aaron Rodgers facing an uphill climb like twenty four points in the second half was Seventeen when he came back and won it in Chicago we want\nAnd you say to yourself oh yeah they they got a chance I mean it's a great chance but they got a chance because they got Aaron Rodgers mean you feel the same way every time\nThe patriots are traveling there are certain quarterbacks certain ... certain teams that you know when it comes to the nitty gritty they're going to get it done right we used to make it interesting interesting with with Baker may feel we haven't seen it yet\nSo you can't necessarily say oh games online bakers going to showcase were Baker does the ... the browns you're going to find their way out of this we don't have that reference point yet and until they start winning these type games\nThis this unfortunate unlucky moniker is going to ten you follow\nThe browns Kareem heart right up the medals for yards out touchdown Kansas City that one's a rat fourteen fifty seven to go to sleep twenty nine to ... over the ... with an extra point on the way I this is out with a statement by the chiefs I I mentioned this\nEarlier uh the chiefs are about to go to five at all but it's not just that I keep in mind what the chiefs of already died in order to get to five you know keep in mind the schedule it started on the road against the chargers and then it went on the road to Pittsburgh\nAnd it's been on the road to Denver forty niners came in had Jimmy gene for three and a half quarters of that football game it was competitive and now\nAre the top defense in football cubs in here and she's thirty plus on the board again they've shredded them I mean this has not been an easy scheduled to start the year and the chief survive it out\nWell look I I mean yes they are fantastic there's no question about it but the Steelers have a bottom ranked defense in this week uh Denver right now is sorely missing weighed Philips or his second year in Los Angeles he's doing tremendous work with that defense\n\nIn the mail saying\nAnd love me and I and\nAnd and bang bang bang and [noise] [noise] yeah well I don't know man ain't got no you're wrong\nOn that and the

here\nMark ... six years and I felt that trend rich Moran burger\nDown the stretch week um wait five National Football league fun fact\nThat the anchor Mayfield Thursday night game against the jets though only time this year the browns have not\nGone over time and what's the score with fifty two seconds to go oh fits nine to nine the ravens just kick the field goal to even it out\nCome on Baker the touchdown maker you got fifty two seconds show us what you got pretty dude last thing the browns want to do right now to line up for a game winning field goal with the chicken problems the bay area and\nOh my goodness gracious the drama\nThat is building with this brown and seem I mean you want to talk about box office you use that term effectively just turn on any Cleveland Browns gain any week of the NFL football season so far you see a close game you see stars on the field you see a young man trying to pull them out of the salary of the league\nAnd he's given opportunities at the end of the game\nTo prove himself each week this is incredible football watching\nAnd Caroline as I'm speaking to you yeah as over to or I should say the fourth quarter a game winning potential drive a bigger may feel begins Carolina in this giants game which is now as close as they can possibly be down the stretch twenty seven twenty four edge over the giants\nThey have a new center in the game co wheel is out with an injury\nOkay speaking of box office erasures to see a devout they Adams down at the one yard line there are still three fifty to go\nThirty one twenty the lines lead the Packers they lead twenty four nothing at half time\nThe Mason Crosby as ms forty eight cakes and they just keep on coming however we're going to get a review here I don't know if there was a Adams caught that ball let's take a good look right here what do you think the ball's moving around moving around doing I think that's an incomplete pass I think it\nTouched the field that he was babbling it on his way down and I think potentially the the nose or the ball touch the turf before he uh he gained control is sort of rolling out of the dive there Baker a first and ten and his own thirty eight\nYard lines are lines got good feel position in theory only needs about twenty five yards to try a field goal but the bronze will mess and we can go to overtime again yeah that's the plan their um either way\nBack to Detroit even it's about the Adams catch is incomplete the Packers still very much alive in this game\nAnd and it's hard not to ask the question of where would they be basing Crosby had even I don't know ... to his for kicks he's written an extra point three field goals lot of 'em from point blank range he's just he's just off today and uh and the Packers are only down by eleven it's got to be really hard for them to look at this\nAnd that and realize how close they could be if he if he was making the case like normally does\nYeah yeah injury on the plane the Detroit secondary on this uh this Bible catch or know catch by divine the Adams so the plot thickens in Detroit\nBecause this is going to be an arrow salt until the very last sounded the whistle is blown a you happier it out if your Aaron Rodgers and the Packers if you're going to have a chance humid score fast and so any injury to the second there is going to affect them very much\nYou're setting up that force in one talk in Carolina they did go forward they got it and now the Panthers are down in scoring range however James still not over two thirty to go giants out to time outs plus the two minute warning if they can even hold the Panthers to a field goal there are only down by six he like many will have a shot\nBig third into for Baker may feel right now from his own forty six yard line thirty to tie gained thirty seven takes on the clock health law to the white has got back in the open\nAnd indeed that's going to set it up actually joined outlay August Landry drivers later came out of the backfield into the wild and now Cleveland got the ball into Baltimore territory tick tick tick they've got one time out they don't want to use in here he got down to the thirty seven yard line\nBaker will spike that one second intend coming out sixteen seconds\nOr you could drive feel go from this distance but they're not going to feel comfortable with that they need they need another five ten yards at least\nAs shame on Jarvis Landry a veteran receiver a guy who they're relying on to lead this group I mean\nGreat conversion when they needed to happen but what are you thinking turning back\nUp on the field you know I mean there was the clock you just wasted ten seconds a valuable time and the game situation that's a bone had moved yeah and there was\nAbsolutely nothing in his way to walking out of bounds gained nothing off or put his head down and barreling into the defender so here comes the second intent play for Baker outta the shotgun he'll throw off the income played\nIncomplete that is off the hands of his tight in David and joker so third intend coming up it's about a I Would say from where they are right now about fifty four fifty five yard field goal try also they need they need something on display I'll tell\nYou I think you're in Port on territory you really yeah well because\nThere's twelve seconds left so I don't either I mean if you don't get anything here and there's five seconds left on the clock I'm kicking the field goal why why not\nI I guess I suppose but at the same time I would just as students then routes to the end zone and take my chances of winning the game that way you have an inexperienced kicker in a game winning situation you haven't been able to\nRely on your kicking and they will in fact go to fourth down as a pass was batted away by the Baltimore defense so its fourth in China okay\nFourth and then from the thirty seven so you're looking at either as you suggest throw to the end zone and there's ten seconds last or I Would suggest\nYou would suggest throw it to the end zone and there's ten seconds last or I Would suggest Joseph from about fifty four yards away\nI'll take I'll just say oh it's it's yeah yeah that's what your wishes had been granted him I hate it when I hear your accent and I see the same way well hey we got it all doing\nVery well but here we go ah Joseph\nFor the lead ten seconds to go fifty five yard field goal try for the browns and there's all this boy editors laughed at is the I think\nHe had the leg but it's left at least five seconds on the clock to see I mean Baltimore's not going to try to do anything with this I'm pretty sure they'll just Neal audit or maybe they'll throwing up\nA book five seconds left to go\nAnd the browns walk to be headed to overtime for the fourth time in five weeks\nIt's a shame yeah playing in Boston because that goes over the green monster there every time that part or out of the right hand the batter's box yeah so Joseph misses the field goal it's nine nine in Cleveland and it looks [laughter] you will in fact out over ... again\nAll right back to Detroit where we're three forty to go air Rogers was just moments ago about to try to throw this one in the ends on his arm got hit right as he was released and you get so now\nThe Packers outlawing whilst are really up against it I mean they've had everything go wrong in this game they really have no business still being in this game but because of an Rogers they are\nBut now they're facing a fourth and fifth dean from outside feel go range and feel go range at this point doesn't matter anyway or does it look at the U.S be bringing Mason Crosby art instead of going forward on fourth and Fifteen they'll try from fifty six yards what do you want to bet he makes it\nYeah that we missed that one too oh my so it is a cool off for five from base in Crosby you can't really jump all over 'em all now that was from fifty six yard ... it's\nAlmost cruel and unusual point if you're Mike mccarthy I assume you're cutting him tomorrow and that's the reason why you put them out there in that situation\nBecause quite frankly when a kicker or a player in general is struggling the way he is I get it game on the line maybe a figure he can pull it together but a kicker is mentality so fragile yeah this uh\nAlso Earl market now offers get tired may girls market here one stop

year All right here we go so we'll keep an eye on that one um the ravens and browns remaining overtime and here comes the clock is should we talk about every week Brown's out the ball back again now uh bought only four minutes to go and they're deep and their own territory we'll see what\nThey're good no from sixty yards sixty three away\nAnd it is good and the Panthers that they've seen in the New York giants what\nDid I tell you we played the brown you leave that kind of time on the clock wow if you're going to score and you're going to have a marginal lead and we're talking one or two points you do not okay for the outcast hold out of bounds you get\nDown all around you are suggesting this is what you're suggesting that I Want to talk this hour you okay hold it back down you went to Penn State out first I did it out for ... okay I'm back because\nThis is what you're proposing sake one Barclay most athletic people in the entire world grabs a ball I passed out in the flat that's right and he is running for the sideline the ten the five step out he sees the pile on\nAnd you are suggesting he should not go for it when you're traveling with less than a minute to go so\nThe ... is that what you're suggesting by percentages the odds of you scoring a touchdown from the five yard line extremely high\nSo you step out of bounds maybe you can even get closure if you lower to shoulder maybe it goes down at the true yard line on the sideline and then you up or down and time outs remaining\nTo close out this game with a touchdown with no time left for Carolina do any no time outs left by the way okay no time out even still so you're telling me you line manning can has three or four opportunities to throw the ball to the to choose me for opportunity throw the ball in luck the low red and you're not ...\nI'm I'm putting my faith that you leave Carolina with the wind\nAnd zero time left on the clock as opposed to having the ball back over the Carolina with a minute and change and they go down and they win the game\nThere's obviously a risk either way here or there like you and I do not see this the same way for ... for two reasons hey I Believe when the touchdown is there you got to take the touchdown because the touchdown is not guaranteed no matter where you're on the field hey but\nBe to even ask\nUs acorn Barclay at full speed um when you're taught smell the end zone died forget the end zone and your trailing to even have him things in that moment you should veer right and go out of bounds I it's so anti instinctual\nI I feel but if you're a football team out\nOf the things that you do remember but he hit a sixty three orders I listed I act like that was like what the Panthers just it was a likely scenario I'm not saying that sixty three yard or was likely but if that's what they needed to shield but if you go from the twenty five yard line to\nGet to field goal range and I'm Talking about acceptable field goal rains not Superman range\nYou you're you're not talking about all that difficult of a task of the way our fence is being played in the NFL nowadays you can throw the ball all our deep and too much so in my opinion handing the ball back over with a one point lead with anything nearing two minutes left on the clock he's insanity\nBut that's not what was your wasn't humid if there was one thirty ... no no it was one twenty when sterling shepherd caught the ball to go down to the fifteenth so we're talking about a minute\nAnd all they did was get timid field they just happen to advocate for nearly sixty three younger now you're talking odds to me I Will take my chances with the lead at a kicker lining up from sixty three maybe\n... maybe it's not often supplier me but I don't want to give the ball back to an up and going against my defence when I have an opportunity late in the game to lay one down at the goal line or step out of bounds and give me for opportunities to go in and scored my our fence and when the ball\n... look I hear you they're both they're they're both interesting quite frankly you're in good shape either way\nI think that your your your other good shape Europe better fifty fifty chance to win the game no matter what you do I just think would say go sake one bark and his running down the sideline and spell the end zone man you you can't tell that guy to hit the brakes and if I coach them up to do that though is that hair but I just hope the short\nBetter situational football teams understand if anything the time left on the clock how many time outs each team has they put their team in the best situation and when and we've seen this twice now early in the NFL season\nThe opportunity for a team to take the lead or send it to over time we've all through much time on the clock and it ... it it just it just happens too often I think it's bad football\nUp you can let him in a point to the guy got people do these situations right the browns are there to to\nBuy the browns have defeated the ravens okay Christian garlic with along touchdown catch\nFrom Josh Rose an extra point there is good cardinals at night are resolved through a quick start cardinals lead at Seventy six here come the raiders back in the field for a third and goal I'm as a this drive for the raiders has been taken quite some time some penalties things is loaded down as they got into the reds out but the trail\nThe chargers three to nothing but they are threatening and Dan Bailey for the Vikings opening drive twenty eight yard\nField goal do good unbelievable hand daily yeah but I Believe guy that\nWe're all talking about that that should replace all these guys\nWell yeah for a while he was a free agent who was very successful kicker in Dallas they got rid of him he remained a free agent until he finally got signed\nA and there you go early entry in this game not looking great Seattle takes the feel for the second time out fence if we are against the rams at home in Seattle and this has been a really interesting year for the backfield\nAs a as I Believe who's this cat is David David Davis who is their third string running back to to go into camp\nA and then of course Chris Carson who is their second string or but but how nice end of the year last year I've gotten most of the runway shot penny their first round or has not and I believe we have a big stop we do in in LA yeah we\nHave a third down stop so to be a raiders field goal dry and it was a great play by Darwin James the guy that John Gurdon said this week you wish they would have drafted\nOkay well yeah so in sending firing shot silver to a Reggie McKenzie is all about 'em there when James obviously a fantastic safety out of Florida State doing great things for the chargers this season so far has been one

the history of\nThat for a poor out of five games have gone to overtime and and what the the one that didn't go good to have gone right you're right\nThis is it's been a remarkable remarkable season for them uh and the way that you you could lose so many different ways you lose her off of kicker you lose all the NFL saying my bad my bad that was a fumble you know the next day or so few days later after the last of the raiders I mean and by the way that loss of the writers\nYou told me keep hope alive for the brown snow you told me they're going to get this thing done do you and I go off the air we're in the back they're watching the game and I I'm a take off and leave so were you and I said you know the rate is going to win this thing right\nThe minute that that for down run that they did not give Carlos Hyde which we and we also I was first do and they didn't give it to him I said you know they're gonna lose right it was just sitting right there it was very Cleveland ask\nAnd then they even get a win today it was very Cleveland as it does make a clean feel go that ad dramas even a field goal you forget\nThird round yeah and I [laughter] I don't care who your team is on some what you feel about the NFL\nWatching the Cleveland Browns play this year especially coming off are not getting to know the players in and their new quarterback\nIt's must see TV have you I I mean say what you want yeah I understand the record there are two to one one which is a monument is for them for them that is true but there must see TV they give you everything you want\nIn a sporting event the high the lows the the cheers the jeers I couldn't take my eyes off watching\nThat game and it was the Cleveland Browns All right oh I told you may have been bad so long that they've become lovable yes they have become like everyone's favorite\nLevel ball they stuck with a hope they do well ... rounds everybody sorry and in every sport has that team it was the clippers for a while and then all of a sudden the clippers became good medical covers or fun or you don't have room for the clippers and and\nUm I mean that now you have the browse being that team so but they do get a when finally it's twelve nine for them to victory of the ravens ravens who I was just getting ready to say hey quietly\nWere maybe sleeping on them and the AFC and then they all of a sudden fought for the browns but again that's not a bad law suit in the brown at Cleveland anymore like this year you that's not bad laws is not something you would laugh at it or something the coach would think about maybe I'm going to get fire with that\nUm it had been one thousand\nAnd twenty nine days since the browns won on a Sunday oh I mean you would think at some point God would spare them at\nThe [noise] the big guy that\nWould answer some prayers on a Sunday from Cleveland fans So Greg Joe civil the game when he feel go ... or thirty seven years ago which again was it looked like it was tipped barely went over the up right I mean\nYou said you want to go to shine down on them he picked that ball out of out of out of ... out of your defeat\nIn guided through the upright\nA beam of\nLight shown down from the heavens as that ball was cascading\nCounter ... counter clockwise through the air barely making the or the cross bar and that beam of light carried it to victory\nGod loves the Cleveland Browns well I Would hope so at this point I thought he loves everybody's hoping that the browser get some love twelve nine they get to a victory couple of uh keeping you up there on the games happening right now you got three three ties eagles just kick the feel go eagles are tied up with the Vikings three three\nAnother tie you got the rams and sea hawks seven seven the rams are moving though and jerk off almost got laid out a play it go\nAnd uh we have uh Darryl Johnston is going to help us breakdown another AFC team as he is joining us now or was that the falcons and the Steelers and finally the Steelers getting going there Oh thank you for joining us and uh it looks like\nAntonio Brown and been rough as burger they finally get right at the ship but whatever been going on between those two\nYeah but it it was really the the big play down the field that was missing 'em\nAnd those will though he was in a second thought but didn't adoption or\nShe is still being sink underneath an intermediate but it was that big throw down the field at all I got one of those this afternoon so I'm sure that uh the Steeler fan base was was very excited to see that\nMost let's talk about James Caan are and what he means to this team no levy on bail\nHe said he may show up around week seven at this point it's clear an obvious that he is the missing piece in the money game and also in the passing game coming out of the backfill how much does he mean does this team with the hold out of Libya on bill and the uncertainty of what's going to happen there\nI I think it's critical and and they just got to be able to get off the better storage um yeah the two games that they weren't able to use\nJames was the Kansas City game where they went down Twenty one nothing in the first quarter in Baltimore when they went down fourteen um and you have a tendency to become one dimensional at that time so against Cleveland and then again today against Atlanta or they were able to stay a little bit more balanced and and it's kind of funny we went back it's a look at it and I think you know you think of the um Dallas\nIs a home run hitter in the game and his longest one last year was twenty seven yards and\nJames Garner had a twenty nine year old or today so I'm [laughter] saying\nAnd James Carter had a twenty nine yards today so I'm saying you know you're talking about the same guy but but I Do agree with what you're saying that you know as as you're moving forward\nUm you know maintain that balance give him an opportunity I think Ben's very very comfortable with him in the past in game I'm In actually said you know he has a better report with him because he gets to the route that point quicker\nGets turned around you know sometimes I felt like he was holding the ball or waiting for ... said he kinda runs this pass routes like he runs with the football that very patient waiting for things to kind of open up so uh it sounds like they develop some good chemistry you know already this season in the past game as well\nWould would lead to them trading Libby on bill this year do you think\nWell I just think if they can't get to a point where the numbers work I think that that's the biggest thing always in the situation and you know I understand the frustration on both sides um you know maybe on bell is you know franchise for the second time in a row that's that's frustrating um he wants he wants more guaranteed money\nUm you know we had this which can be Graham a couple of years ago he wanted wide receiver money's tight ... wide receiver or he's used as a wide receiver buddies and and let beyond you know watch that\nThat respect that he's had because he's a he's a very dynamic player in the past and gay but that's not going to happen so uh it's up to the Steelers to get to a point with guaranteed money that he feels comfortable with\nA you know where the injury to harm is a you know there there's an example that he's going to pull out so it'll be interesting to see how the discussions ... all of a compromise has to happen on both sides and move and we'll see how it works out\n\nNa\nNa\n\nThe laws were all the good songs have\nGone [noise] my
