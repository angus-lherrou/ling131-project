career\nThat's what he's been really good not so good he's about a five hundred pitcher his erase over for I mean this is just who he is at this point it's like people who wanted to sit there with you know in the middle of\nHis career after Shaq was in the league for ten years and they wanted to say when Shaq and to make his free throws now he's not this is just how it's going to go\n... Louis is after making two hundred million dollars and winning MBP if he made a million is going to change that how's that changing his game\nIf he makes me makes them if he ... but if he doesn't he does it you should not be surprised this is who he is it's the same thing with Clinton cursed Shaw this is who he is at this point he's someone who was going to give you a great game and then can give you a bad one\nThis is just the reality of ... pitching and so no one should be surprised I still get people go wow what happened to know this is this is just who you know let's go back to the first\nInning though if um yes yup we play some good fundamental baseball which is also at this point your six of his career we know what he's going to do and that he's going to have ... moment if he throws to the right now but maybe not in and go to turn out as they put you cut it off after one round\nStill you know he gave up seven hits you already got hit hard jerk you know he\nIs you still struck out five ... not sure there's a truck and this is the thing about you know ... you know something we've talked about drought\nFor the last Eighteen months and now people are starting to come around to it is that you're paying Clayton Kurdish off thirty million dollars a year you're paying for this time in the schedule you say well we made the trade for many Machado you traded for many Machado for these last couple of weeks the I don't see us in here in the world series\nThat's what you're paying Clayton Kirsch off war so at the end of the season of Clinton ... hops out he leaves the Dodgers I told you\nThey're trying to push 'em up the door open doors okay Clayton All right we're not going to start some game what\nDo we really want you back well we're not going to talk about that until after the world series is over those are very telling things life without Clinton Herschel for the Dodgers will be very ... very much okay because they're already built with a loaded team in the regular season there for guys on the bench\nThat that that could start for any other team\nA hundred and fifty games a year but because the Dodgers often has so much\nThey sit so we know there are loaded the we know that they now have young pictures coming up Walker ... to the wind up being the next big stood for the Dodgers now they can build that you have extra bat you can trade\nYou know it's much much he's not if you think he's the guy that look you're thirty home runs but he's kind of ... now you could turn him into a really good starting pitcher or something else you need a couple of pitchers\nThe reality without him will be just fine and you know I Know we're talking about next year while you're gay and one of the world series but you know the front office of the Dodgers you're always thinking ahead thinking OK\nOr sold a lot of stories and I bought it should've been an open Mike I Know it that way and Chicago has to rewrite and all like oh you know God yeah I mean you're on the south side for sure yeah we don't care about the situation that as where I was actually at that game\nFor several days I had no voice that really made a lot of people like you know I don't care if it was your guy but I'll be honest\nIs talking about 'cause I 'cause I take umbrage with that figure a home run an echo slam or just lump bigger homerun\nWhining or will be its last one\nCalled a favor\nAnd who could forget like at the end the Ken griffey thirty nine games\nWith the White Sox let's get a lot I Am and he goes\nTo the ground after that we did also celebrate the

and Oklahoma City or are in Indianapolis or or Charleston or a Des Moines\nWell I think if you pay attention to the demographics and the relocation that are going on and off the barricade go All right but that millennial generation and the generation coming in right behind them are more and more are likely to look for those midsize cities\nEspecially in the center of the country uh as to where they think they can best or access to the American dream the cost of living is lower traffic congestion is generally non existent and most of those places\nAnd a lot of places have done a bunch of fresh

one eight six six by boat jumbo we're talking debit card that former Oklahoma City mayor\nFor fourteen years the author of the next American city published by putting them in a man with a lot of innovative ideas let's talk to a dog who calls at July ... from Pittsburgh Katie ... evening Doug welcome to the program\nHi Jen thanks for taking my call I enjoy your show thank you what I what I wanted to ask the mayor about uh Pittsburgh gone to a similar answer made from having industries feeling the biomedical and banking cetera\nUm and it's doing well the region is doing well however the city school the Pittsburgh city schools struggle year after year fewer and fewer families are sending their students to the Pittsburgh public school they'll go anywhere else private school\nA Catholic school charter schools et cetera ... how is it the Oklahoma City public schools are they doing through the transformation of the economy and your city\nWell it's it's a little inconsistent certainly we're we're a little different in that we have twenty four school districts that are inside the city limits of Oklahoma City\nAnd so you have all sorts of different success stories inside those twenty four but the largest district as about forty percent of the population at the Oklahoma City school district and it's it's a you know performing poorly a similar to what you're describing in Pittsburgh\nSo I mean the the urban public school setting it's still it very much a distressed situation across the country\nIn Oklahoma City there are a lot of good public schools um out all around you know that center part of the city and people have gravitated and that's part of the you know the ... that took place over the last few decades people were searching for a better education for their kids\nAnd so we're trying to get more options you know charter schools and other options for kids\nWe're trying to get more options you know charter schools than at other options for kids that for for parents that want to come in and provide more density at the core of the city but I I don't know the single mayor out there that satisfied with the level of education and their inner city district\nYou mentioned charter schools I wanted to ask you more about how successful they've been\nWell most of our biggest success stories are charter schools are not that I Can't tell you that they're all high performing but a lot of them are\nUm and um you know are like Mike one of my granddaughters attempts at a charter school downtown and you know it it's run by a board of our business leaders\nUm who you know kind of insurance success and uh you know there's nothing magical about the about the model it's not that they have a bigger\nBudget they have a smaller budget it's not that they get the hand picked their kids they don't any kid can go there that lives in the district a but\nThey've taken out some of the inefficiencies I think that our public school system is played by and created a model that puts more dollars into the classroom so you know in in that one instance things could be working better I I liked the idea that parents have choices um and in in Oklahoma City there's a lot of choices\nYeah I I Know of course you're acquisition of the NBA thunder franchise and also the opening it part of the maps three project was the the opening of the new stadium where the Oklahoma City red hot your AAA a baseball team are sports franchises a good way to enhance the city because I Know some\nSome urban areas have become disgusted with the ... demands from most sports franchise owners\nWell it's been a big positive for us I I think one of the differences is if you if you don't have a a major league sports franchise and you get one\nIt is on a superficial level up a level of quality that you didn't have before and I'm not saying it should mean that much but it does and and the fact that\nBut suddenly your sports teams are playing teams in New York and Chicago and Los Angeles and that matters because the image of your city to a certain extent as who your sports teams play\nAnd there's a level of quality but a major league sports team can provide to a city the size of Oklahoma City I think it helps our CEOs attract talent from around the country\nWhen you know you offer somewhat a job at a company in Oklahoma City that person no matter where they live in the United states they're going to think of themselves if I take this job I have to live in Oklahoma City or if I take this job I get to live in Oklahoma City\nAnd having a major league sports team is an asset that would get more people that would be more likely to take that job\nOn on a millennial basis my my input from young people is that they want to live in a city that's culturally relevant\nAnd that includes the pop culture\nAnd a major league sports team makes you culturally relevant I mean when was the Westbrook and Paul George to name a couple of our players you know choose to live here and and choose to sign contracts here when they're offered contracts by every other team in the league seemingly\nUm that sends a message that this is a good place to live up in the I think that when sports starts to become\nTired in a city is when they have more than one franchise and people get tired of subsidizing what new facility after another new facility and so I I get it you know if you have three sports teams like Seattle there\nBut we're coming up with a break here that that doesn't move here I'm going to finish your thought on sports teams in just a moment we'll be

this like a five years or ten years down the road or is this the city a popping up right now for\nOil it you know cities are never reached their journey there at least the end of their journey there always evolving\nAnd what we're talking about is starting to purposely create inner cities and urban scores were young people could well and I\nEnd of the environment that has fewer automobiles um more pedestrian amenities and instill you know looks at a call you by from the cost of living\nUm and amenities that appeal to that generation\nA and it you know it's hard to generalize because every city stiffer but almost every city out there in the category we're talking about has some sort of urban revitalization taking place\nAnd young people are attracted to that there's an urbanization going on all over the world and mid sized metros are capitalizing right now and for the foreseeable future\nWife six six five oh jumbo return to a call from Brian in the Ozark, Missouri small town not that far from a a a somewhat smaller midsize cities Springfield didn't do good evening Brian\n... fine question for your guest sure they said uh you have earthquakes in fame flack for all of it

Missouri a down toward do roughly the Memphis metro area and along the Mississippi River I don't think that the New Madrid influence extends as far west as Oklahoma\nUh your thoughts are Mr Mayor\nWell I I yeah I think I think he's just listening to us egos connection but trying to oil and gas exploration and uh-huh and the earthquake it does seem like there's a connection there so\nYou know central Oklahoma was already on a fault it was probably more susceptible when these water injections took place\nUm and like I said you know they pretty much diminished at this point is I think the scientists to work really hard and they know that\nYou know you you can't survive a politically um if you're the cause of these ... a nerve ing earthquakes\nBut I think most people in Oklahoma had been very patient with oil and gas industry it's been a significant part of our economy for a long long time and\nMost Oklahomans are thrilled that United States has been more control of its energy future going forward that we bend light burn and oil and gas industry is playing a major role in our economy um but\nYou know at some point their their technology has got to catch up and figure out a way to do that you bring up the oil and gas that they'd like to bring out a without causing harm on all the rest of this\nNow in the Oklahoma economy of course a a began a pretty much wants to uh uh the presence of a lot of oil was discovered in and of course the the automobile really coming into its own just about the time that Oklahoma became a state back in in Nineteen oh seven\nOr the Oklahoma economy has been tied with energy for for many years is the the state's economy are still that directly tied to energy or has it been in effect diversified\nYeah uncle in the city has diversified look this is talk and so Oklahoma as the state is overly reliant on the oil and gas industry and as a result it's it's a it's calming and its tax revenues cyclical\nAre based on you know how the oil and gas industry is doing but in the oil and gas industry is going through such a transformation right now\nAll of the technology of the advancements that they've been baking and made them more efficient industry uh you know with the current price which is much lower than it was just a few years ago they're able to make a profit\nUm I I Would say we've already reached peak in the oil and gas industry it just simply takes fewer people to extract oil and gas and the ground it's more technology driven and they get more or less gas that it was single well used to ... and so the result of that as a more efficient model\nOr one that ... ... fewer people\nAre but that has really helped the United states determine its own energy future we need to be less reliance on foreign oil\nAnd uh I think the only gas industries you know as as been a wonderful job in in creating a better resources for our country here the United states\nYou mentioned the progress that you've made from that one cent sales tax I'm Wondering the extent to which Oklahoma City depends on a sales tax versus let's say the property tax or is that one of those few urban areas which has an income tax even what what

the animals come right up to people they don't have any fear of um human the same thing with a with fish I'm\nJust people see just kind of strange creatures you know are walking around in the place of people have seen the stars change shape and even with the different distinct patterns over their head and\nAll kinds of very very odd stories people going in with with a um you know a terminal diseases coming out and about the strange thing about this place is that in in the story that really gets me is that uh once they started letting people in Russian journalist and there was this gentleman or who\nHad been in the army and the washed out of the army because of um\nA medical reasons he kind of bounced around in Moscow for a while and then he\nUh caught on as a journalist and got at the time to go into the I'm trying now at this guy once again he ... things or anything like a college or anything he was basically someone who was drafted into the Russian Army and couldn't make it so he went to the end trying only one on a um one of these camping expeditions for two weeks\nHad this life changing experience I came back to Moscow and suddenly as hot as the ... suddenly he had this um he was in lightened as\nTo pasture aerospace physics or he had never studied it before but all of a sudden this came very very easily to him and within a couple of years he was caused by not\nAnd he put this all he said the reason I change the rules because of my time in the ... try and go so you know a lot of people um\nYou know called heaven on earth you know and just the ... some of the stories and you know maybe if there is that having an earth maybe that's maybe this is it\nHot enough material on this planet to write twenty more\nEasily yeah twenty a boy yeah sure as\nSoon as the forty okay Joe Joe in the Bronx taken away Joe starting at George how are you enjoy\nAren't men you know we're speaking about UFOs sheen to UFOs and my one of these um both were circular you know around ... ones um [noise]\nUh if there is so much of this activity in the sky and it doesn't that kind of make disclosure of moot point in the way\nAnd art is there something else specifically a belt either extraterrestrials or these UFOs that the government doesn't want people to know other than that the UFOs do exist\nTaking us in the eating us you know\nWe'll just taking us in the eating us\nYou know it's it's it's this idea that ... and it's been bouncing around for years is that you know we as the you know the population of this planet won't be able to handle the truth that\nThere may be you know being some of the world's are out there and maybe visiting us I Know the wheels Winston Churchill during World War two someone gave him a very detailed photograph of what they called foo fighters back then but the UFOs\nAs he did not want that released to the public released\nYeah that's right because he thought all religion would fail that that was\nHis reason that you know while religion is based on earth based in if we find out that you know we're not the only ones in the universe it put some new questions on um a lot of the major religions show you know can we not handle it I don't believe that I think they were the vast majority of people on this earth\nWant to know what's going on what we'd like to know that there are other being's out there you know it's what it wants to get it would be like the greatest story it in and all of history why they keep it from us though that's just if they know what these things are and they're keeping that uh\nInformation from us and

said yeah we asked him what he thought of um just UFOs in general what you see what he's seen as travels and and I said well you know as soon as I heard this idea of being around about the space for\nUs not maybe this was something that we have\nPut together very quickly you know for some reason that by the nefarious or the central characters out there all the time\nLet's go to Terry in

investigating a series of a suspicious package is possibly explosives address to the White House Hillary Clinton Brock Obama correspondent Sherman Perkovich says ah the tells us a package has also found in New York City headquarters of CNN and here's the details\nThe NYPD or is now investigating a suspicious package something that was sent to the building a ten Columbus Circle which is in New York\n\n[noise] All right and that is all we have from Illinois a little bit more here ah from a Simon the U.S secret services investigating as well\nAnother pipe bomb or possibly a suspicious package explosive device\nAddress to the White House was intercepted\nA at a White House mail screening area ah we're told by officials that device that suspicious package is similar to the ones that were sent to sorrow was home and similar to the one cent to who the homes of Clinton and obviously ...\n[noise] I'm All right so now let's let's pick up again to see if we can get the CNN's information as they are breaking news right now down at the time with her center\nNear the cat in the trunk of every vehicle before it goes in there are a breathing machine x-ray machine for back or you walk into law the every day there are precautions in the mail room I Do every precaution is always taken but somehow it leaves or ... or ...\n... if if I was able to make it inside of the mail room\nAnd I just want to get ... into this for a second is a suspicion right now she mode based on your conversations with law enforcement\nRack these various uh these various suspicious packages are in fact connected the Soros a package the Clinton package we Obama packaged the White House package and Time Warner center package\nI certainly will police right now in New York the NYPD the FBI there are treating it like it's all related they're not taking any chances are as we said moments ago because of what's inside the packages and how it appears a some metal construction perhaps piping\nUh some wires some other things in this box is concerning law enforcement and they believe at least at this point that this could all be connected to the other packages that they've intercepted so while they don't know definitively yet because I don't get the fact that they've been able\nTo get inside within this package you know our mail room in New York X rays that the NYPD bomb squad\nX rays that I think the hope here is that\nThey will remove this and then detonated and then look inside and see what they fine fine\nBut certainly every indication her role\nThat they are treating it as if it's related they are treating it as if it's the real deal meaning that it's an explosive device but the one good thing here is that the NYPD the bomb squad which is probably one of the best in the world are they believe that they have this under control\nAnd that the the packaged within sight of it isn't going to explode a but they obviously feel are taking all sorts of precautions\nWhich is why you're seeing a both poppy and Jim be moved back streets around our building in New York\nOn fifty eighth street have been closed but they close streets north and south\nOf our building in New York or the fire department is they're they have ambulances there all as a precaution just in case if something was to go wrong they could immediately respond to that and treat people um the bomb squad you know interestingly here they go into a very good at this and you can bet you I bet a wolf\nOne hundred percent that this morning the NYPD bomb squad the intelligence division there was being grief\nOr probably in real time on these other suspicious packages these other devices that the secret service intercepted and probably add they were being briefed about this this call came in so they know what they're looking for they know what the other devices how they were constructed what they were compromised of and so that way they know what they're dealing with\n... in this situation it's perhaps related a law enforcement officials in New York are treating it as such\nThey've also taken other precautions around New York author locations tied to George Soros other locations tied\nTo both bill and Hillary Clinton and the Obamas around the country are going to see increased security uh certainly in their mail rooms is certainly at the offices at the home uh and the FBI's joins heroin terrorism task force\nOf probably has a set up a command post I\nGot in and there we go there is there is coverage from CNN or the breaking news and then given us a at least some information now so we're kind of

head and she started crying at the end\nTo I'm not even close like tears she said I Want to begin with two words I'm Sorry oh [noise] so I said I was wrong and I'm Sorry one of the great parts of sitting in this chair as guinea discuss different points of view sometimes I talk and sometimes I listen and yesterday\nI learned I learned given the history of blackface being used an awful ways by racist racist in this country it is not okay for that to be part of any costume Halloween or otherwise\nTo continue repeating some of the same point you made in her ... her colleagues on Tuesday and then I've never been a PC person but I Do understand that the value and being sensitive to our history particularly on race and ethnicity [noise]\nShe said it that way I Would just ripping how she said this past year has been so painful for many people of color the country feels so divided and I have no wish to add to the pain and and a fence I Believe this time for more understanding\nMore

talking with Kelly listening and taking notes\nKelly apologize Achilles apology comes after asking during the segment about Halloween costumes on Tuesday what is racist because\nThe segment about Halloween costumes on Tuesday what is racist because truly you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on black face at Halloween or a black person who puts on a white face for Halloween back when I was a kid that was okay as long as you were dressed up like a character\nShe center NBC News colleagues and email on Tuesday saying that after hearing from colleagues and friends she realized her comments were wrong\nToday is one of those days were listening carefully to other points of view including their uh from friends and colleagues is leading me to rethink my own views Sharon her apology email she later added the history of blackface in our culture is\nAwful and the wounds are too deep okay so the the mea culpa here [laughter]\nThe lexicon right there but also in the defense and the people that are saying that for instance UNT having to change their their sports franchise there\nBecause there were a large group of people that felt that it was intense it now I Know that there are a lot of people that don't even even with the Native Americans but there are enough that felt that it wasn't sensitive than they want to do with the minority rather than the majority will go with the people that really is people are affected by right\nYeah but the problem is people that are affected by were split on that that topic as well you know and I agree and I look he was up\nTo the the you know the college to do it because the the NC double a was saying if you don't you're not going to be able to play in these playoffs and or host playoff games in certain things that I'm so they made a decision was admitted based on finances promptly but at same time\nIt was it's like in radio ... you know and this was something in programming that you know it's passed down for many many years from different ah programmers and this is what I always use as well\nYou'll never be in trouble for something you don't say you know it's always the thing you say that'll get you in trouble so there was a certain topic and there are certain things that are coming up and you know that there's a things even if you stay away from them you're not going to be in trouble there is not something that's gonna come back and follow you one day throughout your career you you'll never get hired again if you don't want to that\nWas used to be politics and religion you were some young void them don't talk about politics and religion well let's ask me to change and I was a different one and we do talk about politics quite often now will and religion Andrea and\nReligion comes up a lot but it's a it's a different society and we have to evolve as a society and that's what I'm saying yes I understand your point but it's still you're living in the reality of today today's different as are oversensitive people but it that's where we are today\nThat's what we have to do like if you go to Russia they have a whole different set of values on things\nThere you go to China there's different set of values you're in America you can get away with a lot of things criminally that you will not get away with in certain countries where you would be killed right away his body part yeah there's no uh appeals court process or anything like that it's a different place when you go there are you not\nGoing to abide by their uh you know as their customs in their society because otherwise you're like oh I Will do whatever I Want [noise]\nWhen I'm Around to his the Romans do which which we don't over there but you get people coming to America that think they can do whatever they want or yeah so we let them so we're different country then I guess so\nBut as a country aren't we also have an to define our rules on a regular basis every year every him because things do change their time where we didn't let women are\nBoth that's the problem though things changed much more quickly than it used to be generational changes that take Twenty years to change now it for years you can have a whole flip flop of everything combat yeah and people and I think people are just getting the tea and having to say okay what's the new what's the new right thing and I knew there is any more straight as exactly\nRight but it's also the ... again that something you have to realize if this is today's society at this the way we are you either\nGo with the flow [noise] or you become somebody who if you do it the wrong way you're out there where the buses or on nobody's coming to visit you anymore though I get that but I mean I think it's just I think when people may be\nPushed back a little bit of that is because they're not used to this incredible quick change of how society as it just changes very quickly now\nOkay let's go back to the phone Roger how are you\nNow I got like ...\n[laughter] you know\nI was born and raised ... ... ... ... only going on and I remember when we were in a lot harder when you're a bowling alley\nOr bowling like bowling and I think human bowling no like like the end of that yeah okay\nI think more dangerous up right now I mean you know what what is it up\nIt was the other day what is it ... it had a bad up where you can get what he brought a gun you don't want them you know I\nRead all about money I Know I think every man woman in the world to make a living and if you want to work you can make a living and you can buy German\nOnly with the young kids like it was better to do that and I just I think they're more dangerous than regular\nThank you appreciate the call ... you have to use a guy who is absolutely correct which is a certain way just as dangerous as\nWell and you know everybody has their uh their limits you know what's okay for them what's okay for you know what their what their life is OK with as opposed to like for instance Bob\nHe might be a little more sensitive to certain things and I know that and this is part of that is because I've lived in different you know California and Texas and Arizona and southern Utah and so I've had different experiences and are you uh do you win over a period of time evaluate that in our conversations\nAnd probably being the upper ... when you are you a temper ... certain thing yeah I don't talk about some of these anymore that's what I I Would do also right now and again that just seems logical common sense common sense\nNow the common sense also an act of kindness to you or you to me by avoiding something like that\nYou know it's it's it's being kind know there's a there's another side of that there are people out there that know what your hot button is enemy only go for it\nBecause it either they're entertained by it or it's the only way of communicating I I Do think there is a generation out there that has become complacent and there's still some generation out there that have become you know overly you know where I Want to just get into everything on the other generations are changing very quickly I\nRecently had a conversation with an educator a who was telling me how\nUm they actually called parents in because of the bad language their child there yeah elementary kids are getting it and brought him to parents egos your kids see this and this and this you certainly don't well that's the way we talk and home right ... ... ... he threw his hands on near true story you know walking out he goes just two days ago\nTo kids in front of me could have been older than like eight or nine years old and they were swearing they were dropping the um right now and go hey hey hey\nIt because there was a couple of uh you know I'm elderly people that are on their way up walking in and they turn to go what language\nAre and they turn ... and then they kept walking they didn't say anything because obviously I think I'm probably a little intimidating mud at the same time people need to do that good for you know there's really no need to do that and they're not my kids are not going to be a hit them or anything but at the same time it's inappropriate in in a public area like that especially with their agent who they are\nUh but if he was in the store I'd say the same thing you know go walking around the store with other people and and start you know at\nOne time at Wal Mart or heard a couple of guys talking about the older guys are probably in their him you know like early twenties\nTalking about some girls that they met at a party and they're being very descriptive nurse yes yeah um I didn't stop and say anything to them 'cause I was just kind of like whenever and I moved along\nBut now there would have been a couple of the older lady standing there or something I probably would have been hey guys seriously and then moved on you know you don't have to you don't have to make a deal out of it but at the same time you can go ha hello on bill somebody calls you on that is you have ... attention to it\nYou don't do nothing and submit an excuse but I call mark on his racism all the time [laughter] if not racism [laughter] [noise]\nMark and I have a different understanding of why we grew up I grew up in the exact same blue I didn't grow up in ... just down the road and I got out and Carrington yeah yeah now [laughter] but on our our family farm on my mom's side um their uncles and cousins and stuff that all\nTalk that certain way and up until a certain age I probably did do until I started you know again I went to school in Fargo and much bigger screen that off the farm\nHe had decided no ice there for ... but at same time I didn't know any better and then finally you know western older and wiser in ... ah yeah that's not the right and grandpa would keep saying their own home until his death bed you know [laughter] and uh we just kind of after a while you just\nYou concede that OK grandfather's not changing\nHis grandma one yes yeah as ... but he's he's out on you know he's not he's not hurt anybody when he does that around the house and you know\nIf he was in a restaurant or you know some place and he was saying he was correct your grandpa he would rather be temper his tongue when he was in public he did he he was he a but but I Can't I don't think of him as a racist guy because I've never you know\nI've never seen him you know that type but he does say certain words like you were saying if you're picking teams in softball it's still not right but these days if you said it I mean it'd be in trouble [noise]\nLoser Wednesday [noise] this one goes out to everybody who bought a ticket but that person in South Carolina [noise]\nThat's all conspiracy long story short this I don't think this was going to stop anytime soon when these packages until they find the person who did it this is going to keep going back to the president\nSo they start in Montana because of the Unabomber yeah I think I moved away\nPressure and the longer there and start maybe where you left off last time well the one thing they've got six crime scenes to work for him so there's going to be evidence together\nSo that I mean it makes them more likely while they're shown on TV to the envelope and stuff you can't use somehow it would be if you own the postal company you know the U.S postal service can't you take a look into you know where these were sent from a small ... regional center tracking Uber's ... do you ever look at the post office is off our days postal services tracking\nSo it's not like is like UPS is I mean it's not that they don't try each package because there's so much there's so much money they can track it but I mean even the ones that are tracked with the little UPC coat on it's not that detailed like you uh\nUPS has got really good tracking yeah you actually see them walking up to the door with about it\nYeah yeah you can you can go and buy a first class package envelope and any post office here but whatever you want him to go\nTo any other post office and the country are dropping in the mailbox you know they're very difficult to track and then I suppose you know unless they actually get you dropping her to the mailbox you know you know what the what the hope to do here is pull a partial print off of something sure\nAnd match it up with a partial prince of something else and and finally zero in on somebody and boy I sure hope they do find that person so to me right away because this is you know whether you like Trump or you have Trump whether you like the Democrats or\nYou don't want anybody to get blown up it's not in Europe you know people just don't feel this way you know in a worse yet is that it it appears to be\nReally domestic terrorism yeah and and it's tough enough when other countries\nAre mean to you but I don't know if it is if you go yeah we don't know yet no but it's worth ... somebody in the country now\nWho who's just trying to clean the two sides are three signs are arming ... and then you start thinking about all the different movies you've seen different TV shows and those conspiracies where\nMaybe it's somebody in a government position right now trying to create even more you know controversy between the two and and\nCan you see it all the time you know it again in movies right they're they're not true they are just you know\nStories however are they well and we don't know what's going on in the you know the ... you know to really know that our with Jamie Lee Curtis is under fire for her strong stance for more gun control but makes plenty of money for movies where she uses gun yeah\nEarlier Wednesday the actress about herself and Fox News's crosshairs when an article suggested her advocacy for gun reform is\nHypocritical given the firearm she wields in the upcoming Halloween ... pointing to several of the actresses tweets calling for action after mass shootings in Orlando in Texas the report calls Curtis one of several Hollywood actors who use firearms in their films well preaching against\nThem and I get it I understand you know she's she's getting paid it's\nPart of her job does she does for a living is an actor to address I should say yeah she's using a gun as a prop in a in a movie sure in ... but there are actors and actresses out there that will say you know what I don't believe in that so I'm not going to take that part she did the dumbest thing and Halloween I'll just tell you this real quick\nI I ... and this was a spoiler alert or whether or not even that much of a spoiler alert because it it was a small thing but I I when when she did it hold on I got it for ... this week Lisa and I attended a viewing of the late on you know you're hearing [laughter]\nWe she's she's going through our guns including Oregon and in the last in the one dramatic scene before they get to the next thing she takes at twelve gauge with a pistol grip and she puts it up to her I like this like should I think to myself oh my God it's going to hurt\nDo poetry or you're going to your nose bruise your break your cheek bones you know that is going to hurt and things like who doesn't know how to handle it goes you need to see it as clean no she's right down the state's right down the sights and she's got that pistol\nWere raped by her cheek or I'm like oh my God and human ... that's a special model no recoil at all\nOh you didn't realize that I have you ever shot at twelve years with a pistol grip it's awful I you know they can ah Arab all look at uh what was she was in with Arnold lies\nOh true I've got to be here I Am yeah true wise\nThat was the violence and gun playing my elder y'all are going up in July\nShe shot iMac ten oh yeah yeah in blue steel she shot at Smith Wesson model pen choose officer making Turner and Halloween to she had a cold trooper MK three\nIn Halloween each to oh Twenty years later Smith in western model thirty sects Halloween each to oh Twenty years later also Smith Wesson model Nineteen a virus it was a cult model Ninety three I mean the list goes\nOn and it's like yes she she's a very aware of weapons when she's in the movies because as part of her care advocacy though if she is trying to fight against gun if she points all of this out\nWhen she's doing I think it's okay if she's pointing out the fact I'm an actress I use a weapon as a prop in a movie it's it's part of what I Do doesn't mean I Believe that if she comes out says something like that yeah I think she has a little more credibility yes but here's where I'm going with this because we're\nTalking about like right now you're all these people are saying um these different mass shootings or because they are they something nice on a movie or TV show our season you know a video game or whatever you know games and they're always talking about how they they want to portray in real life for something that they've seen on the big screen then it's hard for her\nTo not be a hypocrite when she's actually onscreen shooting these guns like they're really cool and in in the movies they make it look like but you know shooting stuff\nWith a real live here in you know and seeing the the shots and stuff it's not as cool you know when people are being you know shot so for her to be in and say we needs you know stronger gun control and we need to you no longer a waiting period and all this\nBut yet in the movies she ... she looks great ... with the little apt to be the right there she's have\nThey've this ... or ... I Believe I guess that's why I'm saying that she can easily come across as but I get it like I said I think it's her job it's part of our you know where that's Hollywood\nCould do more in a year\nBy staying away from violent content and just like comedy movies so not just comedy but you know it ... it was a romantic comedy ... drama or see a gun in your home our channel\nOr discovery type of stuff like a ... a vial effects I Love ... out there now yeah but I think they could go a long way [noise]\nYou know it'd be interesting to see what the difference would be after eater and it was always the ones who are first to say you know we got a staff ... we got and violence and blah blah but then they put more and more of those movies out and games or yeah\nBlood but then they put more and more of those movies are games the office or yeah [noise] it is loser Wednesday final say my coming up next team twelve thirty [noise]\nAnd they had him when [noise]\n\nProviding food feed him over the world is a tough job making a promise even offer you come in factory has a solution for now probably later this join your brain and as soon as it is the best way to take charge of your great maximize your profit and control your destiny souped up offers a whole line of men to your specific needs an with over eighty Patty\nIt's easy to see why should come visit the world's fastest growing company visit Suu Kyi U.
