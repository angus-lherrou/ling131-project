to make that even better as far as storage go with um the odds are already against us when we're a little dry as far as packing and are keeping an anaerobic environment so trying to heal that off with

just put lights on all the time [noise]\nAh there right yeah they are right yeah\nAnd that's the manufacture things of that there is that you know that's a\nOn auto soul is on days like today where there was a month yeah it's it's just it's not dark and the answer won't pick it up right\nThere was a month yeah it's it's just it's not dark and the answer won't pick it up right and so you need to err on days like today when 'cause it by law right to rain rains Avon and whether all that stuff you're supposed to have lights on you know ... ...\nYou know so a good point the emailer thanks for the call yeah it is on days like today and you have to manually maybe turn a model actually\nDrive with mine on all the time even in good weather so you just about any automatic I just turn on and I just turned on I think I'm just used to doing it at the police department so I just do it on my own vehicle given sunny days makes visibility easier people can see you the headlight ... always sixty one\nTwelve thirty they have a question or text us on our techs line six eight when twelve thirty says we recently here's one coming in on my email we recently bought a new car from a private party Andy and looking at it we informed to sell it at the tabs had expired march of Eighteen and that they would have to get them on there in order to sell the car\nThey told us that they would give us a purchase agreement and that could act\nAs the tabs until we got to the courthouse we declined is because we did not think that was legal needless to say they finally gave in and purchase them and we bought the car and didn't even increased the price of the car are they misinformed or are they correct\nA purchaser grooming doesn't take place of registration so\nOkay so the when they said ah they wanted to give them a purchase agreement that can act as the tabs until they got to the courthouse I Will say this\nI Will say this when you buy I think maybe it's different for private people than from a dealership\nYou know you get the temporary attack from a dealer shy in the taps can be expired from a dealership and then they put the tempting and the back saying they just bought it right but the car has to be insured um they think it's maybe different for private parties\nSo can you can put a temp take from a private party in your back window from your back window kept my bedroom have they don't have that I Am tags right so maybe if you want to do a purchase agreement and I mean I guess I've never heard of it so I'm not going to sit here and then\nI've just sit here and try to say\nLet me I guess if you pull somebody over for expired tabs and they showed you approached agreement for today and they said I'm going to the courthouse to get my dad would not give them a ticket ... that's that's something you probably would I Would not probably\nWork with our local law enforcement here but legally it doesn't sound like that that is why\nI say this you know who to get one you could could you know and if I'm if I pull somebody over and they just say I just bought the car and they got no proof of it and the ... are seven eight months expired\n... you're not going to believe I heard that can be ... or you know we could all use that they've got something they just bought a you know three or four days ago and they've got it all and the transfer the title and everything's in their hand I'll probably let it let them let them apart and\nEscort them over to the court does say go get the jobs back and they just go get it in\nBritain will get it taken care of them you know I mean I I Would say this is that if you're going to do that have them maybe write something up or having done and um have that with you and and the odds are it'll it'll probably be okay but I don't think it replaces the actual\nPurchase what have you suggest that they they did the right thing I mean saying that they need that tabs on there yeah I Would say so or they would have to I I suppose or they can buy it and then go get the tabs and then bringing their before that I'm not saying the\nApproaches agreement wouldn't be a bad thing always I Would always do approaches agreement no matter what you buy especially a vehicle right\nEmail markets here of radio dot com are a phone number six eight one twelve thirty and call in you can Texas on our pizza tax I'm sixty one twelve thirty as well legal questions are good ones coming in today or we're gonna news headline break here and get the more I I just want to come back one more time in touch on that one of the first cause the uncontrolled intersections when there are uncontrolled\nIntersections and we have a number of them out of eventually on a lot of K.\nUncontrolled intersection you would need to yield to the right to the right right to correct paid that and that doesn't mean a statute doesn't matter what direction your mom\nDoesn't matter it hey we always have the right way on this or do a right if you deal to the right ... right so if you were to get into an accident on an uncontrolled intersection the one that uh should've yielded a riot and didn't would they be at fault then yeah\nMore likely how they've caught our eye on that there's a there's a little wrinkle about\nIf you're in the intersection first you have the right away that gets to be one of those too close to call things it's just a I've had people meet middle before they may have been very difficult tough call the uh so just because I saw it on and then ... says because there is a lot of lot of them and tell them more and more out\nOf it I I I find myself going down because sometimes I go around a different ways or whatever and go through and there's a residential areas and then there are unmarked\nOr ah yeah and marked intersections uncontrolled intersections I should say but it's one of those roads it seems like it's always on a main road or whatever you know it feels like that now you know I'm\nSure you don't think about it and there are certain roads they can do I take handle if I'm going down somewhere because that's ... that's basically a through street one of those Syrians says she'll kind of gives you the advantage but again it's still going to be careful and you know you get in an accident in your car sales now you might be right but you are still going to be smashed or just you know\nIn the end yeah be careful right All right um the paranormal we're going to get to that in just a moment but\nFirst [noise] or news headline\nMore the river falls radio I'm Mark ... good morning\nInvestigators have identified the man's struck by a train that he jumped from Sunday in Grand forks investigator said that Jacob ... left from the moving train after climbing on to it earlier in the day it was found along dyke avenue with what emergency crews called severe injuries to his limbs\nBut they are not considered a life threatening media sources say the Twenty one year old is a student at the University of North Dakota\nA twin valley man is dead following a to vehicle accident in Norman county according to the Minnesota state patrol the Seventy two year old man was killed when the two thousand Fifteen polaris ATV was driving collided with a two thousand for GM's cc are driven by fifty two year old Danny ...\nOf a ...\nAnd a former the river falls city councilman Josh Hagen made a pre trial appearance at penny to county district court yesterday they burns will have more details on those stories coming up on our noon news today for the for over falls radio news headlines I'm Mark Allen [noise] it is a eleven twenty\nNine eight is cloudy overcast we are at forty one right now are open line this morning legal Tuesday six eight one twelve thirty if you have a question uh you can call in or you can text us on our Pizza Hut text line six say one one\nTwo three zero is or text line or says too bad that people driving on the avenues don't drive below the speed limit\nWell that's another issue to speed has always been a factor when you're dealing with accidents and and if you're speeding or are you forfeit the right away so you got to be careful with that too does it seem people ...\n[noise] yeah and we don't I don't think we have a stand your ground law in Minnesota so I'm almost sure of it stand your ground law is um\n[noise] ... [laughter] 'cause we don't have it I guess I haven't really thought of it so because Florida has it and that's one of the big big issues with a stand your ground I'm middle\nAged kind of like the castle a it was like the catalog wondering or whatever the castle doctrine establishes a right by which a person\nMay defend oneself or others are against threats or perceived threats even to the point of apply lethal force regardless of whether the safety is safety or retreating from\nThe actual threat so I'm I'm just going to look\nHere real quick um as to the states that have it and I I don't think we have it I'm I've never heard of it in the states and I maybe I'm wrong but I I'm almost sure we\nDon't which you you certainly can defend yourself though yeah it it but you're you're obligated to use only the ...\nYeah you can't just pull a gun on somebody because um yeah we don't have a stand your ground law you can't just pull your gun on somebody because you think there are threats and you can just whip you're gone on pointed out um it's got to be\n... in Minnesota it's got to be reading of you think your life or your ... or somebody else is in danger like your family member or something like that you have a right to defend them but if somebody was in the house and you saw them standing there you can just pull a gun and shoot him\nYeah there's been people that have been major lawsuits with that that if somebody comes in and they don't have a weapon or [noise]\nAnd you're just shoot him I think that's that's when you when we had to have to feel your life is in in in imminent danger yup yup yup it stand your ground as I like I said before like I just read it\nIt's it's pretty specific okay um so\nIt's basically a stand your ground law\nRemoves any duty to retreat before using self defense or that and right now Minnesota doesn't have we don't have that can be used kind of a reasonable mess of it and he said he catches wicker gone out and started shooting people because he thinks they're a threat\nUm common sense yeah they got a weapon in there you think your life's in danger you do you got to do but right it's based off of each necessarily unreasonable force yeah OK Keith does that help\nYeah it does ah I I I Wish it would change it changed the law because if someone breaks into my house I'm Sorry but they're not going to walk out\nNo and and we're ... the thing is is that I'm not saying we base it off of\nI think a lot of it's based off situational you know I mean they had an down in Saint cloud the other day in Wal Mart that of videos posted were guy got pushed in Walmart and guy pulled a gun on him and there was a videos on Facebook and held them at gunpoint in Walmart and he 'cause he had a concealed carry permit it's pretty unreasonable\nWell then there's one down way at all I mean uh one guy\nDo people parked in handicap stall and the the child and the the guy went into the store and a personal approach to much about this was in Florida if I'm not mistaken\nAnd approached the gal sitting in the car and they got into an argument and the guy who came out of the car approached him and said you know you can't be messing with my family or whatever\nAnd uh the guy put a lot of gun shot and killed them a\nHeads and then he read a charge that ... right and he's being charged I mean\nYou know this is the circumstances are the key to this thing and you know if uh you know if if it's a young kid in there and that's one thing if it's a you know some big huge guy in there I mean the whole and resell the circumstance comes into play but I but it's the key is needed needed and reasonable force\nA circumstance and a and a each uh each incident and common sense\nIdea situation is going to be looked at you know drastically so I'm\nAll right ah gee thanks for the call this morning version it thank you guys\nAlready ... by alright the sixth one twelve thirty six I went to all dirty damn called question or comment you certainly\nCan send a in a a email mark ... radio dot com architecture of radio dot com or you can uh again give\nUs a call sixty one twelve thirty a and ask a question or the pizza text line sixty one twelve thirty is an ... and again it's illegal to do is they will go to a legal question if you want but I just thought it was very interesting on the ah the paranormal part\nAre likely it's not very well and if that time of year to follow me ... and and uh let me ask you this officer bass up or\nDid you or are you a believer in the years I've had many experiences in college\nNot an issue of like an old and a dorm or something or or or a sorority house in Saint cloud ... wait a minute what were you doing in a sorority house ...\n... ... okay [laughter] I Know it was quite Asia yeah by a yeah those are\nWhat were we was kind of situation gets you a to a believer at the sorority house um\n[noise] [noise]\nAh it's it's hard because there's so many people die in the house and I did a ton of research on that house and it was an old\nUh from\nThe early Nineteen hundreds and sanitary him or something or um and it wasn't sanitary me was it was weird I'm ... and who was a very old\nHouse um and people had actually died in that house yeah okay actually a couple of ads I Would when people have died in the house that's when people kind of think about the debt and Barrett may still be there yeah and then what happened in that instance long story where James their head in a violent death in the house people think there's a spirit out there\nAbout the guy who got over the years\nAnd Lynn death in the house people think there's a spirit out there\nAbout the guy who got over the years I've gotten for Christmas and whatever small books just talking about some of the hot in Minnesota and so on and usually it's just a little short little story about what happened and whatever and a lot to do that all because I looked at it in quite a while but there's there's a lot of stories in even in even in this town\nThat a few things have occurred wind and\nAnd we we had I Know you mentioned uh Ryan that you you you've talked to somebody emailed me our gate back to me and I think is the group weren't they over here like as a couple of years they were on the almost the same there and they were investigating house on the same street and I live on ... north of me any\nBurial grounds by the same thing yeah you know they they actually\nCaught stuff in that house and this on their website and an audio and things that happened I'm In the house and so is that one\nAnd it's called is close to you are and ah it's up about six blocks and blocks where I'm at all\nHave that wouldn't be the burial ground and not close enough for that they're not in ... when I was there were telling you before we got on the air that there is a young man and spending for years and obviously but he uh like I said it was taking a lot of pictures at the old local park nursing home which I which was the old sanitary him before the built a new building\nAnd he said just about every ... taken and has a little ah you know\nA lot of focus image or something in the end up in the pictures and he's absolutely convinced that that place was haunted before\nThe Senate terms of a very very well known for their Ponting and why is that when people die there a lot of people die because what when they die they're dying ... and then I don't know\nThere's a lot of them are sick of it back to what you had tuberculosis and what isn't the only one and wondering why does that make\nIt the way I don't know I it's just a lot of people it's they they there's one in Duluth and no ... no ... I Do not even pronounce it sanitary him and and they give tours and you can stay overnight\nVowing not to believe it or not they're not going to stay overnight in the middle yeah and they they actually are costs quite a bit of\nMoney but you can stay overnight and their booked\nAnd that one was on ghosts adventures on travel channel okay and they caught a lot of stuff it's got a lot of activity in that place a lot of activity so ... are very well known for their activity weird man is just weird it's weird\nI'm I again I actually just never know now that I'm not a real big believer because I've never seen anything yeah and in people that I saw a chair move I saw this and that and and I always have an explanation for an insurance always so I Try to explain\nIt away yeah that yeah I did too I Do too but when it becomes more frequent\nAnd when your daughter starts the everyone yes honors you started this way I mean\nIt's not and like wow I can be this could be that can be the furnace can be this I Try to just push away like you know tried to debunk it and there was a time it doesn't exist and it comes to a point where most of us still it it it's becoming too frequent and I'm at that point I mean all\nAll of us at ... over there to help investigate all all anything to get on there\nAll of us have experienced something now and so I Can't say it doesn't exist anymore I'm not going to ignore it anymore so it\nDoesn't cause us any anxiety I just I don't I Know is there anybody\nOut there there's actually seen a physical form ... there are\nPeople that have been town I've I've been called factually where um my partner and I ... on nights many years ago into a call or someone swore there's someone in their basement they saw him when they opened up the door to their house and\nWe got there it was late and you should ... they were ... years ago when I got there they were scared a lot of his little like mentioned in it because everybody thinks they're ... and ... so they'll just let it just so happened that my partner and I are big believers the nights that were working at night and we got there and we searched full house and\nNothing was there and do you feel anything that we're in now is in the basement and a basement so just bad probably has a bad idea and the problem with this one was don't go in the basement of the they open up their door to their house in the late in the basement turned on and they saw someone to run a by\nDown in the basement and they they didn't even go in the house they separate back out called nine one one and they were scared and search the whole house and then there was no one in there and so when I was a ... and you probably did say something and I don't know how to explain it to\nA burger basket six eight one twelve thirty burger basket sixty one twelve thirty call me up tell me the word that isn't now and that means a small red ... crease as a verb means to make a wrinkle or wrinkles in to be or become this six day one twelve thirty what does today's word to call now\nBarring foreign why does go home of them from going down the tree fresh never frozen birders from Michael's me stronger bar and grill now serving liquor seven days a week the game for lunch for stopping after work answers\nSooner barring rumors about fast burned down down down on second street fever rip offs stopping them today more gold is giving them for taking out orders and sixty one by one for\nFree burger basket sick say one twelve thirty give me a call tell me the word that has announced\nFor free burger basket sick say one twelve thirty give me a call tell me the word that is now running as an outlet means a small ... daily definition\nOh nope thanks for the call Bailey definition [laughter] what's your guess\nSeem nope thanks for the call daily definition I bought a plate no thanks for the call daily definition cram nope thanks for the call\nBailey definition [noise] daily definition high daily definition\nLiberal not ripple thanks for the call daily definition wrinkle it is a wrinkle in who is this I mean\nOur lane I'm going to put you down for a burger mascot from the school they established picked it up okay thank you thanks\nAre laying yes she's absolutely right it is wrinkled W.

cartons sinister enterprise\nIs this a horror movie a superhero movie or maybe a comedy\nNope I think when you get down to it I had to decide it was a buddy movie with all the elements of horror comedy and a superhero movie the real story is the relationship between venom and Eddie Brock\nTheir relationship is dark funny and violent it's fun to watch Tom Hardy in what seems to be a very different role for him\nThe first part of the movie has a lot of story to tell but does it well the real blood and Gore does not start in earnest until about one third of the way through crazy crazy action scenes and some pretty wild special effects [noise] there's\nA lot to see here but watch the buddy element and pay attention to the PG Thirteen as this could be pretty intense and scary for

be more inclusive Italy has lately is that are a lot a lot better and\nAnd I think that starts in the classroom with the kid you know the people that are in the workplace for the most part right now when they were kids [noise]\nA place for the most part right now when they were kids [noise]\nThere was exclusion you know you you you segregated these kids out and you didn't have any any interaction so I don't think they even know how to go about trying to make that happen now for the most part\nBut now there's a lot of these schools are inclusive and they do include your kids and everything you know those kids grow up and go into the community\nIf for no other reason there'll be used to it and there'll be more progressive and they'll try to get these kids involved and you know maybe they can't do anything but [noise]\nThe greeter at a restaurant or maybe they're limited a certain you know factors but they can make it happen\nAnd they'll understand okay she's got a limitation but\nThis

here too and today we're joined by Sam Walker the founding editor of the wall Street Journal sports section and the author of the captain class\nThe hidden forced to create the world's greatest teams\nAnd Sam look there's no better way to start a bar fight than to pick the greatest teams in the world\nI mean that's really hard and also you get up a bar fight deciding what's a sport what we talk about both of those things and was it hard or was it easy to something telling me it's pretty hard\nI thought it would be you know I had those arguments at the bar and you know they always ended and just\nSomeone storming out if it was impossible to answer and when I realized was that there's really no set criteria for how we define great and no one had really done a rigorous study or tried to actually narrowed down so that was the one of the toughest things I had to do at the beginning to find great and\nIn the end what I decided was that we have to be a little more specific about what team\nTeam has to have a certain number of people can't be too she left for a partnership I finally decided that five five people were really\nWell that's a partnership I finally decided it's five five people was really the point at which group contribution some group chemistry was more important than individual performance so basketball's world the smog sport that I study\nAnd another set of questions which was how do you define great and you know for me\nOne of the problems is when people talk about great teams there's no\nReal that period of time that we applied to it a lot of people talk about teams that were great one fees are having a credible undefeated season but what I really want to study what I realized was important is teams that had sustained air dominance for a long time because\nI think any team can get lucky that can win a championship one season or two seasons but really to rule out like completely and to talk about culture and chemistry than you really had to set the bar for years\nAnd let's talk about some competing theories that are out there because the name of your book is the captain class some people think it's the coaches some people think it's the management some people think it's that super star player or the team of players what led you to this categorization and your choice to study the captain's\nI was completely shocked I I had all of this same assumption that I think everyone does when I finally identified the team's not two years and years of work I went through twenty five thousand in the entire history of sports at the Eighteen eighties over the world and I got down to Seventeen about\nAnd you know the first thing I looked at with talent right I thought town would be the thing you know but I quickly realized something seems they all were talented but some of them had talented was clearly average or even mediocre in some cases so wasn't that the second thing I thought it was ... you know it's got to be coaching but to my great surprise there\nWasn't a pattern there I'm not saying coaching isn't important but some of these teams had more than one coach you know they changed coaches or you know someone didn't even have coaches are coaches who really didn't take an active role and in fact\nOnly one of them how to coach who was considered a great coach when they're run of dominance began so that wasn't the magic bullet I was looking for I also did things like tactics\nYou know I thought maybe they just had incredible brilliant strategy that stood out above the rest of it again and only a handful of them could say that so that was in the pattern either [noise] it\nBill Russell was ... and I mean to an extreme he would get sick before every\nGame they play you mean was she would throw up in the locker many facts if he didn't for August she made a rough to go throw up for what's wrong with you or because he he cared so much for the call would play it was a perfect example of why this matters now\nThis happened in the in his rookie season and they made the NBA Finals and again and again the St Louis hawks and\nThis is the first game seven and it was just a huge event or the credible pressure and Russell is a rookie now lately game a boss at one point Lee is a minute left and\nBoxing I ... down and Russell charge found the court and he tried to dump the all this stuff is tiny ... and St Louis got the rebound and St Louis\nAfford him jak Coleman had been sort of hanging back behind the play and they quickly inbound at the Baltimore md core and he's in mid court with the ball and a running start\nNow Russell who had missed that Doug where was he he was underneath his own basket off the court\nOn the other side he was like Ninety six heat from the basket and Coleman was probably about forty five feet with a rising star\nBut when Columbus came to the room and to make a layoff notices late in the game they would have taken a lead it might have been the end this blur appeared behind him swat at the ball and it was rough and he had somehow covered twice the distance that Coleman had in the same amount of time\nI mean nobody on in that arena or what is already had a chance and certainly must not even know what I'm self but just that raw desire that you demonstrated over and over again in competition the thing about it and that was consistent for him and what we don't understand it the studies have shown that\nRelentless us is highly contagious [noise] you know if a group of people to do something together thinks that one person in that group is giving a hundred percent effort or real maximum effort that all of them will raise their own performance\nIf you have someone in your mid like that who was relentless and committed playing an old times at a hundred percent they're going to be serious marginal gains that you will you'll see in your team work and\nThat's just not something we can quantify so it's not something that we teach but I think it's about time we start\nWe've all been around people who have that kind of drive and focus on what it does do our deem we raise our game we raised the bar and when those people aren't present we don't even know where the bar is\nFresh exactly yeah I Know it's funny because there are some emotions that are contagious id group and\nRelentless it's contagious always in a good way to assess as always contagious either way if you show toughness and persevere and others will too and another one is emotional control or something all the leaders had they had the ability to overcome really difficult\nWell control or something all these leaders had they had the ability to overcome really difficult personal circumstances and\nNot just ... competed at a higher level than ever and Tom Brady the patriots is a great example that you know a couple of seasons go after this whole deflate gate ... served as suspension but he came back and\nPlayed one of his greatest season but even after they won the super bowl this incredible comeback against you laugh out and we find out that his mother has been undergoing chemotherapy you know and it had been diagnosed with cancer season so he was going through that and he never said a word about no one knew about it\nAnd he is he had the control to put that away and to play it's hard to determine his plan to deal with ...\nNo doubt we're going to get to a Brady in a little bit because it's such a fascinating chapter in your book but let's talk about one more basketball player 'cause I don't think you get the credit he deserves Tim Duncan of the San Antonio spurs talk about Tim Duncan who is\nShe is a very unusual guy he was a great swimmer I really had incredible talent could maybe even been an Olympic swimmer but you know the hurricane came in and destroy the local pool and I bought the same time his mother passed away and\nYou know we had these hard knocks and then we started picking up basketball and was very lightly recruited in fact weight forces while at school that really took it seriously is very skinny kid and just hadn't grown into his body\nBut you know he got there and really mature and became a really hot and the prospect but yeah I don't think anyone really thought that that he was going to become the star that he was or that he would develop skills or he did but\nThe thing that's fascinating about tend to to do things that I think there's so much about him that he was instructed for leaders but I think that\nThe most important thing really is the way he played and I had the talent to dominate the NBA in terms of score you know on any of the famous Scalia statistics but\nIf you look at his total it's really amazing switch telling you if he was very prolific score some years it was not his blocks rebound and other things we're we're off the charts\nHe would change his position on the court and play different position the pending on the makeup of the teen\nIt just showed that he had the same quality that ruptured ... which is that he didn't care what numbers were what you thought of him or whether he got on the cover a magazine he only cared about the team winning and he would do whatever grunt work needed to be done and he would change his role to that but\nThe thing about Tim Duncan that really every once in a study in the way communicate\nI was completely surprised when I looked at these cats and because the first thing I thought the first way that you know what I made it team is is with the speech give a big speech right you motivate them with words and none of these captain gave speeches and they did not like to do with some purposely avoided\nAnd I did not understand that I didn't understand how they communicate effectively with a team at that I went right to dunk to get that you've ever watched him to give an interview you know she is not\nA charismatic guy he sounds like he's getting a cold and asking the answering questions he just had no motion he's ... he doesn't come across as a charismatic person so how to communicate well she talks a lot but it's a different sort of communication he's always working the room\nTalking individually to one person one on one incredible intense the stairs you this is I contact and gestures and touch to communicate very tense see what people and he listens as much as he talks in the ... and\nHe had his interactions all the time and he has them in the moment especially when someone has done something wrong or need courage that twenty springs into action and when I realized that the spurs talk more than any team I've ever seen him they're always talking on the floor on the bench\nConflict communication and this creates an atmosphere everyone feels like they can contribute to feel heard\nAnd they also feel like they have to account for themselves and all the problems that team had were dressed in a moment nothing ever faster as talkative style that they had allowed them to address problems in the moments pass them and\nThat's why they were so good for so long as why they made the playoffs in Nineteen consecutive seasons for the incredible revolving cast of players and won five ten and she had the greatest long term already percentage and NBA history it was because that\nThat whole climate that Duncan created you know allow them to fly new people and got them talking and solving problems so even though it didn't always have the best talent or\nCertainly not the most money they were the most dominant team of of their hair and the NBA\nAnd we're talking to Sam Walker author of the captain class I Want a terrific series the stats for Tim Duncan wherever you might put them in the pantheon\nGreat Nineteen consecutive playoff five championships and the best winning percentage in National

and now they're you know one or I think than any other as a team and you know they are they are really a creation of Lambert tenacious\nDialing as aggressive play and his relentless jak Lambert was a player who had an understanding of something that all these easily captains\nNew to some extent but I think he was part of the best example of it they understood the power of non verbal communication of just gestures they understood that there were moments where they needed to do something\nIn full view their team it that would show their level of commitment a passion that were transferred to them and allow them to play hard and jak labor was famous of course for a new he lost a couple of teeth in high school playing pick up basketball and he\nHad it for static ensure that the war in public but he would take it off\nOn the field so they end up toothless you know mouth and he would scare people so that was part of it but my favorite jak laboratory that I think shows you\nA the genius of leadership was that they were playing a game I don't believe in Nineteen Seventy six and they had won the super bowl but they started wandering for\nPeople with written them off like it's over for the dealers and had to win this and they had to beat the Bengals and\nYou want to play uh probably the five game of his career in terms of number of tackled the recovered fumble basically accounted for most of the teams points singlehandedly so it wasn't a credible game but on the middle of this game\nHe had a came to the game you gotta cut on his hand and he managed to get up and you know he went out there and of course the band just failed in the blood starts burning out it was all over uniformed pants media was a mess\nI tracked down one of the trainers and I asked her why didn't you know you just reroute that band is when it came off the field or changes uniform and half time or something and said\nYou don't understand is a jak Lambert love having blowout as you know for me I understood how powerful that message was and how uh how much heart nations summit play and how much it to me is opponent and uh she did that on purpose and jak labor did all kinds of things that might seem crazier on hands\nWhen you listen to talk about it I mean he always says look\nThese were calculated acts these were things that I did a you know on purpose because I understood the power that they would have an effect on the team and you know that's one of the reasons that that team was so good so consistently grade on one for Super Bowls and six years or so teams that were done\nAnd what

were talking about all this non verbal communication my goodness it didn't just fire up his team it scared the heck out of the opponents talks about\nCourage and how captains develop it\nAnd you know a lot of it comes from emotional control and you know we don't think of jak Lambert is being someone who is a emotionally control but like all these great athletes you know he was not someone who got in trouble off the field and he was not someone who got in a lotta brawls and\nNone of these cats as they were really very quiet off the field jak level is really kind of an inch reverted pride per se I mean he was a big reader\nAnd you know on road trips he would he would often just sit in his room reading a book I mean wasn't\nAn outsized character that aggression that he had on the field didn't translate to the rest of your life and that was ... all of these athletes and you know I think it's a way of redefining courage because you know he poured everything into football and all of his aggression all his passion everything\nYou know he would he would put it all out on the field and you know when he wasn't there he had this incredible ability to to shut it off and to\nKind of return to normal and and to to to be a quieter person and\nYou know that's the floor of courage that we don't really understand it's a duty to control your emotions you know being able to do that you know it's ... courage and the sense of ... of ... you know running up the\nHill and I and our our reign of bullets and some big military battle but it's a different sort of courage that I think is very

[laughter] we got we got we got we got a busy busy day we can move all we've got a big baseball game in Ross coming off [noise] what else do we have Chris [noise] well\nLet's start off with the big news of the day in if it happened last night Drew Brees tremendous uh achievement last night in that demolition of the Washington Redskins he passed Peyton Manning as everybody knows by now passed Peyton Manning as the all time\n... leader in ... ah NFL history\nAnd he's now over Seventy two thousand yards incredible accomplishment that a huge celebration\nDuring the game last night and the debate today where his Drew Brees a top five all time quarterback I think most people\nWould say no I certainly would say no and I began to wonder like as great as Drew Brees has been and he's been tremendous obviously the numbers he's going to become the fourth quarter back ever to have more than five hundred\nTouchdown he needs one more to to get their uh he's already the ... leader as I said he's already the all time accuracy leader in terms of a completion percentage\nBut I while he's a first ballot hall of famer without question\nI don't put him on the same level and I don't think most people do I even the same class for sure but I don't put him on the same level as I Do Tom Brady Peyton Manning Joe Montana\nAnd guys like that even maybe John Elway uh I I Would say definitely John Elway and I start to wonder why\nWhy don't I feel the same way about Drew Brees even though he's got this great production as I feel about these guys I began to look at some numbers what I found was is Drew Brees has been a starter for sixteen years in the NFL not including this season\nSixteen years in the sixteen years only eight seasons has his team had a winning record\nSo fifty percent of the top fifty percent of the time my masters right\nAnd when I look at the other great quarterbacks Peyton Manning Fifteen outta Seventeen years winning record Tom Brady all sixteen of his years winning record I'm Brett Farr Fifteen of Nineteen years winning record Joe Montana eleven or twelve\nAaron Rodgers nine of seeing it Dan Marino twelve of Seventeen I mean John Elway twelve of sixteen oh\nThese guys and and you know it ... like when you get a franchise quarterback in the NFL you\nSend to believe you're going to be a contender\nFor the foreseeable future for as long as he's there and then you might not win the Superbowl Brett Farr only won one but every year his team was a factor in that goes for all of the all time great quarterbacks in that upper upper upper echelon\nAnd breathe visit there in terms of wins\nAnd so that is why I Believe that myself and other people don't\nPut him on the same pedestal as demanding and Brady and so on and so forth because not just Super Bowl is that's not just winning but just regular season records of making the play offs\nBeing in contention every single year jewelry just haven't done it\nAnd that those are all valid points and you're not just saying that because the one only one championship because people look at and and you bought 'em up Aaron Rodgers\nWho's only won ONE Championship news ... you look at for an all the guys who also won one\nBut I think that record what you just said a proves that sometimes\nStats can be misleading and this is why I've always you know you know of course I've come up with the\nStep pet food index about people put up numbers after the game and that would be made this ... young men do what I mean why of that stuff but it has all these incredible number of people think he's going to pay pass Drew Brees that's on page ... he's all paying you already are yours\nAnd messed up or has exactly how many a playoff one\nZero same as me and you exactly [laughter] so do you see what I'm saying so you got to be careful about stats and thinking that that's the only determining factor for greatness right and\nThis one let's let's face it in in in all sports he comes well baseball's a little different because one player you know with pictures and you know it just you can't have as much of an impact on the game you know like Mike ... is an all time great and he's not winning anything and you know he has the\nBill gambling regular going to get ... ... ... if you're drug users ...\nOr ... the um twelve thirty in Ninety three point three of them for cancer North West

John Elway ... uh you know Peyton Manning guys like that and we figured out why at least we think so only half of his career has has have his team's winning records and been relevant therefore in the playoff picture\nAll the other all time greats ahead of him or on his level even have been a factor a lot more than\nThat and I'll say this team because this is the other part before people go well Tom Brady is a great team and those are the great team and they have a great team\nIt the one guy could point to is Aaron Rodgers you noted defensive been horrible right and he's won every year and you know that when he's in a game and play a right they always have a chance to win no matter what would you ...\n... that's the thing about I mean let's let's be honest for the most part there are three teams that every single\nYear and this this era are gonna be a factor and that's obviously New England Pittsburgh with Ben Roethlisberger and Green Bay with a Aaron Rodgers\nDoesn't mean they're going to win the super bowl that I'd like to mix you can count on those three teams every single year everybody else they might be there they might not when you have that type of elite QB you're in it every year and for some reason Drew Brees haven't been there even Dan Marino\nYou know twelve is Seventeen years they had a winning record he didn't have great themes around him all this I Know that's the knock him when he never won the super bowl you know so we got some callers do they want to weigh in let's see what they say\nLawsuit at age seven seven Ninety not on Fox if you want to get into Israel\nIn uh El Paso Texas you're there\nYou're on the odd couple Fox Sports radio happening man\nAll right guys great to be here you know I just got to say um you know Drew Brees he goes all it's all guys you guys are at work hard the argument is you know the wide scope of greatness on the upper echelon\nYou know and you know we we we cross into the basketball arena with LeBron James and you know LeBron's great you know jewelry isn't LeBron James but let's let's not make that comparison one because LeBron James\nIs in a sport where you can't you know it it's driven by one superstar a lotta times you know ... words Drew Brees you know he's in a place where you don't see any direct coaching he needs you've been stuck in a pretty you know mediocre system for a long\nWait a minute Israel Israel ... the only thing I'm going to disagree with is when we make the case about Aaron Rodgers you could look at that team in roster and start looking around for the other pro bowlers the other guy's going to the hall of fame and you'll be hard pressed to find\nOther guys jet as Chris said is of course the turnout of eleven years or nine out of town and now it's in these these ... does not out of ten if they've always had a winning record that's the difference\nYou see what I'm saying Chris\nYeah yeah I totally agree I totally agree I mean 'cause that's what people are going to say about Drew Brees they're going to look\nAnd say well here they don't have they don't have that yeah obviously there'd been years where their defense has been horrendous any haven't had a lot of help but again when we look at the all time greats\nWe can say that about them in certain years and they still found a way to have a winning record like I'm going to make this confirms another NBA comparison I think Drew Brees is a lot like Steve Nash\nNash was the guy who was you know it took him a few years to get his burns me was coming off the bench early in his career\nAnd you know the breeze obviously somewhat of a slow starter in San Diego and then Steve Nash became a really good player all star in Dallas but nothing that you know nothing historically great he goes to Phoenix\nMatches up with a perfect coach and system for him my dad Sony\nAnd boom he's sky rockets into the two time and VP and clear hall of famer I think Drew Brees in Sean Payton found the perfect coach and perfect system bring him and his career\nSkyrocketed and he became an all time great in that system had he been in another system\nMaybe it would have been different I definitely think it would have been different for Steve Nash and I think it probably would have been the case for breezes well he wouldn't have been great but maybe just not as productive as he became\nI don't expect a rock hole to get another cycle of first postseason history or anything like that but a guy swinging the bad well he went for a yet more hits five Barbie eyes in Boston's route of the Yankees last night and now he's back on the bench cause the left handed pitcher\nOr CC's about this storm for the Yankees does that make sense or or yeah\nWell I think it does make sense Robin and I know it it it sounds a little odd to of course over his career hold actually is his left right splits are not\nAs dramatic as you would think actually as it gets left over his career a seven or eight opiates which actually is a little bit better than against righty so you could actually argue that among among left here is actually it splits are are much more favorable against the left in ...\nAmong left here is actually it splits are are much more favorable against the left in about ... but I like Alex scores Ansar al ... was asked about this a couple of hours ago Yankee Stadium and I think that the key part of this or is\nThis is what we've always done and that brought it probably expected that this is where the red Sox would go they would put a their normal right isn't there with kids who are in New news and that obviously if they get out of the game early\nMaybe they're going to hold that point in time I think he had an amazing historic I never seen it before but I almost think that if if you're going to communicate your players that your that you're confident in them that you're secure and who you are as a manager in your players as athletes\nDo what you always done I think one of the things I don't like in the playoffs are all of a sudden men get panicky they start making decisions they wouldn't normally make\nYour guys guys guys we've always usually it's among the position where are they both had wise you can use your bowl but differently but trust your players do what they've always done it for the red Sox tonight is hard to maybe maybe it's that believe that means they're going with new ideas are killed during the starting lineup\nJar great stuff you branched out into the NFL yeah you had your own you\nDidn't I didn't know about crunched the numbers [laughter] because I don't think about that bridge comparison\nIt's like my next homework assignment because of course as Rob knows well Chris you know those two I live in a state where we've got one well within fifty
