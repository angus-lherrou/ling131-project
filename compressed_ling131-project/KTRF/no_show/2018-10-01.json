your take on what's going to happen later this week when the FBI gets done and what do we do in ... I think it will be a great Supreme Court just\nYeah I mean I listen I I assume I Hope uh and I think you'll be a Supreme Court justice but I don't know because\nThe whole point of this was Jeff Flake in my opinion this was set up shop for like ... it's the United states senator to women aren't allowed to get an elevator when the United States Senate\nAnd the Capitol building how did they get in this whole thing was a setup Jeff Flake they asked them to come in that was his cover for demand the FBI investigation [noise]\nYou know how did those two women getting the elevator that convinced him to change his mind from a yes vote to I Want an FBI investigation and the answer is that it was set up from day one and he wanted those two women in the elevator and he wanted to use them as cover\nSo there has to be a reason they want this one week delay and of course it is either because they're going to have ten more women come forward and write and claim that brick capital rate them or attempted rape them or whatever he did to them\nWho knows what they're going to say sexually harassed them\nAnd they're going to try and dragged is on forever number one number two they're never going to be satisfied with the limited FBI investigation or all the FBI does ever as as Brett Kavanaugh honestly said is they file a form after interviewing people and they don't come to any conclusion and they tell you what everybody said so he said no raped she said rape\nAnd nobody will ever know the answer to that so\nThen they're all going to charge enough and there's got to be more FBI ... for the girl who says he gang raped them ah you know the the one is with attorney Michael have and that he was just an absolute fraud so look it's never going to end the Jeff Flake won and it didn't ever and he's a creepy the bad guy the villain\nBut in the end I came down in the idea that this\nWas forty years ago and a bunch of women were making up stories none of which could be prove not which had evidence\nAnd none of which had witnesses you cannot allow a man to be defeated based on that and they decided that it works with judge Roy Moore let's use it with with Brett Kavanaugh it's very clear that that's what this is if it was real Feinstein would have brought it up and one on one meetings with the man\nCan you imagine if I'm up for a major job and someone gets a letter that says oh Wayne rooted tempted to rape me and you sit across to me and you say nothing but then two months later you bring it up well that means the whole thing was a farce in the beginning\nSo look here's what my column basically said\nI Am Brett Kavanaugh Brett Kavanaugh as me Brett Kavanaugh as you and if they could do it to him\nThey could do it to anyone I grew up in an all Catholic neighborhood mostly Italian part Irish\nI was number one in my class like Brett Kavanaugh I was a sports star like Brett Kavanaugh I went to Columbia He went to an Ivy League school Yale we both got out of the chief great success in life and now they're trying to destroy him and I can tell you one thing\nGuys like that do raped women there's no way doesn't happen find me a case in America where a guy who's number one in his class and it was ideally educator with the sports started a great kid has tons of women friends and tons of childhood friends who stand up for him\nAnd becomes a well regarded judge and suddenly you find out he was a rapist or attempted rapist or a gang rape is it's the stupidest Mariel I've ever heard I grew up with nothing but Catholic school boys and let me tell you we all like women but we're all nice guys were like the date when we don't like to raped women [laughter] I've never heard anything so outrageous\nAnd so stupid and my entire life show me a witness okay no problem there are none nobody saw it happen it didn't happen\nIn the name she provided indicate that she's not telling the truth of the problem here is brute Kevin O's man\nHe's a he's a he's a father whose husband female friend to do little daughter\nThere is no credible evidence whatsoever you did any of these things there's no truth there's no ... no yeah but in fact but Fox News declaring an incredible how is it possible that record judgment pollen nano recruits wallet or ... ... that's credible credible\nWhat the hell we've been credible I Want to hear incredible\nVillage just credible because they didn't break or because no one tried to break or known as the single decent question I mean here's the deal if if I was a criminal awaiting trial I Would be for that woman\nThat road rage and Mitchell come after me please the most incompetent personally you know my entire life at least a hundred maybe dined by dying harder he ended up something\nShe worked for the Democratic party as far as I'm concerned the only good thing she did it she said after the fact that there's no possible way I Would bring charges against him in a real courtroom well OK big deal could argue that find me a lawyer who would say after it\nOkay thank you I Would say after everything\nWe know which is there's no there's no evidence of Napa thirty six years ago I think a lawyer or a prosecutor in the world that would actually say I would bring charges\nAnd I'll find somebody ought to be in jail put that person in jail because God Forbid they come and get my son or my daughter you know these are horrible people they'd be willing to say something like that they don't even know what they're doing they don't even understand the law for God's sakes\nAnybody can charge anything of anybody without a shred of evidence you cannot move forward\nWith the word of one person hell no backup that hospitable for thirty six years ago and ...\nAnd so she didn't even ... even with that either I'm not working\nPerson if they mind whenever you Brett Kavanaugh\nLindsey Graham by the way he's my hero yes yes it was fantastic\nAnd when he said that nobody starts out as Bill Cosby and it for the next forty years as I said there's no such thing that was a great point you don't start out as a rapist and then for the next forty years ever perfect impeccable records this guy's appointed more female

Lindsey Graham because\nBecause Brett without Brett Kavanaugh ... Lindsey Graham stuff on there was no other Republican up there will know than Brett Kavanaugh\nGood in fact ... you know Jeff Flake hiding out in an elevator as you get to Ted Cruz type assault or from some screaming woman who says look me in the ... I would've said lady\nI'm On your side I'm not in favor of sexual assault or trying to find out the truth you I I mean do you believe every woman who said she was sexually assaulted if that's the case the ... the Duke lacrosse team would all be locked up and they use UVA Rolling Stone story never would have happened\nAbout ten to twenty percent of these stories are fictitious eighty Ninety percent of legitimate well which is you know nobody's going to have a car stolen\nAnd tell the police as a Chevy one it really it's a Ford so but but in the area of sexual assault things of that character ten to twenty percent of the time there's false memory or false information given very motive and in this case\nSome Thirty years one by into twenty twenty twenty twelve when she was in a conference or their husband or else will be goes a marriage difficult because she wanted to front doors Thirty years later and that's the first time the therapist took notes and the therapist notes her own therapist\nDo not confirm her story according to the Washington Post then she would not give her therapist notes under HIPAA rules to the United States Senate but she gave it to the Washington Post and the notes the therapist and not contained the named Brett Kavanaugh and ... different numbers of individuals is holding her so the therapist notes the knocking firmer\nStory in fact in obstructed or story but they said it seemed to ignore that too\n[noise] it seems like everybody on a lobster ... wants to ignore all of the holes that had not to like you said that's what I Want to withstand a court of law and\nAny jury that would look at the testimony would not find the evidence you know I heard a lot of the feminist the Methodist so I called them on the left I say that survivors must be believed uh well we believe that they have been assaulted but\nWe don't necessarily need to take their word for as to who if they can't present the evidence how did Dr forget to the party she wasn't drunk when she went to the party\nI should have six miles from the party how she got home she has a very selective memory and like I said I'd rather than something traumatic that it happened\nAnd I believe it at some point in life at some point in her life are probably did\nCraft but she did not display to me like the burden of proof that I needed to believe that it was Dr Brett Kavanaugh and also what saved his his wife I Do believe that this father\nBy keeping a diary a calendar of sorts and without Brett Kavanaugh's calendar it would certainly come down to jot he said she said and the Democrats want to use these weaponized sexual allegations as political tool I think Dr Christine for nothing more than a political point\nOf the Democrat Party while they choose to ignore other women who have come forward with credit credible evidence specifically against Keith Ellison\nThat these fancy vice chair\nThe second most powerful Democrat in the party including a candidate for and turn the channel for a Minnesota has to credible allegations with police report Dr reports text messages and allegedly a video that acts that exists\nProving or at least getting assignments that he allegedly emotionally and physically abused no less than two women\nAnd I'll give you another part of this or you know it's just like the dog that didn't bark she told the committee the primary impacted event occurred during the four years directly after she said she went on to struggle academically I struggled at a Chapel Hill and in college when I was Seventeen I was off to college with a very tough time\nShe skips completely her junior and senior year in high school I guarantee you\nIf there were bad grades are bad behavior by her her junior and senior in high school the to academic years after the event took place when she was Fifteen Years old\nThat would have been the dog that barked we would have found out that she flunked out advice go that you did poorly and so how is it possible\nThat you did well in high school good enough to get into a Chapel Hill which is our school to get into get three advanced degrees including two masters and a doctorate right sixty five books in periodicals travel all over the world to to Haiti and South America and Europe\nAnd uh in Israel and she went to a she went to Hawaii nine times she seemed objectively there'll be full life what she would have written Seventy five books except for this terrible event\nHow come we've not heard about what ... what happened to her academically entered junior and senior year I submit to the reason is\nThey looked into it and she did quite well which is the dog that did not bark and then there was no objective indicator and why would she left the house with their best friend looming Kaiser girlfriends still there if there was two purported attempted rapist running around drunk\nHow'd you get out of there who took her home why didn't you notify other girls the next the next day at the swimming club\nWhy didn't you notify the girls the next\nThe next day at the swimming club but at the country club or or the first day of class\nShe told nobody counsellors mom and dad girlfriend\nShe kept it secret for Thirty years then had a recovered memory and psychological services counseling session because she wanted a second front door and how is it her lawyers got away with lying\nFor ten days about her wanting to drive from California to Washington when in fact she was staying in Delaware at that time and flying all over the country was not a bigger deal because you've fled outlined\nWhat are the another example of the Democrats using women as political pawns of tools and that's political assassination game that's just the politics of personal destruction they want it the political theater\nThey want it to expose her someone dead stomach exposed to she was and someone made sure that she would have cameras and lights and the national audience in front of the Senate Judiciary committee that was a set up in order to try to make the old white men\nOn the Senate Judiciary committee they're all white Republican are somewhat bad you know Steve King tweeted out just the other day and I say that's about old white men are relentlessly being racially and generationally profile by the power and laughed and air quotes tolerant\nLeftist media outlets and politicians almost universally profiled and stigmatized Republican senators looks like racial profiling is back in style\nIf you are left us for not only as an old white men that were going to question her but Brett Kavanaugh as an old white privilege to a guy that the Sacramento Bee is that when he was crying that's just what white privilege looks like\nYeah so they they they call it a massage or their crime Republicans massage that's an old white men and that's coming directly from the vicious violent violent blast and the Mets and dress that feminists\nNo state as the woman that crave unanimity demanded a public forty million audience to listen to her story she was never properly cross examined and uh and the questioning from the Democrats was laughable\n... and at this point uh what's gonna happen later this week do you think you're making ... dot com I assume the FBI Thursday and friday is going to give largely clean bill of health that will may not be sufficient Jeff Flake whose last name is should be an ... not a now\nAh I I guess she's going to he's going to vote for unless he's pitching old by another Ted Cruz CBGB's screaming out I'm In an elevator God Knows what's gonna happen to get all your crystal ball what happens later this week [noise]\n[noise] well I'm I think it hurt opera man however now that we've given the Democrats are there we are in this you know higher than the seven FBI investigation I quit having a I'm sure that my ... or by the gory alright well up here\nWith another victim I mean right now they're probably scraping the Yale yearbooks to see what they can come up with\nBecause the truth doesn't matter to the Democrats it's simply the perception is simply the narrative and they can use their buddies and the media in order to further to the same and destroy a potentially and allegedly assume ugly innocent man\nBut they can try to ruin him in a court of public opinion because\nIt benefits that politically\nAnd Megan they couldn't care less about sexual assault victims they couldn't care less about Christine forward that's why they all lead to our identity to have ... they want it to weaponize sexual assault the way they weaponize the Oscars the way they weaponize television shows the way they weaponize Murphy Brown the way they weaponize Oscars\nThey way they weaponize Grammys and public education whatever it is the socialist progressives want to weaponize\nAnd take up someone's cause as long as it fits their agenda but Keith Ellison or or Clinton or the Kennedys did not fit the agenda of the modern Democratic Party so they're completely ignore the provable Keith Ellison fishers who sold on his girlfriend's because that doesn't fit their agenda but a weaponized Christine for does\nAbsolutely so they're using her as a political pawn like they've done many either when I when we look out for example Harvey Weinstein remember NBC turned down a hearty why changed or eight or he was a big Democrat

on each other and typically the root of the issues often stress or boredom within a flock\nSo take a look at your flock for things that are upsetting them or they overcrowded or they had to feed and our water is too hot to cold or your lights to break or on too long a is there a predator stressing them or or the birds being bothered by external parasites\nTo make sure him to have a minimum of two to three square feet indoors and Seventy eight square feet outdoors per bird with adequate feed and water provide shade during ... and a place for them to get out of the wind and cold during the colder months\nIf you are using lights for your flock to be sure that you're turning those lights off at night not birds do best when they are provided sixteen hours of light and eight hours of dark and do you can to keep predators away from your flock remember that sometimes a predator could be your own dog your cat or even your children maybe harassing your chickens\nAnd then provided ... for your birds and that will help keep those external parasites like lice and mites from bothering your chickens and causing them undue stress how can you encourage\nHands to pack at something else\nI'd offer your birds up sharing a flock block the blocking churches natural pecking instincts and contain the whole grains amino acids vitamins minerals and oyster shells to supplement their diets are the added nutrients in this block provided more nutritious treat your flock and scratch grains\nAnd the flock but can also served as a nice weekend feeder if you're going to be away for a few days and just be sure to keep it up off the ground and protected from rain and excess moisture\nChicken toys also keep him happy or some of these toys can include logs branches or even chicken swings to keep them active and packing on things other than each other\nNow if the distractions aren't helping than you may need to separate the feather Packer from the rest of the flock and if one of your hands are showing excess of signs of being picked on you may need to separate her from the flock as well and this all out her a chance to heal that tried to return her to the flock as soon as possible so she doesn't lose her place in the pecking order\nThank you Dr begs tune into next week slugs drawing friday for more poultry tips from the arena [noise]\nTwenty minutes away from ... central obtain in

everybody to come out in and taking care of the flight are serious head\nNow it's still a strong market for a good use vehicle good training\nYeah absolutely and we definitely that's another thing too

life\nExactly exactly and so you know we were trying a and this year too will be trying a few different things maybe and\nSo it was one of the things too with fundraising you don't necessarily want to be continuously doing things like I'll wear out there selling candy bars all the time yeah um I Know that we have some different things that are in the works\nFor example something that's brand new is like a a St Bernard tonight at the ... and that's in development right now and trying to incorporate community mhm try to incorporate service put the funding fun [laughter]\nAh well good luck I mean I\nThink we definitely want to make sure that anybody who would like in education at St Bernard is able to to do that and so we want to make sure that yes you know there's tuition but we have different programs different scholarships ... help is available house somewhere even though we just welcome to new students today\nOh wow [laughter] good ah Logan or the or the program here ah do you help the number of different organizations and that's your intention isn't it a moving forward\nWith the kind of story allergen or religious to bring that the mind of I'm noticing kindness and the community thanking people further further kindness and just being proactive and going out and doing kind of kind of act so it has inspired some people to do different things and it's just an awareness thing\nI'm more or less it's it's not you know we do have um\nI've done some kindness grants to um where I have a\nGiven out a hundred dollars for somebody to go on and put them into action um but it you know it's not designed to really um yeah fundraiser or anything it's just as I Do to promote kindness and noticed kindness and the community and just kind of get back to those basic values that we don't kind of and by the way ... and\nI think a lot of us notice these things but we don't see anything anymore either we don't we don't saying thank you for doing that or do we take things for granted perhaps\nAnd I know that some of the things we want to I mean Logan in fact as a former grad I taught them in fourth grade and not all\nDay every day these idiots did you ever you know at that point say Logan you're never going to have you\nKnow I always knew from the start that he was definitely going to be a leader so I'm not surprised at all but I mean but he is an example that I Know that I've even used his example to the students\nUm as someone who looks like you know you can go out live your life and work and your job and have fun with your family but what are you going what are you doing to make a difference in everyday life in Logan is a wonderful wonderful example of that and so they have to see what he's doing you know he's he's out there and he's he's making\nAnd so they have to see what he's doing you know he's he's out there and he's he's making a difference for this kind of revolution and inspire kids to do that as well I\nI someone told me long ago you're either a giver taker\nYou know there really is I mean you may be can wattle between the two of them for a while but you're you're either one or the other end user wanted me to give her if you can you know so

mean changed what you do\nA you know you may even have to\nDo things that are a little bit more safe or because again you are now are responsible not only for yourself but somebody else's life\nThat necessarily isn't always true especially when they're celebrity involved and one of the hottest things in a\nPop a rap music and a very popular on the talk show circuit also is the rapper ... be\n... be in that she's in ... interesting personality I put it that way I TMZ reports that ... and buy a card Eby just had a her infants\nTo two months ago maybe three months ago this summer sometime at our

in time is available on Netflix and it's er it's a brand new movie was released a fantasy science fiction\nUm ... I Believe it's based on a kind of a teenage\nFantasy series the I'm not sure I'm who the writer is but I think it's\nSeries that I'm not sure I'm who the writer years but I think can say is a um\n[noise] a series\nOf books but to Disney came out what it is a wrinkle in time and ah I watched it and you ... not terrible\nUh you know I we didn't turn it off you know and it probably in and have some star power with a with Oprah Winfrey a and a strain Anthony and uh oh who else was\nUm [noise]\nA wrinkle in time ah Reese Witherspoon\nMindy ... we're in this movie that's probably why it became a box office loser wasn't so much but it wasn't a bad movie in fact the special effects are pretty good uh along with it but I think a more than anything perhaps um [noise] they're all Chris Pine was in its\nUh in in the\n... metrics gal ... I can receive ...\nAnyway they did some pretty heavy hitters and this and cost a pretty penny to make over a hundred billion making it made far less than that in theaters but if you'd like to see what a\nA really expensive movie but didn't do well is like you can you can find out on Netflix or wrinkle in time it's sort of a brand new movie and and among the biggest money loser is a budget made it a hundred million it's made about a hundred million so far\nAnd now it's already on ... so that kind of give you an idea of a ... works but\nI was able to watch that movie again a meal on Netflix one of the big money losers of year if you're a movie watcher\nDid not hear a whole lot about the movie before the boom the box office but uh\nWhen I Do I Know I don't know I'm not that much of a movie goer

and led to sporting goods next to a Michael's me down ...\nThey beat east Grand Forks a week ago and they want again this week so they are now to do is they were onto a gaining momentum and and they're yeah they're picking up momentum at the right time and they play an exceptionally difficult schedule\nAnd then you get a ... team that's that's pretty good but it's stumbled a little bit in the last week or so\nAnd you finished shop with Detroit lakes who admittedly and buy their own admission has one of the best team they've had in recent history yeah wow and that seeing something because they're usually pretty good [laughter] we've had some damage so there there will be some difficult task ahead\nFor the football team in right so that's what's that's what's left on local football seen probably volleyball goes\nTo deal with Clinton felt in the night which of the key game for them in the section\nThe ... girls about five hundred they're hanging right around the five hundred right they had a a a three game winning streak snapped\nA when they played last week that Detroit lakes ... could have easily won\nIt was one one after the first two they lost a third set the fourth one extra points and they and they had set service on their hand which would have given him a chance to go to five and didn't get it done by Detroit lakes has one very very good player the Doppler girl it can really play\nAn day and every time the Lakers really needed one that's where they went\nBut the problem is that night were also missing a key player\nBeck alerted not play that night she was home meal and K hide the flu or some semblance of some kind of viral whatever\nHas been going through the ... and that they were missing a key caught\nAnd an experienced player in in ... as well who's played a lot of volleyball over the years for the revolt so we'll see if if the meaning of different the second time around one back as they're unable to blight okay again you know you're missing a key jog it the wrong time those kind of things do happen ... a welcome nice school athletic [laughter]\nBut uh Indian yeah but those those are those are some of the factors in some of the things that have gone on a on the probably the scene locally a section eight or volleyball\nSkill real interesting to look at because say on paper even our guy lives down a little bit because they have to have lost a couple of games were matches recently\nBut they've lost has some very good competition out of the section in the section they have to losses those losses are the season opener demand your image will remember who's got a solid club and we'll see them tonight and the other one was a loss in the eight a tournament to eat out in the championship game of the ...\nBut those teams are all in the same section together so or going forward that loses a some key matchups\nAs section tournament time comes around and and that again it's just a couple of weeks away\nAll right ah the ah north one line here's a volleyball a couple of games are very strange all them coming week for the north and pioneers this past weekend\nScreens in the fact that they didn't have ongoing football game yeah ah through no fault of their own what happened there the the football team was to have played ridge water on on Saturday afternoon for own gardening\nAnd rage water late last week I Believe it was when the ninth Thursday right in there announced that they would be for fighting not only that game but the rest of their season\nA very unusual situation I've seen teams forfeit before the beginning of the year for a variety of reasons guys being ineligible or whatever the case may be but I don't know that I've ever seen the team canceled\nAh whatever the case may be but I don't know that I've ever seen the team cancels even halfway through\nYou know the combination of ah of injury perhaps some academic issues or or other reasons for a student athlete to leave the team or be off\nThe team right buddy buddy dramatic dramatic change in their absolutely they were fifty three to fifth victim of doing fifty five fifty and sixty when the season began a week before the scheduled game of the pioneers they were down to thirty two then they lost ten more that we have\nAnd the concern of course was a physical safety of the players that were playing in federal those guys if they had continued would have been a while a lot of position and are\nForced to play both ways and that ... yeah so uh and and they have the right move it's the riots it's hard to make but I think it was the right\nMove but I Do to that point I Do too and I think I think most of the north when folks will tell you the same thing\nThat it you know you hate to see it happening and it it certainly is a disappointment when it's your home game and and your homecoming that you lose the date but by the same token you probably was the correct thing to do for the safety of everybody involved in All right\nNow the uh with that being said the kind of put the north one pioneer volleyball team as we are only coming team to watch last week\nYeah pretty much ... any and they and they answer didn't they they did and it goes according to the other very nice thing I Do not a chance to see them yet I highly recommend that when they're at home you go out and get a chance to enjoy what is pioneer volleyball first and foremost the majority of the kids are local kids\nAnd I'm there maybe I should say regional kids and uh they do have a number of all the athletes on the team they have kids from the northern freed from Goodrich gray glove from climax Fisher from Asia from Norman kind of eased\nAll on the clubs ... gonna miss school doing it that way but ultimately they have a lot of local area kids on the team which first and foremost always makes them more fun because you watch a lot of these kids play before and now you get a chance to watch them or competed at the next level the second thing is\nThat they're fun to watch and\nThey play hard they play aggressive or they attack the the volleyball the they attacked the opponents say defense in and make things happen or they play a lot of aggressive defense of the net and and put a key blocks in key ... all the things that that you're looking for when you watch a good volleyball team\nWith that and they are now after two wins on friday and Saturday they sit at fourteen and two on the year\nOf their two locks is one of them comes to a scholarship school and the other one\nOh I think that back one of them came to what to Minnesota state Fergus Falls at the crossover tournament the beginning of the year\nThe other one team early in the conference even at the hands of the readers of central lakes who are right now by the way the number one ranked team in the country and and Jaycee a division three women's volleyball ... ... ... it's the it's not like the last two way a team where you're going well that and what happened\nUh there are good club and and have been for a number of years\nPioneers will get another look at them this week\nThey play Wednesday night over in Brainerd a second meeting of the year and the regular season with the wind over ... on on Saturday and with the Saudi losing on friday night to central lakes right now the pioneer sit alone in second place and the guy for instance opt for teams do go to the regional\nRight now that results at Central lakes area of the pioneers want any chance at all voting that result they need to win Wednesday night All right but then they turn around this weekend and go to Vermillion him aside beyond the turn around and they need to win those regardless of what happens on on Wednesday night they need to win those to stay at least in that do spot\nYou know up until last week\nA north one was also in the top ten yes and should be again you know in ... and probably will return there but a ... so a good for them in there and dandy a couple of actually three Minnesota teams right now in the dumped in a central lakes Rochester, Minnesota state\nSo a pretty good strong showing and they kind of gives you the idea of the the level or quality\nOf uh of ... fell out and they just don't know this this September twenty fifth for the last poll that okay that was what would you which is weird 'cause they're writing a winning streak yeah that they fell out now and then you know central lakes are just one last year\nOr so far Rochester's Lebanon for Minnesota state as Lebanon six I suppose it depends on who you play but\n[noise] and the man who votes for you I don't know how the er the polling\nYeah the the voting in the it's much like a lot of that national voting alive much knew his reputation and who your opponents are as anything else\nAnd then right oh I like to the pioneer woman a big big match on Wednesday and certainly a measuring stick to see how far they've come\nIn and you know Bob here's an idea of where we're at in the year and one of those things that just kind of ... in the face when you see at the end they hear about it I'm at the north when Jim laugh when they're getting ready for their match up on Wednesday evening\nAnd what's going on women's basketball practices oh yeah\nYou know they get so many hours a week with the players right now and a coach Nelson had her at her kids out in the end was going through some drills and things and she's actually missing for cars there for that or playing volleyball but haven't started yet\nBut it's like a looked like about eight\nOr eight or nine yeah so I if if they're going to run around twelve yeah that was there'll be a nice numbered or requests\nFor uh for the coach and they should be good again\nAnd they'll have to it's almost a full month a conditioning or or or practice I shouldn't say before they start playing at the college right now so I I Know they've been doing conditioning since school started but actual organized practices now started coaching also would tell you they better have been doing conditioning yeah All right\nAh area that's kind of what's happening here on the scene from her falls again you can join us in the conversation at the pizza tax line it's six eight one twelve thirty a big weekend or\nSending a on base record just a week\nAgo another one of the spots now on a twins record book where his name will be but the the big question comes down to what happens going forward with Joe Mauer I his ... year contract ended yesterday\nYep but don't you I I kinda nothing's been sad but certainly everything played out in the game yesterday to like you know and this is that uh I mean they they did everything they could but say that he's retiring\nYeah well and when when I was down for the affiliates many a couple of weeks ago mark and I talked about this a couple of weeks back on sports monkeys or sad levine who's the general manager for the twin spoke to us and he wasn't scheduled speaker Mr fall we were supposed to be his assistant demand that showed up at ... okay how come we got the boss\nAnd say they they conducted a a question and answer session through Corey province\nThe twins play by play a guy and one of the things Corey asked for a living and about was\n... hours future going forward and and we got the typical political answer from\nMr Mr levine that they they wanted to keep Joe Mauer image wins uniform and that's part of the organization but in what capacity going forward it hadn't been decided yet\nAnd that they were going to mean would join his people after this even well what I saw yesterday ... tells me those conversations have already been done even though they said they were going to wait until after the season about three days after that affiliates say weekends Joe Mauer came out and talked about that that he was going to keep sort of retirement at the end of the year\nYesterday they had his little twin girls meet him at first base you know in the opening of the contest which is really rare unless the guy has done that family is on the field unless it's a special family day or something where everybody's families on the field\nThen when he came to the plate for his first at bat\nThe pitcher catcher for the opposing team the pitcher did even take the mound they let him get this huge uproar is for ovation on his way to the mound when she's earned and deserved I'm not I'm not ruling that by any means\nBut it was the the grace with which the White Sox players handled yeah I Am like they'd been told to have this was going on\nAnd then in the final inning they brought in Joe out in ... year which is how he started his career was as a catcher\nHe got one pitch for ... and oh yeah the White Sox battered didn't even Degas bad off her shoulder you stood there and took it\nAnd the pitch ended Joel walk the ball back out to them out of hand it at the ... the pitcher gave him a big hug and they sent another catcher out and Joe Mauer was done yeah so they could take him out during a game\nHaving him catch in the end of his ... at the end of his contract or maybe as career or just like he began his career normally not always but normally those kinds of things are reserved for a guy who is going to retire\nYeah I'd say that everything but the actual words of or sat right so uh now now here's the deal about him staying in the twins organization\nI'm of course that's the only teams played for right ah here's his brother Jake um manage the the miracle\nRight and also I think Cedar Rapids colonel yeah when they would recommend affiliate here's at one of his uncles or has been a scouting guy for the Minnesota Twins so it's not just Joel being a Saint Paul kid only playing for twins his family actually has\nA history a lot of ties with with the twin mental little twins history so\nSo whether he becomes a a spring training guy wouldn't he'd be a great hitting instructor well yeah you know and even if he's just an ad hoc I mean\nThe twins have done this before Tom Kelly or Michael J. dire are really Hawkins as a ... I don't I think if I don't think that he would retire and go back to traveling with the team ball\nYou know I don't I don't think he was ... I think he has business concerns when it's when the housing but I think he's the kind of guy you may be habits spring training or\nBring in when the twins are a target feel because he lives in the twin cities you know the guy who was there during home um and you don't need you can only make up so many front office position right you know so you you've got to find them something legitimate or to do if if that's what\nYou're going over to keep finding a job for jak Morris he keeps coming bad news about the other way to the twin three year the other\nThing is this is Joel was smart kids\nFamily man\nHundred and twenty million eight year contract he doesn't have to work no you know yeah so uh but but good for him I I have to ... and they it's not just the twins I see when you see these things are\nA people retiring in ... new special things I always cheer up I mean they say there was no crime baseball yes there is a circus [laughter] after [laughter]\nSo but but ultimately it's not official at this point but everything yesterday sure indicated that that was his last time and the twins uniform as a player yeah I I own degree\nSo I Am more power and whatever he decides more power to him or speaking of baseball or were playing baseball today the regular season is over\n... [laughter]\nSo are these regular these are regularly these are regular season game scale why are we plane regular season\nWell let's take the nationally central just as the easiest example or the cubs and Milwaukee ended up with identical records ... at Ninety five and fifty seven\nWell somebody has to be the division champion so that they know where they're playing and who they are playing in the postseason and you're not going to stick both names in the hat and drawing nobody would like that\nSo they play today in fact shortly here I Believe in Wrigley Field and field right now I Believe it was an afternoon game yeah and the twelve noon I think and a hard time and the other game as an evening game this evening\nAs a as a wrap up and determine who are the playoff teams and and who goes where now it has happened before but never twice in the same here this is a history making event that\nBut never twice in the same year this is a history making event that there are two regular season playoff games huh to determine who moves on there has been one before a few times yeah that and the twins are men\nAnd boy then Soviet Union or the Yankees in hand and a couple of going back in\nThe didn't the twins and Yankees yeah they might have ... yep yep but uh but it has happened before but never to series so are there for teams playing today to determine who moves on and and the national league playoffs and and I think in the one case who stays home\nI Believe the cubs and Milwaukee a both qualified it's just a matter of who's a wild card\nAnd who's a division champion and the other one I'm not so sure I'd have to look back but I'm not so sure the other meeting is in the wild card game and the loser is done well wow\nBut either way it comes down to a question of you throw your number one or don't you does it matter and a year to you whether you go on the road and the first round or at home\nAnd does it matter they even affected by on who you're possible opponent is as to how you approach the game today\nHere's the deal or American League the Sox the Yankees the Indians ... in the national league the Braves the gums indoors and then either the Rockies or doctors\nGives them the other one is out comes or brewers both have Ninety five wins the Rockies and Dodgers both for Ninety ones whoever loses that one\n[noise] one left that's the other wild card because there are three there's three dimensional who your family and the Braves raves either the cubs liberal right but then the the ... the whoever loses that still has the second best record right it's a wild card and there's a wildcard so then it's the winner of the Rockies Dodgers will when the the L west and qualify and whoever doesn't\nA younger makes it interesting that has a name I saw very much so\nThey'll uh yeah uh and and I mentioned earlier this morning that's the way it should be I mean you you you don't I don't you don't want to like the twins they finish Thirteen games back\nThe second best team in their division you know as the tigers were twenty seven games the scary part is if you look at Cleveland's record where would they have finished and the other two divisions LA yeah and well down the line well down the line they wouldn't be in third in the east behind the red Sox and Yankees and the third in the west in the American league west also so\nThan many games back in both gatehouse may not very much so you know I Would say it's going to be a very interesting postseason it's gonna be interesting to see how these managers construct their pitching staff or you can really pare down to three starters from the five you had\nSo then the next question if you keep your other ... other two stars as potential long manning case the guy as a bad first outing or those guys out and you you are bringing more relievers to fill out your rafters\nBecause say ... you you have to preserve that before the series begins you can change their mental and say well so and so now he's well he can't bad yeah yeah\nYou know I'd say it's a very interesting\nThe ... the mind game behind the ... the chess match part I'm very much so All right\nA couple of minutes left here on our own Monday morning sports my Monday afternoon sports monkeys bomb home front and from our gallon sports Wayne Iran Katie Iran forty three degrees under a cloud in the sky or where there had been much ah speculation ah the tiger Phil Mickelson\nEnergy and\nCoverages underwritten by liberty mutual insurance company ... equal housing ...\nTwelve thirty Katie Iraq the proper falls in Ninety three point three FM Katie Iraq with translator I came to twenty seven ...

All right so the talk Julie Chen officially has left to talk about that right yeah\nAnd she was ... you know curiosity and upset but she said she basically has to do it for her family she needs to spend more time with her a sleaze ... husband and although I usually you're ... you're adding that she did not see about ... technically so you can see in her eyes and her young son\nAnd she did a video instead of actually coming to the talk because I'm sure look she must be very embarrassed right now\nAnd so you had a feel for her you know even though you know she's been able to climb the ladder um partly because her husband is the c._e._o. and the executive of you know by a common runs you know CBS [laughter]\nYou got to feel bad for her because of what he has done and and what are you know the humiliation that comes with that\nYou know being that that's her husband and so not come back on the show I think most people respect that most people understood that it'd be really tough or do you know who they're replacing it with no [laughter] take a guess\nWhy don't we just don't really like and gives you know women out there all coming up in one or two people that you think could be a good deal and\nI'll tell you the one thing she already tried out she was on a today\nShe already tried out she was on a today a dress the number of topics are in fact speaking talking about her\nAnd strange to a relationship with her daughter but they talked about this last week as her being a possible replacement for Julie it's good good good my great hours and so today she just happened beyond the talk as a guest talking about her\nDaughter and their relationship and everybody knows it's more or less a test run it to try out Rosie O'Donnell are\nGood at Google fast enough ... know Rosie O'Donnell is a from what I understand from all the rumors on line on the line with the Google and all that\nShe's going to be the one to fill in and take over permanently for Julie Chen [noise] which I understand because she she commuting then for more of a foreign country she was having to have ... believe so yeah I Believe so because she never actually left a\nBut remember she was one of the hosts on the talk or no the view she's young she's on the one of the original view yeah she was on the uh she was one of the regular and then she kind of went off because of certain things she was saying and they more or less kind of moved her out of the you know the show\nAnd now the triborough today she was on talking about her daughter Chelsea and and you know I think in fact I should've said Chelsea and you probably would have thought it was Clinton [laughter]\nDidn't think of that I'm with the gas bought is basically the audition for her to permanently joined the show and to replace the Charlie Chan who resigned no official word on that and however I think you'll probably hear that and\nI ended up being different than the difference of course between the talking the view is uh one's more political than the other problem I Believe in a\nWell the talks more related to women's issues chair and Meghan McCain by the way it's coming back as we talk on the bill the view you know she and the view of the ... she's on the view of you\nKnow I mean so maybe this wouldn't be okay for parole and see\nIf it isn't you know if if the it's a real change though from oh yeah I'm ... and Julie Chen was very nice and ... and ... and and you see what you want to I mean there there are people out there saying well Julie Chen you should drop drop to get out of this you know this relationship or\nUm you know she's an environment yeah I'm more power to her yeah I mean it's her choice after all mhm um it was her choice she's sticking to her vows more power to her insurance and Indian and if I don't know if anybody is breeding her for standing by our man but\nMan that's a if you if your spouse doesn't stand by you true\nAh and if it's if something comes to light and she decides one day well then you know it's time to move on yeah unlike a Matt Lauer when this all happened lowers why wasn't a TV host so to be in the spot like that I mean\nThat again you have to respect the fact that this is very humiliating and embarrassing and\nUm it's it's no matter what she did she would have came back on the show people would have said hey\nHow come you're not talking about you know it'd be really really tough and um a lot of people are you know criticizing the the ... the view view view because they haven't gone into great detail like they normally would have for anybody else they haven't slice and dice up the the news story\nI'm white ... again [laughter] we we\nDon't mistake or entertainment for news you know I this is a lot of you know it's like sports entertainment as as news entertainment yeah you know it's kind of what they make up on the fly once you're on a cover it's hot you know in the hot tub buried hot topic of the day does your ... or\nSo Rosie O'Donnell probably going to replace or I think it's going to be a mistake I think you're going to find that she's going to be\nA really hard to fit in with the rest of the crowd because she's going to be dominant she's going to take over in issues of dominant personality yup and she'll say things and eventually CBS has gone from it was like well maybe not so much [laughter]\nBut who they don't want is Feinstein [laughter] Senator Tom cotton said Sunday that Senator Dianne Feinstein office will be investigated determine whether or not they leak the confidential letter from Christine Blasey Ford\nI bet they did I I was surprised watching just a little bit of a friday's testimony she needed to take a civics class she while\nHe was not getting what was going on she kept asking her aid or whoever was behind her right what's going on what does that mean words yeah yeah I mean when when you're doing that maybe it's time you step away maybe it's time you're done yeah no disrespect to her being older but the fact of the matter is she still represents her state\nAnd she's representing the state and she can actually handle just a tradition where a Judiciary Committee meeting like that\nShe was asking a question it was right after the vote was taken she oh she goes so is that the that amendment a minute there's straight up and down vote and you you participated you when it hadn't voted no but\nSomehow she missed it you\nAnd then she was like argument of at the end when they finally turned to Mike optical about\nRanked in the news more team twelve thirty on the way\nThey just didn't uh [noise] the only booze make and then um [noise] some day and the random man oh ...\nAnd it's not going to appreciate like you know if you're buying a commodities or something like that you know he's he's not risky in it he buys chunks of land and you can always turn around and sell it yeah people buy land\nAnd a ... a million acres that probably put some probably within the probably the top ten private landowners oh I'm sure I'm In the country with a couple of people in Dubai in fact a second is the second most there's others one gentleman or John Malone who has about two point three million acres\nHow big is Montana itself that's a good question how large is I'm asking a Google Montana and square miles square miles of the wrong\nSo still give me the right answer one hundred and forty seven million no no I'm Sorry wondering forty seven thousand square miles yeah Montana yeah but how many acres I remember a time into a or I should have said acres okay and goes that's six hundred and forty acres per square miles okay you're making may has been in ... acres\nWithin area one hundred and forty seven square thousands in Montana and saw the large and then Japan that doesn't help me a\nWhile how many acres in the state of Montana here we go total acres Ninety four million one hundred nine thousand four hundred and ...\nDo you want to present a tree kill yeah you know working his way out there\nBut Montana's a huge thing and these are the largest private landowners I mean the U.S government has the most land\nRight in the country so it you know the two million acres that's that's pretty good that's wild okay this will get you\nA he owns a two million right yup Rhode Island is only seven hundred and Seventy six thousand acres and so he has two two and a half Rhode Island yes he wants to and a half states yeah I mean that's huge that's a that's a big time purchase right there and think about when he has to liquidate the [laughter]\nThat's when you buy the adjacent property you know oh yeah that's a that's unbelievable\nThe Hudson electric and Jake read a moment ago it's horrible read it over for you to do you do on the air\nTry that one again in Hudson

nothing of it turns around and that's the ... the problem that's why people\nDo sacrifice I'll tell you right now and the number is eight seven seven Ninety nine or ... people who want to chime in\nRight now if the if the NFL players ever ever\nEver ever wanted to turn to walk around their fortunes\nAnd got their contracts guaranteed and and and may be able to do it all they had to do was to stop\nThese one Super Bowl the way baseball players stop the world series and it would totally turn around but they're too afraid they don't get it\nThat's why baseball players a lifetime health insurance they have excellent pensions ... everything everything that you would ever want to have the best union in this country Chris is the baseball union 'cause they stick together they have money in a war chest to fight the owners\nAnd they and you hear one voice you never hear guys splinter and talk you know oh I got to come back on walking never does one voice and they know what they're doing if you need money to pay your bills you go to the union and they pay your bills\nUntil you know the work stoppage subtle and then you're paying back because that's the only way to defeat the owners and while they know that these guys are all running scared and can't miss a paycheck don't always have them onto their thumb and that's\nThe jury I agree I I and I think the problem is not I mean look the sea hawks are good they give her have given their all time is money yes goods the Steelers yeah like Yeah Bill money yes and I wish they would I I tend to side with the players\nIn these disputes 'cause you're talking about you know rich players verse wealthy owners\nHowever the problem is with the collective bargaining agreement as you're saying it's not just with the teams playing by the rules but here's the problem whenever and I've seen it I've covered I think three NBA blackouts or strikes\nAnd the players always lose now you're right baseball has done well in the past I'd be interested to see going forward\nHow they do in labor dispute because you're talking as I said about rich players verse well the owners owners who make money elsewhere their money mostly on all of them their money came somewhere else\nSo they lose a few games they make their money on the appreciation of the teams anyway and so they can sit out a lot longer than a player and in football you're really strapped because the\nAverage length of your careers only three years so I did it why I hate it 'cause I Wish the players will be able to stand strong but I didn't why guy might be the ... and a three year old kid you're so make this money and if I Can't I mean I'm not getting as much as I Want but hey\nBusiness three years I can make a few million yeah but I Want to get that I had my front but\nBut it's a mistake and that's why they're weak and until they understand that they have power\nAnd if they struck the NFL down the owners will have to come to the table it's just that simple don't don't buy into it that the owners don't care about losing money or given money back to the networks and they're they're they're in this for play money they make big money off the NFL says and no they make big money they make money the Dallas Adele\nAdele going but they got money they make it more layers you mentioned players it's about\nMoney would be more layers you mentioned players' union union which is true you know the the money starts running now you got to pay your bills\nYou probably lose their money from near the so much never worried about paying my bills\n'cause they're of a lock out or you know but that's not a tough row to hoe for the players but I get the situation there\nIn our age seven seven Ninety nine on Fox let's do would a brand and ah and Massachusetts You're on the odd couple on Fox Sports radio what's up\n[noise] but I was so good [noise] um I'm kinda leaning a little more towards a Rob side and I heard somebody say are\nAre are pretty for that\nKind of
