decay to Europe thanks to the chamber um I've lived in the fall is a good portion of my life uh spent a lot of time traveling uh lived all over this great country I'm\nOne of the things I'm really passionate about is our U.S Constitution\nI'm also very passionate about hearing what people have to say what they want for change and those voices need to be heard um I live in town currently with ah my wife and I have a wonderful home we have four wonderful children and two dogs and I look forward to trying to make this\nCounty great thank you Mr Thompson\nAs the incumbent Mr Garber if you come to the podium I Will give me your first question\n\nMr nerve route downtown the former falls has experienced some revitalization however there are still empty buildings what do you feel the city council could do to fill buildings and perhaps use downtown to develop a more defined personality for the for referrals you have to answer\nOne of the things we've been working with is the downtown business association\nOr they started the city of super falls is going to do a street project on debris or us from for the first group we're hoping not only to make it a more\nInviting place we're going to change some of the sidewalks a little bit wider a little bit more of a kind of a park atmosphere downtown were greenery are again we're cooperating with the downtown business association and make this happen hopefully they've got they do they have some ideas and hopefully we can work together and get this funded\nOr we should as a new streets by the end of this time next year we should have some history lighting up\nIt should look actually remarkably better\nUh we tried to change a few things and we got to buy the residents that they don't want us to change some things like\nDowntown falling we were thinking we could do that you're around and you know ... to park and that didn't work\nSo there's a lot that can be done do I think to see if he falls can feel the buildings you know\nWe can't we can't force anyone under the trick is we can make it as inviting as possible so that they do come and that's what we've been trying to do and I think you'll see within the next year and a half two years there will be a change\n\nThank you thank you Mr nerve rude Joshua Thompson would you come to the front porch employees for your first question\nMr Thompson downtown for falls has experienced some revitalization however there are still empty buildings what do you feel the city council could do to fill buildings and perhaps used downtown to develop a more defined personality for the former falls and you have two minutes or\nI think the first thing that we need to do is we need to find a way to make downtown more inviting whether that be lowering lowering taxes better curb appeal um we just have to find a way to bring more incentives for businesses to come into the area um\nI think businesses or the or the option to a ... a filling a lot of those empty buildings\nAre we just have to find a reason for them to want to come here\nUm I Know that we do have some buildings that are even being used for other purposes I Know we have a great arena that could be used for many more purposes that can bring revenue into the city um I also know that uh\nUh that uh\nKnow it's it's going to be up to the people we have to we have to let the people will be heard we have to give them a voice\nIt's it's gonna be up to the people we have to we have to let the people will be heard we have to give them a voice you know um as far as other options um other than that I think you know revitalizing it you know like Steve said you know we can make it look better but uh it only goes so far so thank you\nThank you Mr Thompson do you have any ... however Mr Thompson and go ahead and stand up because we'll give you your second question while you're still up at the podium\n\nMr Thompson there has been a renewed discussion of whether the former fall should have a public pool or a splash park\nThere is donated money and interest that might help in such a project what do you feel is the answer to the pool versus splashed park western and what would be the proper use for the ... money that is available and you have two minutes or\nSeems to be a heated question [noise] um [noise]\nI've asked a lot of people about this or what they would like to see happen and the answer I received the most is they they want to know where's the pool that we were supposed to receive years ago [noise] um I don't know much about the pool that we were supposed to receive years ago but I Know that people seem to have an interest in a pool [noise] um\nI Know that open park has a lot of space available to do new things with I Know that a lot of people have expressed to me that they definitely don't want to see a splash park expressly on a beach that's filled with ... ... um\nI I definitely wouldn't want my children playing and something like that um [noise]\nI Do agree with Mike that it is an extreme expense to have a splash part\nI'm it's going to not only cost us money to a new in water resources but it could ultimately ended up costing the residents of the book the forever for taxes for that water [noise] um I think that we can use a pool in a better sense by providing more jobs\nFor people to run that pool to run it effectively and it could also bringing revenue to the city and great entertainment\nThank you thank you Mr Thompson the ... would you come to the pedestal for your second question please\n\nA Mr Garber there has been renewed discussion of whether the former followers should have a public pool or a splash park there is donated money add interest that might help in such a project what do you feel is the answer to the poor versus splash part question and what would be the proper use for the ... money that is available you have two minutes or\nCrystal ... would you come to the podium for your first question then just to remind or we're going to everybody's question one question at a time and a half year everybody's had a chance to have a seat will ask you if you need if you have a rebuttal and then after that we'll go onto the next question ... your first question miss Keith\nThere have been allegations of poor morale as a result of micro managing in the school district do you feel this is a valid issue and what could you as a school board member due to restore morale\nYou have to match ma'am I'm\nI Believe that it's important to have a good morale and any environment that you work in um if you do have harbor around it's tougher um employees which will be teachers to do their jobs properly and get your our kids' education that they need\nUm whether it's teaching or sports or whatever it might be I truly believe that it's very important that we support those people who are being mentors fired shelter\nAnd thank you very much ms ... next John lingering\n\nMr Lincoln your question there have been allegations of poor morale as a result of micro managing in the school district do feel this is a valid issue and what could you do you as the school board member due to restore morale and you have two minutes or or if it's an issue than\nBroaden due to the forefront and there there is an issue here that needs to be dealt with um ah what we can do is to keep working with the weather with each other um\nBe a proactive about micro managing if there is or isn't be proactive about the prevention of micro management or we have a great great group of uh\nUh administrators and the school um we just need to let them do their jobs and I'm In the role of the school board is\nOversight and government uh there's a day to day operations or not or\nThey are concerned but they're not are concerned we hire people to take care of that thank you\nThank you very much for lingering cash rich would you come to the podium next please\n[laughter]\n\n[noise] ... what's your first question there have been allegations of poor morale as a result of micromanaging in the school districts do you feel this is a valid issue and what could you at the school board member due to restore morale you have two minutes ma'am\nAlright I'm not sure if\nThose allegations are true or not um I have no way of knowing in my opinion the way to prevent it is to keep them around so I within their own compartments\nIt is to keep them around so I within their own compartments\nUm I think what John said when he said that we have people hired to take care of certain areas there are processes and people that are in place to make sure\nThat everything I'm is running the way it should be and I do believe that it's always important to communicate with everyone what what needs to be communicated\nI think sometimes there are situations that need to be kept quiet\nUm and I guess being on the school board would give me the opportunity to see more on that maybe what what is quiet and what is what is open for the community but I'm\nIn my opinion we\nWhat we need to do is to let the people do their jobs and um see how it I'll say south\nThank you very much mismatched a\nUp next a my experience if you come to the podium please\n\nMr spears your first question is there have been allegations of poor morale as a result of micro managing in the school district you feel this is a valid issue in what could you as a school board member due to restore morale and you have two minutes or ...\nI think I'm One of my favorite things to is that perception a lot of times gets to be reality and that\nSome some items Lakers get blown out of proportion I'm One of the jobs as a school board member is to watch a taxpayer dollars to and and er which affect people to come to work and do their job but I don't think the micro managing part is there\nWe do fires superintendent and building leadership to uh\nTo run or district um we tried and encourage a high morale in our district in and do what we can to make that happen so thank you\nThank you very much for ... years a text would be banned all Rick\n\nMs all Rick your question is their head or there have been allegations of poor morale as a result of micro managing and the school districts do you feel this is a valid issue and what could you as a school board member due to restore morale you have two minutes ma'am\nI'm not aware if it isn't an issue or not I would like to be able to talk to those who are saying it is an issue and those intact others and see if it is an issue and\nBring it to who bring it to the facts and staff and make sure that it is not an issue or if it is an issue for some people tell them why it has done that way\nSo\nThank you very much muzzle Rick up next Ryan ... have you come to the podium for your first question\nFor\nMr also if there had been allegations of morale as a result of micro managing and the school district to do you feel this is a valid issue and what could you as a school board member due to restore morale\nYou know two minutes or ... as far as\nI'm knowing whether it's an issue not would would involve speaking with the people involved the teachers the people that work for the district\nUm omissions name because I Know that it was a quite ready to him but I Do read for a little is the one that brought that forward and I'm a true certainly talked to him and hear more about the reasons that he\nFelt that way and I guess as far as as far as doing something about it I think that communication is key or when I was mentioned up here with communication\nUm we've transparency um don't hide from moving a dog lover or they just tell us how it is and be completely transparent and you'll be surprised how well it was raised\nAs a business owner I've been through it um so my best years I Want to have a voice so it uh it really pays off thank you\nThank you Mr ... and Michelle Westerman would you approach the sodium please\n\nOkay ms Westerman a there have been allegations of poor morale as a result of micro managing in the school district to do you feel this is a valid issue and what could you as a school board member due to restore morale you have two minutes man\nSo one of the things I did when I decided to run without wanting to make sure that I was well informed on the policies the teacher association agreement as well as sending I sent out a questionnaire to some educators in the area different districts or did not different districts different schools\nAnd asking questions and that was one of the questions that was marked quite high that micro managing is something that's a huge concern for the district\nSo how can a school board member help facilitate change you know there is a chain of command as many of the other people on candidates have mentioned and part of it is you know the school board can help\nMake decisions but it's a superintendent any ministry of team that that follow through with that so I think we need to have an open discussion with people about micro managing what is it exactly the right of the problem and that's not get to the bottom of the problem\nAnd see what solutions we can have I think if we work together as a team we can be extremely successful but we need each and every participating number of this district to do that\nThank you thank you very much ms Westerman and whether anybody with everybody who has a rebuttal for the for the first question\nOkay before we go on to the second question good news bad news we got a question from the back from the school board\nBad news if you thought oh one more question and this is over with no got one more for you so we're going to ask for you sit here after we get done with the second question and we'll take the one from the audience if there's anybody else who has questions ... remember right back during the corner is where you leave those so\nLet's get on to question number two crystal ... approach the podium\n\nMs ... we live in a generally safe place however our children our greatest assets are our greatest assets [noise] do you feel the school district and its buildings are a safe place for the children teachers and others who work there if not\nWhat changes should be made and you have two minutes ma'am\n[noise] um\nI Believe that the changes that have been made to the schools have greatly improve the safety for our children\nUm as far as ... says I Need to be more done I guess\nAll of my kids now are at Lincoln So I'm not quite sure how that changes at the middle school and elementary school are\nYou know I guess I Would have to see if there is any additional changes that need to be done if there isn't that something that the school board needs to work together to um see what I mean the other school they're doing or what we can do to ensure that\nAnd educational experience for those troubled children so\nI'm I guess I ... I'm definitely talked talked\nTo them you know see what you can do you know if you do have to cut budget what what areas can be caught what needs to stay and how um [noise] I guess better to communicate those things slip them and\nMake sure that they understand what's going on I think\nThey can do is keep John Lincoln or would you approach the podium and if you want me to read the whole question I Will happily do that if I if you want me to lead read the last part that's good to last or why okay if elected a will you visit with school staff as well as the straighter rush\nBefore taking such drastic actions as they depicted here at the ... two minutes or\nI'm a ... in the budget for ethical you have a system in place where the administrators\nLook through their budget they bring into through the different different levels and then it comes to the board for action so\nThere's the to me there's a fear of going back to you if you're if you're going to go and talk to each individual\nPerson that this is affecting\nAre we going back to that worry of micro management um do\nPeople need to be talked to yes but that I got the administrators deans and it's like teams are there I Believe that as their place to be talking to\nThe individuals that are affected by budget cuts\nUm are as a board member we need to be open and a\n... to talk to someone wants to talk to us about it but I don't know like I said my fear is looking like that micro management but I'm totally you know we are the system in place a and a ... very well thank you\nThank you Mr lingering uh Carol Schmitz would you approach the podium next\nAnd Carol would you like me to read just the last part or would you like me to go back to the beginning of the question okay\nIf elected will it because I think this is the crux of the questions if elected will you visit with school staff as well as administrators before taking such drastic action as they spoke of at the AFC in this question to management\nI'm not sure what happened um however I Am guessing that\nThe administration had some voice in to what was cats and a lot was caught on fire to the actual doing now that I'm at least from what I Am familiar with administration on\nYet is given a certain number of dollars that they need to cut and\nThen there may be a meeting with staff to come up with creative ways to accomplish that and after that than the decisions I mean probably with other members of the school board um I ... it's my\nUnderstanding that\nAdministration already have a voice in that\nWould I be a poet to talking to someone you know I Would not um I don't believe in like a managing but I also feel that if someone wants to talk to me if I'm On the school board I certainly would be willing to listen and and to understand what it is they're concerned about\n\nMaking them instruments are up next we'll be my experience if you'd approached podium\n\nMr ... the just the last part okay or if elected will you visit with a school staff as well as administrator before taking such drastic action as they spoke about the ale see you have two minutes or\n... I think uh they're too We're back to John's comment the micro managing goes on of earlier questions I'm being on the Finance Committee we did ask questions of our superintendent dinner administrators you know concerning the\nEr numbers in our ills see or not what they used to be a lot of classes have to be unfortunately are numbered driven we have a limited number of dollars to work with we can ... not go out and Lebanon for general ed dollars to uh\nTo uh pay teachers for some of those rooms and in some of the concerns in the community is to keep keep numbers in classrooms low show\nWorking within a budget that it's sometimes hard and sometimes painful cuts needed to be made and those numbers were looked at in recommendations from the administration were made than\nMany school board members did ask questions and then got um answered and we'll make the choice I think you're\nThank you Mr spears and Ulrich would you approach the ... a podium please\n\nWho's or it with you if I just asked last part of the question if elected a will you visit with school staff as well as administrators before taking such drastic action as we spoke about the ... you have two minutes me\nI I Know that there are protocol from the fact that the U.S out\nFrom\nThe fact that the U.S up to the school board you have to go through this person or this or\nI I Would love to talk to anybody who had let it in my prime minister and know what's going on to bring the\nWhat should be cut and listen to the school board they should be aware of what's going on I don't know if I were to go lower areas\nOn thank you\nThank you very much ms ... Ryan ... would you approach the podium to answer this question also\nIf elected will you visit with the school staff as well as administrators before taking such drastic action as they spoke about the ale see you have two minutes or\n... definitely I mean I I think communication with my first question they started with\nCommunication transparency I think those are still important um I also think is very important to do a thorough job of\n... something before making a decision so I was lucky enough to be a part of the uh the president of of north when invited me to be part of the football team decision I'm One that was cut and we are bringing that back in the last year there are lesser job so I'm\nMeeting as long as we do a thorough research of investigate everything\nI think that uh communicating with the people involved is most important thing\nThank you must rest surf Michelle rushed Herman would you come to the podium please\n\nJust the last portion of our time ms Westerman if elected will you visit with the school staff as well as administrators before taking such drastic action as they spoke or even the hills you you have two minutes ma'am\nI Am fortunate enough to have had a sister in law who benefited from the sea program and the for her she was a teen mom and now it's successful um and couldn't have done it without the program\nI Know that there are tough decisions that need to be made in regards to budget um that's something I'm very familiar with in my daily job we are I have a state operated budget and this year we were caught by seven percent that is significant so what we've had to do is find creative ways to make our budget stretch\nNow I Do agree that you need to communicate and like Ryan said have transparency with people\nI Do know that there is a process of the what the school board has and what the rules are in the superintendent's ministry enters roles are and I think if we\nIf something isn't being communicated or somebody doesn't think that that's been communicated and we need to go to that person whether it's the superintendent or the minister and make sure that we are\nClearly communicating that to make sure people know what the outcome could potentially be and what is expected of them to see that budget um extender not extent that and find alternatives for that money to go out there I\nThink yeah I\nThink humans Westerman are there any rebuttal questions off of the ... broke my bottles rather off of the question from the audience anyone [noise] without thank you very much those are your candidates for the for reform school district you guys can ever see thank you very much\n[noise]\nOkay we've had a some more questions from the audience and the first one we have here would deal with a candidate for state house representative district one a which would be banned Fabian and Steve Miller so if you like you can come back up and we'll start the process over again [noise]\nJust one question\nOkay ah\nHere's the question\nRepresentative kill stated funds were given for broadband for the east side of the ... River Falls\nWhen can we expect broadband expansion for the west side and north of the river falls I'm Mr Fabian you're the income but why don't you go ahead and take the question first you have two minutes or\nIn the audience question for you Mr Hansen is if a pool is preferred over splashed park and the estimated price point of a pool is three to four million how do we pay for that when nobody wants to raise property taxes you have two minutes or\nUm weed out the look and I feel outside grounds um I Know there's money to help the situation\nBut in the same time they said no one wants to his brother Texas so I think we'd have to look through outside help 'em some personal backers maybe some people within the community alumni people that have had the roots here before I didn't want to see that happen\n\nThank you very much Mr hints Mike alerts and would you come to the podium please\nThank you very much Mr hints Mike alerts and would you come to the podium please and I'll read the question to you Mr Lawrence and if a pool is preferred over slash park and the estimated price point of a pool is three to four million how do we pay for that one no one wants to raise property taxes you have to make sure\nI first probably go out to a neighboring town to see how they did their pools a good example of the world's a pool that is not a normal pool that you'd see it's actually a a like a sand or gravel or ... bottom and that has a filtering process and it's a lot cheaper\nOr it could be an alternative and again I Would have to talk to my war to make sure I get some feedback from them that that is indeed something that they would want\nFor the more I like a um a Gary was saying I Would look towards um private individuals that could potentially help donate the building that we're in right now it's only I'm here because of uh people that donated to put it back into its position or or ... and two it's a\nA wonderful ... a place that is that right now it's like a back to its I wanted to say almost original state that it was um that was not done with out a lot of sweat labor and ... and I would go a push to try and see what I can do to\nHave other individuals not only in the ... but the area that I could help support that\n\nThey can muster Lawrence and uh it would turn would you come to the podium please\n\nAnd Mr colonel ask you the same question if a pool is preferred over a splash park and the estimated price of a pool is three to four million how do we pay for that when no one wants to raise property taxes you have two minutes or\nWell I think I kind of go back to my comments earlier you know you can you can build something for three or four million dollars but going forward how are you going to maintain it wears the operating money coming from\nA and where's the the three four million dollars coming from um [noise] as far as pools goal of those wonderful they have it but to envision spending three four million dollars\n\nHow are you going to pay for it you can go to individuals which are great people to donate\nBut you're you got a big ticket and again the maintenance uh if you go around to different tones number a little familiar with some of them\nThey're struggling and uh to keep it going and uh um that's a huge task yeah and I'm not sure that to put ourselves and that kind of debt would be very prudent thank you\nThank you must return Steve not rude would you approach the podium please\n\nMr nerve rude if a pool is preferred over a splash mark and the estimated price point of a pool is three to four million how do we pay for that when no one wants to raise property taxes you have two minutes or\nYour way to do with his private pool a that is the only possible way that we could do that right now for just aren't enough public dollars out there to you'd be looking at\nA ridiculous amount of funding could it be done yes could we bond for yes do you want that kind of dollar on your tax right now do you probably don't in\nSevere so aptly seven figures it might be a different story things might be changed by then it might be much easier thing to do I really think of this case the only way this is going to happen\nThis private dollars who I think they're out there yes do I think it's possible that we can arrange to make some of those private ... over this yes\nI'm having said that it's I just it takes people to get together and do it that really that's what it really takes a lot like raising two hundred thousand dollars you're talking you know ten times at\nSo pushy and so that's where I think we are they really need to go in and I hope that we can be together but in the beginning of this year to get\nThat done I really do think we can do it that way they do\nThank you very much risk in our rude and find that we have Joshua Thompson if you'd approached the Portland police or\n\nMr Thompson if a pool is preferred over a splash park and the estimated price of a pool price point of a poor excuse me is three to four million how do we pay for that one no one wants to raise property taxes and you have two minutes or\nIt's a good question um and I don't think it's one that can be answered by one person individually I think it's a group of people that need to sit down together to answer that question but\nAh you got in a neighboring communities that have outdoor pools such as world really falls [noise] ah I Know ... I mean they got a lot of money just be Marvin window is the mayor [noise]\nUm they got a lot of funds coming right there from just the family [noise] um so I'd start there and I'd ask them how they did it you know it's you know try to get some answers from the people have done it um\nFrom there I go to or the private sector and I'd\nYou know try to see if I can get bonds to you know offer people are businesses the opportunity to uh invest\nUm if you have a pool of you have to have a comprehensive business plan to run it and if you run it you have to make sure that it's going to be profitable if it's profitable then you can find a way to make it pay back any debt I'm therefore I think that if we reach out to other people or we could make it happen\nIf the if the community watch it I think it could very easily be done it's just going to take some work I'm\nA I Do know that for a lot of corporations in businesses there are tax write offs for people who donate up to a thousand dollars a year [noise] um and I think that if you reach out you can you can definitely find that people especially in the private sector thank you\nThank you very much Mr Thompson are there any re bottles off that first question tech if not we will go on to the second question and a ... Christian Andersen you want to come to the podium please\n\nYour question is would you support curbside recycling you have two minutes or\n[noise]\nYes or no I guess I'm looking for the parts that I manage Reno it wouldn't be convenient for them just for the short streets we have and everything and make it easier um\nAs far as people and tell them that might be a little different going through the alleys and stuff having crashed on your front yard all day and I think you need in the union for some parts of dull lots for much for others so that would be uh\nOh not so much for others that'd be up to the people what they want to\nThank you Mr Anderson Gary hence would you approach the podium next police or\n\nMr Hansen would you support curbside recycling you have two minutes\nYeah so would the only thing I Would say is what is the hidden costs for cycling Ben's to the public to the city of Z revolves would it be increasing garbage that they already be in the city bill I have a family of seven we were like all the time so yes I Do support\nI very much Mr hints Mike Lawrence would you approach next please\n\nMr ... would you support curbside recycling and you have two minutes [noise]\nUm I Am not a fond uh or I'm not in favor of the bags that we currently use and I would look at I'm\nLooking at our trash pickup altogether [noise]\nUm I Am a strong supporter for recycling with loving kids you'd be surprised how little trashed we actually have in fact I'm over a year plus bags\nHad in ... just because my kids are very um ... you know dedicated to have ... helping us recycle 'em I Would look at neighboring town to see how they have done it and try and learn from their mistakes find out what it would actually cost to us if there'll be an increase and then in turn\nThere are so many things they show lost and you want to give you information\nWho are you and what are you doing these numbers out twenty four seven three sixty five\nWere that trusted voice that makes you smarter feels quite sure if you've ever met when you're wrong so tell your friends\nYou know why don't we listen to them it's right here in Fox Sports radio Fox sharks to think about that when attitudes have asked why\n\nBy one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for detail tap tap water\nSaw and Robert\nAnd we're brought to buy discover card discovered street Jews like you to treat you [noise]\nI guess this is why were the odd couple of points that you continue to have on LeBron James I don't understand why we're\nNo shot to beat NBC\nSheer asked me if I'm ... I'm going to win the repeated Shia Islam ... going to envy previous years no way no\nHow [laughter]\nI remembered as we were doing was drivers you know ... I Know you do okay okay so who's winning it\nI'm jumping to ramp bodily jumping to wrap when's it um you know they win Seventy four Seventy five games and\nAh you say that like it gives you know that when they're they're when they're Seventy four Seventy four Seventy five games they might even where they have to they could and I think I Hope they go for it but I don't know that they will like it and that's not what they're\n... they're they're about championships and they're not going to burn themselves out\nI just wonder though if you were in their shoes\nI mean it would be chipped in the mean it'd be like look guys will know if this is going to be our last year together or not\nBut let's go out here and just born store every by ... and you know I and I think their motivation the bronze come to the west\nAnd kind of ... I Want to say stole your thunder because everybody thinks do they still going to win it but you know he's this story\nRight you didn't think they could play with you last year and you know you you you got all these other storylines so I just would love to see them go out there and just make a statement and knew if they win I don't even think that the wind break the Seventy three when regular season more if they win Seventy\nI think is Duran might be assuming you know but he has a place that like I mean that may and then he looked apple have some tremendous year\nThat's also the biggest problem too is when you have two great players on one team they kind of separate the votes you know what I mean a little bit so we ...\nWe used to do that it happened you know I think or some other guys and again my pick has been LeBron as was the pick of the NBA general managers there's just remind you that\nUh last year they also picked up a little brown five fifty\nPercent but this year's ... percent as you think that's better ... that what you're trying to know what you're saying he was number one all got among the vote matters but I looked Duran got to have a great shot I think ... got a great shot because I think Iran is going to happen\nI think ... got a great shot\nBecause I think to Ronald don't have a good year they're usually quite yet and the east I think why you know wants to come back and show people you know kind of remind people that he is a great player I if I were him I Would be looking at this this man I Know I'm only stay in one year I don't want to stay in Toronto\nBut I have a chance to take the eastern conference by storm and show everybody what I'm about remind people that I was arguably the best player in the league you know before I got hurt last year so\nI think he could he could be the MVP\nUh I think Kyrie Irving not that he's the best friend the league or anything like that but if Boston wins you know sixty five games are so hang just dominates the Easter is the number one seed in the east\nTheir best player in their team is going to have a shot at the MVP you know how it works Oh absolutely I re as if he stays healthy he'd be in the running to\nKnow I I agree with that and he wants to wall bounce back and uh and show what or he can do so there's a couple of players and hard and could also want to repair and and be like now you know what I mean and and and uh and get them going\nIf they win you know for them it'll be like they got to win a lot of games but if they end up with the number one seed again and you know maybe close to Seventy wins he can get it he can definitely went through in a row\nThere's no doubt about it there's no doubt or\nIndeed ... like you said for LeBron then again this is one of the reasons I picked him to win fifty three guys I think he really wants to and he's smart enough to know\nHe's got a gift ... if not fifty than forty nine he'd asked if he he got forty nine wins\nAnd like it was gold and state maybe Houston and then several teams in that forty seven to forty nine when range maybe he could get the MVP with less than fifty wins but generally you have to win at least fifty games\nSince Nineteen eighty two to have a shot at the MVP only one player since then has won the MVP without winning fifty games and that was Russell Westbrook because the average a triple double two years ago but which was a story right right and he said I I and I and I said this I said this live\nI voted for Russell Westbrook that year he was first triple W. average one last year or two but it was totally different nobody he didn't get many MVP vote\nBut if he had average like nine point eight or nine point nine assists rebounds and not gotten a triple double I don't think I Would have voted for really that close Chris oh wow because I mean it it it was historic it was simply one of\nThose achievement that\nIt was just the he wanted for the individual achievement but the only team won enough game but the only\nThing that ... that I I liked about it was the team's record when he got the triple double\nA what a great well you know so it wasn't just like meaningless numbers he was actually gave I looked at that and I thought wow that's impressive\nThat when he got a triple double ... they normally one they were like one at a higher than it was a great ... remember what it was but it was tremendous when he had the trip because if it would have been the other way around like whatever you did the triple double and they were out of five hundred regular below five hundred record\nYou wouldn't look at it the same way you'd be like a lot of these are just a\nGarbage that's when they're down big or something so so I thought that that helped him out\nDo you think LeBron could average a triple double\nYeah Cody um I don't think it's that easy uh I don't think you\nThis year this year I don't know I don't think he will um you know I mean you probably can say I guess he could but I I don't think he will um but I think he's going to have a great year and\nBe the MVP but it it's going that's going to be one of the interesting story lines or this season and or the other one well there's there's several but I think Kevin Iran and what do you decide to do going forward in the offseason after this year that's going to be a story all year\nThere sometime we talked earlier about you know does he go to New York or does he go back to Oklahoma City is one caller said does he go to his home town of Washington and then there's the Lakers Rob and you know the brown once in their\nEyes I just don't think that I think that the league if I'm the league out I Would really really not like it hey hey you know a little a little baseball update aids had the bases loaded two outs in the fourth\nAnd uh several you know just struck out the batter to get out of the inning but it was bases loaded into out so they had a threat going here and there are no hitter do right was annoyed or to the walk two guys and one guy got on an era so ... so he does have a no hitter go into the fifth and\nWow this is big but yeah I see I don't I look at it different if I were Kevin Iran I wouldn't\nDo the LA because he got a chance to win more rings and LeBron James I'm he's got a chance to do his own thing by maybe going to New York you know\nUh so I I Would do that if I were him I wouldn't help Bronwyn rings\nA but I I think from a legal standpoint I think they might love it if he wins I don't think so I think they love it if you went to New York too but I just think it'd be a law that would be a huge deal because they wouldn't be\nI mean look they would I guess they wouldn't be the favorite I just saw it I don't think that they will look at it would be right there but I\nI just don't look at it because first of all one of those who teams wouldn't be in the finals right\nRight right down to the west would just be that much more power to see what I'm saying so so that it wasn't until it's about you know the NBA man it's about storyline no I got it\nBut I'm just saying I don't think the league would would really want that I think they look at it and go to just not good for the rest of the league I Know it sounds good and people are going to tune into that but the rest of the leak why would any if he went there people will go like are just as ridiculous as stupid\nGoing to get you run he's got an injury history as well as the bulk of free season I like Bryce Harper but not for three hundred million dollars\nGonna get first of all that was I got to meet your your mom with that that was that was just\nI I I like give them to\nPay you thirty million look you know this is baseball there and you can't find any player and expect him necessarily to win the world series that just doesn't happen\nIn baseball you never know but Bryce Harper is a productive player he's going to be a perennial all star I Know he was down in the first half of the season buddy heated up in the second half and he puts fan he's in the seat\nThis is a business he's gonna be productive on the field he won't be the best player in the league most years maybe here there he might happen it would be the type season but he's gonna be a perennial all star\nAnd he's gonna put ... into the\nBusiness he hid under two fifty two of the last three years the initial love of coming to see Bryce Harper is going to turn into oh boy really over paying for this guy nothing\nIs going to put people more seats than winning games that's the bottom line someone's going to give Bryce Harper money and God Bless the Marlins gave Stanton thirty million dollars he was going to run the team it'd be an all star and he didn't make it a year out before they said we got to train them because financially this is killing you give Bryce Harper thirty million you're going to be read it for however long\nYou know I think that Bryce Harper is a store in baseball one of the three big attractions\nWhether or not or they have the other pieces in place and they should have won in Washington they've had a well pitching issues and and things not go their way during the playoffs but that ballpark was packed here they are a prime time guy he's worked at thirty million guys who weren't even as good or even attract people\nTo come to the ballpark and making twenty four twenty five goldie extra six million get you a store\nProved to your fans you're trying to make something happen\nAnd that's what fans are always looking for his my team trying to when they went out and got me Bryce Harper I'm going to go buy\nThe tickets and that's what it's about\nAfter a bad seed like Chicago if they go out and getting Bryce Harper those fans are going to be high their fans are down right now they're just\nStayed there does grants to they're they're just all of that you go get 'em Bryce Harper their back\nBandwagon and excited they give a hundred million dollars a foul or for the next five\nYears at a hundred million or ... points\nOut the killing me [laughter]\nTo be a box with rain or the odd couple Christmas art rocker Jason Smith sitting in a hot he looks very comfortable somebody switch it up this round\nYou keep saying that got if you should see it right now but seizing his bald headed everything all\nAll that said something about let's get Chris Broussard in the hot

Parker said it was a virus ...\nWatch Philadelphia do this all the time and we loved it I we saw some paint and do something similar in the super bowl on by kick it work we loved it he took a chance he knows his team as young he knows his team is not ready to win yet and so he is saying I'm changing the culture\nI'm showing these players they were going forward we're not playing for tied we're not going to be happy as a five hundred team we are trying to win everything even if we don't do it this year we're setting the tone we're setting the culture and we're going forward\nAnd we're moving the ball on them all night\n[noise]\nIt's not for the ... why do I Robin I are fighting against the ... really throwing punches at each other it's not fourth in one\nFrom the Texans forty yard line its fourth in five from your own forte the chance of success is low you have to understand the modern NFL now ties are valuable there will be more ties because of the way the NFL does think strategically you put losing the game back on the table\nAnd that's what happened and the worst thing is that as a first year head coach now who trust them he makes a call like that Bill Belichick can do that when he's got three superbowls and say are\nWent for it on fourth and one of my own thirty people are going to say what does that all about but the guys won three superbowls Frank rice has put a bull's eye on himself doing next time you do something like that we're going to say you\nPeople love Frank White they know he's the quarterback whisper he's got a little bit of leverage here a little bit of leeway I'd give it to you is obviously not belly checking and he's a early in his coach he can't do anything like this anytime soon I elected starts winning big but the\nPlayers loved it they know we're all in now they know it's all about winning and I mean they weren't it wasn't given them a field goal they still had to get six seven yards or whatever maybe even a first down to get within real real goal range so I again I wouldn't have done it but I don't think you're\nMove that everybody thought it was a terrible move course I've talked about it over and over sports that the short menu wins and losses you can't get you can't take the L\nAnd uh divisional game in that situation this could come back to haunt you and you know what to tip the players are they're they're saying to themselves does this guy you know what he's doing Kenny coach you put down in the air of whether or not you know what you're doing\nSo every time something doesn't work out for you know they're going to say why can't cold that's why you don't do it you had\nA tie your back pocket go home with that have\nAnything is better than the laws [noise]\nAnd that's the hot and you just took a long while I don't want to go along with you about that you know what I got something for you go back to cover the NBA\nThe microphone and that\nThat's a low blow route route that without then they look\nLike the hot there I'm like I Love\nDoing it I think he's I think he's just in ...\nAnd then I I Love\nDoing it I think he's I think he did in ashes on the floor\nYou know how I'd be the way you saw that last ten minutes and the way the rest of the world did that's two different things credit that well we wish you had to Jason said he got a\nGuy a great job Jay Z great job our last segment is coming up let's finish draw more the odd couple next Fox Sports radio\nWhether you get us on Facebook Twitter on Fox Sports radio dot com\nOr you could just jump in on your radio\nImagined that work in\nA lot of ... sports do you\nFox Sports radio\nWe've all been there you're out on the golf course and it's bad\nFamily is not always easy to fix your golf game but when it comes to go check engine light auto zone makes\nFinding a fix a breeze if your check engine light is on the plug in the ... tool for free saving your time and money down the road so off your light is on a visit\nYour local auto zone today and let them by your fix with the free services firm auto zone you just can't lose getting the zone autos regard\nBelieve anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation that's why they think and you'll see are ridiculous and now just for giving them a try discover will get new car members a one year anniversary gift they'll never forget at the end of your first year they'll match all the cash back\nYou our dollar for dollar no cap and know catch you try it and believe it I discovered dot com slash Matt only for a new car members limitations apply\nOn the battlefield there's a saying America's military men and women live\nNever leave a fallen warrior behind\nOff the battlefield wounded warrior project ...

radar that matters to anybody\nHas the warriors and the Lakers in Las Vegas\nOne game that mad as hell here's the thing is that you look obviously what would you will get to the Yankees and the AIDS in a couple of seconds Yankees still up\nTo nothing over the ... and the sixth inning but pre season basketball has become a thing not quite to the level of pre season football but pre season basketball has become ... yeah well I Would\nReally had that one year I'm up for it now that one year of summer league excitement last year yeah and this year it went right back somewhere\nAnd never goes away like the NFL at least goes away for a little bit of time now the NBA never goes way could ride right into the draft number right into the summer league and then you know football starts that it's like I ... for basketball they pushed up to start\nTo start earlier it's a real cause they needed the ten month season NBA basketball pre season has become the second\nMust see preseason out of all the sport while there's more opportunity to\nBet there's no question that you know so that's good I'm Still battery over under as you can still bet some individual prop that's along the along the way although you got to be worried about minutes superstars tricky game to play along the way but we watch the Lakers last night you got to celebrate a Knicks when\nAnd now we're watching a little AL

just say see you know here's a seven spot to get things started daily fantasy leagues all your lighten it up at night\nYou know the one thing that I thought was pretty it was pretty low class was capitals you know they raised their banner\nDidn't mention buried trots once I mean the guy who won the cup and yeah they had issues and they didn't like him and he didn't like them and and and and he left\nBut I mean come on the guy won the Stanley Cup the guy the guy who won the Stanley Cup he was your coach anyone you give them all kinds of credit for doing that happened finishing like yeah that's good and the players loved him I'm Sorry if you had difficulty but you realize you can't just a race him off of what happened oh he'll get his\nName etched on the cop and a giant novelty size

that [noise]\nAh so we'll update you want any more capitals goes there could be four or five more by the time we get done meanwhile\nIn major league baseball so far so good\nFor the Yankees against the Oakland A's right now he's er batting in the top of the sixth inning and the Yankees on the strength of Aaron judges to run Homer in the bottom of the first inning lead this game two to nothing Lewis Severino\nI ... I guess you can say he was successful began you ought to John Miller on it but he only went four innings for the Yankees eighty seven pitches got in trouble a couple of times had to be bailed out but still Aaron Boone feeling okay about himself right now because he picks Severino even though he's not been good the last three months\nOnly makes it through four innings but this is why the Yankees when I got that great bullpen for\nFour years you could say All right you want a little bit more but it's okay because of the ... they have but so far Aaron Boone saying oh my God I can start sweating for at least a little bit because we're into the sixth inning and the Yankees and the to nothing lead Bela ... the second inning of relief right now for New York\nYeah when they had the chance is up in the bullpen and say you know you're playing for one day that's it get you get your guy up in in bridge away I just saw a number of opportunities deep and the couch and a lot of swinging straight through beautiful Ninety seven fat\nPitch and straight down the middle guy he's looking for the ... they drove my big fat ... once I just made contact yeah just make content like her watching yesterday in the NFL wild card with the cubs like just to put the won't play\nWhy why are you swing for a home run every pitch and ... are having a lot of probably left seven men on base which isn't overly so but it is two innings in a row of five in the fourth in fourth and fifth yeah I mean that's that's a lot of us you a chance to get runs in and out but Texas gets out of the six\nEight called strike three so now the AIDS will have three more times it's about one more time through the order at least to try to get to runs on the board for the Yankees but I talked to my dad\nBefore the game yeah I wanted to call them see of course well you got to see a wall is just balls and see if he's got an a\nWe will ask well we haven't been in a while there you go well now it's the playoffs again we

tonight is wired up you know what I'm nervous about somebody that separate I was going to be fine I said I Would see the one I'm worried about now\nSo ready to four or five innings out of him out to be great and you know it's going to happen the chances of somebody else is going to come and you have a three run over to David so we're going to lose as Saddam or I'm not gonna worry till the eighth inning\nPromises so\nFrom one country [noise]\nThe chip Kelly can't coach and this is this is an example of why chip Kelly can't coach and their doom and gloom and all that UCLA is going to be fine

knees like it was going into the dirt and it comes across and I watched by inside part of the plate should have been strike three they apply recalled based on the catcher's like you don't know what's going on I'm not going to strike\nA so this is just after Aaron Judge led off the six the double Aaron Hicks doubled as well what the third and a wild pitch stat and just walk and now Steve Bell boating\nText doubled as well went the third in a while pitch stat and just walk and now Steve Bell\nBony is batting oh sweets anytime I see the forty five for the Yankees I think it's the about voting maybe not so field or a little bit to the ice and we are not sought can we go to Ken felt Senate somehow ...\nBoy does now first and third the Yankees again up ... voice and dying [laughter]\nShut boys and I [laughter] every time I think I just think of this scene\nFrom anaconda where the where they where the the snake just fits amount of the well and he's doing that for Jennifer Lopez show that bad accent the whole time ah sorry I just spoiled anaconda and it's a twenty year old movie that you haven't seen it by our break\nThe the master thespian\nThat ice cube Jennifer Lopez no no I was her name was in that sewing well San ... was a ... I was a big I was I was I didn't like Marisol but I Love ... who didn't a love story where a open\nA uh uh you would think it will be called anaconda with Jennifer Lopez people are going to go see it but I got to go see\nThat already I gotta I gotta go see it does she have the snake around her and she dances and works now I Know it's a different movie after celebrating her mind and I we\nWe have to clone Jennifer Lopez we have to clone that DNA because what you know fifty years in the future is what it's going to be\nEvery woman's gonna look like Jennifer Lopez if we can clone or every single woman will look like Jennifer Lopez and we all when everybody went women when the men when that doesn't that's all we need an interesting life was I was my idea\nThey called me so every guy looks like me and I get headaches for Lopez like three hundred million times you'll be dead at fifty ma I allow\nI put the over under a two and a half is that what you mean it'll present a good ... we have our own decay jury we'd be we'd be Jennifer Jason low oh how about that and just to get you know it'd be great Jennifer Jason low we'd be Gen J. J. J.\nJ. jet jet what I Want to go you know we we would be J. lo I BJ and she'd be the low but about Jennifer love horror Smith jail [laughter]\nI bet you going to say Jennifer loves me about tell us [laughter]\nThe official who'd try any world you're running\nYeah lot of a lot of stuff going on for as much out there right now yes boy does that still second and third now with nobody out in the bottom of the sixth of the Yankees up three nothing\nAnd threatening to blow the soap and not real quick before we get to Joe Madden\nLiaison made this a bullpen game yeah and you can't look back and say oh this didn't work out for them\nIt worked out pretty good right yes you had to run home or that you gave up in the first inning that hundreds to be you know what to Reno came in and gave up one hit and three innings Kelly came in pitched one inning gave up ahead right you get up to her arms and why they think that's that's all you can only got ... we\n... if you got that if the if the AIDS pick somebody to start if the said hey smoke Stewart come start this game you're sixty years old but just start and you've got five things into runs you're feeling pretty good I think that's right you can't say it didn't work because it weren't they got exactly what they need it if the AIDS had a big died\nOf course they would have pitched them but they didn't so they're going to a ball game this worked out now you're getting to a point where when you don't score for six innings and you have your chances eventually the other team was going to break through if you if you keep\nLetting them off the hook and and the age did too on one out in the fourth bases loaded effect and they couldn't break through\nAnd they're striking out a lot of eventually that's gonna come back to haunt you so I I have no problem and what the age that so far it worked and the brewers are going to do it tomorrow night they're doing the bullpen game in game one against the Rockies I mean the ... or you have to do again one against the Rockies are going to have it so I mean that's how it goes\nRight in the new strategy and you'll see it more and more and in this particular case bugs are going to point to the judge all round and try to say that it was a failure liberal offensively they did nothing to support\nThe the status and the strategy we talk about the the two innings leading runners on but even before that\nA lot of pitches in the zone that they're just when you go through it's like step well given the the big homerun it put the ball and play but that's been the mantra Madrid in battle cry for all of this season\nAs we go through but here are at the ... look at the way these games are played the last couple of nights and what the Iraqis had to do to get to where they're going short rivers and they're run over the last couple of weeks the ups and downs in the battle with the cubs\nYou got a lot of bull pen that have been taxed pretty hard it's going to be an interesting first round here\n[noise] ah so again still three nothing a Yankees in the bottom of the sixth inning will keep you updated their dead Carson is going to get you caught up with everything in a couple of minutes\nBut we find out that Joe madness staying on as cubs manager today after the game last night we talked about changes for the cubs next season we wondered if something's gonna happen with Joe mad and then Ken Rosenthal than the athletic\nHad a big column out about how potentially the cubs could turn that pain John Madden or maybe the cubs aren't as in ... with him as they were when they hired him because he likes to do things his own way he doesn't like to just do and put the lineup out the front office wants so potentially they could part ways with him but\nThey decided today the cubs put everything to rest madness coming back for next year and I think that feel Epstein spoke longer today at his press conference then President Trump talked in the last like five months at any processors me not pressure today was like an hour and a half long about Joe ... just kept going between Madden\nAnd they got Joe magnitude that these are his guys they are very loyal to him they love him they love the way that he has allowed them to play the men but at the same time keep things fun and interesting and keep things loosen up Joe ... is a phenomenal\nManager nominal manager he gets one more year with this group that after this year if it's wholesale changes then okay sorry Joe thanks so much he'll have a soft landing somewhere match and\nWind up being a terrific managers someplace else but yeah you got to get more and more you\nPlenty of other places that you can go to we talked about the contract status of all those players last night you do find the podcast and I do and certainly a number of players are with their deals are up in in Nineteen arbitration eligible you've got some older members of that pitching staff\nThere making the decision on whether to bring back coal animals at twenty million dollars seems like a no brainer a the way he pitch for them this year but for ... for Joe Madden you're right he plays by feel oftentimes especially when it's the bullpen as opposed to it was the print out here's the\nThe splits against these hitters in recent history and all those kind of\nMetrics and data points that you go through not to say that he's not doing some of that work but certainly not to the level that we see in other other dug out another call about the cross major league baseball so the players one after another just stood up and said well that any of this speculation is nonsense\nWhere the guys that failed to hit\nRight he doesn't go up to the plate for no and and that's it they're standing up for their guy now it's the question of for the cubs or whether they try to keep the nucleus together including the manager or whether they think they can just plug anybody and Barry Switzer like Twitter at\nHow about a fresco Mike it's

investigation into allegations of sexual assault or misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh\nThe allegation stayed back to when Kavanaugh was in high school and college just six days later the FBI is ready to provide information to senators from its interviews Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell rejected a request for minority leader Charles Schumer\nFor an all senators FBI briefing on the report in a written response McConnell said a briefing would not comply with the rules that govern background investigation reports instead the senators will get to review the report only under restricted conditions\nThat the report they viewed in a secure room and then it not be released to the public\nJudge Kavanaugh has consistently deny the allegations from Dr Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her when both were in high school to other women have come forward with allegations is well\nPresident Trump initially made very little comment about Dr Ford Senate testimony when he made a

Murkowski called President Trump's comments at the fundraiser unacceptable she also said she would take those remarks into account when she considers whether to vote yes on the calendar nomination\nSenate minority leader Charles Schumer was particularly outraged by the president's behavior\nPresident Trump's outright mockery of a sexual assault survivors riddled as it was with false words was reprehensible the nice the office of the presidency and beneath common decency from one person to another\nAppearing at a forum in Washington DC Republican Lindsey Graham said he didn't much like the president's remarks either\nSo President Trump went through a factual and dish and that I didn't particularly like and I was telling knock it off yeah health\nOh okay All right I didn't

I mean look at every single country hate each other out there they're ready to bomb each other for almost nothing but anyway I real quick towards my dad moved to New Jersey I think in my career as a special ed teacher or I start working with kids who didn't have any qualities attributes of characteristics that normal people have\nThis war began to feel like I was blessed\nGeorge ... uh you have to work with these kids who appreciate that that is when I started trying to pay back for just\nBeing normal so I started a prayer life I always had a prayer life when I saw it apparently this is a prerequisite for white had this ... I mean it is for kids that have nothing going from I even had some kids in my classes\nI had these terrible Kansas and I would draw for them and they always they want the joy so I Would give them like coloring books in crayon and they would try so hard to keep those those those are cut that the ...\nIn in the lines are with the numbers more but some of them had says terrible it's your Kansas said they would rule following through on a coloring they withdrew in ...\nWas in school you were at\nWell I was just it was yeah I was a special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happened to be in these classes it was it shows in like that okay\nI but I Will be cleaned it up for them it was nothing to rule because they did that all day long so that didn't mean anything to them er and er so anti but you know where they were learning the skills that they were never going to use or you know there was no really cure for them back then even tell you just really no cure so as a special ed teacher had a lot of time in my hand\nAnd the kids need to two hours for lunch for the teacher said would help feed them uh there's no papers to correct\nThe bigger kids that had in the ... in the room you stumble box as long as I enrolled us you know when you see a tractor trailer pull up to a warehouse and they put out there was a sign role as the boxes on him to shut them down and you know there's a lot of them don't you know yeah so this is me this school supply\nI enrolled lives in my class sideline of the kids I think until it can get a box put it on the island world he was fly down to the next kid they because they would open it up to slide it down to ... put something in and fly down to the next ... tape and you know so that's what they did so I had plenty of time\nSo George I know how to Boston so I had bought into the nightclubs and I believe this is a real prerequisite of what why they steam and came to this house\nWe're doing two jobs John\nYeah I mean then that being a special ed teacher didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this too so um\nYeah so uh uh ... you know people at night and then look at all I Know a lot of um real estate and the people but there was a certain set of people out in the dark side of things these people who are like little wicked you don't have control costs to alcohol or drugs or commit adultery\nLooking for anything they can get their hands on and the good parts in these people were atheist or they went to the coast a little bit\nMake sure I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody and this type of behavior didn't even bother me back there but just over the years I noticed that a lot of these people died from accidents like car accidents overdoses suicide cancers\nAnd ... and I bought it with these people and and I knew them you know but I felt that these people like ships in the night without a runner any within\nTime take 'em to go with the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they died in the state that I thought nobody should die\nThen we're the last rings unusually high yeah\nUnbelievable and so um yeah I just didn't think they knew how to live I mean that's another thing this book is going to the teacher has it teaches you the nose I\nSelf you know knows I mean it's I'm not trying to be somebody else knowing their self means knowing the truth about you you are what they do look at what you'd do analyze what you do then analyze what you believe about yourself you might find a completely different person here\nI mean I had one friend I've tried to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into the ah his name is Chris he was a bartender he worked right alongside he was an atheist and the used to make fun of God used to make fun of you just used to make fun of the Virgin Mary and he smoked and drank every night seven nights a week\nHe didn't feel well they went to visit a doctor and he found you're already had four states can't oh so he couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know going from school my school job in my nights off or we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but you didn't know what\nI Know it had this ... yeah it's about forty isn't it in a few months and he died within a few months but I Would go visit them and I would try to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all and he was even more busier now George because of the diagnosis he had when he died in such a terrible state he died in the state no one should die and\nUh I I felt like helpless form\nNow in my religion George were told that people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky especially\nThis no one to pray for them so I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew and bonded with and they felt they were friends of mine and I would ask God you know don't send these cells to held it unless you go to hell until I finished praying for them no matter how long ago it gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand they still got left an hourglass that's what I was going to do\nAnd I believe now that was the prerequisite of why this human creature was compelled to assess my house and I'll build up mosaic through your piece by piece right down to every single detail\nNo when we can really as you well let me ask you this little job to do this demon follow you to the house basically or was it already there\nAbsolutely not you know the only absolutely not I've never had like a and I've never you know I never had ... invited to speak to here I never had to say on I never use ... or ...\nIf I did speak to here I never had to say on I never use a Wi Fi board or I never\nUsed ... I mean I I Believe that opens the door for a creature like this to come in and I don't think anybody does that because I now I think if you allowed to speak to come in hillbilly you harm I think you're committing him it was worse\nYou know on the other time it had\nNo there's no doubt if you if you invited in each call me\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you did in violence is\nAbsolutely not I've learned a lot from it I learned that it it has a methodology will discuss that too but the only other really other time [noise] ah well you know I thought that I worked in that's why I wrote that book anyhow that at selling book and if you're interested in any of that though I had some funny stories about the rapid Chris\nBrown that's that's a topic we don't touch [laughter] we do what we we don't we don't get into that topic oh okay [laughter] so anyway\nPeople probably why it was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\n[noise] [noise] [noise] yeah okay so the only other time that I ever knew about a person who encountered the demon that I Believe was because my brother my brother Paul he we had just a rare a blood\nDisease that runs in the family and my my dad was unfortunate to get it and it killed them very early in the sixties had a heart attack and died at the\nSame day God rather was unfortunate for you to get it are you OK yet it seems to me are you are right\nYet what with the ... disease\nOh I haven't I I've been checked with that yeah oh yeah the doctor who well let me tell you what happened to pull you and I'll tell you felt Pauli breaks up and they had the same symptoms my dad had pets they doubt nine one one they can they come and they take 'em to the hospital and at the hospital he died on hospital bed\nAnd when I went to visit him later on he said which on it you know and I heard that he died on hospital but that's what the doctors told me sit down and when I died on a hospital bed I left my body is that I left my body and I watched that doctors frantically and then\nThey're ugly find the getting back to life again if they'd be late and not uncommon Udall\nAnd yeah and uh alarms going off and said that when I talk about that\n... mentioned a spiritual dimension he stepped into that for him and he was still he still thought he was in the hospital room because he could see what was going on with his body ... isn't that high but it will\nHe said to me it\n... and ... and then there was a dark side of that room he said and demons came from a small team is not like big ones like three foot four foot tall he came to me\nAnd it was grabbed me and was starting to pull me into that dark area of the room which I which I say is the because they are they overlap sometimes and I believe that's where we overlap him at fifth dimension and ah they were dragging him into that talks romance and I finally got back to life he was able to get back into his body\nAnd he said to me Johnny why didn't even though I'm not really that big of a person that you know I don't understand ...\nWhy would even come man I was like oh I really\nDon't know uh I don't know if anybody but no I Know that you know all of us are raised the same way like I said you know got a religion ... confirmed and our religion he was too but he dropped out and okay ... to go to church anymore okay he met a woman he didn't really Mary ... okay you know again I tell them you know\nYou got kids that you never gave them a religion could anyone of your kids even ... one\nOne prayer maybe it's like I'm not\nWell I well I don't know maybe get a big kick and yet but sometimes when you when you pass into that they mentioned you know that\nThat we were at overlap somehow on John we're at a break but we'll come back and talk on\nThe coast

geo ... deep river bowls and you're listening to coach the goes\n\nAnd we'll come back to coast to coast George George with you it's the double has approached you were going to take calls next door were withdrawn you can join much pick up the story about your brother your your brother at the time what happened\nYeah so I'm just to recap uh is probably the only other time I've ever had an account with uh\nI mean this is probably the only other time I've ever had an encounter with a double that I Believe that you know I Know my brother wouldn't lie to me about it and he wasn't really a\nBad person I mean okay he left his religion like we talked and then he he lived with whom he didn't get married to him and he raises kids didn't have a religion so uh you know I felt that may be but he said you know to me ... you know when I went I died on that hospitals that I left my body I watched the doctors frantically trying to\nGet me back to life again with the fifty ladies and the nurses running back and forth sticking things my aunt and you could hear the alarms going off but he was in that like that dimension that oval laughing to mention I guess\nAnd he said there was like a duck part of that room which probably never was there when he was in the hospital but when he was in that oval laughing to mention that he should demons came for him and he actually what why the demons ... man I was like ... [laughter] I really don't know why why you know I just don't know how to explain that either\nI I never had this problem I never had a problem like this before uh before I had this adverse and in my house\nBut um I Wonder about his lap and he's a uh like he is completely one hundred and eighty degrees turn man he's a very religious man now\nWe were you scared the heck on moving\nA can of ... but it believe it I mean to actually\nBe dying dying and then leave your body that's something you\nKnow she's gonna remember his ya may still young guys only like forty years old he's got a lot of life ahead of him but he now has a very religious person\nBut uh he encountered this statement but the one that I encountered was a very different like I tell you the the ...\nYou know what was the first episode you John de ... demon showed up what\nThey all K so uh let me explain to I live in New Jersey like the middle of New Jersey right in the ... area I have a house that sounded like an acre of\nProp ... Hoboken or you\nAlthough pretty far from there is a good hour though oh are you from Hoboken\nEnough no she's not sure what to do [laughter]\nOh yeah [laughter] well I was born in Brooklyn that's not that far from home\nBut now I live in New Jersey so oh yeah so I just wanted to say oh because I had a best selling book I was able to retire and I didn't have to work with those I Love those kids believe me but I ... I I stopped working but may not have to work at ... I guess you just stop\nAnd I stopped a bartending at night and I love tending at night but I but I stopped but I still know about those people and they still pray for those people and that's a big ... big prerequisite of why I had to separate Russia so now I'm In New Jersey now so I'm doing fine you I have a very uh elaborate for life\nUh I I retired from my by my job as a special ed teacher retires that not working at night and I miss those people a lot too\nAnd I have this nice house and it sounded like ... okay\nAbout a hundred and fifty feet from the street is on a hill you come into the house and yet the the garages are under the house and you fill your car into the left and you go into the garage his sentence the back door the as it comes to the garage and in between the garage is\nGeorge and the basement is this big indoor\nAnd other ... I had three boys here growing up and I think a little bit bigger they wanted to a little more room so I had the basements finished and uh I cut it in half and I had an apartment building down near so my first why that's all he wants to more space he moved down there yeah you have your own interest\nYou pull your own spawn come and go as you want so I guess\nYeah if it was nice so then he goes to college and he moves out second boy wants to parliament and so he takes it he goes to college and moved out my third boy he wants an apartment he ... he was in there he he was he had this whole time so he uh when I had\nThe he was smart one free rent [laughter]\nYeah well I didn't mind you I Believe we have this big house and then like when he he he went to college he moves out but he got a job and then he said you know can I moved back home I just want to start my own business as they come back home because I mean we got it's a big house and my wife has this empty\nNest syndrome sure you know what I mean so and I like having to a company to you know these somebody to come upstairs and have dinner with you once in a while when when you saw him he wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then you've got a great orphanage took his but anyway he's here the whole time so that\nThe upstairs and so in the basement you come in that that I ... off to the kitchen was a big kitchen the okay if you're in the kitchen\nYou can almost hear that door open and close and then next to the kitchen is living ... most of the time George and uh that's what I like I I go to the gym in the morning to meditate\nThan in the afternoon I meditating at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for life and I took I did get back to my artwork because I Am good at it as just a small little towns that God gave me you know so uh I'm doing that and everything's fine to it for years and I've been praying for the last cells\nThat I felt will last cells every day\nFor years and I like I said I'm going to do that until whatever time I have left here so everything's fine\nOh and then a bank yeah\nSo then yeah I'm sitting I'm sitting in the liver and that I enjoyed downstairs I'm by myself and I hear that I enjoy ... slam lucky you normally wouldn't even hear it from in the living room\nRight here it's like it never was slammed before and I'm thinking to myself\nAnd you know somebody's open\nOh absolutely you in the house at twenty five years you know every noise in the house you know so I'm thinking to myself what was it was I don't think my wife could even if she came home and sleep like I don't even think she gave slam that do that hard and maybe my son can I don't know why he would do that lets you had a car accident or with a girlfriend broke up for them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that so I get up\nI go to the kitchen I looked down stairs usually when somebody comes in down near the puts up with in a lifetime so still talk to you so I go into\nThe largest I have a a surveillance system here right they look into the cameras and they roll back the cameras ten Fifteen twenty minutes I said nobody was on the property I look at the cameras that face the garage doors nobody nobody open those garage doors and look at the camera the faces that during the back nobody went through the backdoor\nAnd or what you want you distinctly hurdle\nOh absolutely slam no like slant I didn't know at at the time so that we can discuss this creature was using his methodology on me and had a message wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for social call that wasn't passed them through with and I was playing that and the minute so I go I look in the cameras nobody was on a property in the basement I got\nI got bars on windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fire in a house seat this on lock them and jumped out do so I Know he couldn't ... anybody if somebody was trust me I think I couldn't see them so I go I turn the lights on in the basement I go down to the basement\nThat looking everywhere\nAnd ... you're pretty convince you think somebody's in the house don't you\nOh absolutely no actually but I the only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the south twenty five years I feel if menacing sinister I'm In is\nLike the only word to describe this like evil like an\nEvil trust then I

the devil our final segment of calls you on Long Island New York's with us Hey Joe go ahead\nYeah Hi John uh that sounds like the description of the devil you are that great issue a ... is almost similar to something in the book of revelation but I Want to a rope eight proverbs chapter seven to this uh\nIt's it's really using its it's talking about who won an improper chapter seven it's talking about a ... woman uh it says make wisdom your tense woman and understanding wisdom and understanding and white\nThe wisdom on the tablet of your haul marked the wisdom on a tablet of the hard\nNow to me this is the anecdote for the mark of the devil and\nThe book of revelation all the Big East you know the six six six the anecdote for this is the wisdom of the lord\nA and it goes on to describe a strange woman now the strange woman is not really a strange woman it's just a metaphor for temptation and the devil and it talks about this woman said to sing men and the night\nWhile her husband is away and a enticing\nThem and then forcing them what flattering lip [noise] so I think this is the vice a ... of the devil where\nIn this show lore is like an enticement the devil is not gonna is gonna address the thing up as where it's not obvious that it's the devil and that as you get lord then\nIt changes to a fourth play you're kind of in the jaw duck\nYeah yeah so only later on just the devil revealed the true intentions what's going to really happen and forces that upon you so if you look at the\nBook of proverbs that directly were late store I think what you're saying and I wonder John if your previous work in the bars somehow you picked up\nSome of these demonic entities\nWell that's an interesting possibility could that have happened to your other ... your job as a bartender\nThat's possible I mean who who who really knows I mean that's part of it that was good advice to keep the heat that was with them in your heart you know what I mean they keep the first thing in your mind\nOr what but what you were talking about and that yeah that that that's good advice and and uh who knows if they came out of it could be there I mean that could exist there and you know and like I said there was wicked people there and some of them went to the cold light of ... and uh hey who knows\nThem into their John where do you get your book between love and hate\nYeah if you're in love and hate you go to John ... is a key a N. dot com\nOr to three hundred and fifty paid a a book I pressed the button that we get it ah ah you know ... it you'll understand your life purpose and it will transform your life ah ... the ... you know if you really want to give you the gift of the other end of the unknown on their\n... dot com or there's so many\nSo many things in this book if they if you really want to know know that I sell if you had to know that I felt as many of the spiritual stories in this book that people cry when they read them\nWell I'm just glad you got rid of the devil\nHard like Edgar Allan Poe\nTrue nervous very very dreadfully nervous I had been in them but why would you say that I Am mad the disease had sharp and my sense is not destroyed not

never wrong me he had never given me an insult for his gold I had no desire I think it was Oh yes it was this\nHe had the vulture\nHe'll be why was assume over it\nWhenever it fell upon the my blood rent cold and so my degrees very gradually I made up my mind to take the life of the old man and such rude myself of the eyes forever now this is the point you fancy me mad Mad Men no nothing\nBut you should have seen me you should have seen how wisely I proceeded with what caution was once\nShould have seen me you should have seen how wisely I proceeded with what caution with what foresight with what the simulation I went to work\nI was never kinder to the old man during the week before I killed him at every night about midnight\nI turn the lack of his door and opened it owes so gently and then when I had made an opening sufficient for my head\nI put in a dark lantern\nAll close close that no light show now\nAnd then I rushed in my head or you would have left to see how ... I trusted in\nI moved slowly very very slowly so that I might not disturb the old man sleep\nIt took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed oh what a madman events so why is this and then when my head was well in the room\nI ended that lantern cautiously also cautiously cautiously for the hinges creek [noise]\nI ended it just so much that a single than race fell upon the vulture by and this I did for seven long nights every night just at midnight but I found the ... always closed and so it was impossible to do the work\nFort was not the old man who ... me but his evil lie and every morning when the day broke I went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name and hardy tone and inquiring how he has passed the night\nSo you see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every night just at twelve I looked in upon him while he slept\nUpon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious and opening the door a watches emitted hand moves more quickly than did mine never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers of mice aghast city I could scarcely contain my feelings of trying\nTo think that there I was opening the door and little by little and he not even to dream of my secret deeds your thoughts\nAre fairly chuckled at the idea and perhaps he heard me for a moved on the bed certainly as if startled\nNow you may think that I drew back but you know\nIs a room was this black is pitch with a thick darkness for the shutters were closed fasten through fear of robbers and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door and I kept pushing it on steadily steadily\nI had my head in and was about to open that lantern when my phone's slipped upon the tin fascinating and the old man sprang up in bed crying out who's there\nI kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour I did not move a muscle and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down\nHe was still sitting up in the bed listening just as I have done night after night Harkin into the death watches and the wall presently I heard a slight grown then I knew what was the grownup mortal her it\nWas not a grown the pain or of grief it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with all I knew the sound well many a night just at midnight when the old world slapped it was wild up from my own ... deepening\nWith the dreadful echo the terrors that distracted me I say I knew it well I knew what the old man felt pity him although I chuckled at heart I knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when he turned into bed his fears had been ever since growing upon him\nHe had been trying to fancy them cause less but could not he had been saying to himself is nothing but the wind in the chimney it is only a mouse crossing the floor or it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp\nYes he had been trying to comfort himself with all these ... physicians but he had found old and vain all in vain because death in approaching him it's stocked with his black shadow before him and enveloped the victim\nAnd it was the ... full influence of the ... perceive shadow that caused him to feel although he neither ... nor heard to feel the presence of my head within the room\nMm our military service members volunteer to protect us in the most dangerous places around the world they step up and when\nI report is out South Carolina police shot I'm Elliot princess going house to receive the FBI supplemental investigation on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and own senators will receive that same report and just a few hours from now when the Kenyan report\nThe FBI was given one week to conduct an investigation into allegations of sexual assault or misconduct by cabin on\nThe allegations date back to when Kavanaugh was in high school and college and Kavanaugh strongly denies them the senators will get to review the report under restricted conditions that the report they viewed in a secure room and that it's not the relates to the public option any bomb shells from the FBI investigation and initial vote on Kavanaugh's nomination\nApps and any bomb shells from the FBI investigation an initial vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court is set for friday and the final though could come as early as this weekend Lindy Kenya ... washing\nFederal judge in San Francisco issued a temporary injunction Wednesday the bars but that the president ... around the sci fi older ... around the ... temple in medicine when we were talking\nTo their intent hideous ministry as many people aren't ... this mean to the program I races are stopped taking it all the line at one for all of a\nSort of good as it did it already in ...

I met a lot of really beautiful people from Arkansas\nAnd it always strikes me as somebody who is a free wing neither blue or red and my ah in my tribal political identity that seems to be polarizing the country as your report said worse than ever before\nUm but when I actually go out on my blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people\nWho and I listen to them and I can see so much potential if\nPeople would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news\nAnd just talk to each other\nThey don't talk anymore John ... problem nobody they screen they argue but I've actually\nFound the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive [noise]\nAnd I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state and uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together already a this forecast which\nIs the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned and uh\nI was just reading it again after many months and I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put in is\nA that was basically is happening is a a\nLevel of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planets in astrology and\nPolitical strategy their plate right now one is a is you're honest and just\nRecently come into tours and then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn is Saturn\nStory short it's a struggle Iran is finds itself in the story in fine which means it's dealing more with focusing\nIt's finds itself in the ... sign which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations\nWhereas the the earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it favors the establishment more than it favors\nThose who are resisting the establishment um because Iran has into horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least comfortable flying\nThat it's translating through now\nLast time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it did to ... major changes in political astrology it brought the German Third Reich into being under adult Hitler\nAnd it also uh aged Franklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to destabilize established banking ideas and things that were restructured that\nIn in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of time in history [noise]\nUh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms have slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms and Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the fuel all the and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth is almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is their Iran is if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and it is a it is expressing itself with great passion\nAnd unpredictability but its negative it's about destroying from getting the house back\nGetting the sent back but for what it's not really define itself\nIs what we know what the resistance is against when I hear it all every day here because I live in the very heart of it here [noise] uh but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if and if you follow this pattern with much more energy to it than it happened before because I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said\nOh a Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland\n... five hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later I said well no it will happen because\nIf you're ... anybody but Bill Clinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except you're on tearing down and then\nAnd it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before\nAt least at least and and it's being I mean it's being the people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media avenues that it is really quite\nThis classic um Iran is\nConfusion and its fall and tourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud earth science it's a muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come\nAnd save you from your cells and you know I have been how long long time first with art and then with the huge origin I've been\nTalking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it\nIs really a hand now it's um it's not going to be when I look at when I look at the um situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is going retrograde its back going backwards in in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around or just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if if red voters red American voters\nGo to the polls early especially in a lot of the areas which will\nBe in the early times oh hold on for a second John already at the break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this will get into some of his top ten forecast for this year she how close he's coming and uh also march twenty third you live in Everett, Washington\nJust circle that date for two thousand Nineteen will tell you about that later to [noise]\nCheck out that's blind or dot com lines T. E. R. dot com\nTwelve thirty AM and you're listening to coast to coast [noise]\n\n\nBy the way we used ... dot com for some home projects and they are really good you just put in what you're looking for and you get a number of different ... names and the other old qualified picked the one you want a\nSuperb workers by the way John ... with us as we talk about prophecy predictions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many have come true already\n[noise] well uh there have been a number of the more the most shocking and been my my eighth prophecy what I did is is basically short um chapters that takes a theme and then looks at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of the ten real quick\nWell yes they they were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration\nUh definitely things have intensified that way the second prophecy was a you're honest in the last chance sec style that looked at a play between your honest and Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground but that petered out by\nMay ... and that seemed to happen in a way where there was also the third prophecy\nWill Trump be impeached or not in twenty eight team and that looks like that's definitely happening [noise]\nUh I've always said that both candidates and twenty sixteen were afflicted astrological we both had the danger if not if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this but that they could leave in scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January [noise] so\nAh it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before\nThat the first half of the day goes to the red states and the red voters said get out early they vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house of representatives\nWill uh see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon\nSo it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see at ... eleventh hour or close to the polls are turned around so with that\nUm you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I Would simply say about President Trump that if he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president\nOh what's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and try and taking\nNotes yeah taking of it's like I mean literally ... family members and other things are are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise] um every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and tourists\nUh they're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the little blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until six here if he's a two term president\nAccording to my interpretation of the strategy they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge also the other thing that uh once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote I said\n... million strong you know I said\nTen months before Trump was elected I said the the big upset could happen through their\nUm and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving it's almost like it's it's the musical chairs that we've had before where\nIt's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats at the same number of seats just switching back and forth and in that there's not enough\nTo create any significant legislative advance so it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before\nAnd it's almost unbearable now\n[noise] well it's I I hate to say it to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis it's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states\nAnd the world is just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually\nThink of a way to get out of the margins it's kind of have to get much worse and frankly astrology a saying that they're not going to see a a tide shift until the middle of the next decade or we're we're we're just\nI'd shift until the middle of the next decade and we're we're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail yet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen was kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh and all the small fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh in my article send that Kevin I Would be picked that um [noise] I\nI think people are stabbed rushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not saying they should be looking at according to their needs\nIt if you look a cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be weighed it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme\nCourt no I I don't think so why a lot but I tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planet so next year\nAnd into twenty twenty these these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment will to power\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see was creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging Miami which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's or sign and\nGo into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened and so it's possible that after\nTwenty twenty with the American people or or the working people people started really starting to get riled about situation a there will be basically in a completely corporate elite control the United states\nAnd so that's that's my call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more a [laughter]\nA recently were on the History Channel reality show

acknowledged which is of course not illegal and that he in turn may have helped them hide some of their wealth later on almost a a I guess paying them back if you will did you go into further detail about what the times says\nHe I think that's that's a pretty good summary um of course President Trump for years it said that he had gotten that small billion dollar loan\nOr from his father to really start out and get as good as going and with the times reported was at least in twenty Eighteen dollars that amount was really much more like four hundred and ten million dollars at least what he had received for his father a throughout much of his life\nThis started off when he was three years old he he began making about two hundred thousand dollars a year\nA and his his father that eventually

there\nIt has an impact of the little question about that although again if you've ever followed it that closely I mean even his initial claim that uh he only got his start with a million dollar loan from his father yeah I remember the first million dollars my father gave me the jury helped out a lot\nI mean for most of his living that that's a joke obviously okay so we had a lot of help fine ah there's no question about that I mean I I never cared much one way or the other people's self made or not and I know apparently a lot of people do but I mean that to me is\nIs right down there at the

there for a candidates running for more than three and then there's two for the ... um so they make sure you get out and vote or talk to these people\nAnd I have you guys are going to have a replay of the\nIt's going to be up on a A R a check out our Facebook page and as Jake was there he was a recording so I Hope you comb your hair before your and by the way those those that don't O'Brian was the time keeper time keeper and boy what a job if you had a pretty easy job last night they would I Do know that anybody ever went over a liquid once\nAt one time during the introduction I think I had to kind of had to tell somebody hung out of that and then other than that most of the questions being the last minute so I didn't even have to hold up to one minute dealing we're a\nGood about getting their points pretty quickly\nAnd there wasn't a holiday the controversial questions where there was ever or something that ...\nYeah I didn't do I think this is the first time that we've done a a debate that has been at least\nOne one ... one one said something that they want to hear the other one that I have a bottle that\nI'm an end a school board and a nine eight or nine nine candidates they're seven I'm there last night\nAnd nine of them told of a school board they had four is it three or four is up for a lecture and I should look before I came here there was two incumbents there\nLast night and then to step to and I think that who's that who's in ... and I'm\nDrawing a blank on who would have been the other one me too but anyway I'm good to see a lot of interest in this\nMess and there was a I thought the room was pretty full I didn't get a chance because my backwards to the audience but I think ah it was pretty much standing room only wasn't it\nA there was a couple of seats right up in the front and no I don't think anybody one is that right oh do you like as I say I'm rod Raul there was cameras and stuff but Jake had cameras set up so yeah we we he recorded that ah we're going to put that on our Facebook page ... a radio Facebook page scifri Facebook\nAnd I understand that technology kinda cut off to last a little bit of it but I guess he's still got audio to the right\nWay on that we have the video until the very end and then that's how ... how much basic battery he had ready to go in and out of storage space I think it allows ... hours a store okay and then went a little bit longer because of some of the extra questions I doubt that still on the audio part he was going to have on the tail end so\nBecause this year and and uh I think we've had a couple of questions for this year we had a couple of more questions that were asked at the end and and people stuck around so you could bring them back out because I think the school board had a question\nHad to create a holiday um\nIf the school board had a question everybody had to create a holiday\nUh there were the only ones that don't have at least one question\nAll right so that was that was kind of nice to see to granted nice job last night yes and held held it together and did a good job of literally ... funny liners in there and says well he's when it came up with the question though is that our our\nQuestion that a guy who's going to repeat you had to repeat the question the candidate who was a school board question\nIt's nice when and and the and again just just wrapping up a nice to see the interest there um I Know there's there's nobody running for mayor but but the other positions there are people running and it's nice you know they can that interest in a you know and uh it was tough\nTo throw yourself into the political re nowadays keepers look at the what's going on right now with the Supreme Court nominees\nAnd uh it's time consuming you know oh I don't know how much time it takes a for your community but a with a a three hundred million dollar project and the things that are happening at a kind of result of it because we were going to have to grow to meet the needs that uh some of the businesses demands not only that one but the rest of them and\nIt takes some time\nAnd again that uh that debate if you get miss it uh you can watch it on our Facebook page tier of radio Facebook page and watch the whole thing their parts or whatever you want to move forward backwards just go ahead and check it out there are again you get a good chance to really get a chance to see and hear from the candidates\nAre in their home or with us it's eleven twenty four hours in line today Katie arrest sixty one twelve thirty damned you have any questions

I think that it brought that up so we brought up in the past uh unfortunately with the quiet zones or you have to put it a median and\nAnd the distance with comedians and the distance from the turn lanes and stuff um would either hamper business from having a access to their business a\nBecause it turn land because you have to I Can't remember and we feed it is and then even having some difficulties steak in a in a ... with a believes Davis avenue that runs north and south on the east side of the tracks here I'm\nIn uh the intermediate to make sure that you can drive in between the crossings arms and stuff or just won't allow it and uh we've done research on it the the railroad helped us and the DOT has been on it and everything else it's just not something that will work out\nBecause of logistics because they don't have the U.S may still have the the room\nRomeo and things like this call because of the stop lights and everything with the next street next to it on the\nThird street started out in front of the quiet zone is there has to be so so much ...\nThey have to make that a a secure area with crossings arm and also what to protest transit pedestrian arms and everything else okay and then as a driver you cannot there has to be the curb down the center of a\nA lane so you can't drive you would have to have an obstacle to drive around to try to get around the arms oh okay I made a separation barrier in between there\nWas a little complicated has very complicated and then we don't really have what it takes to get it that we\nDid a a changed uh put her request and for the signal arms on a street\nIf you'd notice or that they would go down and start doing and the way down but they'd remain dang as they were down and that got very annoying for the\nUh uh area up their neighborhood a 'cause he's ding ding ding steady right well if there is a train there you don't even know digging anymore the flashing lights are still there and stuff um so we requested to have them\nShut off ... as they do get out\nThe ups and they're starting to function so hopefully that helps the area up there but uh there's really nothing we can do about a ... of the horns\nOkay All right thanks for the question and appreciate it then it then the city has looked into it then so that that's something that\nHas been brought up before I had like sixty one twelve thirty ... a kind of a lemon twenty seven year of news headlines in just a moment I'm I wanted to because tonight we're talking snow for the first time\nI'm the at the council looked at calendar parking you looked at tried doing some adjusting and in the end they learn that wasn't really much changed\nWas arrow there really wasn't much of any or a little change would downtown I Believe there was but uh other than that uh we left to the date\nTo some people are the counter parking which goes November fifteenth yeah to\nA ... volt fifteenth march April March fifteenth I Believe is march fifteenth it's in the spring I think it's march in it yeah I think it's mark Kay and\nNovember ... October November November's November next October is always at least not right on the November to march\nUm is when counter parking exist and they want to keep it basically the same name as it has been in the past which is a is it with\nThe exception of downtown K they cannot park on um the the downtown city streets against do perk on\nUm which would be highly fifty nine and thirty two cutting through they still work on them but all the other streets need to be a vehicles need to be removed and parked in the parking lots and that's just for the guy so they can get out and\nClean in front of the business owners is through the overnight hours and you can work anywhere downtown yeah that's what it is okay you know his yeah but the ... after ... park and the designated spots within the parking lots that we have to pay in in parking lots okay but not on the streets I'm ... ... what do you have much problem with parking downtown last year\nWe did um and the problem is is if they get down there and they plow while outrages in there for the whole business day and yet it makes a problem so this is one way of trying to make everybody happy um\nAs far as a business owner\nNavy downtown is that it's tough because there's no obvious there's nowhere for the snow to go because of emulate and it goes onto the sidewalk and our money on the first day\nGoes to the sidewalk right and then depending on when ... when it stopped snowing possibly the next night to come in with a cruise and take it out in the early morning in role at all to the center and blow it in a truck and get\nRid of it yeah okay so they'd they'd that's in an ideal situation which they did is they plough it next dating trying to get to it\nTwo years ago we used to do it just on Wednesdays\nRight and you made that change because she was so much problem downtown that\nWe've had it had issues and not to getting a specific issues we resolved all other measures by getting rid of it right away\nGet rid of this now getting rid of the problems\nThat ray from so a with a figure it out there that really take much more overtime and uh we made people unhappy or so on and and\nTo make the downtown better I mean we were trying to do best we can right now just to make our downtown because there was another topic last night is downtown revitalization\nThe community development advisory board is that's what that's what our task is ... and there's an incentive peers have any kind of tax incentives um it depending on what you're doing um you know there's some tips but then only covers certain things um\nTax rates on I I I don't really care for them because uh you're putting a business that's coming into town to business as trainers survivor already there right so you're you're given somebody in the upper hand so like any\nKept the city you have you have water or electricity and water she were electricity can you give 'em for years something like\nThat of that can you how could that that was huge thing traveling now you're going to set a precedent and everybody that comes into new you're going to get the newness has\nNow and now if it's a new business you're going to close the other business downtown and make an unfair advantage as as personal need water and sewer if\nIt's just an incentive here you go you don't have to worry about the water shore and electric bill for a couple of months or whatever you know what are the city decides not just to get your business going but I don't think that's unfair to the other business as\nWell if a and go talk to someone the other businesses downtown and see if some of them really want\nDoes add up business downtown and metal and I've said in the business downtown want to see another business downtown oh they definitely do okay so wouldn't they say that okay I'm good with a if you're going to give them a couple of free months to get going\nThat'll get somebody in there and now that revitalize as my downtown area I get more people walking in my door it could be I'm just thrown out I was mayor and throwing it back\nUh is that what you do up in your town\nYeah we've we were going to where we've given are giving two years free water and short 'cause that's all we have a for us we don't have an electric like you guys have here we just have water and sewer so we're getting two years free water and sewer for anybody wants to move in a to the new lots we have for new lots we just put the infrastructure in\nWater ... Center for residential cat you know yeah and ... says\nThe same thing with would try to push the same thing I enter\nBuilding not a lot of the city can do as far as ... and you know that that's what I mean they're they're really you know that's why we have the between the development\nBoard you know and that's what they're four and a will help any business with any grand a applications they may be able to pursue or whatever his letter support\nAnd and they let me ask you this because I've asked you every time you come in and is there anybody close to getting in that will JC penny building\nA last time I heard yes there was somebody getting closer or\nDo you know what the holdup is is is it cost is it that things with the building I Need to be changed\nThe honest with you oh I hear is the thirty thousand foot view so I don't know what the individual discussions are and how there are but the hang up his on it I just know that ah [noise] it's a should be occupied the near future\nLet's hope so let's hope so um\nAgain like I said there are some buildings that are that have business and that's a bonus that's a plus let's let's let's keep looking at that I Want to come back to the mayor Brian home or with a six day one twelve thirty the snow emergency K now this is something fairly new I think for the verb falls isn't it\nYes it is a lot of other communities do it um\nIf you look or some communities do it on just about every ... they'll say it's a snow emergency and make sure you don't work on these routes and have signs up for ... what first off what is a snow emergency um well as ... as we have outlined it is a snow emergency would be\nA small fall that I consider will be the start of the winter season than that we are going to have to remove snow prior to that date them no member fifteenth so that if if the temperatures were\nEyes are in their twenties right now and we're looking at this possibility of three inches plus coming mhm I might decide to bumped is a winner um the winter a parking ordinance into effect earlier\nWould it'd be then just for that snow emergency just for ...\nLike as long as that snow and stuck around I I might keep it just for that or I might just uh just leave it on and just started\nTo feel the actual calendar or then basically getting account of our ... okay so in do\nYou have guidelines as far\nAs how ... how many inches of snow\nI Want to work with the the you know all of the I definitely got the national weather service availability of finding out for them but it's going to go off a lot of the uh expectations and stuff from their expertise my mind as a weatherman 'cause I didn't stay at a Holiday Inn express or\n[laughter] or\nI Do know if I look outside and see if it's snowing it's snowing here but I Would like to have this announced ahead of time too so I'm gonna have to go off of what Greg ... over at the national weather service says say hey\nSo the when when you call that like I Would try and like oh it's do wild like knowing\nI'd like to make a call before it even comes if we're looking at a big blizzard coming on or let's say the first in November for example\nWhen we got a big blizzard coming and grapes as a mayor you're gonna get six to twelve inches of snow this weekend around and he's telling me this already on the twenty eighth of October ... I'm going to be on calling you up and calling everybody\nRadio station in a newspaper or wherever it can get it later and that's where you are I'm\nGetting the information out a radio social media et cetera\nYeah exactly and just get a note saying I have called a snow emergency and calendar parking will be in effect on this date\nAlright a six day I went to all thirty is the number um talk a little bit more about that I Want to know the exact specific as far as ... when you have to do so they you know as far as a residence of town when a storm or does she has called but I Do have a caller on the lines let's go to the phone call or good morning Iran open minded as mayor home or go ahead\nGo smoothly former mayor [noise] this is former mayor yeah you're talking about recycling yes so I wanted to clarify what's going on Elena ...\nWe're likely yes\nSo I wanted to clarify what's going on Alabama's expanding their uh that ... ... ... ... it belongs to the Kmart store which belongs Alabama right now\nAnd what they're doing is they're going to put a fence around there and they're going to put more a stop selling their so fast that we could move it can be under which we took him out of there and want her plan is or the winter was just out one fight but that will be at a huge goals\nAnd then um you know we will evaluate the I'll probably get some people uh one guy is already called me but he looked like him at his place it's all about what kind of figure out where we are going to set up the next like\nI'm probably not till next spring then not till next spring\nOkay but the one who goes will remain there\nBut one of your goals or remain there up with a bunch more a card or you know and if there becomes a problem uh yeah we're will obviously a change right away I mean technically I plan on getting them out next spring but for some issues we can certainly look or one\nOkay alright super thanks for the call me every eight and it's good to have you back on the radio [laughter] luckily gave a mayor we can have a mayor round table if you came in\nA sari [laughter]\nOkay\nMaybe not thanks Dave for him but you got any but my or maybe not so easy to do mayor roundtable resident former mayor has come in and and passionate all kinds of ideas on the air\nThere's at least for a no they are in town here still OK well beaver Dale I'm Jim Jim Jim dang it myself and yourself and current in in his four oh gee that's good [noise] okay\nAll right um where where they owe ... or so people I'm ... here's the thing they do you call this number to see that what do people or the falls need to know what do we need to do\nIs just know that uh what you need to know on your calendar parking days okay you're you're on a boulevard or St ... avenue\nOkay so that doesn't mean when you say snow emergency doesn't mean every are both both a street salmon is it means whenever data's that's that would count a parking good that's the way you go\nAnd I do not having enough to pull that out and I can't remember either so I'm I don't have it with me and I know I really didn't know this might not ... I Would no I Know I I should do this by now are having an art history and she had a councilman Steve nerve roads are out there maybe call in there's\nNo he can't because he's running around the problem is I Can't believe I'm here\nTo mark ... said if the if you're listening or can you call me\nOr text us six they went to all dirty um it's avenues one day and and uh so okay but that's that's the main thing that I wanted to know is the fact that if you call somewhere to see people need to know that that means a counter parking goes into effect immediately from that date from\nThe day that I and I wanted to or from the day that I say it's going to affect All right um [noise]\nIs it would it be at the end to say at that march fifteenth of march ... ban that march thirtieth we get another one\nAnd if we know that it's been a tough winter and we've had tough winters around here that last into April no doubt and just by going by that you somewhat you can see how the trend is going and uh I can extend that if I needed okay okay I'm not going to reinstate it only use or extend it\nOr it's going to go away it's not going to be running things where it's going to go away and and I want to re started again\nBut what happens okay a dead ends march fifteenth and knew whether all of a say you know our weather aid solves and now it's sunny and fifty and then the April April first we get that we've had Ninety seven blizzard well\nWe we I kind of had that discussion and if it's been nice like that beforehand and stuff you can kind of check by the trends and we just feel that it would be a short lived a thing it it wouldn't be like it would be in a in a early in the year when we get that ISIS days from now and November all the way through\nSo you wouldn't be so concerned about ... ... as\nThe sun is high in the air um even if it comes on a sunny day Ed Burns off to the streets and stuff so I'm not quite as concerned then at the end of the year it might be ah the occasional blizzard we just went after deal with it for a couple of days but it's nothing like it is at the start of the year that we are going to consider oh yeah that's true that's true\nThirty six AM twelve thirty Katie Iran the forever falls Minnesota it's news time good afternoon\nA split decision cyber charges ... more Republicans certainly FDR report on Brett Kavanaugh kickback clean Democrats say it's incomplete and a new storm a rupture going on but I should've Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court [noise]\nMarching in the nation's capital and planning to march on Capitol building majority leader Mitch McConnell says lawmakers have been under siege\nScared about all these people rampaging through all the costs are members at airports come into their homes are trying to intimidate the sort of ended a ...

that the third or three yeah yeah and I want to mention right away\nWe didn't on purposely stack and the the questions at any certain direction but the entire rooms started laughing\nAt one question [laughter] the entire ... the entire world you could just feel that it was tangible they're all like when's it gonna ... gonna happen I even saw cars pulling up to the side of the road [laughter]\nThat window when this question was asked and would you like to ask the question of have it in front of me but I didn't paraphrase it get\nIt a been a lot of talk about the pool versus splash park in the fervor fall and the rumor opted\nJust any what\nCandidates do who are asking who were answering the question yeah I felt this was coming [laughter]\nIt was funny though I mean actually lighten up the mood considering that there's been a lot of emotion over that question actually a little a little humor was kinda\nNice yeah and I thought I thought the answer to well I mean you could tell that they all wanted to say yes I'm In favor of it yeah they all wanted to say that however\nThey said yes I'm not opposed to it however the cost factor and it doesn't make any sense to do say splash pad in an area where you know not that warm that often and it's such a short season and even with the pool surprised when one of the candidates said\nWe shouldn't have an outdoor pool and we should have one you could use year round you\nBecause now you're talking a whole bunch of more money that you can imagine\nWhen you are in the high dollar really I was an option at one point you have\nAn indoor pool yeah at the ... and ... and that's what that's what the real this whole thing you are a number of years ago it sounded like hey we're going to get back on track again but then it it it morphed from a justice\nYears ago it sounded like they were going to get back on track again but then it it it morphed from a just a ... a pool taught and aquatic center to you know just big player in people just want something simple just went to a simple pool\nAnd that would keep the cost down well but there's also people that talk about the splash bad\nIs separate something I was a little surprised by last night was was a more dissent against these flash bad idea that there was so much at least that's what some of the a candidate said they are their constituents may have the one

I mean it's a good point pizza tech science six they won twelve thirty\nAlright other than the pool was the other big issue last night [noise] a school board or city or let's go to the first the school board because over and over again people were talking about this whole you know either it's miss trust or what is it with like\nAre managing they feel or they felt like there was low morale I mean we had a we had a story much was that came out why may June somewhere in there like that\nAbout a individual had written a letter and if she got quite a bit of backing that there's a lot of micromanaging going on and it had fled to low morale among staff in the uh the the ... school district so that was one of the questions we ask that you know this has been reported how would you handle this\nAnd uh got a variety of questions in most of them I mean pretty much all of them were real pretty conciliatory they were like hey we want to be open to everybody you know sometimes we have to make decisions\nBut uh you know we weren't open place but of course the other thing is I was one of the candidates said yeah we're in control day to day operations but we really are I mean you have supervisory role with in the school district a superintendent ... command jaded command that runs the day to day operations there\nI mean the school board overseas that but they don't I mean they have to allow it it's a fine line between micromanaging and being last a fair\nAnd not having your hands on it at all so I mean they're trying they're trying to walk\nThat okay and the ah school members or the school board candidates the they sounded like they're pretty much on the same page walks up or one of them are sounded like they didn't think there were really that big of a problem that there wasn't micro managing and there's just a perception problem yeah but I think\nThat's in Canada that came back on the second question when they asked about basically went into that same vein and was much more\nThe restroom when they asked about basically went into that same vein and was much more much more conciliatory that time around after hearing maybe some of the other statements and having time to mullet around but yeah I mean everybody's going to have a different reaction to it you know I mean\nThere is how many people in the school were eight I think there's eight\n... I Can't even at seven Evansville by members of federal health care\nBecause of seven total school board members and three spots all open right now\nOr four or more so\nIf all for it are are newly elected you know I'm going to be sweeping change in what the school board looks like that would be you know out of seven Canada or out of seven school board members if for our\nYou know basically brand new huge difference right and so when this happens I'm as a city are you looking at\nStability or you're looking at change\nMhm that's that would have been a while that was you know you have to ask a desert or you have to ask yourself and that's why these candidates\nAre points of view so last night was so important to hear ... uh for the voter to make up their mind whether they do what do they are are they happy with the situation if you're not you should vote change and if you're happy with it you stay with your candidates I think that's\nI think that's exactly right actually when I looked I if I look down I was just I thought about it after we had done I was thinking I was wondering what's going to happen here\nI think you're going to get a a little bit of both you do I do get some change but I think you're going to get some also some stability because there's some really good school board members out there to be a good good individual we know we'll get changed with two of them aren't aren't running back Dr ...\nNot running and uh you know I don't remember the last time I think I remember is John John or like are running John in my car right the they're both running again and I should Shannon I don't remember who else in the region and might make it last night and my experience was the other my experience John Linder another Togo they both were\nBoth there so last night to ... to finish up here are the ah the the school board when you when you listen to these people talk there's a lot of passion you get far as wanting to be part of it right\nAnd I'm not you know I'm not endorsing anybody but it got to tell you I think Ryan waltz added really was well ... that's what I told them okay\nMy wife has really dry and so I she knows them but I came home I mean I I Would you say my wife is related to riot all through the wall so but I came back when I got ... I had to wear Allard oh Kevin ... Ballard valor does the other members and he didn't he didn't run okay so those are two\nWhen I got home I told I told her while Ryan is well spoken and I like what he said he said he said in his business he's made the most money when his employees are the happiest [noise]\nI think he said he has been the happiest when his place with a happier [laughter] he also said a communication and transparency ... shot\nThe the word transparency should be used more often when you're talking about ... ... they're called eggs in general yeah absolutely I entertain for him to bring that up and and that was a point that he was making that you know there has to be transparency otherwise\nThere's a lot of people at the ill feelings because if you don't know what's\nGoing on then you feel like you know you're out of the\nThe circle you know or are there is like private meetings in in ... transparency helps solve not just the school board or the city council or or any type of elected position where everybody gets together and meets but it helps ease the minds of the citizens to if they know exactly what's going on\nWhat's the reason why we don't have a budget for this why can't we do explaining good detail and nobody it's like there was an episode of West wing\nIt was towards the end of the the run for West Wing you edge Jimmy Smith was running for president against Alan Alda in Illinois ... um he was the senator from California and they had a nuclear um a meltdown at one of the the nuclear power plants\nWhile he was the guy that really push to get that plant put in twenty some years ago [noise]\nSo it was it was going to be terrible for his campaign right suddenly he's the guy known for you on the nuclear meltdown that was happening in in Southern California\nSo what he did was he went out in front of the the plant after they said it was safe you know 'cause you know they it was a reactor that had him um you know a bunch of problems but they fixed and he went out there and he did what's a basically a nonstop press conference until he answered every single last question\nThere had to be thirty or forty reporters standing there asking questions when he started nonstop asking questions about two hours later half of those people are gone three hours later down to three or four people still standing there and any more questions anybody anybody leasing you've got a question no no no good\nAnd it was over ... any ended it involved in that ... you got behind it and he moved on and that's I mean again people you can only ask so many questions so if you stand there and you have an answer every single one of them every possible way\nThen you're done nobody's asking more questions you move on that day when it comes to city council you know county commission any of them\nIf there is this something that's a problem if there is a ... you know an issue that people are talking about talk about it you have to talk about it but the owner of the better go talk to mark gallon during open line and answer every possible question [noise]\nDon't don't avoid it don't just grow [noise]\nIt is soup Thursday king crimson and the world was my choice [noise]\nYeah exactly I'm not leaving until you agree\nTo vote no yeah what is that\nBare minimum I Would think it would be some possibly disorderly I mean sure it's just you kidding me I mean what happened to states being statesman like I mean I I don't get that you can't persuade people with the you know hey look or I'll give you a you\nKnow another uh a couple of minutes to talk to me about this and then we can have a discussion and then they'll then they'll go vote but no now it's gotten to the point where we're going to have thousands of people you know dumping around in front of the the the um the ... the capital [laughter]\n'cause they won't be doing the White House it doesn't matter you know they could sit there and protests and part of the White House all day but the capital they're gonna send thousands of people there in these buses to protest\nFor what reason they had the FBI investigation and they had the interviews in front of a the the congressional\nOr the or the Senate Judiciary committee right they had the original review to fill the this man has gone through the first review which is a normal Supreme Court justice review then a second one where he brought in the in the accuser and they sat there and they did the whole thing again and an FBI investigation\nThis is after he's already been background check and now if the FBI says no we don't have any information that soon there's yeah go go proceed with the vote\nAnd now you're just going to get angry and bring people is just protests and it's all that's left maybe ... ... what we've come down to when it comes to the Democratic party we maybe we didn't get our way so we're just going to turn the whole world around\nI think that's exactly what's going on I mean\nIt's like it's like when you talk about somebody doing something he said follow the money but I mean follow the motivation on this they just absolutely\nAre unwilling to let they don't want this person a ... as Mr cabinet judge Kavanaugh in to the Supreme Court and they'll do anything to keep them out of there I think maybe even in their own heart of hearts I don't think they believe this but they're just like we don't care we want to keep ... I don't\nThink it has anything to do with this at all you don't I think it's the midterm elections I think they're just if they can get the president to say fine I'm not gonna you know I'm going to he's going to withdraw its going to take six weeks to get somebody else nominated and go through the background and do all that and then hold a vote their ... which I actually had a ... term\nRight and that he won't get it back and they think I don't have any new cabinet himself anymore I don't think it has to be at one point that could have been but at this point it's not the man who shouldn't be on the Supreme Court\nIt's the fact that the Democrats are hoping to regain control I agree with that that's and then they could put to make sure they get whoever they want\nBut that's all we've come down to it it's it's almost to the point where it's physical and verbal you know to defend it all costs you know that we want to wait and and put somebody on the Supreme Court and it's always\nBeen as far as the Supreme Court nominees it's always followed party lines if ... if it's a Democratic president in it's a Democrat writes a democratic or a Democrat president or democratic line typically\nWhat brings right now many that gets into it but typically what they do and correct me if I'm wrong but they they'll find like three or four candidates and they'll thrown by the whoever the minority party as and say\nWhich one would you accept which one or one or two you know and that way they have a better understanding who they could get through sure there are still my picks\nBut already is what you and and so you know the always throw some crazy pot at in there [laughter]\nOkay this one definitely won't make it but they they do that as a way that you know both sides of the you know the ... kind of agree 'cause they started to be confirmed and if there's any problem getting ... getting a confirmation they'll go\nOkay let's talk about a curious who we want they're not going to Democrats are going to come back and go All right as long as you bringing this guy right here he says one hundred percent full fledged Democrat of course not\nBut if somebody is a little bit less than a you know conservative than the normal Republican Party would like him to be or her then maybe the Democrats would go and sign on this time I'm going to guess Trump didn't do that and maybe that's what happened they didn't give that here's my three candidates what do you think\nInteresting a couple of uh messages that come on our pizza tax line one says if they did a forty year background check on all people in Washington who would be left right that's a good point and other ones as the FBI investigation was a joke Trump control the whole thing\nWell considering the fact that his relationship with the FBI isn't the best you know I don't know how how fair that is to say you know I don't think so either\nBy the but what's happened is he has and and kudos to whoever is spending this this has turned into a an attack on all women everywhere uh you know they've they've taken this instance and all of a sudden you've got the entire feminist moments\nTurning this into a an attack on all women everywhere\nAnd ... and it's it's hard to defend that yeah you know if it's hard to defend these you know these are individual instances but um and and that's what's got everybody up in arms is for some people with black and white for others it is just the opposite there is no middle ground anymore\nNo there's no let's talk\nLet's figure this out talking or last

qualify casual right you add that urgency you know what I mean I don't mean just the one game I Know one giant player in the playoffs yeah that's huge because I think people still you know baseball's a great sport\nTo watch and and and obviously play\nBut when you add that sense of urgency to if you're going to get people glued to the TV\nTo be honest I think regardless of who's there there'll be more when there's the big market right but you know even if it's Kansas City I mean obviously they're not in this year but you know Kansas City in Cincinnati with that sense of urgency I think people are still tuned in to some degree\nNo doubt about it of course big football game of course was welcome in the odd couple cruel because you know what Chris we wouldn't be able to do to find little

...\nThis was a true story real quick um you know uh what is it the the ... what was the first rap\nSong or the first national ... was ... and I said well I my way to others whether you're not from

how on you forward it was to me I I run never done that do you ever do that for the first song I was listening to this what is this that's what I said to her and there was\nI had the same reaction you remember it to this I I was about I think I was fourth grade but went to visit a friend of mine in Cincinnati and I lived in Indianapolis at the time I went to visit him in Cincinnati\nAnd walked in his front door and he had rappers delight plan and I was like speechless I was like why is that like you say I never heard anything like it he was like all that hip hop that the new jam\nYou know you didn't even remember the new note of real man ... that's the new jam and you're right I mean I I went when we went home to my dad I like that you bring to the store I got to buy and I got up and right and we did and like you said look that's\nArguably the most arguably I'm not offended we'd have to think about it that's arguably one of the most influential pop music songs in American history no doubt about it just because of what it spawned you know I mean look at what hip hop has become\nKnown as a part of our society is so are there yeah on on that was just that just came to me and I think we both had the same reaction it's a big Thursday night which was Thursday Night Football patriots and the colds and well you got Chris on this game\nA couple of [noise] I got the tree is of course they patriots look the patriots or background back where do they know who they are about a year they went to the graveyard did too and they were too into last year where they end up super\nBowl you count last year this year when you know look at the numbers down at the same and they're not the same two and two other\nNow they they're getting back to night they're getting back Julian Edelman\nAnd we think they're going to have Josh Gordon\nI mean this is gonna be a different patriots team Rob now Tom Brady has some weapons\nLet the let the colds or whoever else they play going forward try to double team ground now it'll be a different story Edelman is going to be getting tons of ... going to be open from the line of scrimmage and I mean that's the operating needs a Josh Gordon you know who knows what he is we'll see\nBut assuming he's still you know close to what he was a few years ago\nA ... and he looked good for the browns into one game you play I think that the patriots are right there obviously Kansas City in Jacksonville are the two top teams right now the AFC but if you count out the patriots count 'em out at your own peril their back\nFor providing evidence based

Sports radio justice my two favorite days of the week our TV theme song Thursday and trash talking\nTo me [laughter] you know making the trash talking obviously is not Tuesday was good to have you with the light you like their leg where where every now and ah thank you sound like you know radio God\nNow that was I I Am now I it took me a little while but I Am there um we have a lot of trash talk this week from Kansas city's tiring hill going up against Jay Lynn Ramsey jaguars\nIt'll be a fantastic game best game and the weekend in my estimation two top teams in the AFC\nAnd you know what I write about that because you got that high flying op eds right with with a patch elves and then you got the best deep them one of the best defenses so now you're going to really get a look I mean if people if he pulls out the Jacksonville Jaguars then you've got to take a look at my home and\nIf he gets stopped or or slow big time did you say okay a little just one was made so this is going to be one that you're right everybody's gonna wanna watch no\nQuestion about it and you know the the matchup between him and Ramsey is one to watch to Ramsey obviously a top corner back in the league may be the number one\nCorner right now and hills having a nice season you know he he hasn't been all pro yet as a receiver and Ramsey let him know that in his trash talk but it started with still let's hear what he had to say about his match up with James Ramsey\nTo me he was a great player I mean obviously things are obviously he thinks high itself so [noise] he's All right I guess you know I mean I Can't wait to line up against them and I I Hope uh he personally\n[noise] well he's going to get his wish or his whole whatever you want to call the cars jailing Ramsey presses every body physically and verbally and he pressured back on the hill like this he's\nGo for what he does for a team or you know he made a pro as a return specialists let's get that right that was her specialists or his ... year he wants to to ... as a return specialists require special is two years I I'm a all pro\nIn my position as a corner uh went to the pro as a corner [noise]\nUm so ... versus quarter master\nOh oh oh you like that I Love it I Love this is what's missing from sports because everybody\nWants to be buddy buddy empowered nothing will no he's not being disrespectful like in a meeting negative way just saying he's calling out hey I'm a all pro corner he's an all he is an all pro receiver that I'm going up against\nBecause he's not he hasn't been all ... has did he say anything that's not factual\nNope nope and he got he got\nAll the facts and he got the digs in and I love it that's what sports is about and then you get to go out on the field and proven\nRight I'm I'm with now how to yeah I I Love this I think you know I like both guys for speaking their minds\nAnd Ramsey got the best of him there's no question Ramsey also I loved what he said you know I Wish he would pick aside because it wherever you saw you heard Tariq say he's All right I guess\nBut then he also said later that he's the top dog right now at the quarterback position so rams it was like hey which one is it am I just saw right or am I the top dog well make it might make it plain so\nI'm with you I think this is great\nAnd you're right look I mean there are I I\nKnow you think you know all these players just want to hang out in there is a little bit of that they know where\nI come across this the AA you are era where everybody played with everybody everybody knows everybody is totally different\nWell did with the traveling teams and all the other stuff that people do football they did they have a big seven on seven thing that they do all over the country with guys play against each other you know what I mean that they didn't do in the past\nAnd I'm young you know more about people and no more people that did the um the way they rank people the way you could watch people on YouTube do you know what I'm saying you have a more knowledge of people are now did you ever knew\nYeah no question that you get to know him at a younger age but I Do think at times\nWe romanticize it myself included we romanticize\nThe past like everybody hated each other not bill Russell in and and wilt Chamberlain were friends you know Magic Johnson and Isaiah Thomas were really good friend and they were great friends with Dominique Wilkins yeah but they were not there kissing before the finals yeah but\nThey also a gave each other some stitches and and and also a battled Isaiah\nEnds and magic so you won't take that into account that's when their relations they've actually began to go down when they began challenging magic while he wants to ruin the we may not hey\nWe're cool 'cause I'm On talk now all of a sudden I became a big player right yeah oh totally\nEvery winter yeah it was fine when I was there was wasn't wearing individually but his team wasn't a threat\nAnd then that one those back to back ah she ah championships the bad boys and things to change and it became a battle and and I'm not saying that you can't be friendly but I'm just saying there was a degree of a warning to win and the competition and keeping guys at arm's length that's all\nYeah I I'm with you\nWith you I like I said I liked the trash talk or I Love jailer Ramsey and what he's bringing a he he you know he'll go after everybody would after drunk you know he goes after\nIm seeing what he's bringing a he he you know he'll go after everybody would after drunk you know he goes after job and then he delivers on the field\nLong in your backyard happening and grumpy and get it wrong they'll get off didn't do anything to do anyway absolutely\nSo when when you talk like that and then you got the defense like Jacksonville it only gives the viewer goals I don't know Rob Rob how many of field a touchdowns have given up and for weeks not that many I'm telling you cruises unbelievable\nLittle ask you the here's what I Want to ask you if Kansas City beach Jacksonville and you know what I'm saying they will just a little for tomorrow\nI Believe Kansas City is going to win this game I may change my mind but right now that's what I'm\nReady to Chris in sorry go ahead\nFor games have given up four touchdown that's incredible in this NFL think about what I just told you\nThey play ah ... okay that was impressed with us\nOn the ... the game in New York or no maybe it wasn't\nGiants jets are one and three I'm with a rookie quarterback you had to give me a ...\nA giants and tightened\nOkay they play one team don't give me the titans\nLook at you now don't you remember what it is so funny you know Rick\nKansas City they ever played any by you know written a New England they ever played any body\nYou know what are you going to praise Jacksonville will never get ... to New York will never do ... you know how to go to rip the tight [laughter]\nThis is my question to you Robert ... win Kansas City beach Jacksonville I hear your party are you going to still have the jaguars rank the top your power Parker power rank\nIt'll be hard to do that but when Jacksonville ...\nDo three hours on this I have an old man who want to go out for three hours because I don't I Want to see muscle or saw me to cause I just I don't know where people get that from an and we'll move on because there's a couple of the things you want to get\nA let me ask you this is Joel um we we talked about ... at the outset\nWe would look at a player like that in the past few years I mean hey maybe even a year or two ago and not necessarily well okay is college football it's even the big twelve\nYou know he won't be able to do that in NFL now quarterbacks are coming in and they're playing well right away and gods they put up big numbers are doing the same thing in NFL uh obviously the rules have helped and stuff like that why do you think do our quarterbacks just better today better prepared\nYou know at a younger age or or or are we just imagining things and new rules changes have helped the quarterbacks to it looks to me like quarterback for getting better\nYeah ... they are it it is a mixture of different things I don't think it's any one factor a but let's touch on a couple of different factors for one\nIs the fact that the NFL game has evolved and now what you're seeing as more college style of off into the national football league we see that with the chief who see it with the eagles see the lambs\nAnd we see these Tyler quarterbacks now that used to not have any success going college and the air raid systems are spread systems in the NFL now you're seeing them have access because you're seeing some of that carry over a systematic I'm a ... or ... if you will\nA then and this is another thinks he's now Rob you're going to agree with me because here's another generalization oh it is the generation of quarterbacks that have grown up being taught like individual sport athletes this is the generation that has been throwing seven on seven there were seven eight nine years old\nThis is the generation that has grown up in the new rules see it used to be that when I grew up playing that this position the quarterback position guys\nYou were taught that you had to protect everybody on the field you get them into the right play calls you don't lead a wide receiver into precarious situation\nThat is no longer the case of what we're seeing is very similar to the guys getting out of the PGA Tour that are younger played with the modern style of equipment forever and so all they know how to do is bombing in ... well guess what quarterbacks now all they know how to do\nSling it meant they can sling it they have no regard for the health of their wide receivers the rules they are out there ripping it man and and it is fun to watch that is the costs and the more homes and now the quarterbacks that you're seeing and the college level and Carlin Mary certainly fits in that\nWe do agree once we got less than a minute now a gym horrible as on the top coaches football coaches salary ... number three behind Nick Saban an urban Meyer\nOr has he really earn that money to be there he's only one in five against uh up until this point obviously a one in five against his rivals and ah but yet his record do the first three years is very similar to Brady hopes three years when people couldn't wait to run amount of Ann Arbor\nWe use is very similar to where do you hope to three years when people couldn't wait to run amount of Ann Arbor has he earned that the beer a top three are earner as a coach in the college football\nThere's no doubt let's put it very simple and very very quick this is the winningest program in the history of college football and they had went into a deep dark oil that was the rich Rodriguez and Brady ... era and ... really don't hold water outside of\nThe operation of eleven one season the pretty hokey out there's programs that are much better spot that you are on deserves a lot of credit for that I think that they're going to play while the rest of the season has started to the second half last week liquor bleeding of some ... Seventeen going come back on the road which is the largest comeback they've had under his\n... he he deserves it is a great coach and uh I Do believe that Michigan there that are better spot\nAre Joel ... every day every answer Joel right on the money [laughter] no question about it uh I totally agree made shouldered your welded on your own good or whatever it is you should feel that it could be bad\nAre John\n... and I are the strong man [laughter]\nHey you just might be the late ... it'd be it'd be a and that's not necessarily a good thing I'll explain next is the odd couple of Fox Sports radio\nWhen you're hiring you don't want to waste time sorting through dozens of irrelevant resumes you want an efficient way to get to a shortlist of qualified candidate that's why you need in the dot com posed a job in Minot\nSet up screener questions based on your job requirements then zero in on qualified candidates using an intuitive on line dashboard discover why three million businesses use indeed\nFor hiring posed a job today at indeed dot com slash higher search for greatness search indeed\n[noise] things happens so fast in our world people don't know what he wants to keep up here's what they're doing to follow us on Twitter that Fox Sports radio\nWere teasing you in the ...\nOn Twitter at Fox Sports radio\nDiscovered car believes anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation that's why they think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving them a try discover will give new car members of one year anniversary gift they'll never forget at the end of your first year they'll match all the cash back\nYou our dollar for dollar no cap and no catches try it and believe it I discovered dot com slash\nMatch only for a new car members limitations applying the thirty second commercial now I'm going to throw a lot a number that you but please stay with me it just Fifteen minute you could say Fifteen Percent or more on your car insurance\nThis company has been offering great rates and great service for over Seventy five years and anytime you need help you can speak to one of their trained specialists twenty four seven\nGo to guy told dot com today sorry Bob and numbers and in five four three two one I'm Out of time\nThrifty white community health corner by\nThis is my kid pharmacists to Jordan pharmacy and cheaper falls or you're sixty five are older are pharmacy team is ready to help you make sense out of choosing the best Medicare part D plans bunch change every year to ... to make sure your current plan to do the best option for twenty nine ...\nOpen enrollment onto a couple of games or December seventh visit manager dried pharmacy and falls we have the tools to help you save on your prescription medication\nATP home security company offers catty service you get a bus from your eighty to yeah to check the doorbell issue nine hundred and delivered safely the ATF helps protect your family home in packages\nBut not your Gulf stroke [noise] so you can keep practicing knowing everything's safe at home [noise] chatty service brought you buddy ... visited ADD\nDot com slash smarter to learn more slices of racial ... di di di di di di real protection\nEmail phishing attacks cost businesses billions annually in real cash data loss and brain damage fishing emails are hard to detect because the messages appear to be legitimate to unsuspecting employees\nBarracuda fish line a groundbreaking cloud based solution designed to help employees recognized sophisticated he now phishing attacks through interactive training reinforced by continuous and elation transform your employees from the liability into line of defense go to ... to learn more\nUnder Libby jak bought bingo Thursdays at the American legion those one Seventeen and the ...
