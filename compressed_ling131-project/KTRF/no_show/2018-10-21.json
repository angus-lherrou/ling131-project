went through that brine well first go to you\nI think it was all a really good game especially from a spectator standpoint that uh they played with a little more aggressive or aggression throughout the whole game night both teams dead and uh I think they showed that uh both teams are really altered to compete and uh I think Japan and not to be a very both both teams are really good team\nIn the ... this year besides a son or banks are still being undefeated we don't live ... between four teams is going to be a lot of different uh\nChanges in the standings and I have one team gets hot yeah but we got we got bright and we've got the river falls Rez Life we got for Francis fall for those teams on any given night can win a hockey game\nAnd you know it is with this level of hockey too we get a chance for a lot of these other ones that are still getting cut from the other leagues\nAlex hello and welcome and we've got to our players had been playing this weekend that ah we're told that could have a big impact on this on\nTheir roster players and also a you know as the season progressed as here still early on but uh the nurses are showing some promise\nAll right Mike your thoughts on tonight's game as well\nAnd that they did really well they they kind of slow down the second period again but they came up with more intensity and the third kept on it kept their shots slow what a lot of pressure on the golf [noise]\nI thought they did really well they're they're passing needs to be a little more credit but they weren't doing the the throw 'em in the air and I don't know where it is um I think they got to work on some other basics again do a lot of us snapshots back and forth practice to catching it\nBecause there's a lot of parks that the guys were there were bombed softer sector not\nBecause they're not using as we used to be told soft pads you get the ... you should stop trying to catch it and you can bring it back a lot of them are hitting it hard that a rebound just coming off there's someone out of the blue line of work on a missing a couple of our things\nOther than that I think overall they did a really good job and I stayed on that they stuck with it they did a good game a couple of big hits they didn't come out swinging at the other team so we didn't we didn't lose our cool\nYou got to give them adds up for that and then the referees let them play tonight\nFor happened last night habits that I ... in the second ... kind of took that period of the local either they only gave up one goal in that second so they got some good goals and AIDS ride as they did last night and as a result of that tonight and the third period I was very impressed and it shows I think what happened is\nFever evolves was short players and the short bench in those first date games you put a couple of new players out there you go to a longer batch these guys aren't as tired\nAs what they have banned in the first few games of the season and helps a lot\nAnd it's helping I think a ... point on the passing I think a lot of that has to do with these kids haven't been doing a lot of time with each other spending a lot of time on the ice and stuff and I think that all comes with a few more games in her belt and are figuring out what line they're going to play with\n... ... new player that the guy in ... ah from Los Angeles California\nHere by daylight no I I got to say that this kid is Israel is a really nice hockey player I as a stepped up be played I think uh to practices with a ... he picks up three points over the weekend\nAnd he's going to pick up his goals as well he's a good steak and learn a good or\nA sister man and he tells the country at the clock so I think he's going to be a big difference maker\nAs the northeast get into this season as I mentioned the river falls\nNot the best second period again but they didn't let that get to them as they got to the third period and they made sure that the red light was not going to take this went away from and I thought that was a a big a positive step for the north Koreans as though we go on into a next weekend's way [noise]\nAll right not to go to ramp up bar game's stat center individuals dance and they aren't you\nThat's going to ramp up bar game stats and our individual stats and they're brought you buy unity bank ... than you can get the numbers that matter with a visit\nTo unity

a rental link up playing a very good hockey game for the miners I also find that a a Michael dilute all\nOf a red lake cabin ice skating these guys didn't get on the scoreboard but these are the players that make it happen they're out there a lot for a red lake and also their gold ... a game of two goals on\nThirty four shots making thirty two things so he's got to be a nominee for the ... River Falls north east and the game and and like ... did not get a gold tonight but I tell you what he was out there on the power plant he was out there on the a\nPenalty killed had day in between ... I mean he's working a hundred and ten percent all of the time and uh it's it's gonna be a um [noise]\nLeadership that he is showing as he is one of the veterans on this hockey team\nEvery game alec game and comes out there with everything he's got for the north Koreans also allowing after seeing a [noise]\nA nomination for player of the game would be Alex Sievers and Alex ... a lot\nOf big hits tonight but he held his own he didn't get into any big uh\nUltra Tunisian tonight he did a great job of a a defensive link in his own zone is an enforcer for the river falls and uh uh\nActually he had the game winner\nYes the bank and the secondary pleases sides on nature very well you know says six for two Fifteen a\nHe's a force out there and when he's on the ice people now he's on the ice and\nBoy that was a sweet goal coming from the game and and the ss and a great place right time\nAnd but the alec being added offense been putting the rush up from a his defensive position he was there the right place at the right time and they made sure it went home All right well so can forget a\nGold center which are Boulder\nFletcher Boulder not playing in two weeks all he did was make thirty three things on thirty four shots nights so you've got to\nAssume that a pleasure Boulder came up with some really big ... especially in that second period where things River Falls gave up Seventeen shots so I thought a ledger coming out the bench not playing for a couple of weeks play very well\nNow this was the first time I actually got to see him down ... English solid between the fights and he didn't get rattled detracted buck well so yeah he's another ...\nAlso you know you can give a nominee to the team or you could but I Would I Want to say is that a wind red lake would get their power plays\nThe river falls played in that short box and in that box they didn't let anybody get through and that was the difference in the hockey game defensively when they were short handed working on the ... federally kill that they were not getting out of that and they were playing it safe and the results\nRed lake was not getting the shots they wanted to write\nDay kept him a out of the perimeter long the boards and stuff they give them rub the chances of look at in uh there again though what the chances they did get a look at Boulder was right there stands\nCrying half the seat in the river falls probably presents the employer the gang get a jump on your field every year\nWith the valuable line up a seat chemicals and expert agricultural management firm have the seed\nAlright we'd had her nominees will take a break from hep C seed and we'll be back with our player of the game right after this [noise]\nEverybody says their business has service but what does that even mean we're full service retail who doesn't do custom application we offer aggressive pricing it early catch discounts at only do we have all the major company rebate programs we fill out the paperwork for you to get everything you burn\nCrop plants change could switch products and still get the best price of the year or better yet get your money back with interest we're hefty seed company called today for rape crisis and even better economic advice for your farm\nDeep river falls to one eight six eight three sixty nine thirty\n[noise]\nMeasure the ... center enters the crowd is filed out Zamboni is on the ice and the clean up the arena and we're\nWe do the half the seats layers again we've had our nominees only one player can be they have to see play into the game and I'm Mike will go to a huge nights it was a player the game\nI Am very proud to announce that a fellow goalie\nHas trouble that get to see how do you see the players the game you start solid\nThere was many times over a scrum in front of him on his knees who was trapped in the parking was kicking them out he was knocking 'em down his trouble and deserves that they have the seed player of the game\nTonight Fletcher ball the gold standard for the favor falls ...\nOut of out Pina Michigan\nHunter as I mentioned a hundred and I've seen a action for a couple of weeks is very strong there tonight held onto his rebounds and I think that was a big part of his hockey game and\nYeah that's amazing yeah I'm Frank you\nAbsolutely you know because the we need to do with it so\nIt was important for us to get a W when it was a much bigger noodles [laughter] pretty important\n... of a must win it they have it you know yeah\nUh we got action and the baseball game as well where the Milwaukee Brewers trying to make a little bit of noise to our bottom of the seven to run run first base still a lot of baseball to go by going well\nBut an absolute stranglehold on the game right now ... capital ...

is with\nThe lead on both revolt\nOf course I Know you're watching that but I got my eyes on the Dodgers brewers right now Dodgers up five to one as they\nIt's on the Dodgers brewers right now Dodgers up five to one as a now go to the top of the knife yes yep week with the three runs slamming that one that's the\nUh so far a little bit of the difference there was two one when they hit the three run Homer five one in that one and the big game going on right now for two thirty five Thirteen over Ohio State\nStill five minutes left I sent to the show sheet of what I wanted to talk about an hour ago and if you notice on your tax that says Ohio State loses I I told you an hour ago they were going to lose this game\nWhile and you didn't jinx them because I was going to say for our loyal listeners you sent the Ohio State loses two weeks ago or three weeks ago when they were at Penn State\nDid not work out for you or Penn State fans I think this time we're good\nAll right well of course we're a good thirty five Thirteen ah Purdue is leading right now this was actually seven in the three late in the first half went Ohio State was looked like they were going to go in for a touchdown they didn't get in or because of the receiver dropped it on third in goal I Believe\nThey wind up for a field goal they miss her do comes out and gets the late touchdown fourteen three it was all downhill after this this last may drop them quite a distance because\nThey're getting manhandled that that produce like all horrible team but there are five hundred team or this last may cost Ohio Ohio State of chance at that a four team playoff\nYeah it's well it's certainly not good they are certainly going to fall as you said Ernie and now this is what's great about college football this time of year the playoff picture starting to take shape\nMichigan wins again which will get into but if Ohio State can't hold on a could make that Ohio State Michigan game basically a de facto playoff to get into the Big Ten championship and then potentially for a playoff\nBerth right first of all before we even go flying into it we want you to go ahead and give us a text\nOr tweet us excuse me early and often all through the show you could reach him Aaron underscored tour as I'm at stinking genius one we should get them tonight like it's a slot machine like I'll give it away hundred dollar bills\nBecause so much going on but Ohio State how far do you think they're going to drop from this and do you think this loss is going to keep them from getting back up into the into the top four and I know that's hard to tell now but I I guess what I'm asking is how bad of a law says this\nWell it's bad but look there are a lot of one last teams as we get closer and closer to the end of the regular season here I mean they are officially as things stand the last undefeated team in the Big Ten\nI'm obviously the pack twelve doesn't have any undefeated teams the big twelve doesn't have any undefeated team so you'd think they'll fall into that group with Michigan with\nGeorgia with Ohio or not Ohio State excuse me with Oklahoma all the schools punched up the great thing is we still have a lot of games to be played in the big twelve the west Virginians are going to play the Texas and Oklahoma as and as I just mentioned in the Big Ten that Ohio State Michigan game could be huge now Michigan has a\nBy next week right but they play Penn State and if they get by Penn State it's hard to see any scenario where they don't enter that game with just one loss and we'll see what happens with Ohio State\nWhat went wrong in this Purdue game um look I Know Purdue had a a field day on the ground against them but also a passing they had over three hundred yards passing Haskins\nI I don't think the game plan was to throw the ball sixty two times which is what he's put up right now but uh mistakes have gotten the puck guy is at least what I've seen so far or this game of flipping around all the channels there\nWell I I think you and I were a little bit ahead of this because if you remember last week Ohio State they right yeah they beat Minnesota but it wasn't pretty they were kind of honestly dominated at the line of scrimmage by Minnesota and it was an ugly it was about fourteen point wind\nBut it was it was I remember correctly it was a one point or excuse me a one possession game going into the fourth quarter if I remember correctly\nExactly and by the way we saw a Minnesota did today losing to Nebraska giving them their first law so it's not as though are giving them their first winning season so it's not as though Minnesota\nWas this red hot team but you saw it in so to bring it back to weigh in asking\nI think this Ohio State problem stems from the fact that they can't run the ball fifty three yards on twenty two carries a Arnie your Arizona degree my you kind of agree I math was never my strong suit I don't think that's good though\nA thug gonna guess where Ohio State school in the fall I still think obviously LSU with another impressive result maybe el issue gets into that top for the Georgia will be okay obviously Michigan with their victory Twenty one seven they'll stay up or maybe move up the spot\nA I think Texas will stay you know what it's either going to be Texas or Ohio State I think Ohio State stays ahead of Texas I think that's fair\nYeah well what I think is interesting too is if you start to look at Ohio state's resume it's not as impressive as it looked three four weeks ago you know we we spend a lotta time last couple of weeks talking about how that Michigan lost to Notre Dame actually looks better because of the way Notre Dame plan but you look at Ohio State\nThey beat a TCU team that's absolutely terrible you know they beat a Penn State team that last last week to Michigan State rise so so Ohio State doesn't have a lot to cling onto right now now\nLet's be honest they they run the table they win the Big Ten they're going to be in that that final four but right now they got to get back on track because they don't look anything close to one of those top teams that can compete ah once they get to that that playoff\nWrites this final just in Washington state over Oregon thirty four twenty a lot of people were calling for this upset the cougars at home Oregon coming off and emotional when last week\nA good victory by the cougars and this one thirty four twenty cuddling with Washington's when a set up a good game at the end of the year for those two huh\nYeah in theory I mean I think I think it's just more bad news though in the bigger picture for your pack twelve Arnie because\nI mean we're down to now with Colorado losing today we're down to one team with less than two losses and that's Washington state right now\nAnd I don't think anybody thinks that Washington state is going to run the table considering that they still have Stafford on the schedule they still Washington schedule they still have your Arizona Wildcats Otto yeah ... don't forget that how 'bout that maybe the Wildcats planes spoiler here and a couple of weeks\nBut meanwhile yeah there was in the UCLA right now seven nuts and so yeah and by the way LeBron's playing tonight we got his heart of a view that I keep an eye on him flipping around the channels like crazy while we do the show now before we get into the Michigan Michigan State game so many different things to get into in this one\nActually before the game even started um a shenanigans I guess is the word I'm looking for a before the game did you see the Michigan player a going out to midfield stopping on the logo\nOr and then after the game I'm a coach ... just really going up the coach Dan Tony saying you know taking shots at him saying it was five yards away I guess you like stuff like that boy there's a lot of bad blood right there\nYeah so for people to see the video it's already in my line here I don't really remember ever seen that before is that um basically the entire ah the entire Michigan\nAmerica's veterans are on their most important to work\nAnd da Vinci were on a mission to help veterans get the benefits they\nI'm a

one now as they\nGo to the bottom of the night will keep you updated as soon as that one becomes a final Purdue scores I get oh my goodness up forty nine twenty now a over Ohio State uh this is the difference between Ohio State staying in the tub seven or eight and the fall of the top ten they're getting up feeding and this\nOne Aaron yeah it's a it's just it's crazy because now the second straight year\nThat Ohio State has just gotten him bearish on the road last year it was at Iowa and frankly that was the last probably kept him out of college football playoff if you remember\nUm it came down to Alabama the non SBC champ versus Ohio State and everyone pointed to that one really really ugly laws as to why they got left out and it looks like they are going to have another embarrassing loss see how it affects them going forward\nUm look I Know we're a college football show it of course we'll preview week seven of the NFL just a quick left turn because I'm trying to follow everything we're trying to see what's going on with the Lakers as I told your\n... uh LA debut a Dodgers up five to one over the brewers winter\nGoes to the world series a take on the Boston Red Sox reason I bring that up is quite and curse shot in the game um are you getting too cute I I Know the jets and just pitch a you know one of the third but\nNobody else was available to ... to the finish up the game or what Dave\nRoberts I Swear man and I'm not like I'm not like a big you know bash the manager bash the coach guy right I Am so on board with you already ... ...\nWhat are you doing [laughter] I'm\nA first of all if you really feel the need to bring in clean Kurt Shaw why don't you bring them in in the eight to set up the closer to close the game or\nI Know this is crazy couple of things one let the closer pitch to innings he's done it before we saw throughout the playoffs last year we've seen it at times in the playoffs this year or let him start the nights and if it doesn't go well then you bring in ... they've Roberts man I Swear like like this guy\nI I just don't get what she's doing I I don't\nLet me go to them because they were missing something or ... well\nI I'm I'm In complete agreement with you guys when I saw the score one to five to one I was like the mission for David Roberts should not be to bring Clinton ... in it 'cause 'cause what\nCause let's not forget and I know this game is over but yeah for run lead with the way the brewers have been hitting the baseball the night they haven't scored runs in the first inning\nThere's no reason to bring him and you've got a game one in Boston on Tuesday night yeah well you gotta you gotta think about that like I Know you're trying to win a game but Alex would can't get you three out I I Know it's\n... and include encouraged are just work out hastily bag you are but yeah that's right but you couldn't go with jets in another you know you could you could easily gone two innings within ... days rest and here's the other thing\nThough too is let's say God Forbid something happens including ... gets rocked now you just use jantzen in aid you don't even have more valuable anymore and it's like it's just you know what's\nGoing to work out for them obviously\nSo any more and it's like it's just you know what's going to work out for them obviously but I just well it's been a workout but you don't want\nTo see some wild how\nIt worked out for them now I don't\nKnow what that means when the world series starts obviously Caruso is not going to pitch in game one or even game too I don't believe so\nUh why wouldn't the origin game one or game to see what was because that was in the way they set it up this time around he was what the uh third started was he not or no well do you he was he was the wine and like he would have ... it was the one only because of the rotation before\nA right exactly but at the same time you you\nYou gotta know scenarios and I know is presumptive to K. they're going to when they're going to win this game but still you got to be thinking towards the next series like totally ... and being it being on Tuesday he would've been lined up to start that game now he's not maybe throwing pages in a game\nYou know it's interesting maybe they Robert wanted to do it on purpose to take that decision out and say well not recant pitch game on we're going to moving back a little bit to save everybody face I don't know\nSo now ... game one is that my understanding I'm not I'm not positive Richard ritual pitched ... last night too\nSo I I I don't know who to line up\nI I don't know who would who would pitch game on for the ... one for the red Sox his critics sale for sale who came five off because he had a belly ring and ... and ... and that was one of them\nWill ever see last week I had less or I was going to have you been there come on and we all we've all had a belly ringer or who and I still have one yeah I still have one too yeah he's still got the nose ring to\nYeah absolutely very good\nNothing wrong with that I saw a couple of things while to get the Alabama well I look they were winning at half time uh what was it a forty two fourteen\nAnd as Nick savings going into the uh you know the locker room or some tendency fed those I guess it's a couple of vice Adam I first of all did he think Tennessee was good to be where do you get half [laughter]\nThat's my first question to you scored four he points if I was sad to see I'd be celebrating if I was a tendency fat because I didn't think they were going to be able to score that many points are well what does somebody figured when when that happens\nThere and three Nick Saban is escorted off to the field by police yeah what are you doing yeah what do you know it was\nA it was a weird day and uh by the way it looks like the Dodgers have Dodgers when yeah they they have one they're going to the world series they have no pictures for game one so they are just going to um they might bring Fernando balanced oil out of retirement here because then he called facts usually in the ...\nYeah I was gonna say Sandy Koufax a you know he's usually in these post game locker rooms he might have to throw a few in game one because uh because uh you know the or the\nDay on average was left there Yeah David Roberts I I just I don't want to use the word ... and I don't mean to get off family here but I also like\nWhat like why why I don't get it and as you\nSaid on like maybe they are doing it so they take it out of the decision of him to pitch gave number one I didn't think he was going to pitch gave one anyway because\nUh they went with a Walker viewer to pitch the game one sixty three and then they went with somebody else to open up the serious so he was the third pitcher anyway for you so I even a third picture on the way down the line\nI guess I just think that you know and and by the way it's exactly what you just said is it's not game one sixty three it's not a the opening round this is the world series and you're going up against one of the best pitchers in baseball and Chris Sale\nI just I don't get it Arnie I really don't and even if you don't want him to start game one I mean it's it's one thing if it's if it's a five to three game if it's seven six\nEurope right for and you have your closer in\nIf it was that close to the jets or whatever would come out of the game I think I Would just go with him into his arm fell off or 'til he got a little bit in trouble in that I was what happened by the way I just real quick back the college football David the tweets in Michigan State did nothing wrong or disrespectful horrible as the definition of classless why sore loser sore winner\nNever once as he displayed class he's all about committing or encouraging disrespect past tag nothing new wow\nWow so it was it wasn't disrespectful to just while the other team is warming up to walk across the field arm in arm but that was Michigan State that the one that you know in her book disrespectful writer but\nMichigan but Michigan also was displaying a disrespect by stopping on the logo after the game that's completely disrespectful\nAll right a couple of the games consumed woods at forty one seven over NC State noticed that were just ignoring quite having trouble warrants not one twenty six of thirty nine over three hundred yards at a touchdown I'm Still not sure the third best team and now they're probably going to move up the number two unless somebody seems a jump up and I don't see that happening but\nI don't see them as the second best team in college football right now no I mean this was there\nBut I don't see them as the second best team in college football right now\nNo I mean this was their first went over ranked departed all year now they did beat a ... uh they did beat Texas a and M. who is now ranked but this is the first time they played a ranked team in one this season\nI mean look the schedule leaves a lot to be desired the fact remains that we talk about this every week already if they run the table they are going to be in the final four in the play offs\nBut the competition just hasn't been there yet and so forgive me for not being all that excited this was the first rank departed they played NC State by the way who they beat has not played any ranked opponents\nSo I just I Can't get too excited about clubs in right now if they if they run the table they go search you know we'll have a different conversation but right now there's just there's there's reason to think of Notre Dame and some of these one last teams the Michigan the Georgia's et cetera better than them\nBecause Ohio State gets upset because Michigan has a good victory over Michigan State nobody said anything about that was you who was a while after what happened last week there overlooking Mississippi State um they grind it up Mississippi State gets a feel go nuts enough that uh\nIt was a typical LSU big three die team three a job or oh nothing greater or anything like that but\nUh no major mistakes that up one interception I'm good victory by Elvis issue that's going to move them up a notch you get them into the top for probably\nWell maybe except your boy Tom Ridge well tours already had him in the top for less yes you did I did I said look and it it comes back to what we're just stay on the Clintons and I said I Know well as you as a loss but if you look at what they've done it is more impressive total body work with ... than a than clubs in\nReal quick on LSU though yeah I actually give them a lot of credit on you know how you feel but they they're coming off this huge emotional when they got to buy they got ... the whole roads ahead of him I thought that it might be a

one\nUnbelievable how excited are you you are in the belly of the beast in Boston you're from LA the Dodgers you claim or your team when they're good [laughter]\nHow do you feel about this one I'm going to be a great match up I I really believe\nThat the Dodgers are in better shape starting pitching wise um maybe even bullpen wise um as for the wind up though gosh the way the red Sox what a hundred and eight games I Know a lot of became against Baltimore but there are wide up is hitting great at the bottom of the light up especially jak you'd probably junior\nYep who won the MVP I don't know if the Dodgers what was going to hit as well as the red Sox lineup\nYeah the Dodgers were really weird because they were struggling so much they get that extra innings win and then they they they hit pretty well on the back end of the series it was funny because they have that that great late night when I think it was whatever Thirteen innings\nAnd the next day to day games they don't take batting practice and that's when the bats came alive for him so I obviously not the depth of the line up that that the er the red Sox have but when you look at guys look Machado bleak cetera\nI mean they could put up put up runs I I'm really curious to Ernie is just the experience of being there last year there were so close I Know it's a different team it gets a different opponent but you got to think they got a little some extra just for that\nI think I see that the red Sox the early favorites according to the super book\nUm Red Sox for the series minus one thirty five Dodgers plus one Fifteen coming out about Fifteen minutes ago so a as expected or the red Sox the early favorites in in that one and that like I said Chris cell will be the opening tapes are we the opening starter\nA Tuesday or because he didn't have to pitch game five for the red Sox\nHe would have been ready to go for game six um but uh the red Sox did enough to go out and go that far so Red Sox will be the more rested team there's no doubt about that era\nYeah and there are at home to to start series so Dodgers gonna fly across country whatever every baseball guys are used to it at this point but I still I Know they won I still don't like the way David Roberts juggle that bullpen tonight and not to get super nerdy bullpen guy but like\nI just don't like a lot of decisions that he's made over the course of the series we'll see if it if it ever comes back to bite them it did last year late in that World Series against the Astros I'll be curious to see if it has an effect this year against threats like\nAll right we've got a lot of college football to get through by the way I'm before we started the show today I was thinking not a lot of great matchups I thought it was a horrible weekend in college football yes Ohio State gets upset um we have the Michigan when but not a lot of sexy matchups that a lot of\nYou know or you know final ... meters or ... I'm less second wins or anything like that I I was not impressed with this weekend's a games\nTotally agree with you and it was funny too because the one game and I think everybody's looking forward to in that early window Michigan Michigan\nState yeah whether to lay and we're stuck with a lot of all Bernal miss and uh Arkansas Tulsa and I can't even remember who else was playing at that time slot but\nOklahoma TCU I Believe too yeah and that one like we said earlier kind of got a little bit out of control their early I'm with you but uh you know like luckily as it always does with college football the the end of the day\nOr prove to be worth it with this Ohio State game but yeah a little bit of a slow start today for sure\nOf course the big story Purdue wins it over Ohio State forty nine twenty uh yes you heard me right forty nine pretty puts up twenty eight points in the fourth quarter a this was a seven three gain weight in the first half\nOhio State driving they drop the third doubt touchdown pass in the end zone obviously a go for the fuel go on for that is miss\nAnd produce gets delayed touched fourteen three and Ohio State never in this game after that and the fact that Brazil hung forty nine on them really has just scratch your head about this Ohio State defense um we questioned them against Minnesota's you're brought up earlier\nBut Haskins forty nine Seventy three for Seventy two touchdowns\nNot the game plan to fill the ball Seventy three times Ohio State school to drop how far I Would say about number suffered integrate probably stay out of Texas if a if you're asking me\nYeah I think the good thing is that we've learned through the years is that as long as Ohio State takes care of business from here on out there going to be just fine um that that would obviously include beating Michigan which is looking a like a very good team and would be a very\nGood when that Penn State when is going to hold up they still have to play by the way Michigan State who has given them trouble historically\nBut if Iowa State wins there'll be wins out there'll be fine I think it's hard to look at that team we saw tonight and say they will win out problems on defense problems in the running game this is a ... a team with holes even though that Jersey says Ohio State they got issues\nGet the Michigan Michigan State or before we get to the gate we mentioned this earlier to start the game off\nMichigan State walking arm in arm I guess when a little bit too far caused a ruckus shenanigans a you know getting a little bit of a altercation I guess is the word I'm looking for oh with the Michigan players one was good player at the ear buds ripped out of his ear I guess the Michigan State a dead Tony ... is\nBuds ripped out of his ear I guess the Michigan State a dead Tony ... is a according to horrible was five yards away from the smiling enjoying the robot is going on um look it was that a big thing is is just part of the whole Michigan Michigan State\nMystique rivalry that it goes as far or these coaches taking it too far\nWell let me flip it on ... because I I look I thought the Michigan State thing was a little disrespectful it's one thing if you have a pre game routine tradition whatever but why what's the other team takes the field for warm ups I mean you have to respect the competition so so you're in agreement with me then\nAbsolutely I thought Michigan State uh took a little too far now I didn't have video of the guy getting his ear buds ripped off or anything like that so I've I've got to take first you know reports on that a chef serving that's true right\nYeah no and I look all of this all that makes sense is like ... there was nothing malicious nobody got hurt like all that stuff but I just think it's one thing look you want to be a competitor you want to\nFully the opponent you want to show how tough you are in Iran or feel now bowled ball and this and that I also just feel like there's common etiquette common decorum and you did mention earlier in the show Arnie is that after the game so Michigan players were stomping\nOn well no no no not saw the whole team oh good for them when the ... I maybe I didn't\nSay it right it was the whole team I'm ... whatever you take traveling with your fifty sixty whatever it is Seventy right there in the middle jumping up and down on top of sporty um and and you know obviously trying to take a dig at it\nYeah but the thing is again and and I hate to be like a little kid here who started it but I mean you know as you started yeah like I mean at a certain point if a team disrespect you like that\nI don't know do you disagree I feel like you have the right to kinda hey we just kicked your but it's it was Twenty one seven the game was a lot more one sided in the final score it indicate I feel like good for Michigan they\nTried to do I feel you can do that when you're playing at home but the fact that you're on the road you got the victory just pack up get the hell out of there and and move out I Know what your rivals in Michigan State\nBut come on now you know just you know it's hostile you know you're going to cause a problem if you're at home and you want to play up to the home crowd and go into the stands or you know do the Notre Dame singing afterwards knock yourself out but you're on the road let's get dressed and get the heck out of your you know\nIt means seeing a doctor you experienced the symptoms of Lyme disease which can include joint pain flu like symptoms fever fatigue or sometimes a bull's eye shape rash set your sights on stopping mine learned how you can talk it Lyme disease at target ... dot org [noise]\nDoes that sound of a school they'll bring to mind home room lunchtime the day's end for the end of school entirely and then\nKids dropping out ... communities in schools we work directly inside schools to help those students whose ability to come to school is often jeopardized by hardships the loss of a loved one poverty lack of housing or bullying here from a few students whose lives we have touched they've\nAlways had my back they've always done anything to help me\nI communities in schools we empower students to succeed in and out of the classroom\nThey've been there for when I had any questions any ... personally anytime I mean if they weren't there\nOur mission is to ensure that at risk kids had someone by their side\nIt means a lot of the way this is a big accomplishment\nCommunities have never give up on me I can do it and I did it\nCommunities in school we're in schools to help kids stay in school to see how we help all students need communities in schools dot org\n[noise] why why have\nCollege sports for\nThe pet the the chicken from Erica Scharf independent tax will be twelve\nMiddle America done about covering the west day his\nMind all of your schools are wrapped right here\nIt's your\nFirst day on the Houston Texans look to take down to Miami do\nSelf and\nThursday at seven thirty eastern on Fox now to [noise]\n\nGet rewarded with snapshot from progressive it's simple plug in snapshots dry and burned discount sports they driving the floor at progressive dot com or call one eight hundred progressive [noise]\n\nGood evening everyone era tour has already spent and you're right here on Fox Sports radio guys let's go right up to the guy go Fox Sports celebrity hotline joining us\nNow you could think about it the big moves dot com that's the big moves dot com or you can tweet them a Greek underscore gambler that's ... s Vegas runner how you know in Vegas rather\nNever better on e thanks for having me thanks for having me\nIt's run or how you doing in Vegas runner\nNever better Ani thanks for having me thanks for having me uh once again on the show\nAaron and a busy day of course new college football and more importantly with the baseball game seven tonight a Dodgers coming through with that was a big win for the books\nThey were getting pounded with one sided public money on Milwaukee a wise guys were on the Dodgers no surprise they had the Dodgers for the series and they didn't come back the hedge that back um they let it ride as the Dodgers were the hot side\nFor the sharks the night a lot more than enough public money on Milwaukee to uh make it a good result for the books and more importantly Dodgers Boston you can't really get a better World Series\nA four book makers and four major league baseball so a a locked I'd done today and tomorrow we got weeks seven event F. L.\nWell let's start with baseball or what's going to be ... in the early wines I think that the red Sox are a slight favorite and this was I was wondering was coming on something like this around\nMinus one twenty five Boston ah you know being home that they'll they'll be probably around one twenty five one thirty what was the number that was slated if it was going to be this ... you know with Boston get in a home field\nUh so I think they're going to get good to a action\nArnie believe it or not um I don't think they're going to get one sided action than you you didn't see anything immediately\nColumn in a one that line went up so it's going to be interesting between now in game one on Tuesday to see if any of the betting syndicates getting involved and more importantly where the public bets their money I probably going to come in on Boston the home team but\nI don't know I I could see Dodgers money coming in especially out here on the west coast\nHow much action does the world series or an individual game or whatever get I mean we know football's king in this country but but how how does baseball compare relatives on his ...\n... it's not going to get that the the volume that football does no not no other sport does um\nBut with that said baseball in October is when it gets the most by a betting action the first month ... sided with the start of baseball on April but nothing like when October rolls around and when you get into the world series\nMore times than not it's going to depend on the match up um you know are they more key teams uh with big fan bases or those small market teams and this year we got a\nTeams with two huge a fan bases major cities I saw I think this one's going to do extremely well again not your your football type numbers but it'll surpassed your prime time NFL games I Would put it up there with the NFL playoff game\nUm as far as World Series game by game action goes\nBy let's get the college football oh my goodness give me a little money on Purdue over Ohio said how did the books do on that one and I'm sure when he was paid ... billion this where\nYeah you know the winds guys weren't all Purdue that line dropped down to his lowest twelve\nBut the public obviously was Ohio State we thought we were going to get Ohio State Michigan at the end of the season I Am with they're still going to play by the hour we'll see how that game shapes up now oh house there was a minus five hundred favorites a while and often about minus four fifty\nA plus three fifty on Purdue so you've got three and a half to one on your money on that home dog if you put it on the money line if you stay\nYou laid five to win one and not a good result it all the game did end up going over a barely a ... point or two and again that wasn't a great result for the book says as both a sharp send the public were betting that game over\nOne thing already and I were arguing about a little bit a minute ago so central Florida look\nI'm just saying we know they're not famine Notre Dame whatever but at a certain point you win so many games in a row\nI just think we should at least keep them in the conversation if they let me go bam because there's so much better than everybody else if they were on a neutral field against the Michigan Notre Dame ones in one of those one of those teams at the top that using them what kind of points are we looking at\nOK you see ads on a on a neutral field against Michigan would be about I'd say easily hot\nTo touch down favorite while around ... eleven twelve points at the least\nI'm gay because if I guess Alabama they'd be three touchdown favorites easily probably\nA little higher than that but the books were bringing out lower obviously because they're in the business of managing risk\nIt they're going between what they're going to put out as as a true line compared to a fair line a fair lines meant to split the bending action and put them with limited risk limited liability or if they you know put a real or true\nNumber out there that that's meant the split the result long term teammate supposed to cover fifty percent of the time at this point spread team be supposed to cover fifty percent of the time\nAt this point spread since they get eleven attend long term if they can do that they're going to turn a profit so they probably wouldn't put Alabama's a three touchdown favorite or Michigan as a two touchdowns favor because the public would come in one sided only UCF thinking they're better than that number reflects\nBut I'm telling you what what happened is the public would be on your ...\nAnd the winds guys would be stepping over each other to get to the window to on the load on the favorite\nKnowing this line eight nine out because believe it or not um you know teams like Clemson Georgia Michigan all those would be you know to touch down favorites believe it or not over UCF based strictly on power ratings alone what the odds makers we'll numbers look like\nAll right let's get to the NFL let's do with the New England patriots in Chicago the bears no patriots had a lot of time to prepare for the kids to the game they're like ten days you're not getting that the advantage and this one\nChicago who ... who mouth was hold on one of the less practices but then the rug didn't make the trip wind open up a two and a half the patriots were favored\nThat one now down to two maybe even want to know what's going on your biggest runner\nWise guys love Chicago Arnie that's one that every every group that I provide betting it accounts for that bed NFL when long term doing well\nHave Chicago plus three in their pocket already well they really like Chicago in this match up and and I agree I mean most our ratings at least from the winning guys ... favorite in this game um mostly the wrong team is favored I mean listen this line reflects that in in New England\nKnowing that would be around six six and a half point favorite\nAgain she can't go and I mean they were six and a half at home against Miami um there were six and a half against Houston and Chicago is a much better team I think then that ah so I I think I this is more reflection of the the wives guys taking advantage of the the books having to put a a higher number than they shut up\nYou should write an article about bad contracts I mean we always hear about the ... one you know that oh yeah I'm and real quick I just got to stop and talk for just one second\nBecause a way of Stevenson was taken down by the neck ooh ah and ah there was no tough all the players that kind of gather around I'm shocked\nI'm I'm absolutely shocked that it didn't get into a subject a little bit more physical I I don't know if you guys have the game on was that when Stevens it looked like yeah yeah No Child maybe it was a little bit\nNot as much as I made a good take her out in the neck though\nIt was Josh heart but Lance Stevenson jumped right in and was not having it at all\nIt's All right so there you go on that sort of just kind of a jump on that one um yeah so yeah we're obviously\nA yeah have you get the best way is that you should write a story on who has the best contracts obviously Bobby beneath his name keeps coming up I remember the old time people like are needy or to the ... or was getting paid I still might be getting paid what some of these crazy contracts that are out there and\nI'll give you one how about you your boy Kevin someone\nBecause and I'll tell you why if I'm not mistaken\nAll these other guys that had all these massive buyouts\nThey had a stipulation where if they accepted a new deal obviously they're ... right I Believe Kevin someone was paid his entire buyout within like a month of losing his job why now he's at Arizona making money new check\nKnew everything got up those double paychecks yes like you when you were in that arby's commercial\nThat [laughter] I'd\nA couple of things before we get ready for the next segment I just wanted to wrap it up put a bowl on this one I'm Nick Saban getting ice do that I'm obviously you know that would have been the biggest story of the show today if we didn't have so much else going on I'm a I didn't hear the post game conference by coach saving but\nUh the police did go into the stands remove the tendency fend for a nap\nOr nothing crazy bumped supply something like this hasn't happened more often era\nYeah well I mean we saw last week a New England with Terry kill right and uh it's just you know listen I I think that it's one thing if you want to yell it's one thing if you want to scream I never have a problem if a fan like yell stupid stuff when you start throwing stuff\nThat's ... that's what I think it crosses the line or by the way we're not going to our topic for are we not doing that this week top five ... I'm like a kind of forgot you want to squeeze it in right here real quick well I'll just tell me real quick I was just thinking about it I completely forgot myself so\nWell it's yeah I mean I'll I'll give it to you real quick right now if I'm going to go ahead and do it and that's obviously dropping a what Ohio State did because they're no longer going to go out to be number two so my number one team is still going to go and be Alabama there's not going to be a change or obviously number two is good to be Clemson\nThough I really hate to put them there I'm going to put Notre Dame and number three have LSU\nAt number four I don't you don't like when I Do my top five um but it's not even five I may jump Michigan over Georgia so I've missed you get in Georgia and I'm probably going to drop Ohio State uh to number seven just to add to Texas and central Florida in Oklahoma\nO. so Oklahoma's behind all those teams interesting yeah what do you think you've got your top four what yeah I got to have four ... number one bam a number two now uh there's so much better than it was\nFamily one Notre Dame to I still think ooh this I think that the second best team in the country I really do I mean they play great defense and they got to be in book\nOr three I Will go LSU cause I think their resume is more impressive\nOr I Will go Clemens and and then right on the outside I'm with you I think Michigan is that one last team that that right now they certainly have the best loss of any one of the real contenders\nOr so ago Michigan at five Georgia six although Oklahoma looked really get to that we're in there one that they're kind of everyone just forgot about him it wouldn't surprise me if if if that last Sunday there that team that gets at one of those spots\nAll right how are the

on the east coast anymore in the NBA got used to this idea that they were going to have the ability to really take advantage of all abroad and had the lead in for everybody on the west coast\nI'll kick their coverage with clay tribe and six am eastern three I'm putting it back on Fox Sports radio\nWhen Mike harm\nJohn grew and if he could get a one in something else for dirt car he would trade

St driving said more progressive dot com for call one eight hundred progressive\nJonah socks Fox Sports radio [noise]\nOdd\nComing out in less than ten minutes from now here on FX are we are going to have [noise]\nMy Carmen Fox Sports radios fantasy football insider who will be in the studio a little bit of disco fantasy it gets wild man look you're playing fantasy football a lot of your seasons are on the brink do not go anywhere he's the best in the business and we will have that for a year less than ten minutes from now you're on Fox Sports radio so\nNormally we do in all NFL our here this final hour is dedicated to nothing but the NFL um but I I noticed\nSomething that I Do think is interesting and when she just bear with me here because I I I think I'm reading into something a ... and I I think there's lakes to this and it's not so much a conspiracy theory but just something that I've noticed I'm\n... I'm seeing something that Kyrie Irving is doing in interviews and I think I Know why he's doing it and decisions he's made I'm a firm believer\nYou learn more from seeing people do things the wrong way as opposed to doing the right way I've always been like that um the greatest lessons I've ever had in life are seeing somebody ...\nI've always been like that um the greatest lessons I've ever had in life are seeing somebody screw up and going yeah I don't want to ever do that again I don't I Want to make sure I don't do that myself\nAnd so you sort of learn how to treat people or be around people based on people that you work with and it's like anything like any anything in in work anything in in whatever you you you treat the people the way that you were treated the way that you were impacted by house somebody treated you growing up\nAnd so I'm always very cognizant of that and I'm always on the lookout if somebody makes a mistake I Want to use it as as a learning lesson Conor McGregor is coach\nI'm a Kavanaugh and I forget his first name ... I think it's John cabin uh he had a great term after they lost to ... Diaz first Sunday last\nHe said uh you either win or you learn\nIt there is no losing you either win or you learn and it's true and I think that Kyrie Irving has learned something\nSo after the Celtics beat the Knicks on Saturday Night Kyrie Irving was talking and answering questions as honestly as you'll hear an athlete talk about the potential of going somewhere else\nWe hear a lot of these rumors and reports about players going here or player signing with this team or what's going on after the season is over or they're going to get together or or Kevin ... is interested in the nicks are all this stuff\nAnd Kyrie Irving is the first guy I can remember who's addressing it with the media and so they were asking about the appeal of going to New York and whether or not it was a real thing and he said look yeah it was absolutely everybody was under\nConsideration of the Knicks were or definitely under consideration the opportunity to go to New York I'm I grew up in Jersey that to play with Christopher ... yeah definitely that was you know that was in consideration and that's really what I was thinking about\nBut ultimately I just decided the Boston was the best spot for me here was Kyrie Irving afterwards\nI mean you know I I think if you are officers who views [laughter]\nYou know thinking about who we have in the future and what we're set of for [noise] for me it was a you know where I Am an age of how I visit my career going\nOut of the laser ... for me in the Boston Celtics is something that I wanted to be a part of so I'm obviously my mom in Boston so I had a lot of history there as well obviously if they're losers because there's this reserve of buses and stuff like\nI didn't Kyrie Irving watch LeBron James and how LeBron James handled his future and I think he said I'm not doing that\nThat's not how I'm doing it because reportedly part of the reason that he wanted out of Cleveland is because\nHe wasn't sure what the bronze plan was moving forward and I think he was bothered by that that it was always some mystery or it had to be some grand announcement or it had to be a decision or had to be something like that and so Kyrie Irving learned how not to do it\nBy watching LeBron James so here we are a couple of games end of the season and he's already come out and said I'm not going anywhere\nThis is where I'm going to be\nHe announced it to the season ticket holders after he'd already told us teammates\nAll these reports all these rumors and he's been in contact with the Celtics ownership group and he's been in contact with Celtics management and Brad Stevens for months letting them know yeah I'm not going anywhere no I mean I'm definitely and it's been so transparent but it's almost weird\nBut it's because LeBron James is set this tone and the standard in the NBA that if you leave them make a big deal of it\nYou know if you go somewhere don't tell anybody until the last minute I get to this big God grand entrance and this big grand announcement and Kyrie Irving I think looked at that and was so annoyed with it when he played with him and he said I'm not doing it like that\nF. that I'm not doing it I'm going to be honest about it I'm going to let you know exactly what I think there is not going to be any hidden messages there is not going to be any passive aggressive tweets or Instagram posed this is what it is this is what my plan is\nI'm going to learn from how he did it the wrong way and that's how I'm going to attack this off season and that's where I'm going to attack being a free agent\nAnd I actually think it's kind of a a refreshing with all the drama and all the blow Harding is in the NBA I think it's refreshing\nThat he's taking this approach a Jonah stocks here Fox Sports radio uh well let's you know we are brought to buy discover card become a new card member and discover card will match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar at the end of your first year learn more I discovered dot com slash match limitations apply\nA I was thinking about this as we get back into the NFL I promise that'll that'll probably never happen again that we actually touch on a little bit of MBA and the NFL our I just thought it was interesting so either that or is that upset you\nI'm I'm not apologizing but uh the Vikings and the jets it is they want to eastern time kick off on Fox\nThis game 'cause I'm going to pose a question to you\nIf you remember in the offseason the jets offered Kirk Cousins more guaranteed money than the Vikings did Kurt cousins took the ... from the Vikings because he felt like they were better football team and there was a better opportunity to win and he's probably right\nDefinitely a better football team definitely a better roster he passed up more guaranteed money and he decided um Minnesota good for him\nBut\nIn doing so the jets were forced to figure out the quarterback spot and so what ended up happening it was a trickle down effect the jets moved up to number three in the draft\nAnd it was some help from the browns who took Baker Mayfield and some help from the giants who took sake while I'm Barkley the jets ended up getting their top guy at number three which they had no idea what's going to be available to him at the time so they ended up with Sam Darnell\nI just thought it was funny because you can't just have everything else why don't you throw it out on a lot of clout by yeah with him about I I got to go ... I Can't wait till ... check to see the grassy knoll my [laughter] on yeah I got to think you go up top\nTo Josh ... of the game where he gets a little more activity down feel ... Kamara banged up\nA you've got some other issues in that especially no clue Mac for a hundred percent or at least that's what we're told yeah again a kitten you I got to think that guy's going to watch in that tape their pride got hurt a little bit so they rally in front of the home crowd a but otherwise we're going to go into\nA little deeper on the the tight end position you know and in joke you against Tampa Bay they're given up by ... points to a game to opposing side and\nOpportunity there you go a little bit deeper you got the J Zuma for Cincinnati going up against Kansas City because people would dive into the wire usual Rob Gronkowski we had the red flag here's one where it's it's a red alert or that he probably doesn't go\nAll right so my comment on Fox Sports radio fantasy football inside her final one from you and this is where we get our ninja pick of the week and under the radar pick from my Carmen\nSomebody who may be available in some of your leagues give us a quarterback right or there's a lot of there's some ... weeks and they're starting to pile up for teams into Pittsburgh zada by if you're out there and you're desperate and you need a quarterback who's played you\nKind of like in this spot this week doubled down with ... look at you you wanna you wanna get a little bit uh getting a little bit loose\nLike I've got to make a decision between him and Drew Brees I don't know that I Want your breeze against the Baltimore Ravens on the\nRoad that I'm On my ass sided on then you know I've got to wind down right you know and I ate out on his you know it was wrong\nYeah no I I agree a hundred percent or ... of with New England come into town\nYou certainly got an opportunity there if you lie Manning's ever going to put up a fantasy day to day against Atlanta the Monday Night football yeah my ... if you're ever going to have an opportunity to play him and roll to die agree I like the older than I Am I think the ... big in that game I lie for I like what you're talking\nAnd then on the running back position or just one guy to pick up on the other side of that game Smith\nIf you haven't already developed a frame and outs of the year Schmidt's been used alongside to having Goldman reps go up giants ... minutes they're Super Bowl yeah it's it's kind of like we had with the Denver Broncos the other night if if I'd have been able to get to Vegas and just pile a bunch of money\nI mean Denver that that was the lock of the year that what that game was leading up to a and then the fact that anybody still got a job in Arizona's amazing\n[noise] um my comment Fox Sports radio fantasy football inside or get them on Twitter at\nSwollen dome harassed them with your fan of bring it on and make sure you check out my Carmen and Dan buyer Fox football fantasy coming up a nine to eleven eastern time here on Fox Sports radio\nBiking thanks so much you want to stick around for a little profit model I'm ready to send off the bike mayor I'll yeah it is they send out to end up process that monster is back next year on Fox Sports radio [noise]\n\nIt is it Fox Sports radio [noise]\nAnd we're taking over your city is you're going to see what they just said ...\nWhat is that what we do know he does it better than we do get used to weigh in the world is favored Fox Sports radio [laughter]\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you see veterans rights they knew Michelin premium ...\nDesigned with exclusive smart military offering must be the Michelin laid switched to the curb of your which giving you a ... long lasting only reform\nSo when the going\nMichelin really ... it's a different you can see a billboard Walmart and then on the line retailers\nAnd now are far from Geico motorcycle it took Fifteen minutes to purchase the gas station eggs salad [noise]\nEat the gas station ...

went to bed\nWith ten twenty five every day for forty five yeah I always like during a with a woman because that's what he says I've gone to bed every night and wake up every morning I'm going\nWell good I'm happy I'm Glad it worked out for you I Hope your husband's approve of that but I Know it's it's very very very nice and but I think that's the relationship that we have this community that people have done you know local news\nAh it ... we are a very appreciative of the people inviting us into their homes every night I think that's the one thing with this day and age of social media and people are on the other devices all the time and it's it's all information but it's not real personal\nAnd I think that's the one thing that local television local radio can do still does I think it's more important today than ever before\nBecause we do feel like we bond with people and I think that's what everyone's lacking right now or it's just it's so a distance and and so informal that I think that the fact that you know we are invited to the people's homes and they listen to us or watch us a mix all the more meaningful\nIt's been very meaningful watching you on TV and my friend thank you and Thanks Mike\nThat's mark Rosen and Mike grim Rosen says he plans to continue his frequent radio work with the twin cities sports station and will still be on television occasionally after he signs off in April [noise]\nTerrain says the real secret sauce for his success is always being alert for inspiration\nI'm thinking about it pretty much the around if I'm Out hiking or canoeing or fishing I'm thinking about hey is this gonna work for that contest so I I have the I enter about eight contests they'll year and I have those on my mind all the time\nWith all his prior success terrain said this year's winning pheasant product stands out as his favorite so far\nIs the first time that I have one or the president's stamp with a male and female 'cause usually it's just the lone male that I had painted it's very hard for the judges pick one with a male and female because most of the judges are not as familiar with the female of the species as they are with the male which makes them little has content I'm picking one\nBecause they don't want to be Ryan chase or something technically wrong with it so when I put this together I thought my gosh this is such a great top position and I just love to have the female and they're you know it to me it shows that they're meeting and there are together and there's going to be more ... and I just like that idea and also this one I put more scenery and this one\nAnd then keep it as designing as I did my other one so I kind of went out on a limb on this and I ended up doing really really well\nTerrains love for the outdoors makes the conservation aspect of the contests a huge draw for him but he also wants to help further the craft of wildlife art\nI Want to keep this going in Minnesota this is where I live I just want these to continue and what I think is really interesting that I really enjoyed doing of going to the judging\nAnd meeting young artists who have entered for the first time or they've been just doing this maybe the second or third year and they're always they're always on the last table they're not getting moved to the second round or the first round and I sit with them and we talk about their painting I talk about mine\nAnd they are really really enlightened and where to go and that's about the only way I can think I can bring these people into creating better and entering so that we can keep it going\nAs for slowing down that's not into ... plans just yet\nI'm gonna keep painting as long as my eyesight holds up and I'm able to keep my hands steady and thank God I'm able to do both those still you know and of course I've thought about you know what happens if I get Parkinson's and what happens but I\nI put that aside and said what happens what happens is down the road you gotta do

brought my pastor Alex Amy\n\nGood morning again special welcome to those who are visiting with us today grace in peace to you from God our father and the Lord Jesus Christ by to just stand as you're able in honor of the reading of God's word they the Old Testament lesson if I say a chapter fifty five versus one through nine\n\nFor nine\nUnder the inspiration of the Holy Spirit the profit I as a a writes in chapter fifty five beginning with first one\nOh everyone who first come to the waters and you who have no money come by\nAnd eat yes come by wine and milk without money and without price [noise] why do you spend money for what is not bread and your wages for what does not satisfy listen carefully to me and eat what is good\n\nAnd let your soul delight itself and abundance inclined your ear and come to me here and your soul show live and I will make an everlasting covenant with you the shore and mercy of David\nIndeed I have given him as a witness to the people a leader and commander for the people surely you show call a nation you did not know\nAnd nations who did not know you should run to you because of the larger God and the holy one of Israel for he is glorified you seek the lord well he may be found call upon him while he's near let the wicked for ... sake his way and the un righteous man his thoughts let him returned to the lord\nAnd he will have mercy on him and to our God ... pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts\nNor are my ways your ways says the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth\nThey knew what justice look black but they didn't know oh God yes God will judge those who in on belief reject the forgiveness of Jesus Christ which was one for them as to cross\nBut God is so merciful that anyone who believes on the name of Jesus Christ will be saved even if that one was responsible for killing Christ we see this mercy\nFor those responsible for Christ's death an ax chapters two and three and Peter sermon on panic cost fifty days after ... death and resurrection you spoke to the Jews in Jerusalem and in the middle of the sermon he says starting an axe to versus twenty two\nMen of Israel here these words Jesus of Nasser if Amanda tested to you by God\nWith mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him and your midst as you yourself know this jeeze us delivered off according to the definite plan and for knowledge of God you crucified\nAnd killed by the hands of law this man God raised him up losing the pangs of death because it was not possible for him to be held by yet\nSo Peter has accused\nThe crowd before him of killing Jesus he's proclaimed Christ resurrection and then he goes on to explain how king David spoken the spirit of how desk can hold the Lord's anointed\nAnd then as the exclamation point to the whole sermon Peter seven X. two verse thirty six\nLet all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both lord and Christ\nThis Jesus whom you crucified in the parable Jesus told the fares sees expected the landowner to mercilessly judge the wicked vine dressers who killed his son\nBut they didn't know his son nor did they know the Mercedes of God do you know the mercy of God for you it was your sense that sent Jesus to his death\nLike Peter said and accept or to this Jesus you crucified and killed by the hands of law his men if you think like a fair see then there's no mercy for us in like that\nIf you think like a fair see than perhaps you have other big fins in your closet that you think you can never be forgiven for\nTheir conscience this bird and with the weight of your sin and you think that there's no mercy for you than God's word and I say a fifty five or ... eight is for you gods said my thoughts\nAre not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways says the lord inverse seven there's the invitation of God for centers like us let him return to the lord Isaiah said\nAnd he will have mercy on him and to our God for he will abundantly part and and this is the mercy Peter extended to those who we're sorry for their sin and acts chapter to it says inverse thirty seven\nNow when they heard this they were cut to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles brothers what shall we do\nAnd Peter said to them repent\nBrothers what shall we do and Peter said to them repent\nAnd be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the Holy Spirit for the promises for you and for your children and all who are far off everyone who whom the lord our God cause to himself\nIn his rights his judgment God judged Jesus as guilty\nFor your son and he and his infinite mercy he abundantly pardons you the fair sees and chief priest refused to know God's mercy toward singers they did not humble themselves as the centers they were before God\nJesus Says to them and Matthew Twenty one verse forty to have you never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone this was the Lord's doing and then this marvelous in our audience\nWhat does it mean\nThat the stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone we might think at first that those builders must have had any sense\nTo reject what would become the cornerstone that's why it was fair sees rejected Christ but think about it when someone is building with stones or with any material they pick and choose what to use and what not to use builders are smart enough\nTo choose good strong looking stones\nAnd to reject the poor week looking stone affairs these then reject Jesus because they weren't smart enough to receive him\nThey rejected Jesus because he was lonely and humble and didn't fit with their ways and their thought he was the stone that the builders rejected he was poor week looking like a throwaway stone\nBut by submitting himself to the will of the father and offering himself as they once for all sacrifice for since he became the chief cornerstone upon which our\nSalvation stands for\nThe stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone this was the Lord's doing and then this marvelous and our eyes as the world the devil and the flash entice as us into thin and and we spiritually spend money on what is not bread and our wages\nOn what does not satisfy what are we guilty of\nWhen we choose thin where like the builders rejecting the less attractive\nStone which has Christ when we saying we're really guilty of sending Jesus to his death like the crowd Peter preached to were guilty of the death of God's sunlight the vine dressers who killed the messengers and the landowners son our sin is deadly treason\nAgainst God so what shall we do\nWe should repent in return to the mercy of God in Christ Jesus\n\nWhat will God do to us when he returns friends because of God's great mercy and Christ towards centers like us we get to look forward to God's return like Peter said and first Peter one\nVerse Thirteen we set our whole Foley on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ all close this message\nWith these verses from my is a chapter fifty five versus six or seven seek the lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near let the wicked for ... sake his way and the on righteous man his thoughts\nThat have returned

Scott who was a sports writer so I got this kid across the street bugging me no matter who shows up and I and I did and I to this day I don't know why they didn't make believe for me to certainly wasn't anything special just hanging out\nPhiladelphia will take a high school scores on a friday night and then they'll know grabbing ripping in a row reading a wire copy in typing to my fingers started bleeding and figure out how to write copy into legible copy that somebody could read on the air so\nBut I learned the basic from the best probably ever existed at a local news or sell 'em at all it all turned out somehow some way and it's it's just a credible how the flash it it's gone by this fast\nAnd you think of all the different things over the years that you've covered I Know you're going to um I think kind of the last marquee event will be the final four of us banks stadium in terms of of all time or work in the right and then you get one more marquee event had Superbowl last year and um all kinds of different things over the course of your career\nWill yeah a lot of uh locally based as well um I I think you think of course a lot of time of fans here and we haven't had that many bright spots but uh you know the seven Ninety One World Series but more than the event itself I think the the relationship not only the media had but it but the fans had with with those players I think that's something is missing today there was a real connection with\nThat group for the twins in particular that lost a hundred and two games that they can Nineteen eighty two and we saw them kind of grow up right before our eyes and we all know the names by now but\nThere was a real bond and I I think that's missing we'll use that word loyalty and sports anymore is Jerry Seinfeld says you're cheering for laundry but I think back in that day when you had ... pocketing guy Eddie and her ... laundering viola go out on the line\nThey were part of our fabric in this community and people really glom drawn to that team and and those teams in particular so those those are will always stand out obviously ah going back before that to the lake placid and and what happened in Nineteen eighty a will always stand out\nThere are certain individual moments but I think the bond in relationships it's always been about relationships beyond the games and I think that's what I'm most proud of in terms of my career\nWhen you made the announcement I'm obviously everyone wanted to talk to about it to congratulate you on that what you mean when you hear what you meant to people with our listeners what his coworkers and colleague\nI I'm I'm honestly uh blown away by because you're you know like you know this business you're you're it's a day by day thing you don't have retreats like a lot of businesses do you don't go on these ... a long weekend some talk about how we going to make things differently you just go literally day to day to day to day to day and\nYou know I and I I ... I've had a lot of uh insurance I bet a lot of insurance who I'm because I've always wanted to pay it forward knowing what the people did for me that if I get it like a proud pop a great deal of satisfaction seeing that they've had success if they stayed in this career or gone on to another career and so when people come back to me and\nDuring this time in particular and say hey I Can't take enough are treated me so well and\nAnd to always giving me a helpful a piece of advice or whatever the case may be ... yeah I mean it's it's astonishing because that's all you can ask for\nIn life that is the stuff that's the most meaningful and I've gotten so many emails from people that little things meeting people airports or whatever it might be say a time for my son to take a picture a signing autographs or whatever it is in a debt stuffed means as much to me as as any pro athlete coming up to me manic something and then when you hear\nAs as any pro athlete coming up to me up\nAnd then when you hear feedback to from viewers who will say you know hey\nI went to bed with ten twenty five every day for forty five hours like during the ... are going to do this every night with every morning I'm like\nWell I'm happy I'm going to ward off or to approve of that but no it's it's very very very nice but I think just the relationship that we have this group of people have gotten all local news\nAh and we are a group of people inviting us into their homes every night and I think that's one thing with this day and age of social media people are on the other devices all the time but it's\nIt's all information but it's not real personal\nAnd I think that's one thing that local or television or radio to do still does I think it's more important today than ever before\nBecause we do feel like we bond with people and that's just what everyone was walking right now it's just it's so a distance in so informal that last week the the the fact that you know we are invited to people's homes and they listen to us watches a mix all the more meaningful\nIt's been very meaningful watching you on TV my friend thank you very much\nThat's more grows and in my room Rosen says he plans to

ACT\nJoining me now is state education commissioner Brenda ... commissioner I understand these improved scores could be related to a legislative move made a few years back can you explain\nYet thanks Tasha several years ago the legislature passed a\nLaw to provide the ACT to all juniors to give them an opportunity to be able to take the test and both their junior and their senior year this would give them time to practice and and I think that this is why we're seeing our scores or be steady as we have more participation and more\nEquitable opportunities for kids for instance the kids who can't take the test because they don't have a test station close to them now they take the test right in their high school and so all we know that the in college and career ready as\nAn absolute

I don't know what that was doing\nYou former Lyme it have to be upset with that he had plenty of time he was on his own to yard line backed up these of course a passing so he's in his own ends all ages hold on to the old don't do it and then finally ally Becker do that\nIt'll end zone and he just hold on to hold onto it and then finally linebacker comes after him and he just about to get sacked that he realizes so then he just kind of those are on the ground follows it he's\nPins into the end zone [noise]\nAnd instead of taking the safety for almost a ball and gives a protest\nI then I drove you crazy and drove all was great to watch it as well they have for twenty left in this game back in the cowboys I said oh he just avoided the fact\nThere are there still trying to find a way to get back in this thing and and at least tired maybe put it in overtime or find a way to win it um so I Want to get to spend ...\nJust Gordon a touchdown videos to throw that out they're screened passed from Jared golf uh for me about their teen yards out\nSo I'm thinking yes he is the MVP I mean obviously we have a lot of football left but I mean it's getting embarrassing how good he is and how many times he scores in the game he laugh at looking it's crazy man I Wonder if I get another call Judea commercial\n[noise]\nRidiculous thirty eight to ten rams over the forty niners right now\nOnly under its own undefeated team in league\nThat Scrabble and got a first down there is a flag so we'll see what happened there are well in why we have a little time and by the way states up twenty four Seventeen however the Joe Flaco and the ravens throughout the ball they're marching and they're at their own forte with about\nA minute fifty left in that game and as you guys mentioned the ravens are the only team that Drew Brees has not been in his ... hall of fame career\nSo he's trying to do that but the raven still have plenty of times during the time out as well or not yeah they do have one time out left so they have plenty of time to get this thing done at least tied the game as a complete a nice passed now they're on the other side of the field about the state's forty two yard line with a minute twenty five left plenty of time come on just need\nI Will just ride this thing out for a moment here and I'll get to the NBA suspensions and just a moment\nJoe Flaco us back\nFind Crabtree over the middle ... first down all down to earth laid out the thirty two\nYard line of the saints on the other side of this day we have a get a twenty to ten Redskins a lead and the cowboys trying to do something off of the specially that blood from Prescott so\nWe'll see what Joe flack was able to do here of course a I have a feeling that they get close enough we'll see a Lamar jak society and this is what I mean by close enough as they are on the fifteenth ...\nNow they can't put a put the ball in his hand at this point in the game they been doing it every other to an hour you can't\nDo that this one this one was important if you don't want to miss hand or a ... because the direct\nHit you're going to write don't anymore I mean it's been all of them are Jackson that's true [laughter] and he was like all the way what do I do in the red zone again but nobody wants to answer those questions so why don't you take Joe Flaco out and uh yeah that you're bringing Lamar jak semi finals\nYou don't want those now you don't want that All right I'm going to casually start rolling these out and if there's a score or anything that happens big in the game will give you of course an update so this is from New York this is from Kiki a bad way and who is executive vice president of basketball operations\nAs Adrian ... earlier and or Alex Rodriguez was we were talking about with him or was it I I Can't remember it was out it was also asked what thought a four games for bread and ...\nAnd now all raven ... face down raven okay ravens well yet action they Drew Brees you can break every record but you're not being ... that's the way [laughter] we got to hold on to that\nUh twenty three twenty four PIN dean the extra point ... showing we I Know that means\nWe know that means so Joe Flaco drives in the down the field gets him in a position to tie the game he's done his party\nHas on his part test on the John Brown is that is part and I don't see\nI just I you know I almost don't want to make it just so I can hear you talk about pickers non want to do that man I I Want him to be able to do his job but want everybody to be able to do their job to the best of their ability\nYou know the ravens are the AFC version of the Panthers oh that makes sense if you love their explosive nothing gray hairs look up if I give you the St Charles why we should have this game to back\nOh this he said they missed it you've got even mention the extra point with twenty four seconds left and that was just a sucker\nJust into their enemy calling him on the other word of ... the same ... up twenty four to twenty three total joining forces that can wherever it may look Ron ...\nWhen I Need is is ridiculous and missed is why you don't get to ride back home with us\nToday when a field goal was almost guaranteed was automatic you like all of that and you went into the kitchen and got the ... and came back to the point was good as the three pointers good no matter where they kicked it from what we talked in languages seven member you all do you feel you know up to\nSeven you would say I haven't seen it wasn't it was seven it was like wow I have a field goal because they're always making it now so much best\nThing the best rule the NFL has ever change your light of it that rural ... or you know what that's the best way you want and excitement\nTrue if you are you going to do is we just where I feel about it\nAnd you're like really ... all the way where should happen right this is ridiculous Justin Tucker you've been lead to long now you're going to try to keep going on\nI can watch them get on ... just to make this even more so he's not going to get\nOn a key not after having that sit on his jokes like that not after having this little so the there there are holes in your body\nHow do you think how you think he says officials right now to real says how do you think ...\n... just in terms of the great teammates Flaco driving a team down great drive get a touchdown we did our job you do it ... it was a bad kid to like eat me he makes it border line Izzy\nDyslexic in that he thought there was another up right on the other side\nI missed by a lot it almost miss the rise thought oh well our left there right side of the net goodness gracious man I went home with a souvenir look at him looking eyes wide how'd that happen\nWhy and what happened here because okay when they were then waged to going back to the what is the fifty now\nWhen they did that I don't remember this many miss kicks that year but what has happened to ... this is and you can tell leaves upset talking about families over there we go it ...\nDoes it does come are get anything for that I doubt it I Wish does that count as the cat out of the\nAlvin tomorrow the saints uh recovers the on site kick twenty three seconds left in the game ravens have one time out doesn't matter\nGame blouses man on the other screen that Prescott is on the ... over to thirty left in the game a down into the red zone a Washington on the boat well not quite on the red zone Twenty one yard line move going in\nAnd they have three time outs to\nAnd obviously if they were to score here they have the uh the two point\nIt would only a three point game right now so you you unless you were talking about it's over and I'll say no there's a chance that's\nPrescott runs it in the end zone and they get the extra point was again are not given any more [laughter] show the Redskins are up twenty to Seventeen it's thirty nine for the Redskins the ah cowboys decided to kick off as opposed to going for the onsite kick so big big big play for both teams here\nAnd the rams are forty nine and can I just round the clock\nAre you allowed to just forfeit I'd just running clock are you allowed to join yeah just like we are there should be in agreement with the coach of on both sides agree we agreed to a running clock to just run the clock 'cause at three twenty four left but the rams are thirty nine or ten on the forty niners and the rams had the ball so it's just it's just getting brutal\nI mean they need to do like intentionally walking batters just hey we're gonna we're not gonna waste these four pitchers will just put 'em on first base All right we'll keep you updated on this Redskin as a game as again the cowboys are looking to a comeback\nGreat tackled their Alex Smith tries to run for the first down almost got the first number two we are short but the bad part is he goes out of bounds\nYeah so it saves the cowboys from having to use their last time out silently hawk them down which is why one of the ... line why he wanted a better run linebackers and the games\nRunning fast man\nThat tackle still live I took a little odd Alex Smith so now it's more than three they're going to ... and a Dallas will get the ball so we'll keep you up to ... ... what's that being said hey we got action we do have accident that game\nA which will be good that we have another game that is going down to the wire want to give you a brand new ... suspended for games and the good thing about this or that kind of explain why I got to get to the Arab side anger management suspended for aggressively returning to an escalating the application throwing a punch\nIn the direction of Paul confronting a game of fish in the hospital he tried to check the rough if you recall right it was a bit much and I get an overall incident by shoving rockets James Harden so that was strange ... if if if you saw it he pushes James Harden aback because those are stuck in the restaurant and would actually be an end when he's not even thinking about bringing her\nAnd so burning or we just got heated out of the blue and decided to try to take it to the streets Rondo has been suspended for instigating a physical altercation with a and spinning and throw it out so they did say spinning\nAnd throwing multiple punches so it's with three games were Rondo and then to for Chris Paul who's been a he's serving his suspension tonight when the rockets play the clippers\nI don't have to miss another game as well so there you have it um those are the suspensions for those NBA players in last night's like a rocket a brawl you call those suspense is more\nHonest I Am a I think Brandon should have got the the biggest suspension because he came back into the male am swinging the people from behind and I'm a that's just you know\nA huge square up a new going back and forth and all that tend to go high but when you come into the ... you come back into the may lay like that and you throw a punch as someone who can't see you ... we can't\nDo that especially when I still get while you were in it and the first place you know you're mad because James Harden down in the fall and he lay up and you thought it shouldn't have been in and when it was pretty strange\nYeah I'm okay with to be honest with you I applaud the NBA for not getting carried away yeah because the NBA I used to get carried away with gene gay yeah they've I mean one game than you know five million dollars and all these different things they used to get carried away that's the problem by the way\nUh with the Dallas Cowboys they don't have that downhill threat as you mentioned the off year we were talking about it they just do about thirty are passed a call ... ... you know it didn't work out so certain type for the cowboys again we'll let you know what happens on display but I I thought I applaud the NBA for not overreacting\n[noise] yeah I wanted to gay for Chris Ball pushing the bigger the guys I don't want to come to mind I mean\nIt it it was heated uh you got to point guards who ... you know have spicy demeanor is to say the least uh and so I just think you know both guys have had problems with their own teammates like you know so you know they're not going to like each other\nThat's a great point and big big big big play back Prescott colby's they pick up about twenty twenty five yard pass it looked like a Kobe doesn't look ups right there\nYeah he did he went up and got it uh they're currently uh what about the ... to forty five yard line yeah probably about ... I Would say ten to Fifteen Years away from Google range but who knows what that is these days that's [laughter]\nFor it or have you done one of the week we see we've just witness an extra point being missed\nYou know who's by one but then earlier and earlier game we see a fifty nine yard field goal kicked\nTo win it over a hundred or so I don't know what the range is in that same kicker for the browns are for the buccaneers Mr early yet so I\nI don't know is I think three extra points I don't know what I don't have to do it we don't know and the brown just sitting there saying there's no way no way that he may there's all the feel goes we had a chance to win and he had the nerve to make this has been actually will be a a ridiculous\nI don't know what's going on we had to figure it out we have to see what's going to happen um I don't know if you know twenty yard field goal or sixty or if it well they both\nI don't know if you know a twenty yard field goal or sixty or if it well they're both don't seem to be the same thing that's\nA great point eight oh why one of the places like earlier in the see the last week I Believe it was when Aaron Rodgers what our Aaron Rodgers last week against or who was it against\nWho was the comeback of the Packers last week I Can't I just stopped talking about or was it the ... what was it the skiing can't remember but the Packers he came back and he kept\nGoing those amazing passes and you're like okay they're going to kick it feel go here and he did one time he looked at the the sideline\nAnd he threw it for one nice pass again that Prescott they pick up about a Fifteen yard or a couple of hours away from what is quote unquote I'm giving you air quotes field goal range scored a touchdown ... Aaron Rodgers kept going and there are kicking feel go he looked at a sideline he built the ones that I'm going for one more remember that yup\nYup go for the points that plays San Francisco last year\nOr ... whatever it is a great yeah he came back and everybody's are cool they got enough yard you know\nAnd remember at eight seconds left and about the twelve your life still try to go for a touchdown\nReview this play\nOh there was a another twelve yard pick up for the cowboys but uh they're going to review it because Redskin players are saying was incomplete of course ... players are saying it was caught but why they're reviewing this that was my point air Roger said I'm not putting it in the hand of this kicker Crosby who miss what four or five that you have a bill goes a week prior\nYup he came back and here to be a a game wonder though that was a\nBook that I Love the airline Roger said I'm going to get you absolutely as close as possible as no just aren't cool we're in a thirty that should be a good no no no no man on the wall them all the way down to about the twelve yard either here you go\nOut a final final say has taken off the rams game rams or Los Angeles rams thirty nine San Francisco forty niners ten that is or what ran a severance when ... you know\nUh the only undefeated team in the national football league and have a ...\nGrass and strong hole on the NFC\n\nI don't think there's a team that I mean the paid on you know the patriots so if it came down I was not an even\nBetter at a total team there's not a team better offerings of layer defensively a than the rams and the credit to them because I spoke about it this off season they didn't rest on their laurels they had a good and a great season last year about a guy stepped up we we got to meet the good food Jared\nGolf a a curly girly got back to his his his ways that we saw two years prior right and they said hey we have to get better and they went out and got key pieces and free agency or\nA Britain cooks that's a big guy dominance too they went on got Peters a keep to leave all of these pieces because they didn't\nWant to be in a situation where other teams around them got better they want it to get better and it's it's it's showing it improve a dividend right now\nAll in and speaking of all land the cowboys are all in good position to have a chance to try this game that was reviewed\nAnd said it was a cat so now they're at about ... thirty one yard line of the Redskins they're closer to kick him you know they're not but I think they're going to Aaron Rodgers is\nWhen they hand out to see if he picks up maybe an extra two yards or so give or take there you go lay you got two yards and I hope you're under that puts you over double digit so that counted as one time out three seconds left\nI'll take what I could get I guess it is an idle hands ... did you like that if I'm going to I Want to pick up more yard that's not what they just wanted to get into the middle I Know what I'm just saying what we've been talking about I Want to pick up for you but you don't want to ...\nThis this what are your predictions here the cowboys is a dead smack\nIn the middle east the smack in the middle of a thirty twenty nine yard line\nSo it'll be rough for what is that the thirty the twenty nine\nYear olds about what it is a pretty ... thirty nine your fuel thirty nine dollars more than that forty six forty six year if it will go water we got he's missing anybody ... what are you got he hits the upright what are you guys league quick quick we're getting to know T\nMobile what'd you think I'm a cowboys fan I'm that that they didn't go oh wait hold on\nWe might have enough time you might have an all or either an outsider a lost art for ... for about an hour definitely saying he's missing\nThis is a big call\nOh fall start you've got to be false start I'm ... now fifty eight to lead to yard what do you got ... you still going over time\nSide of the coin ... my my my reasoning okay go ahead here's my reasoning why if I were in the locker room or global as he said a fan I feel like my coast will\nBe kind of a can say that term he was a gutsy\nAnd he went out there and said let's go when is he a big girl is they're scared money don't make no money right and I feel like the cowboys were playing scared\nYou do this I didn't even get in the middle road that was horrified [laughter]\nOkay I had to laugh and steal twelve seconds on a client and you just saw and I have to keep bringing this up but you saw a guy who was beaten you before you saw a guy who's been held as maybe the greatest\nYou're bringing this up but you saw a guy was beating you before you saw a guy who's been held as maybe the greatest quarterback of all time last week Aaron Rodgers go down the field and say\nNo choice but I don't know who won again\nIs that no it do it again but it was they were going to try to get a touchdown and you watch them like that oh freaking winter that's what they are the nah no no no no no no no we're winning is\nJane even on top of that there was still there was still the the fact that Kobe easily was catching a ball like rock magical like if\nRight call they call three amazing catch catch is right there and you don't trust him enough to try to do it again just to like do\nI not even saying low for the ... I mean yes if you watch great but at least pick up Fifteen more yards wanna out that you say are exactly ... this is all you need now we're down to twenty Eighteen yard buying cars that run gave him what an additional like five or six yards knows all too ... too\nThat if it was like a yard you're basically weren't doing it to gain they are when we're doing it put to position the ball in the middle of feel yeah I didn't like that now here's why I'm OK when you asked about earlier the titans go for it\nI liked that they said we were down in his game on the road which stream we're on the plane was not even on the road we're all we're all going into different continents\nAnd I like that they said what are running style quarterback and mark is Margot that he should be able to at least make a pass without their run it in the end zone and I don't mind I think my ... he's probably got a little leeway with the team I think there's probably some conversation with the GM hey\nYou are guy let's just keep getting better let's keep building you don't do that if you have if you don't have job security\nSo I think he knows that trust me they believe in me let's go for the W\nBut I'm just
