more odd car insurance visit Geico dot com for a free rate\nQuote um there are ... and look\nI'll be honest with you I wanted this to be true too I did\nI wanted to believe and I wanted to buy into it I'm partly to blame for it and your partly to blame for it as well too and I think at least acknowledging what it is that we did wrong and our part in the unraveling of an NFL franchise I think at least if we acknowledge that\nWe can sort of start to mend and and he'll and recover from the damage that it's done because as it stands right now there is somebody who has taken a beating for the status of an NFL franchise\nThat somebody is John group [noise] and I was mentioning this before that we are partly to blame in a couple of areas when it comes to the demise of the Oakland Raiders or the status of the Oakland Raiders or how bad the Oakland Raiders are because they are the butt of every joke in the NFL\nI'm John ... gets mocked and ridicule that every single\nPress conference anytime he mentions not having a pass rush or somebody goes\nBut you have a job in Detroit you\nKnow that same tired actor tired routine that people's view out on social media\nAnd so John ... getting all the heat\nHe's getting ripped for it and so the news comes out that Marshall Lynch is is is possibly done for the year it's another blow in a series of blows in a bad season for the Oakland\nRaiders and I think that if you actually look deeper\nIt's our expectations that got us to this point with the raiders because the only reason we all assume that the raiders were the next big thing in the NFL is based on one season\nSo the story is in two thousand Eighteen for the raiders this story really is twenty sixteen when the raiders were twelve and for when the raiders went to the playoffs when the raiders suffered\nA terrible break no pun intended to Derrick in their car\nAnd had to go into battle with Conor cook against the Houston Texans and we know how that played out but everybody came out of that game thinking a don't worry about it yet sucks their car wasn't there everybody came out today but\nThey're built for the future this seems built to last to get a franchise quarterback they've got an elite past Russia they got an a superstar wide receiver this seems built to last\nOut here in LA we were pissed off three teams are relocating we got the two worst chargers in rams\nThe team that was on the rise the raiders we were so pissed man we can't even get that right ... luckily lucky for Vegas\nBut the fact is we all assume that this team was great because of one season\nAnd now when you have a little time to reflect and you have a little time to look deeper into things you realized yet twenty sixteen wasn't all it was cracked up to be you see the raiders were twelve and for that year nine of their twelve wins we're what by one possession or less\nIn fact there were a couple of games that they won by appoint a single point week one against the saints how did the raiders win that game or they went for two late\nFlip a coin\nA couple of weeks later one in Baltimore\nBut they were trailing late night game in fact the raiders only played eight games all season against teams with a winning record they played three playoff teams that year\nThere were one in three because they played Kansas City twice or oh and they lost the Kansas City both times but they did beat\n... while they're in the Texans you know ... the same guy who was a disaster he was one of the laughing stocks that year of the NFL because he was a member of the Houston Texans and he took all that money to go to Houston and he burned the Denver Broncos and as it turns out he stunk\nOf the joint like that team wasn't all it was cracked up to be we just thought it was that's on us we overrated the raiders I always say when\nWe go get the most disappointed in life when our expectations are way too high for things it's the difference between getting flakes on by somebody who's dependable and getting flake on by a flake you expect it when it's a flake you bake that into whatever your ... thought processes up upon their arrival time\nOr when they're going to show up or if they're actually going to show up\nA Mike says he's going to be here by thirty but you know it's my kill probably nine Fifteen or ten o'clock\nBut what if somebody dependable who doesn't do that in our expectations are really really high that it hurts the most our expectations were way too high for the raiders that was a fluke here\nWe assume they were the next big thing but if he actually took a deeper dive you realize a lot of things went there a way that year and so now John Bruton\nThe guy getting the blame for because John Bruno how dare he trade away ... back him in how dare he traded away that guy you know the guy that they offered a boatload of money too and they thought they had a deal done\nI did they offered a boatload of money too and they thought they had a deal done and all of a sudden the Aaron Donald signed his contract and the raiders came back for more and then they decided yet we can't go\nThat high so they treated them away because\nThe way John ... and looked at it won't mean if we're not going to be a playoff team with clue Mac why don't we keep them around when I can actually cash in and make some you know get something back\nFor a guy in his prime\nYeah but it's just it's Reggie McKenzie is guys like he's going after Reggie McKenzie guys before John Gurdon got their Reggie mackenzie says five years with the raiders organization they were thirty six and sixty\nBoy what a group of guys that is\nBut I don't think that our expectations are the only reason why we are to blame because clearly we were wrong about that I think we just really really were happy to have the raiders back and I'm\nGuilty of a new book man [noise]\nI don't hide it [noise] the lie him raises the rebellious attitude\nOf certain ... from see Conor McGregor so mixed save in all of our favorites\nHere on the show all have a common denominator is with a B sometimes they're in a ... and the raiders had a reputation with the same growing up you always heard about the old school raider was violent they were called\nDon't you know there are still under an episode of health goes by\nThat I Do I feel like you say that your wife secret about ... hill the most expensive

audacity and the swagger paintball Iran at the fact that we can do even do that as a lot about the fact that a little bit more than anything else I mean maybe even know if he believes what he just said no\nI mean really I I'm looking at this going these are all famous seekers from the past and here it is one\nTo get the rest of what Jason Smith and my comment that pod cast in by searching the G

Smith show when Mike harm it\nAlways hear that you didn't match what might harm in week night to me I mean if they're big right here on Fox Sports radio\nLeads to our coverage with clay trap NBA\nRatings on opening night we're down thirty seven percent [noise] and I think a big reason why that happened was because well brawn James was not playing on the east coast anymore in the NBA guy used to this idea that they were going to have the ability to really take advantage of all abroad Advil wheat in for everybody on the west\nCoast I'll check that coverage with clay tribe and they say yeah I mean there are three I'm back on Fox Sports radio ...\n... ... rockets didn't get better they just got older prisons Paul whose race down every year when even the most got a year older they bring in Carmelo Anthony who was just a year old and still really can't play but somehow continues or find guys\nTo poison the rockets did not get better so I'm not surprised that they take a downturn this year ...\nMike ...\nPound boxes ... all of the NBA is ah\nTo me the most type ... than ever ... are you in\nBecause we are down the far\nDo I have I have to wait and to make use [noise] we\nA camera but here as we covered that when you see on a on a on Fox Sports radio Thursday off by the Houston Texans looked at take down to Miami do\n... in tax\nThursday at seven thirty there not by now [noise]\n\n... Fox Sports radio um\nHow many alive even the guy go Fox Sports radio studios are\nUp in less than ten minutes from now here on our pets are will have the scraps\nOf that is where we uh go there some stories maybe we missed around the world of sports or we will have those plus uh you know usually one or two stories that could potentially get us fired\nSo we or walk the walk the plank you're on Fox Sports radio and try and save our jobs in the process so that'll be coming up here a less than ten minutes to pronounce your on Fox Sports radio\nSo that'll be coming up here a less than ten minutes to a firm now here on Fox Sports radio uh sometimes people are really really\nBad at a at listening really bad it's um\nIt's actually like no no matter how many times you try and put qualifiers into something to be very clear about it\nI'm Still some of you guys are awful at listening [laughter] I I don't like it it it really is amazing so I was making this point last hour on the show about often to blind play in the NFL\nAnd my point was if you want to just look at the teams in the NFL\nBetter ranked are like six of the top nine teams in the NFL and so that the way that I presented it was if\nI were to say to you one of these teams won the super bowl\nYou wouldn't be surprised ... most of us that are at least sober coherent and logical if I said that one of these of the following teams\nWas going to win the super bowl you wouldn't be surprised by it and the teams are the patriots\nWouldn't be surprised if the patriots won the super bowl the Steelers you wouldn't be surprised the Steelers when the super bowl you wouldn't be surprised the saints won the super bowl if the rams won the Superbowl if the eagles won the super bowl again or the Packers because they may have the best quarterback in the league\nLike you wouldn't be surprised by any of those teams winning the super bowl those are all either preseason popular Superbowl picks\nFor teams that have already won the Superbowl recently\nLike none of those teams would surprise you\nPatriots Steelers saints rams eagles were Packers none of them would surprise you if they did in fact when the super bowl the reason I brought those teams up\nIs because those teams are all in the top nine according to pro football focus\nWho ranked every ... offensive line in the NFL so far this season six of the uh those those teams are on the top nine all six and four of those teams are on the top five and my point was\nThat often so blind play is still important it's still a big deal and so that's not just\nA coincidence there like offensive line play is a is a big factor into success for off fences and teams in the NFL you wonder why the Arizona Cardinals are bad they're ranked dead last and they're often says atrocious and of course because some of you guys are not good at\nListening I'm this guy writes in\nRavens Phillies ramps Steelers patch chiefs pass because of the patch and chiefs Packers stink saints get beat by raven Sunday\nWho asked you what do you what are you hearing\nThat the point is there are six teams I just throw him out there I gave you plenty of qualifiers and still you guys get so emotional about this stuff that if your team is disrespected at any point during the during the process even if it's just\nHypothetical you still attack\nPut the booze doubt that's almost say listen put the booze down it's late enough you've had enough to drink either that or share them share some boos give me some\nMan I I don't know how difficult distance for some people\nRight Jonah socks Fox Sports radio um so I was talking about this earlier that I got to hypnotize by the MBA and I didn't even know it [noise] um I was more in to the Thursday night debut of LeBron James with the Lakers\nThat I was Thursday Night Football now look there was a dog ask game everybody knows that I mean I'd rather uh pay twenty bucks and watch to homeless people throw up on each other a than than watch profit or ... cardinals again for free that was terrible and awful football game\nUm so I acknowledged that um but you also ... going on\nAnd I was more into LeBron James is debut at the Lakers and I wasn't anything else\nLike I ... it didn't meant like ... Thursday night game could have been a great game I probably would have still lean towards LeBron James and the Lakers and I was totally hypnotized by the NFL because I poked fun at the end at the MBA um I ... and and I poke fun at what they do and I was hypnotized by the MBA in this regard because\nThey try and throw out all these garbage stories\nI mean we've got the season underway and all the talk by some people try and force feed you these stories are or what about showing show who may go to the next at the end of the year oh what about nuts free agency Kiss My asked what about this season sunny but underway and you guys are already talking about which do superstars are going to team up for the next\n... ... what are we doing All right do you have that\nLittle confidence in your regular season that you're only focused on the off season\nBut man all the talk during the off season all the hype about LeBron James and the Lakers at work I cared more about that than I did Thursday Night Football or the American league championship series which was the deciding game in which Boston went on to the world series\nAnd both of those played second fiddle and third fit all to the NBA which was LeBron James making his debut for the Lakers\nAnd it was all that hype that I didn't think they had an impact on me\nAnd it did\nAnd it's it's great for the MBA cars look I poke fun at the NBA because of the the the stories in the path of aggressiveness by some MBA players is is just too much bad way too much drama it's over the top it's ridiculous\nBut I also do it because look let's have an honest conversation about it I think there's some\nReally good reporters an analyst to cover the MBA and then I think there are a lot of fan boys and girls\nI mean a lot of pom pom waivers a uh a lot of uh a lot of uh\nWhile I Would think I mean look this is a chance for the Dodgers to go back to back World Series they have not won a World Series championship since Nineteen eighty eight\nI mean it's pretty easy for me if it were me I Will be trained and again it's not that bad ourselves on the back here Fox Sports radio and EPA's won by me to the game seven of it you know so yes for the Dodgers I Would imagine that would have a little bit more important\nThan the game number two of which will be many of the brawn James playing in the Los Angeles Lakers uniform I understand the significance of it it's a star player in the city of LA\nBut it's the second game of the regular season versus the opportunity to go to the fall classic\nI don't see how there's much of a comparison so if it were me and say I couldn't go to a sports bar I Would have oh I have my eyes trained and focus on each and every pitch in Oso yes well periodically checking in to see what's going on with the ...\nYeah but ... it's LA man you know we've been here our entire lives uh they have an affinity for new and shiny things sister and that's LeBron and this team could be for one eighty one and this is their last chance to win a game and I I think there's going to be a large\nPortion that are are going to be so in tune with that and ... it's the first game and if\nThe Dodgers are getting blown out at that point oh yeah uh all all the\nBandwagon Dodger fans are going to go ahead and turn those a Dodger hats inside out and\nTry and turn into Laker fans all of a sudden a it's a great fan base but you know this and look I was making this thing this earlier\nNobody goes from high to low faster than Dodger fans of anybody I've ever seen to where they were mad was over and they were cocky and we've had crickets since the last game six 'cause everybody so nervous\nTo roller coaster of emotions they do and what our Dodger fans out here trust me we talk to them every day and our local affiliate I Know how it goes\nUp some NFL or the Jacksonville Jaguars lived a pretty charmed life last season now so much this year they've been struggling\nLast through the last four and got absolutely both raised by the Dallas Cowboys last week in a big reason why that is the fact that little for another place this week one\nThey're going to be out again this week as he nurses that hamstring injury um I don't know if there's any way any light at the end of the ... for the Jacksonville Jaguars this season if so it might be a train coming but obviously all come on disappointing I'm Sorry I'm just being honest just be an artist Jonas\n... obviously a disappointing season for people for the people about what's going to take a next step\nAnd they were taking about what three or four steps backwards more there were last year\nUm ... I mean they're tied with Tennessee in Houston, Tennessee is so bad yeah Marcus Mario with us thanks sorry guys that I and I know we can make as many excuses one he's not very good Houston's got no business being three in three I still think Jacksonville is going to win the division\nSo most disappointing part of all this is now jailing Ramsey isn't talking\nTo solve the book I I mean if you're not doing that what's the point man like nobody nobody goes to see a comedy special and the comedian just doesn't tell jokes like if I'm going to see Andrew dice clay\nI'm going there to see some of the rhymes I I'm not I'm not going there to have them read poetry do not come on man like your jak wars nobody's going there for ... Ramsey talk trash\nThat's a dark comedy watching Blake borders play the quarterback position that's what\nThat is well I don't know why race had to be brought into it was just wanted a dark ... I mean this isn't this is ridiculous I mean I Can't take you anywhere\nJust trying to keep her O'Donnell says Fox Sports radio and they want more to go on this um I don't know if you're a big fan of hair pulling Jonas um but apparently\nAll that stuff is that are my bio [laughter]\nThere may or may not be but according to the NFL senior VP of officiating river on he said\nThat it's possible the NFL could go back to making hair pulling to make tackles a we go in the NFL it's been a rule for the better part of a decade or so now one of the more ... getting interception against Baltimore\nIf someone literally grabbing nothing but a handful of hair and making them to the ground apparently if they go back and change these rules plays like that will be deemed illegal you are you a fan of them taking their hair pulling it making it illegal in the NFL or are you find what the what the rules that they have him now which is a Harris part of the uniform\n[noise]\nI Know what you're doing and I'm not going to fall for this ah oh can you about John news manager and I asked my I Know that I was going to answer\nThis like a professional um I Believe there's a time in a place to pull hair\nIn a game [noise] um and so I Believe that uh that if if the Harris sticking out and you think that that's the best way to complete the task and that's going to help you in that endeavor then you've got to pull their [noise] in the NFL\n[noise] noticed knocks endorses ...\nIn a roundabout way I Do I like uh I mean what do we get the guys weren't earrings you're not allowed to take rivers earring out I mean if you've never seen a women's fight at a bar the first thing they go for is the hair the second thing is the earrings all rain if it's there you've got to take advantage of\nIt I'm Sorry I agree a hundred percent and there's a agenda political career ahead of you to their journals or the way you answer that question is pretty good if the U.S fight they got about ...
