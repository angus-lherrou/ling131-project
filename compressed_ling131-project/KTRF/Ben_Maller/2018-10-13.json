got\nThree games that ... top twenty five teams going against each other as everybody is sort of jockeying for position because we've got the college football playoff which will be coming out I'm In a couple of weeks or now\nWhich is always fun and it's always a hot topic and it basically saved a Wednesday's during the football season for sports talk radio host because Wednesday there's not really a whole lot going on so when you could ... it kept the college football playoff committee selection for the Tuesday night before\nIt'll save a lot of people's ah shows on a Wednesday and so teams are trying to jockeying for position and so there's four\nGames that I think are the most important games right here so the first one you've got number to Georgia number Thirteen LSU so that's the\nCBS SEC game that's going to be a fun one eye LSU last they're going to be pissed off\nYou know a a Baton Rouge is going to be ... is going to be rolling their ah Death Valley it's going to be awesome that's going to be a fun game to watch you've got Washington and Oregon number seven Washington at number Seventeen Oregon Justin Herbert I don't know look man I'm not trying to pretend like I'm some quarterback whisper\nI have no idea how how he translates to the pros I leave that to to the professionals to break that stuff down but I'll say this I watch them make a couple of throws this season that guy's got a real arm and he looks like it'd be you're a real player at the NFL\nSo if you're a giant fan walking watching on Thursday night and you're trying to figure out who the quarterback of the future is maybe it's not ... your fourth round pick\nMaybe it's not Alex Tenney maybe he's playing up at ... stadium and you can watch 'em up coming up on Saturday ah and then\nThe third game is

anything anywhere\nBlah blah blah blah blah I was in Hawaii when they last\nWeek one to Notre Dame and that's not bragging I'm saying that because I actually wanted to see what some of the reaction was because I watch the game at the hotel bar you know it was pulling one of those uh where I Would tell my girlfriend uh am gonna run downstairs and get towels\nAnd then one of the trips I a halfway up I forgot that I didn't get towels so I had to go back and grab somebody's talented break it up like actually went down there to do something worthwhile when reality was I was just having a a Michel

to pay for one so enjoy that on Thursday All right no I agree [noise] I don't know if anybody else does this but sometimes you'll see something and you immediately think a one person\nI get so it'll happen on this show from time to time we talk about Conan A beer so much because it's one of my favorite breweries\nAnd so people send me pictures when they're drinking like a big wave or along words the Hawaiian ... but it's awesome great beers I don't think they have a bad beer um and so people whenever they see Conan beer\nThey'll send me a picture of them drinking a beer\nAnd there's just certain things to where you see it and you immediately think of one person\nYou'll beat an airport and you see a coffee mug or T shirt or something like that\nYou'll beat an airport and you see a coffee mug or T shirt or something like that and the gift shop and you think of one person to take a picture and send it to him you'll see a street sign\nA you you have a buddy whose last name is Louis and you're passing Lewis wrote and you'll send a picture of it like this happens from time to time like when there's anything Iowa related I immediately think of Iowa Sam our technical producer\nWhich I don't like because I hate his guts and he's an alcoholic but\nHe used to non Amish with Iowa it's it's ... ... ... put in my mind is planted there it's a stamp whenever I see anything Iowa related I used to think field of dreams that's all been wiped out it is now Iowa stay on my technical producer 'cause he's a friend of mine and I see them every single weekend\nBut I was watching Thursday night and I'll be honest with you\nThe only person I could think of while I was watching Thursday Night Football was Ben Mac do that's probably something I shouldn't have admitted on the air that sounds a little creepy that I was thinking about bend Mac or do or watching a football game but just think about what went down last year\nBen Mac do\nAfter his team went to the playoffs the year before after you took over for Tom Coughlin\nAnd they lost in the playoff game gets the Green Bay Packers bed Mac do goes into last season and there was a lot of promise there was a lot of people that actually like the giants to win the NFC ISI year ago\nAnd vent Mac do dealt with an injury to his best wide receiver and often civil line that was a roast shifts and that's putting it mildly\nAn inconsistent defense with all sorts of dysfunction guys and the secondary calling each other out like all of that stuff\nSo Ben Mac do later in the season what did he get Gino Smith a look\nSo he approaches Eli Manning and he says hey I Want to keep your consecutive starts street going but in Oakland at half time I'd like to put Gino and to get him some work and he lie manning said no either he starting\nOr I'm not coming out of the game I don't like how this feels so Ben Mac do started Gino Smith and Eli Manning\nWas emotional talking about it and he had tears in his eyes and all of this stuff\nAnd ... you made the tough choice he made the tough call\nAnd he got clipped for it got fired organization through one of the bus got buried for it crushed I backed bin ... a year ago he gave Eli Manning the option\nYou made it could have started and come out of the half time and I sort of give you lie manning a little bit of credit as well too 'cause he didn't want it to feel artificial and I totally get it but it's not like Ben ... said hey man FU you're sitting this one out and I'm putting in Gino Smith\nNo he gave me the option listen we understand how much the consecutive starts streak means to you I don't want to take that away from you but I Do want to give Gina Smith another look he's been playing while in practice\nThat was the thinking behind it and you're going to Oakland and Eli Manning said no I don't want any part of it\nAnd the organization through Macedonia under the bus fired him cleaned house everybody rallied around ... poor you lie manning how dare you snapped his consecutive wins St ... consecutive starts streak rather how dare you do that Ben Mac do and now here they are still a disaster\nStill drama still dysfunction\nAnd bend Mac who gets to kick back and have a diet right and watched that game on Thursday and go [laughter] I guess I wasn't the problem\nBut here's the thing about the giants bend Mac do was just one example of what the organization is\nTheir heat checkers their temperature takers that's what the giants are\nMac who made the call last year with Eli Manning he made the tough call that nobody wanted to make their because his last name's manning anyone you a couple of Super Bowls and what did the giants do\nThey fired him last may giants\nOwner John Mara was talking with the M M QB ... nobody's brought this up John Mars talking with the M M QB about the possibility of signing Colin Kaepernick and these are quotes from John Mara quote\nAll my years of being in the league I've never received more emotional mail from people\nThat I did about that issue if any of your players ever do that take any we're never coming to another giants game it wasn't one or two letters it was a lot\nIt's an emotional emotional issue for a lot of people more so than any other issue I've run into and quote so let me get this straight\n\nBecause some fans told you they weren't going to come to your football games\nThat's why you wouldn't entertain the idea of sighing signing Colin Kaepernick are having to your players taking me\nIf I was John ... and I said at the time I Would have said oh you don't want to come to the games I don't care don't show up there's there's a season ticket waiting list for years long somebody will be right there to take your spot\nBut he didn't do that because he's a temperature taker their their seat checkers that's what they do\nThey take the temperature of the public and the media and then they proceed\nYou've got multiple examples of it they fired a head coach for daring to sit on the line manning it half the time of the game because it got negative backlash from the media\nThe season and the idea that you should still be putting up these great numbers that he did his rookie years just unrealistic\nYeah really is I I just I I I I don't understand now the petition to bring back Tony Romo mhm [noise]\nI was a so I was watching the Tony Romo football life documentary I have ever going to be out you know it's it's actually really good um Fox Sports radio makes an appearance on the uh Tony Romo documentary oh somebody sent out a tweet like they did a screen shot one of the reviews of Tony Romo Z I early games as a broadcaster\nAnd it was a quote from the Fox sports radio Twitter account that said I'm Tony Romo is the home run already a as a broadcaster and uh that clearly meant\nThat they didn't hear a my show with Brady Quinn because we have crushed ... several days\nBecause of some of the calls he's made but uh we're getting more religious teasing we're just spreading balls but um yeah it's it's pretty good but I don't I don't think he has any interest in going back then I don't think so either I think he said I I think there was an offer on the table and I heard there was an offer on the table from the Houston Texans\nUm if you wanted to go back there but I just don't think he would walk back and I've heard that his relationship with Jason Garrett is not good they were really really close to hung out all the time together and after the jak Prescott decision was made to making the starter\nTony Romo was so pissed off that he wasn't even given a chance to compete for the job that that image Jason Garrett have not been the same sense so\nTo then you're making you have a cushy job sitting next to Jim Nance making a lot of money why would you want to go back down there and have J what snap your\nBack and a half again and he had bad injury yes a lot of injuries in the pro down some of the injuries you got in his career tough dude man and he was a good quarterback I don't even really was what he says he was I thought he was so misunderstood and so under rated 'cause he's the cowboys quarterback everybody hated us that that's a problem\nWhen he had enough talent around him when he had a legitimate running game where they are they're fourteen ensued that you're demaio Murray who not work at Fox is an analyst at that excellent Seventy are rushing year that was the year that the desert Brian catch ... Green Bay I mean they're on their way possible to go on to the super bowl that\nA perfect team that season yup enrollment was she was one of the best years of his career\nYet they were good team or his fourth quarter numbers are amongst the best history of the league I just think he he gets a bad knock 'em you know the because he's a cowboys quarterback in because uh you know ... ... ... ... people assume that he was fake ways enthusiasm but no I always thought he was really can\nSome will never forget the or the botched nap in Seattle yeah and that that playoff game heart out\nI Would have ... to man up all looks that looked like somebody at a blown not rock I think that's why it's you know that was going to look at the tape\nNo doubt a one more forage I got to hear a leafy Merkel of Raleigh North Carolina he passed away earlier this week uh he was a big Buffalo Bills fan and a lot and those obituary reads quote\nWe has requested six Buffalo Bills players as Paul bears so they can let him down one last time [laughter]\nOh yeah [laughter] wrong is that\nAnd they're fairly Mr Merkel\nWent through all four of air a Super Bowl mosses there for ... or above the\nWith attended every last one of the big long suffering bills fan in every sense of the word\nOutlook this is a topic we can get into a died during like July when there's nothing else to talk about we don't want to break down the all star game but I\nStill think the those bills teams I still call that a dynasty easily yeah Boris rate Superbowl people that say no you don't win one man no B. S. four\nStraight Super Bowl to get over the disappointment and to get there four times in a row that's nothing dynasties ridiculous now it's a dynasty so listen we don't need to do a\n... and we're

devastated Scott Norwood to this day still is oh yeah\nLike he is devastated he was a good kicker and he won a lot of games for him but he just missed that one kicking in his life was never the same reason\nI wasn't a chips chip shadows what forty five yards was eleven I mean come on yeah forty seven guys are missing extra points at thirty three yards today what are we talking about\nYeah it's a
