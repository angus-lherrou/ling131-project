going to go down in history as one of the great postseason games and most remembered or discuss postseason games\nOr in all of sports and I I don't know if I can if I can call it the greatest game I've ever seen there are some other great games that come to mind and that's to the prisoner of the moment sort of talk but just everything surrounding that game\nThe atmosphere the length of the game all of it jumbled into one of the way that the game ended absolute craziness a as we saw a seven hour and twenty minute baseball game in game three of the world series or the game started a little after five o'clock local time in LA\nI had just gotten home\nFrom doing a show here at Fox Sports radio when the game got underway right I just got no\nI didn't realize that same game was going to be on a as we were in the middle of our two of our we do overnight show it is it's just bizarre a thing after another that took place in the game or a but it was to the Eighteenth inning\nMax Muncie up to bat for the Dodgers bottom of the Eighteenth and already the longest game in a history of the major league baseball post season and this is outside of courtesy of Fox [noise]\n\n\nCrazy the absolute craziness and so the Dodgers uh survive a now the series is a two games to one\nWith a game for coming up later on today I Would imagine this is a big disadvantage for the Boston Red Sox by the world does a Dodger fan those crybaby Dodger fans who have been complaining about Joe Buck and John small uh the entire post season\nUh where are all you twelve year old [laughter] I'd like he's [laughter] but there are showing more excitement for the other team you know there's been a lifeguard team shut up but what are you at twelve years old pitching because you get a three musketeers here in your Halloween candy\nShop I\nYou sound like me when I was younger you go trick or treating if somebody gives you whoppers you remember those things because basically I shock with chocolate on the outside\n[laughter] I agree Dodger beds complaining because you don't bug and John ... being mean to my team a good change your diaper\nUnreal that I I did see that all postseason it blows right and we're not talking like just Dodger fan but members of the media\nTour or or or just claiming that John ... and Joe Buck or being mean to their team I don't know where do you think John smokes and Joe Buck would rather stay three days in a row Milwaukee or LA words in eighty degree weather\nCome on man a but nonetheless\nGreat win for the LA Dodgers a fantastic performance by max month the a ... in the clutch bottom of the Eighteenth I hear was max Monti who joined Fox moments after his walk off when a Dodger Stadium I\nSaved over seven hours\nWe just drove by the way\nEye on that but I I'm a really good I argue about\nAh you know he ... he went on my way or the you know caught and everything and bought it and it was all like but uh [noise] and I don't get it by about ... about that on ... fought back and [noise]\nA kind of want to take like that before he tried to go back to her daughter saw\nAnd so he gets it gets to the gay parade bath afterwards and uh it just ban what what is what a crazy set 'em ... set of circumstances ... months he wins it on the opposite field home run but ...\nI actually thought max months he won the game a earlier against of all the because he hooked one down the line that looked like it was out and it was foul by less than a foot had to be less than a foot that it was a foul ball I thought that you did it out so it does point he was seeing ... better than any other hitter in the Dodger line up\nUm and and and the real victim and all this\nAnd the guy who's going to get it you're just going to look at the box score and you're gonna chalk up all lost the Nathan a ball team and he's going to have a loss on his record in the world series ... did was absolutely amazing like the performance of Nathan ... in that situation\nBut you gotta you gotta consider this\nSo neither of all the ... and just these are all the the circumstances and all the factors that that led to why Nathan ... he was in the game\nShow the Boston Red Sox tied the game up\nA home run by Jackie Bradley in the eighth inning off can lead Jansen and so the red Sox all of a sudden find themselves in a position to to potentially win the game a game to\nPosition to to potentially win the game a game that they thought they were going to lose because they were trailing late and so the Boston Red Sox now changed their approach so a couple of more innings go by nobody's scores nobody's scores Nathan ... comes into the game\nAnd Nathan of all these brought him because he's going to finish the game out\nAnd best case scenario you get a lead and Nathan of all the is there for the ... and and potentially to save and he's going to close it out and the red Sox are going to take a thrill lead and then after the Boston Red Sox go up\nTo ... to one there's a bases loaded situation\nAnd the red Sox hit a little uh a number on the ground and and you just bad luck if you want to call it uh the Dodgers pick it up step on home plate and it's a force out any innings over they go to the bottom of the thirteenth\nAnd the red Sox would have all the dealing he ends up walking max Muncie or they get a couple of outs but on the second out\nNext month the advances to second base because a Red Sox player defending against the shift to add to add to run so far to catch a pop out that he fell into the stands\nAnd maximum see was able to advance to second base so ...\n\nTo find out fast one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for details tap tap water\n\n[noise]\nJonas knocks Fox Sports radio [noise] company alive here from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios [noise]\nAh in about ten minutes from now here\nOn our focus our rule I have a another edition of the scraps with Kevin figures that's where we uh get to some things that we have not had a chance to get to on this show and there are plenty\nOf them are because if a but just a crazy crazy Eighteen innings seven hour game\nThat wrapped up a that started as I was getting a whole ... from doing the previous show on friday and ended while I was doing the overnight show on Saturday morning just the bizarro land at Dodger Stadium as the Dodgers on an Eighteenth ending walk off\nBeat the Boston Red Sox three to two\nAnd now a we've got game for coming up on Saturday um five o nine pm Pacific time eight or nine eastern time I is first pitch so we'll see how that plays out uh we got a a Dodger fan boys\n[noise] fan\nBoys who are listening to the show and they're upset because we're praising Nathan ... apparently everything's got to be a a a ball wash the Dodgers\nAnd you've got to talk nothing but Dodgers or you can only uh you can only talk about the LA Dodgers I'm a guy wide eyed guy right then and he goes ah\nGet off of all these beliefs he wanted to do his job and he lost the game [noise] what about the job Walker buell or did that was an awesome performance which was\nParked my car wash sure that's as\nBig as it gets right there was a ball washing fan boy a football\nThat's amazing that is somebody who cannot absolutely cannot see the other side of things they just can't\nEven it'd be nice to my favorite team that's probably somebody also has been complaining that Joe Buck and John small to been picking a new team here in the nice things about our team\nGod [laughter] so I Do I tell you they're they're the little kid on Halloween\nWho goes trick or treating and gets pissed off when he comes back and he opens up his bag and he got like lassie taffy instead of more Snickers bars\nWhat a child right\nUm see a game for is a is coming up later on a Saturday Night uh I'm actually I'm going to defend somebody in the world of sports that it's not gotten a lot of defense and I'm going to defend them\nBecause I think some of the criticism is pretty ridiculous um so I was talking about this earlier on the show so Jimmy ... below spoke for the first time since he injured his knee or out for the season\nAnd he just talked about you know the the idea that these injury prone to it they they you know people don't know if they're talking about it that's what they're saying and some of the the criticism that drop below got I think\nIn large part due to the fact that he's a former patriot and I say that because\nIt is in large part due to the fact that he's a former patriot\nAnd I say that because like if you have an impression or an image of somebody that you went to high school with and say there were in a hold of you in high school\nThey could go on to do great things in the years since high school and and be a completely different person but for a split second when you see him again for the first time at the reunion you still go back to where you knew them in high school and they were the bag\nAnd and you're never going to get that out of your mind I think Jimmy ... deals with some of that because when when he got criticized for going on a date with a porn star that was a big time story and to me that was a big time store because he was a patriot and because so many people hate the patriots or when the guy tears up his knee\nInstead of people saying man that's a tough break for Jimmy ... there were a lot of people out there who are criticizing him oh well he's an idiot I mean why didn't you just go out of bounds the game was out of reach a Kansas City you didn't need to make that play God Forbid the guy wanted to make a play for his team\nGod Forbid but I think he's dealing with a lot of the heat because he was a former patriot and somebody else in the bay area who is dealing with a lot of heat and it gets completely ridiculous is Derek car their cars been getting crushed\nAh people thinking that he was crying out an ad on the field after he took a hit\n'em there's the stories that are going around about Derek tar and his teammates losing respect for him because he cried while he got hit a in an NFL game that teammates don't respect them there are some people out there that are floating the idea that ... cars soft\nYou know maybe he's not tough enough\nUh you know maybe you can't trust her depend on their car from a from a mental aspect because maybe he's not tough enough um\nDo you know how ridiculous that is how ridiculous that sounds for people that are crushing Derocher like how how completely ridiculous an asinine it is to call anybody in the NFL\nSoft it's completely ridiculous\nTheir car had his leg snapped two years ago he said numerous injuries the past couple of years and he's always come back always\nI'll be honest with you I blew my knee out a few years back dislocated kneecap torn ligament destroyed my knee destroyed or playing basketball\nTo this day I'm cautious about climbing down off a ladder because I don't want to step wrong and have my knee cap sitting next to my ankle again like it was a few years back\nI'm paranoid about it to this day I'm overly cautious about it just imagine a pocket of three hundred forty pound lineman collapsing at your legs thirty times a week\nAfter you snap your leg two years ago imagine how tough mentally you have to be to overcome that fear\nThe idea that he's soft\nOr not tough enough he's completely and totally ridiculous I Do a show with Brady Quinn here on Fox Sports radio every single Sunday night I Can't tell you how many injuries Brady is dealt with\nPlaying games in college where he had a concussion that was so bad he didn't remember what happened on the drive\nHe has to sit a certain way and the chair because of his back injuries that he suffered while he was playing back injuries that were so bad that he had spinal leakage\nOr a a a leakage from his school India was fine what Steve Kerr ad Steve curves issues where he was he would feel nauseous and all that Brady dealt with those as well to he can't sit in certain spots in a chair because of the damage that he's done\nHis left foot is completely deformed because he got Liz Frank and he said other foot injuries that he hasn't been able to get fixed because if you do get it fixed you're on the shelf and on crutches for six to eight months and he's got two little girls at home that he's got to take care of\nThe pain and the agony that these guys go through we will never know\nWe'll never have any idea what it's actually like so when we flowed out the idea that there are cars soft\nYou're an idiot he it doesn't it doesn't make sense\nLike fans in media members calling out an NFL player soft\nUnderstand that there's not a player in the league that you could out of violence on the field\nNot a quarterback not a kicker not lineman not a hunter nobody\nAnd it's why I've said this and I've always maintain this and this is just a fact I've said it before football players and fighters top of the food chain\n... you cannot dispute that toppled the food chain\nEvery single plays a coalition of collusion every single play is violent every single play you're risking doing permanent damage to your body every single time out\nMost of us we go to work and if we got like a really tough sales job you you know what a real rough day for us is like you know when you make eighty calls and you get rejected eighty times in a row man that's a rough day sales wise proof\nThat you go back home and you got to hope that you'll hit quota later on down the road man you know a rough day but you know we'll figure it out or a or your show up late because you had to deal with traffic or you blow a flat tire on the on the side of the freeway that's a real rough day\nAh that that's called a combative day or that's called an uneasy day at work for a lot of\nUs for an NFL player every single time you show up to quote unquote the office\nJust got their good she stepped Steph Curry on Thursday ridiculously good and then they they go to New York and it's\nLike you go on the road you travel all that way you get to Madison Square garden you've got an earlier I start time to a game that you're not used to get your Golden State and they still win by almost thirty ... back to back it's crazy you know\nBy the way out Kevin to rent erected a giant billboard to try to recruit him to come there and Kevin ... before he ended up dropping forty one and a victory in New York says yeah that really doesn't do much for me so I got to bring a little bit harder in New York if you want to try to Kevin rats come to the next\nSay come on man you know you want to do something or a good James Dolan to sell the team you're in if you want to get them to get Kevin ... to go to New York at James going to sell the team either that or quit his stupid band JD in a straight shot that band stinks and you could tell James do and I said that\nToo but I Will pass the message along thank you [laughter] I don't know if you have a leader of course if that's what they re doing right now it's five thirty in the morning we are by the way you live coverage of the world series that show you Kiss My math exactly well right now I don't know if you have anybody\nIn your family Who's Afraid of spiders or my sister has a giant beer spiders us I don't know if you have anybody in your family a giant arguing the recognition\nWill be no not at all okay I'm I've I've I've held tarantulas before um uh my my girlfriend is is very afraid of spiders but yes I I Know that those those people are out\nThere so maybe she'll be similar to this gentleman in Fresno war porn reportedly burned down his house tried to kill spiders while you watch a TV station a local TV station or Fresno says firefighters recall tore Fresno housing development earlier this week\nTo pull up to put out too alarmed boys they say there was a man sitting in for his parents in at their house and he tried to kill a black widow that he spotted where they blow torch\n[laughter] that'd be great\nThe attic and the second story of a home or actually damaged by the fire because he was trying to kill the spider and the craziest part is they still don't know if he killed the spider or not it's very possible who's got burned down the house and the spider probably crawled out and got out safely\nOh that's awesome that's like I like the more on who tries to kill the bugs on his windshield with a hammer [laughter]\nI quit it idiots I so each completely burned his house\nDown the brunt of the top story the the addict and an ... and the second story of algebra burned down\n... ... it's just it's not the spider offer pick it up\nAnd I happened to those shoe method yeah I mean you could do a shoe I you know what I Do and this is only for good karma because there's that stat how many spiders you swallow year what is it like a ... to spiders a year the adults in their sleep\nThey swallow spiders um so what I Do just for karma purposes I never kill a spider I always scoop it up and I put it outside because I'm hoping one day I'm being attacked\nOr by like a you know like if I'm In Venezuela and being attacked by a bird so that one of those Venezuelan bird eating spiders can all behind the bird wallets attacking me and put it in like a dark joke or something and that way all those\nYears saving lives will will come in handy\nLater on down the road here rather the spot or eat the bird and then you afterwards that\nDo that is that a a very likely possibility as well to now let's go live to our grew up on a farm and that is not buying into the spider hype insider Iowa sample the latest Sam you're dispelling the rumor that you swallow to spiders a year\nOr I think I read an article that that's pretty much hogwash or that you don't really know how do you come to you like that like you know it's not too when I was growing up that that the number was eight ... fighters cause you you'll sleep with your mouth open and they'll just crawl in there but I think that you might swallow one like once a year maybe\nThere are certain things I don't want to know about it if I if I go to a restaurant I don't want to know the U.S that the cook was playing a pocket pools [laughter] ten minutes before handling my van\nDam which I've always really really nice to ah to ... restaurant we don't mess around with that man of research always super nice yeah 'cause they're handling your food yeah so I put fan but spiders or misunderstood\nYeah of course they are blood blow torch for a spider that's a bit overkill no pun intended now did he did he end up killing the spider the mess\nWe don't know well we wish having no evidence has been found as to whether or not the spider actually survived another more\nOn oh wow well done I think it's got a problem and that was the scraps\nAre Jonah stocks here Fox Sports radio [noise] I Want to let you know we all brought you discover card we treat you like you treat coming up next to
