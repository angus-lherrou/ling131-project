um\nSo\nI think sometimes it's best to just not no right like you just don't need to do the truth sometimes you know if\nThings are you there it's an old adage you know some things are better left unsaid or unspoken I think that that applies to a lot of things um I think it applies to to certain things in sports\nNow I've talked about this before a lot of scratch yours I had a a just an entire a grip of lotto scratch yours that I'd gotten for Christmas or holidays or or other holidays or birthday or whatever and I'd forgotten about him\nAnd so what I did is when I took him in I put them under the scanner to see whether or not they were still good\nBecause the lotto scratch yours have an expiration and like in small print on the back of a lot of scratcher and I'd forgotten describe I just forgot I forgot I had him and they found him in a drawer and home took a man got 'em scanned to see whether or not they were good and then I found out none of 'em were good and I threw him all the way\nAnd I had a buddy say why didn't you scratch him as a man or it wouldn't have amounted to anything I Would rather not know could you imagine\nScratching one of those off finding out you won like fifty thousand bucks and then you go take 'em to go cash in and the person at seven eleven says oh yeah sorry these are expired\nLike I Would just rather not know like I don't even tell me like it's not just like don't you know I I Would rather certain things you just don't want to know\nI don't need to know it's fine like I also don't need to know how a cow\nBecame my cheeseburger I don't eat it I don't need to\nBe having boneless wings buffalo wild wings and have them show me from birth the chicken\nAnd how it got to my plate next to my Bud Light I don't need it like I mean there's certain things that you just don't need to know right like the I it's the two minute review in the in the NBA the last two minute report dumbest thing they do first of all\nWhat's the point\nYou can't go back you can't correct it you can't take back the point you can't take back the when the last what it does nothing and then you expose your officiating crew as being flawed and making mistakes the most important part of the game so there's two minute report to the NBA does\nLike just why we wish there were two what even come out with that watch the games over toothpaste tube you can't do anything about it\nIt's done\nBut it's just you don't need to know like I don't need to know what was on those waters scratch or is it wouldn't have done me any good to throw away the hell out of my face and I don't need to know I don't want to know\nI I don't I don't need to know what happened to the cow on its way to my plate before turned into a cheeseburger I just don't need to know that stuff all the NFL has decided\nTo ah well they're going to ignore all that and they decided to come out uh with uh a little something on friday\nRight so the NFL acknowledged on friday that there was an Arab whistle and it cost the browns a fumble recovery and they're over time lost to the raiders on Sunday\nNow if you remember there were a lot of odd plays in that game and buy on I mean crap calls in that game um you know the spot\nRoughing the passer so on so forth very very bizarre game but the call came I guess there was a little under seven minutes left in regulation their car lost control the ball miles Garrett recovered it I'm\n... and and he was hit on the thirtieth yard line Garret recovered it and he became running towards the end zone but the referee had blown in errant whistle\nBecause he thought cars for progress will stop now the NFL comes out and says a as a matter of fact uh we ruled the pastor's stop for forward progress and we killed to play this is not for progress obviously this is a fumble we should not have blowing\nThe whistle okay why are you telling me that we lost the game like I don't need to know that\nI still I don't get this stuff I did the two minute report in the NBA this crap we don't need to know man\nYou don't need to release the information that does nothing could you imagine if you're a gambler if you're a a degenerate funky gambler and you're the browns and the money in line for like fifty Fifteen thousand dollars\nLike you're eating Rahman and drinking out of a coy pond\nBecause you blew all your money on that game only to find out that the Russian Blue the call late and I had an impact on how the game went\nI I don't like what what point does this do anybody any good I Would just rather not know\nIf your wife calls you up and said hey by the way honey I'm having an affair is your first question who'll give me as a measurement\n[laughter] I don't want to know bad I guess I don't need that [laughter] [laughter] yeah oh God he how is he no I don't I don't need to know like it did to over done we're done here we don't need this crap if I'm a browns fan this is nothing for me\nGreat you guys for the call cool I feel even worse about myself I don't like I just don't need this nothing good comes of this stuff and the NBA does it and the NFL does\nNothing good comes of this stuff and the NBA does it and the NFL doesn't we're trying to be transparent no\nYou're trying to over corrected by over correcting it's a problem now now everybody feels like they got screwed now there's conspiracies out\nI just me and it it it's at a certain point I Would just rather like let's just move on man it just move on it just it it's over it's just like we just we just got to move on I'm like hey babe I I heard a rumor yeah what's going on yeah I heard you slept with for my friends\nYeah I did oh that's cool um so who is the best one through four what's your Mount Rushmore my friends well what would you say as a better in bed ... what go ahead and give me your Mount Rushmore like nobody is asking that question you just move on but she's a terrible person you move on your loss for friends and your wife\nNot

projected ... going to have his meltdown uh we are projected for different games uh eagles week six\nFalcons week seven Redskins week eight I went a little above and beyond I said it's weak Seventeen against the cowboys are going to be on his best behavior if you're wondering why we're gambling\nOn when owed I'll bet comes meltdown is going to come it's because old out back them in a recent interview with ESPN and he's very frustrated the giants are one in three he's got no touchdowns he's fits in the league interceptions but he's not been in the end zone yet although back them decided to open up a little bit\nAnd now he's coming off the bench for ...

I Love Fox Fox college football I think does the best job on my radio wife Brady Quinn a calls games for Fox but let me tell you something man when that CBS SEC music comes on\nI don't it just does something to me I I I don't it it just you start thinking back you start all those it just feels like Saturdays in the fall\nTwelve thirty kickoff out here in Southern California SEC covering college football in the south you hear the music you just it it just I don't every single week like that it seems like a damn good game I don't know if it's just the SEC or whatnot but every single week\nThe SEC rolls out a decent games he can criticize Nick Saban eight and criticize the SEC and their non conference schedule and all that stuff but when you hear the ah\nAh SEC music on CBS damn\nJust do something to yeah um and I was talking about this last week now I think about the big tent traditionalist college football you know sometimes you think about man things are so good back when you were a child or I used to remember this place and I was younger and everything seems like it\nWas better all these years later when if you really think back and maybe it wasn't even that great at all you're just sort of romanticizing your youth\nUm I did that last week\nI was talking about man I Wish Big Ten football would have their best games on earlier in the day and then a few hours or a few hours later one of the best Big Ten football games on the best football games period Penn State Ohio State kicked off on Saturday Night so I was proven wrong\nI grew up on Miami, Florida state\nHow many people actually realized at Florida State in Miami were playing this weekend\nI I grew up on that some of the great games you could ever imagine in college football season where Miami, Florida state and how awesome they were and every time those teams played it went down to the wire there was a wide right wide laughed incredible play's incredible players\nI mean they're playing on Saturday I don't even know how many people even know or care and yeah it speaks to Florida state's not what everybody thought they were and you know Miami football isn't what it used to be but damn man I I remember those were being some of the great games in college football\nSo All right uh and by the way a ... I mentioned my radio ... he will be on the call for eastern time on Fox a number three Ohio Ohio State and uh and Indiana so odd why do you do\nYou guys have CBS or is that what you're getting me too I don't know I'm being yelled at and the other studio or so I'm All right Jonah socks Fox Sports radio comedy live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios alright so piece of trash talk here on our focus our we have a a piece of trash talk here on Fox Sports radio\nSo\nSeattle wants to NBA team right Seattle wants an MBA team and daddy preseason game in Seattle on ... on friday night so they went back Golden State playing the Sacramento Kings\nAnd so it was the first game at the ... in Seattle since the sonics left first an NBA game\nPre season or not since the sonics less Seattle to moved to Oklahoma City so Kevin to rant showed up to the game he was wearing a sonics Jersey old school I Believe is Shawn Kemp Jersey I'm the fans are all their old school sonic than it was really really great 'cause I grew up the sonnet or a big deal\nSo they go back they played this game on friday night everybody's all about man let's we've got to get a team here there's talks about hockey team going there gotta get basketball in in the city of Seattle you know it's a shame that they left they went to Oklahoma City look what they could have been\nLegendary franchise so many great players what a bummer and see you see all this you know man this is just just great great great stuff in the city Seattle\nThat it is not unusual for players details seems that there are a wife and they're a girlfriend will both be attending basketball games and other teams meet that information to make sure that the women are seated as far apart as possible\nOkay um first of all I'm not surprised that\nMBA players have wives and girlfriends or professional athletes have wives and girlfriends that I'm not surprised be surprised if they did know yes I mean everybody knows that\nYou you've you've heard the stories I actually remember this he'd make their order just on a fortunate murder or ... who I mean there's that led murder suicide ... there's a lot of details that that don't add up but I remember\n... and if you talk to players um they'll they'll say yeah I Know guys who completely shaped up after that that scared them in thinking man I I'm I'm being foolish I'm fooling around them going behind my wife's back\nHow do I know I'm not going to burn a bridge and something like this could happen like that scared a lot of guys 'cause that was the guy who was fooling around on his wife and\nShe got attached and he's sleeping on fourth of July in his\nYou know a ... pad or how see out on the side some in apartment he had on the side and she walked in and and blue is brains out and then\nAnd then killed herself so that she would land on him and they could be together forever that right there is next level stuff scary yet but it doesn't usually so I'm not surprised at these athletes have a wife and a girl friend here's here's the most amazing part of that whole store ... how\nThe audacity the arrogance to not just say you know maybe you should sit this one out no no no no yeah you can come and don't worry all just send them\nFar enough apart to where they don't know that nothing's going on nobody will have any idea that they both have something in common and it to me like how do you like just imagine being that arrogant to think you know I'll just I can get away with this they'll all be in the same room as long as they're a little farther apart we're all good here\nI Would think a lot of these guys get thrill out of it you know every once in a wife but their girlfriend the size pieces in the corner they give her like little wink or something you know what I mean\nYeah like I don't know I think that's honestly why some celebrities a drink and drive\nIt's not like they can't afford a new birth it's not like they can't afford a limo or or or even a a helicopter to take them from one part of the next I just think it's the whole the thrill of it there's there's a certain thrilled to it and it's all yeah can I get away with this like your ego is so out\nOf whack that you actually think it's a good idea to see your wife and your girlfriend in the same arena not that far apart from each other\n[noise] I mean like somebody's got to know something right they could just man that's crazy\nThing is you can put them both like in the same section one like on ... up in one and rosy and just point there and they and now they're all know which one you're pointing to I mean you got above covered\nIf you're going to go that far too to adjust\nTo showcase what it is you're working with yeah I mean at that point you may as well just have them sitting right next to each other\nSince even get away with it right on and say I wonder if I Wonder if guys have done that just to see if if there's no way that they'll know anything or maybe the girlfriend knows about the wife but not vice versa and then that's insane if\nIt is it is there's another one a policeman harbor Michigan currently investigating how a batch of twelve we laced brownies were distributed at a high school\nNow Harper patrolman Michael prince who's investigating it\nSaid that uh several students receive brownies laced with marijuana and many of them were distributed\nBy a girl who was running for homecoming queen in hopes of winning votes [noise] she gave out pot brownie you gave up her brownies to twelve students many of them football players apparently believing that she could\nBuy their influence and uh when the homecoming foes does she when that was not good for the authority unfortunately\nShe gave out pot brownie from like the I've heard a like a hundred dollar hand shake or something like that but like here although we put a bunch a hippie lettuce inside some brownie mix from Safeway and let me past these out so I can try and win win the award now\nThe hell is that the ... brown is all that's not really must be but I'll say this and she was running from coming queen at my high school she would have won running away all all you got a lot of hot as hell yeah oh yeah I mean a lot of guys kicking in Hackensack\nAround all the time out like skunks there the back of the science burden was smoking for a completely different reason it was a different kind of chemist oh yeah well there rather than a lot of people a a tickle in God's feet in late yeah Aloul either that\nOr a Kevin figures or try to get a homecoming queen nomination Manhattan\nOut a pop around ... oh no I just say it was me I guess that I knew somebody who would have now that she got the idea from your point fingers at I'm just sorry that was a Dutch
