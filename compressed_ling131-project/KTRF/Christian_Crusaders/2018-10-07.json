{"month": "10", "state": "MN", "station": "KTRF", "content": "In to the needs of the economy and as well as the provide Minnesota the talented need so that's the really the ... the background work was and these are the ... century listening to a century where I Would go into a region we have a\nWe have a state wide reach we as I said a thirty seven institutions are spread over forty seven different communities and have fifty four different campuses so we had in every part of the state sometimes we get to metro centric\nIn just staying in the twin cities as important as that is because the majority of our population is it but it also makes sense to reach out to other parts of the state\nTalk to the local businesses there with the help of institutions and colleges and universities doctor the businesses chambers of commerce legislators other community leaders in the nonprofit space we're focused on what development\nAnd just being a listening mode understand what is working for them we had our colleges and universities are deliberating for the need to understand where the gaps are\nParticularly with regard to how much your job than the margin was closed shortages and then work without colleges and universities to make sure that broke I'm Eric portfolio\nAs well as our work is very well on line in order to ensure that the uh Minnesota as the talented late and David with all parts of the standing gets economic growth and prosperity\nAnd chancellor ... ban on what would you say are some of the challenges we're hearing from manufacturers across the state\nThe challenge is really very region to region depending upon the composition of industries located in a particular region and the kinds of shortages that off but\nOne thing which comes up diamond again is that right now unemployment is at a very low rate and so the shortages are even more imminent\nAnd so there is some sense of urgency\nOr on the part of the uh businesses that we are ... a line of work quickly so that they need the workforce they want and the second round is\nThat'd be business as also realize that the knowledge content of all occupations is going up just to give you one salient fact Seventy five percent off the gutter\nAnd then they're not getting jobs right now in Minnesota they require some secondary credentials that is some credential from college you're\nAlmost half of them will require a forty year degree and so it is much more you need much greater lead time to train the what going off today than of the study it who could learn on a fly on the job\nChancellor still teams right you have a really close working relationship with a different tack companies across state kind dance I guess transforming your curriculum to prop help me care needs\nYou know it'd be it'd be local businesses are very very complementary of the work going on uh in our colleges and universities and they are very engaged aren't without without colleges and universities are our presidents in colleges and universities\nA regular basis reach out to these businesses but as you know the world around us it's changing very rapidly\nThat that change very rapidly those business needs change very rapidly too and the kind of training needed for the work of\nAll those also considerably over time and so we have to continuously align our portfolio and I work to the needs of a a business partner\nThanks again in my gas Minnesota state colleges and universities chancellor singer Mel hot chocolate he's\nMake Utah shut Minnesota matters will return after the [noise]\n\nYou my friends have connections in the government yeah usa down\nThe officials orders for government information on thousands of dollars and like any good connection there is no only were contained\nWhy one day you're getting a loan from the next thing you know you need a job hunting down the road construction in both have users you for telecommuting ideas of the more the more you use you in\nThe more you you'll find more and\nMore now medications for example\nThey've been known to lead to some interest in travel advisories [noise] our new mobile apps will be even up to you on the go whether\nYou have the information to get more ideas to give your government check out you know a lot of resumes today could lead to retirement when\nConnections there's no way you can\n[noise] looking\nBack to Minnesota matter it was coming week on the U. of M. campus in much of that revolved around athletics former go for basketball star Quincy Lewis was recently named the director of the em club which helps connects former go for a letter winters to the department and then in sports director Mike room sat down with Louis to talk about his new role I'm\nSuper excited you know I'm [noise]\nI'm In the super sweet spot to get to work with two Napoli\nAnd I use I get to work with the alone\nSo I get the help to build up in the with the young guys and I get to a\nBelief in the name what's the alone so um\nI really look at it really simple in my job is that every goal for his goal for because they decided\nThey made the choice to come here and in my role I wanted to see him as a student to be probably the source and then as alone be proud of the choices they made back and I think that's really important and in my new role it was really just getting back to that\nEverything that I Would try to do to try to make our loan proud that they made that decision whenever it was who was Nineteen Seventy three or you know two thousand Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen and the young Gulf or is that a common future if you want to be a goal for and we want to make a profit that decision um because\nWe all know that kids can transfer who's a pig and we want to recruit to have options you know we don't want to be the only school in on the on the sheets so uh it's super\nSuper exciting for me and how important is alumni support for the greater good of the school to have a lumps who want to talk positively about the school might write a check for the school or all that stuff I think is so important I think that you know most of us came here because some\nAlone you know made me look good to us or made it feels good to us and the most important thing is is that the degree that you have on a wall is only valuable wouldn't how the school was doing now are being a basketball player is only as good as the basketball team is now so\nYou're always tied to go first and one of the things that we want to do again is that we want to be proud of it and one of the reasons and one of the things you can do\nAs a loan them is if you care\nAnd the things you can do as a loan miss if you care find a way\nTo be involved find a way to help you know I look at it three ways you can help athletes department by an advocate or by donated [noise]\nDo you want to help student athletes to calm if you're a mentor you can come and helpful for Ford jobs you can help them with internships and then last part is\nYou know what ... go out do fundraising go out and be a part of the community do community service\nAnd you know what if you don't like the way that the border regions and everyone is ... legislating and say hey stop it bill for athletics is important so those are three ways that we're going to be looking at really trying to activate a villain I give them a sense of purpose and say hey look you know what\nAre you still have a purpose does a lot of not come back and help\nEveryone is in the same you don't have to do a true and you know the same way do what's your way but just come back and give off and\nLast one for you because you're a good example of this year very young man from Arkansas all of a sudden you decide to come to Minnesota you have a professional career and where do you choose to a set up shop you're back here in the twin cities representing the ah the em on on that chest and still every now and and I see where in that Letterman's\nJacket [laughter] every once in a while you know I tell folks Minnesota is hands down the\nBest place to live when you talk about what the state offers you talk about the quality of life [noise]\nThere are worse restaurant is probably somebody's best [laughter] we have every ... every protein a chicken imagine you know Jay Z and Beyonce come through a you know when you think about\nLike the I laughed because you know being a country boy but if you think about all of the country ah concerts has just come through the twins stadium it's just a great place to\nUh to live and I love the fact that you know you drive about thirty or forty five minutes you know you're out in the middle of the wilderness or men able to\nRelax and have that but also too I think that people are great\nAnd like I said before and I always say is that it's so hard to leave because everyone loves go for sure and I tell the young guys take\nYou come here you work hard you take care of yourself and you do professional development you care

...\nThe Lutheran our bringing Christ to the nation's\nYet as we are in our sinfulness we placed little value in lives that are no longer able to contribute to society or to us more rightly\nSaid it\nWas good could bring a disabled child into this world possibly brain what purpose does grandma or grandpa in their frail bodies offer or one with a disease that will keep them requiring care for a long time stripping them of their ability\nTo be active citizen even though\nIt was my actions that caused a life to be created my life isn't ready to share with another so I'll just make this problem go away\nIt isn't really a life until it fully enters the world we hear today and until then we have a right to choose to do whatever we want with it\nWe need not look hard at a mirror to see how broken we are our thoughts may even shock us at times looking at strangers seeing how they are dressed or thinking of what little value they contribute judging their life as worth less than our own\nBut what if we are wrong what\nIf our sitting written reason cannot be trusted and we were to give God the final say in our lives\nRemember how we were once created in his image\nOh that image has been shattered but it is helpful to see how our natural inclination to hold cell value above others in this world should be seen as a sign of sickness you see\nAll were and are created in his image I'll be at a shattered remnants of it and God loves us so much that he wants that all would\nBe saved and if his value for all of us is so great even broken and simple as we are there must be something to each life that he grants to exist and therefore we have no business pronouncing a right to choose its existence or not\nAnd as Christians we cannot be complacent about this issue we cannot claim to see God by his words to be followers and to not speak out against the hatred towards his creation that exist today\nPro choice is sitting in God's throne and making decisions that only he should make\nEuthanasia is also the same sure\nThings are broken in this life and we can expect some tough stuff to enter our lives yeah using evil for good as God does all lives have purpose\nWe may not see it as clouded as our eyes have become by swallowing the devils lies but there is much to be gained by knowing the one true God as he\nIs you see God is a servant king\nEach action is one that is meant to draw us into a deeper understanding of who he is and how valued his creation is to be seen\nThinking we know better in seeking control we'd be left looking at an eternity of darkness Jeff and torture in choosing the devil as whom we should follow\nYet wanting none of that God in knowing how we could never perfectly fulfill the laws that are best for us since his only be gotten son to save us\nAnd with him living his most perfect life Jesus then traded as life for our dead ones ones that deserves nothing but God's wrath and separation from him\nTo see how lucky you are you must see how enemies as we are God's still loves us enough to provide the fix to show us that even our lives still\nHold precious value to him all lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and wants us in spite of our own the facts maybe then we can see how his love VIX tends to every one everywhere and that they too are valued and deserved to know of his love also\nThose who God creates are no accident regardless of how they arrive in this world the blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect to be burdens are precious in the eyes of God\nThose who need our compassion and service are there to teach us and they exist as lives that we may grow\nIn love by and that is the real gift\nGod grant says to learn of how we too may love and in doing so may receive love and return\nFollowing him we can expect is sinful broken world to bring with it trials in hardships yet we are made stronger and blessed to be in closer communion with him trusting as he draws us into deeper understanding of his plan and purpose amidst the chaos\nNow if you are listening and you have gone against that which God wish for you to have\nTaking a life and now find yourself surrounded\nBy the darkness of that decision and feeling the pain I encourage you not to hide in the shadows where the devil wants you but instead to bring that to the one who loves you the most your lord and savior who seeks to save the center the last the broken\nThe one who's forgiveness knows no limits\nThe sooner the last the broken the one who's forgiveness knows no limits in seats to embrace you a gym in his love\nAmidst darkness storms in trials Jesus Says I Am with you always even to the end of the age and in that there is much to be thankful for\nThe whites giver our lord and savior seeds to give us life eternal in him she wants to share of his love but you would share his love with others also I mean we always think of God's created children how wherever they arrive in this world and wherever\nWe find them in the age of this life has full of value and purposes God declares us to be for the whole children are a heritage from the lord the fruit of the room a reward\nMe we thank the lord always for valuing our wives enough to save them but there was nothing greater to be thankful for today than a father who spared not even the life of his\nSon to save ours and trusting in this most precious work of Christ we will arrive home again to share in a life that never ends\nMade bad piece which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in your lord and savior Jesus Christ in his name we pray all men\n[noise]\nTo learn how you can support wing wide outrage of loose or an hour ministries go to Lucy run our dot org or call one

kind of doubt in your own life\nWhen I found out that I was pregnant with our youngest daughter\nNow well I was not\nThrilled to be pregnant and I'm embarrassing to admit that to people I had two kids that were getting ready to graduate high school and I would\nJust add a point in my life where starting over with midnight beatings and diaper changes\nThat wasn't really what I had in mind for myself\nAt that point and so for the first few months that I was pregnant I actually really was struggling with now I Know this is a blessing but it doesn't feel like one and of course then
