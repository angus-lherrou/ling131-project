disciples of price or rather angry with her fellow disciples James and John were coming of Christ and asking for the most favored positions\nOf power right next to Christ sitting on his right and on his left in his glory as they described it\nIt would be almost funny that James John are asking for something that they have little idea about as as Christ's tells them you have no idea what you're asking for\nExcept that as Christ in St James and John\nWhat they're asking for one involves going through what Christ is going to go through on his cross\nBesides courting to Christ James and John are asking for the places that have already been promised water\nMeaning the one who would be on his right and on his left to criminals crucified alongside Christ's when his cross\nSo don't be still in touch with some greedy James and John you'll be getting yourself into far more than what you think you will get\nTradition even a science names to these two that were crucified alongside just Smith and Gaston just myth repented and\nAsk for forgiveness at the very last and went to heaven with Christ and the other one justice who did not repent\nIn an orthodox cross a reminder is you see the the cross ... across the charge sheet or the charge bar at the top but then\nWhat was called a super ... on across where the feed or the ankles were nails and on price right you can remember that just miss was the one went to heaven with price after repenting and the\nOne lower was asked us with the very last did not pretend I'm but\nAll you think about this advance Christ tells his disciples that they're not supposed to be people\nWho glory in their own important whether they should be people who model their lives after the humble example there Lauren Weber wishes to be great among you must be your service wherever wishes to be first among you must be discernible\nSo serving hood serving others is part of our faith something that defines the Christian\nMight we often hear of\nImmensely impressive examples of Christian humility in our world um besides all the other really troubling stuff that we can hear about every day in our twenty four hour a day news reporting cycle\nLike the story of the pastor Andrew Brunson imprisoned in Turkey\nWhat he was released one or two weeks ago brought back to the U.S after an ordeal and being accused of terrorism unjustly imprisoned having served as a missionary in a Muslim country for decades\nThese sorts of stories do not get enough attention in the media but they're really encouraging to hear servings of Christ in our world from claiming their lord and savior rather than themselves\nIn this fall period of remembrance as we approach the time of the of the Sunday of all saints we remember others remember the humility of the saints among us\nLiving or departed we remember ... or we remember Andrew I'm\nOur oldest member marrying you said is celebrating her hundredth birthday two days from now\nWhich uh I it's it's neat that that will be happening or family will be gathering with her where she lives in Morehead but she currently is is our oldest living member scenes among I\nRemember the genes and John I'm made a really strange request one day to be seated next\nTo the lord in his glory again not realizing quite what that would mean\nMaybe they could not really except the predictions of is in the gospel there are three different times were Christ tells the disciples what's gonna happen they do not react well\nThey're expected that their lord and master would usher in that time in the kingdom messiah right center\nOr Wilmington dwarfing the apparent power and glory of even\nCurrent day Rome and the Roman empire\nReading the gospel we know that the glory with something vastly different than that it would not simply the earthly something that would outlast the Roman empire it would also be universal and a terminal\nBecause the glory of Jesus Christ would be his cross and his resurrection\nAgain we hear that phrase she uses in his glory dislike it says in a classic him what does that place besides him in his glory again that\nFirst that's spoken later in the gospel and he said on him Jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom and Jesus reply truly I say to you today you will be with me in paradise\nSo now the ending blessing I promised Christ the form of God took the form of us are and for our sake\nEven to death on the cross submitted a piece of God be with us in our lives in strong faith that is active in love and telling others about gods love revealed in Jesus Christ\nAmen\nLet

I remember when I was a kid I Lived out on a farm on the middle of a cornfield or we didn't have air conditioning we didn't have cable TV we didn't have a cell phone we didn't have an answering machine at one point we didn't have computers you know anything like that\nAnd to think of where we are today it was like I was living you know like life on the prairie [laughter] something like that and then then all of a sudden those technological advances started and they started to you know kind of multiply in their speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking\nWell I'll just let the next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out\nI had to stop that will I'm sure that's just kind of for kids I really don't need 'em [laughter] and now today you know how it is kind of permeated everything so yeah a technology I think is an amazing amazing gift but it it does make your head spin it it also\nBrings questions of of morality and in usage and in how we're using things appropriately or or inappropriate as well Dr Hoffman\nSpeaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better and that's the same thing we could say today what does that mean for Christianity for the church\nBut it's interesting er here at the losing our we use technology a lot to um to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out into the world but I'm not someone once said that the Internet is where religions go to die really yeah and I it's kind of an odd what do they mean by that well I I think that the the point is that\nWhen you have a faith of any kind um that's talked about on the Internet you're exposed to all the other ones ... and you're exposed to people from all these different belief systems that say no this is the right point no this is the right point or my way as and here's the proof or this or whatever it might be I think it's partially because of the fact of um exposure and\nAs I could go back to the beginning of this when I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody other than the six hundred people who lived in my town but now every religion every thought every philosophy that exist in the world comes to you and I think for many people\nThat is a challenge and they don't know how to necessarily think through those things so I I think it's important on the one hand that as Christians that we use technology in a way that gains a hearing for the gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd that proclaims that gospel in a way that um is clear maybe even more than it has been in the past because\nWe can assume that people understand the message of the church anymore I'm with all these competing messages\nThat are there so on the one hand technology is this great tool for us to use to communicate the gospel but also it presents a challenge is with other ways of looking at things sometimes that can be a challenge or just for people who might not be as as strong in their faith and thought about their faith that might challenge them\nAs well I'm not that we should pull out of technology but I'm understanding\nWho we are in whose we are and being able to articulate our faith clearly as we confront these diverse messages I think is extremely important with all of this technological change\nAnd as much as technology continues to change what remains the same is God's love for us in Jesus Christ and we've reached that message each week you're on the program\nAnd that's kind of beauty I think of Christianity is the goalposts really never move [laughter] you know it's a a Jesus is already kick that ball and and the game has been one [laughter] um\nAnd for us the message is the same the message that because of Jesus Christ\nThat the love of God is here\nFor you that the kingdom is here for you that there is a place that has been prepared for you by God in God isn't your enemy is not against you he wants you to be with him forever and his kingdom and that comes through\nThe crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and wild things are changing you can never change that that's something that his his historic it's something that happened and it's something that regardless of what you're facing you can always go back to and say this is the one thing that makes the difference\nThen that crucifixion and resurrection we find our identity then as as people of God oh and this is the kind of the beauty of it\nOur identity then as as people have got a and this is the kind of the beauty of it it almost a knowing beauty but it's it's like a beautiful mystery to me are identity being connected\nTo Jesus that in our baptism that death that we talked about that that that saves the world from than\nWe are connected to that death so in our baptism we'd die and we rise with Jesus and our identity is directly connected\nTo the identity of the son of God and so when you worry about who am I a in these changing times uh how do people perceive me on Facebook and all these other a technological platforms the real question that we should be asking is is how does the gods is and God sees us in\nJesus our identity as him\nIn him we have a diet and risen with him and when he looks at as he sees through that death and resurrection of his son and he loves us and he cares for us any for gives us and he wants us to know who he is\nAt the same time that message is not an easy one it's perceived as foolish both by those who take religion very seriously ... and by those who don't Yeah Dr Hoffman talked about that the ah the foolishness of the message that the that is being preached and yet that is the message\nThat contains the power of God for saving us\nYeah it's interesting 'cause we talk about the Christianity is foolishness I'm On the one hand a person could say that and you think well that's a horrible thing to say I'm sure that's not correct but if you ever take time to look at it you know I guess it [laughter] um it's foolishness to our human\nWay of thinking really the why is this person in the world would not have come up with this is a solution to the to the problem is and you know so you think that okay\nSin came into the world and the solution is that God is going to sacrifice his son Jesus and that belief in that\nJesus in in that son of God in his sacrifice is somehow a toning for us that doesn't make\nSense it just doesn't make sense and and so when you try to think about it a cognitively with your mind or academically or treat it like math or science or you know something like that in dissect it in the end you kind of step back from it and go\nWow that is not how I Would have thought about that that's that's not how I Would have done that but in many ways that that again is where the beauty of it is that God's solution\nFor a problem that transcends our ability to cope with it also has to transcend our ability to cope with it so I got I had to provide a solution that was so beyond us that in many ways I just kinda really stand in all\nOf what the gospel is and the ... that he went through and what that meant\nFor Jesus I can only barely begin to kind of crafts but that you know I I read the Bible and I I Try to imagine what would that be like and of course I I Can't put myself in in Jesus you know shoes at that point\nOr you know that he would die and then he would take on the sins of the world and and uh that he would descend into hell in you know for claimed victory things like that\nSo I just have to stand back and I just say uh you know I Believe that but I don't understand it and in many ways when people say that sounds like foolishness I just said yeah you're you're riot but it's not really about understanding it\nFrom a logical perspective for me it's about faith\nAnd faith is a trust and its trusting that the solution God has provided in Jesus crucifixion in his resurrection is sufficient and even though I don't understand it even even though I don't think anyone probably can I trust in it\nMay be another way of saying that same thing is to say that the the cross of Christ is not so much foolishness as it is an offense it's offensive to those who are trying to be right with God on their own terms and it's also an offense to those who think they don't need to be right with God\nYeah I in the passage that was the basis for our tax for it today in many translations it's translated as a stumbling block or a scandal on and that is something that causes one to stumble or in some translations to it falls on someone in hurts them crushes them kind of thing and so", "show_name": "Christian Crusaders", "year": "2018", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "21"}
