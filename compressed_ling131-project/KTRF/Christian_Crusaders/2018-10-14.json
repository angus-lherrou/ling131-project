close to you\nYou're perfectly content to go along with God with faith and fear and a lot of producing a new maturity without\nReally help the outlook on life that's what Martin Luther was talking about when he explained the ten commandments\nWe should fear and love and trust in God above all things we should fear and love God that we maintain our cursing and swearing and crabbing and sharp\nAnd filthy times we should fear and love God that we may offer him acceptable worship and praise we should fear and love God that we may honor respect love and\nObey every proper authority

comment\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the lose for an hour and we just heard a classic message from Dr Oswald Hoffman\nTalking about the connection between faith and fear joining me here now to discuss that is Dr Tony cook director of us ministries here at Luther and our ministries Tony let's talk about fear in our lives and uh how face interact in intersects with that\nSure ah thanks for having me again this is a topic that\nI can get in the way back machine and go back who um I think if I'm remembering correctly too about when I was seven and and um I was going through some rough times uh in my life\nAnd I started to have\nNight terrors ... when I Would have these dreams that felt like you were kind of locked into them you know you couldn't get out um they repeated every single night it was the same dream\nThat that happened every time and when I Would uh when I Would wake up from his dream I'd be like really startled and in in my heart would be racing and I'd be half awake and half asleep and I would see\nThe shadows in the room is a little kid you know and that's scary stuff it was that I had a closet that didn't have a door so dark um and I had a a Barney rebel nightly news though yeah in fact I had a night light\nAnd that was the only light in the room and sometimes it help and sometimes it cast odd you know shadows on the wall but\nWhat happened is I was going through this period of when you went to sleep I have this dream and I would wake up with this tremendous sense of fear and for boating and I I'm a little kid I thought what can I Do\nTo keep these things and um I really only knew two prayers at that time I knew now I lay me down to sleep\nAnd I knew the Lord's Prayer and so what I did is um before I Would go to sleep I Would close my eyes and in my mind every time I said one of those two prayers they would make a brick\nAnd I would\nTake these bricks and I would put them around me in a circle and as I pray that they would get higher and higher and higher until it was like a pillar you know ... and I was inside of this pillar of brick of prayer and that would help me fall asleep and it gave me a sense that this this pillar of bricks was\nProtecting me if you will from the fears that came in the night and eventually eventually they they went away after a period of time but I still have that very very vivid sense of\nNeeding to be protected from that fear as well as not being able to stop those fears from you know in invading my sleep but I Do remember that little I don't see a childish technique because now that I think about it ... it probably wasn't that bad that bad of a thing to do but uh that was a time in my life that\nI had these kind of foreboding fears and and how I handled it as you look back on that as an adult\nDo you continue to use prayer as a shield and as a protector yeah for me it's interesting with the prayer it as a as a Lutheran\nA lot of times we'll say a when something happens will pray for you mhm and a and a lot of times that's a a a way of saying I'm Sorry for what you're going through or whatever [laughter] um but what I realize that prayer has\nPower and and the power of prayer is something that I've learned over my life and I still use it today I'm when I'm fearful and anxious anxiety about decisions I Need to make things like that most of the time still oddly enough I I use prayer\nWhen I go to sleep I'm a person that thinks a lot in their head and turning off", "show_name": "Christian Crusaders", "year": "2018", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "14"}
