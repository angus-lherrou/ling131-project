of days were in we take great pride in our country is freedom\n\nAnd I was in college I had a friend who was from Norway she told me that she was writing an essay for sociology class above the American flag she was reading it as some sort of\nAttack or complaints\nAnd I asked her why why would you do that what's the boats and she said I Can't believe how much how often I see the American flag flying around everywhere no matter where I go in this country why do you have to have it up everywhere\n\nRemembering this conversation years later I I don't think I had much of a response\nThough I Know what I Would say now that the French flag symbolizes freedom\nFreedom that is so real that people from all over the world when it come here more than a million people every single year wants to come to this place called America and be part of it\n\nThe flag of any country is something highly symbolic of its secular national identity\nThe American flag is highly symbolic

and made right with God for the life and the death and the resurrection of the son of God Jesus Christ\nAnd that forgiving of our sins we can live lives here on earth\nThat glorify God now enjoy turn a life with him and having the glory\nReclaiming that message with what Martin Luther and the reformation era of the church were all about and what it is about today and all we\nLose their said let's create some private what ever proclaims Christ and that's the point that Jesus Christ is proclaim\nMartin Luther the pastor reformer theologians\nWas a faithful witness to Jesus Christ among also countless other reformers of the church wrote many centuries\nReminded us all what the revelation of God and Jesus Christ is all about it is about race alone is this is about fate alone Christ alone scripture alone God's glory alone\n\nReminded on this special fee stay in the church calendar reformation Sunday Sunday before all saints\nSunday before all saints\nWere reminded that we're guardians of this heritage of the Lutheran reformation\nOn behalf of the gospel\nWe give thanks for witnesses to Jesus Christ was driven to challenge the church to be faithful to the lord and savior\nAnd to keep to that vision\nInto the pure word of the teaching of that good news\nBy the grace of God the father love of God the sun guidance of the Holy Spirit Christ promise sun makes you free\nWill be free indeed\nSo made the saving word of Christ gospel always free us from Austin to love and sort of\nGod and one another which is our spiritual calling from God or ...\nOr humid day today it's a

mankind if God tears down ... can rebuild\nIf God's shut the man in non can open\nIf God should gather to himself his spirit and his breath all flesh would perish together in men would return to dust\nJob twelve and thirty four job's belief\nThat God is the author of all things is the foreign at the throbbing source of his anguish if we continue reading the perplexing book that bears his name we hear him go on to say\nGod has torn me and his wrath God gives me up to the ungodly cast me into the hands of the wicked\nWhy do the wishes live and prosper why are not signs of justice ... by the almighty\nJob sixteen Twenty one and twenty four imagined being trapped in a story like that at a turning point in the story of Harold trick\nAgain he hears his author alluding to his past interpreting his present foreshadowing his future tying is tied here's the voice again\nIt was remarkable how the simple modest elements of Harold life so often taken for granted would become the catalyst for an entirely new life\nBy the end of day\nHarold had enough again he hears that voice in his head Harold suddenly found himself beleaguered end exasperated outside the bakery\nShut up cursing the heavens utility no I'm not a person you you stupid voice or shut up and leave me alone\nAnd even if you want it out you couldn't escape\nYou can't stop being a character in your author's story\nThat doesn't stop you from trying\nYou rebel against your author now that you realize you fear that he's in with under everything messing with you you try to fight him resisting the movement of the story trends pressing the boundaries of you're setting but the more you struggled the more you only hurt yourself the more you fight him the more you find yourself fighting everyone around you\nSo you begin to resent your author you hate him one day you try something new\nTo protect yourself you start to tell a different tail it goes like this there is no author\nThe universe is a an accident of undecided evolution from\nThe idea of an omnipotent author is a infant tile illusion from an age without smartphones\nI must make my own meaning I must create my own the happy ending I Am the author of my story it's up to me to justify my life as a life worth living\nAnd so it goes you know that when we reject God the problem of justifying life in the face of evil and suffering doesn't go away it gets worse\nAnd now you and I have to bear the God awful burden of justifying ourselves justifying our actions justifying our world or else we pass the buck onto a government and that will become our author and master\nQuestion of justification is on a void of all we cannot find meaning in life unless you receive it as a story and there's no story without an author and so the problem is always the same which author or do we trust\nNow Harold is standing at the bus stop and once more that voice provokes him\nAnd so on this particular Wednesday evening as heroin waited for the bus his watch suddenly stopped the Herald watched thrust him into the mythical path of fate little did he know that this simple seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent\nDeath watch but hey hello why why am I guess hello excuse me why and how it's\nHarold burst into his apartment ransacked the closet throws open doors turns out George searching for the voice okay where are you are I heard you come on you're stupid voice something\nDesperate now Harold becomes his own narrator Harold frantically grabbed his lamp Harold incense she'll get about the room for no apparent reason smash it on the ground stopping it repeatedly\nAnd say something say something say something\n[noise] Harold distraught God Harold the straw\nThe author speaks not about you this time but to you\nNot about you this time but to you your author addresses you personally now I'm going to ask you to stop imagining and just believe part about God being your author it's true\nThere is another part of the story that I haven't been telling you and you need to hear it before it's too late hour author is not limited to one way\nAuthor character relationships are author is not a solitary and moved mover he's not an evil genius playing with us like puppets are avatars he's a father before even started this story from eternity\nThis author has a given take relationship with his son and then the power of his spirit he loves his son and as much as he loves his son this is how much she loves you\nThat's why he created you you know so that you could become not merely a character and his story but he's adopted son his adopted daughter he justified your existence stopped because of what you could do for him but because of what he wants to do for you\nTo bring you into an authentic to weigh relationship\nFather son father daughter relationship of love and trust and to recreate this relationship of love for us the father sent his only son to be born into history to take the name of Jesus to become a character in his own story\nAnd as a character the son suffered all the unanswered questions that you and I suffer as characters in this strange and sometimes confusing story\nJesus showed us what it looks like to actively strive and to passively suffer as God's love children in his death he showed us how to express doubt with job like faith my God my God why have you forsaken\nMe he said father into your hands I commit my spirit Luke twenty three forty six\nIn in his resurrection of Jesus showed us how faith weights on the author of life\nGod is God with us or without us yet God became God for us when he became the man Jesus of Nazareth\nFace alone was the phrase that the Protestant Reformers used to describe that to a relationship between God the father and his beloved children the reformers were just following the apostle Paul when they insisted that we are justified we are put right with God to face alone\nThis means that we are rescued from our rebellion by hearing in Jesus the voice of our author and taking them at his word trusting him receiving his story is our story that's what it means\nTo be justified by grace along through faith alone in Christ along to the glory of God alone\nAmen amen\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the Lutheran our I'm Mark I sure along with Dr Tony cook and our new speaker Dr Michael regular we thought we use this time to help our listeners get
