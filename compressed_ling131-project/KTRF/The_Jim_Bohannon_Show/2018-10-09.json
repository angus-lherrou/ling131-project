Pennsylvania\nWell Lisa I can answer that question for you I don't know if the sports illustrated people ever got around to reply to you I can tell you a very simply why their coverage was one page in a few photos and that's because nobody watches the WNBA [noise]\nBecause it has very low attendance at any time it's on TV which is sporadically\nThe ratings are terrible the WNBA exists only because the\nNBA the gas ... male league has chosen to subsidize it any women's independent basketball league has gone under\nAnd when I find particularly interesting though is is the language that was used shameful and appalling you should be ashamed [noise]\nNow I'm not that concerned about coverage of women's basketball I Am concerned about people out there who seem incapable\nOf anything that is reasonable perspective about things with which they disagree shameful and appalling really for a minor sport and I'm terribly sorry leaves the but it's a minor sport if you are to judge the the public maybe we should simply arrest\nAll the people in the country who don't have season tickets to the WMBA team that would of course be everybody except for a handful\nShameful and appalling\nHey Jim yes yeah um my take on this or is it I think it's tragic that a young lady that's Eighteen year old\nToday that goes to four years of college boy there it's higher institution of public or private there's this constant drumbeat on campus that all men are evil that you always have to be looking over your shoulder but how does this prepare young lady to go out in the world\nAnd have good social skills to make a living to raise a family\nI mean it's it's almost like it's the Victorian area\nYou know it's like there's this real narrow defined idea that this is how men and women are and that this is how you have to relate to the opposite sex I mean it's just so narrowly defined it's just like a throwback to Victorian\nWell in many ways it is which is which is ironic because of course to many of these people are rather rather liberty and in in their views about a a things though that the upset the Victorians but in terms of of being easily offended some of these people come forth like they are one giant raw nerve ending\nIt and I I could I I think I did watch some of these people that I could say a good morning and they would say what you mean by that I\nI Know it's ... it's supposedly a\nLiberal approach but it it's more like a really really a really conservative Victorian I mean it's so narrowly defined about how men and women are supposed to be able to one another so anyway that was my thought on it you have a good night\nShow Thanks John appreciate your thoughts one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six on the bull headed show and the in Pittsburgh is that lives up this evening hello Liz\nHi Hi now what I wanted to say on ... and he said he's moving watery but they can't put that on on man and see that all men that allow ... just because they're ... they're not gonna take it out on all men\nMen want to read to\nIt does happen it it does happen that you're very correct it does happen\nYeah man you know going around ... is often anybody they they are eight than they are accused of rape so I'm not really in the ... and ... some of these women\nWell in some cases I I Will I I don't know that I can get down to a comparison let's say of a of rape versus an accusation of rape or an accusation of rape unfounded would be a terrible thing uh being raped I I have no idea what that would be like and I'm very glad that I I bring Noah\nNoah ... ah empathy if you will to the subject did not\nBring Noah Noah ... of empathy if you will to the subject is not something we most of us want to be familiar with but I certainly see your point lives and and I you know again today and\nOn a man not ... because some of the moving or read and I sympathize with them and I I mean it's wrong I like it being I Would use them but they have no rights taken out on on ...\n[noise] well it certainly is not a ... a correct thing to do I would absolutely concur that uh again there's just no legitimate basis for doing that I mean it would be the same thing as if we were to say are based on the Duke lacrosse case all women are liars really based on one case\nWell of course everybody would put down that knows your what are you saying oh women are liars\nAgreed that's ludicrous\nBut how is that different from looking at one incident\nIn which a there are charges against men and assuming all men are pigs I'm Sorry that doesn't hold up either every case is different every case is different and has to be judged on its own circumstances in bed I think is the message that we should be getting across your along with the notion\nOf tried to put your outrage indignation and some perspective a Steven and you're in North Carolina joined us good evening Steve\nHey miss ... yes or as you too\nUm did you hear or illicit dolls Saturday here and the the hours of ...\nA ... fan was a control this whale tried to be controlled or shaped like but you know it was like\n... ... ... or ... scream in power and people um\nThat that's all suddenly people know that they're incapable of irrational debate no no I ride I therefore I shout I mean that's all they know they are in many regards some of these people are in their twenties thirties forties and older but they're they're like like small children having a giant tantrum\nAnd I are getting out of the politics of a judge Supreme Court justice have allowed less say um so that's behind us um\nI think it but I really do I get the culture I mean when you grow up and you're a little bit older than I Am but I'm old enough to our house a lot\nAt a lot of things [laughter] I bought some boys that that ... or stronger pepper and they may I played sports wow almost uh-huh\nYou know we had to face up to the source for ... you don't know why it doubled our role as tall you don't always get what you wall [laughter]\nYeah that's true as the old song the says uh uh absolutely true and again as I said before and we'll keep repeating because it's obviously necessary for some folks out there\nI have no idea of how it feels to be sexually assaulted I cannot imagine that it it it would not be the worst thing I ever I ever encountered I'm sure it would be but again\nWhat happened to you does not and and whether or not you feel you were given justice maybe society didn't treat you as well as much deference as you thought maybe the\n... the law system didn't uh didn't punish the trans grassroots as much as you thought all of which would be terrible but but it has nothing to do with the circumstances of another case\nAnd and and justice this the scales with justice are not tipped if in fact we railroad through\nA a a a a a kangaroo court on somebody because they're a guy and a and that that does not tip the tables just because you may as a woman they have not been treated fairly I'm Sorry that you weren't if in fact you weren't butts\nBut it doesn't doesn't alter the fact that\nTwo wrongs in this case do not even come close to making your right so I I certainly see what you're saying Stephen to ensure your viewpoints\nAppreciative very much say ... ... absolutely ...
