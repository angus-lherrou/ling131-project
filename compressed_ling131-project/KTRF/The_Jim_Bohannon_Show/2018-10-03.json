Kavanaugh is confirmed as suggested to this in court\nBecause I Believe very strongly that we need for justice and to believe in the constitution and justices who believed and creating a legislature legislation can match their political views\nAgree absolutely and now it's really a fear that wants to you you have to touch on the very reason why Brett Kavanaugh is facing all of this opposition it's because he believed just as you do and as I Do and that scares the daylights out of the people who abused judges\nAnd Supreme Court justices as life time tenured unelected legislators\nI agree the other thing I wanted to pay a light light strong feelings I Believe that for many years I was very open minded\nListened to both sides Democrat and Republican of arguments vote if the person I out

Democrat Party has been a\nA ... as the minority party in the house and Senate thing you give them either one of those and if it's a dead why I left for the call it that\nWell that's true of course

books his latest being ghost writers published by the capo subtitled with us and German soldiers fought together to save the world's most beautiful horses in the last days of World War two and we haven't really gotten into this and in great detail but uh\nWe should point out I suppose of the importance of these horses just from the standpoint of if you will breeding stock because I gather that is why the Germans had them in the first place right\nYes absolutely they'll if it's on a breeder a very very special breed of a white holes are found in Vienna Spanish riding school they have been carefully bred for hundreds of years hundreds and hundreds of years by the Austria Hungarian empire\nOr they performed a very special kind of a display which is known as high school English ... says um is very very stylized and of course if you go to Vienna today you can see this they hope the palace and that bloodline was absolutely pure and the Germans grabbed the whole says\nWith the intention of feeding them into a program to create if you would like an alien kind of soup a whole for the gentleman army\nThat's absolutely unbelievable but but nonetheless that was the circumstances that occurred so these wars was at ... at the at greater boarding served from the standpoint of justice those who love horses but also from the uh German point of view of the of the master race even to and including\nHorses themselves so as as we were telling the story or the Americans have reached the location of these horses and they're going to have to convert German trucks\nIn order to transport them back to American lines and the in the meantime I gather that the fanatic German SS forces have not been inactive and they are suddenly aware of the presence of Americans behind German lines\nThat's correct says you have this little outpost of the U.S army twenty miles behind the gentlemen lines or the the other German troops in the area where of what's going on and most of them have stood down a little leaving them alone however there is an F s unit looting up which has been defeated elsewhere and that coming up in groups of several hundred\nUh and they said this has some kind of a red flag to a bowl of some kind of opportunity and they launch a couple of consented attacks\nOn the uh the little town which has defended by only you know a couple of hundred Americans is very light weapons and the small vehicles and uh they have to fight them off and they have a couple of\nA fairly serious battles if the ss had managed to break in of course it would have led to a ... I'm On the other thing is it leads to the creation of something colds to its foreign legion which is the interesting part of the story\nOf bleeds delivers learned more about stewards foreign legion\nWell they also say was that come out of this guy called a captain told us to it and uh you know any officer he's right combat experience but he's left with a really difficult situation is simply doesn't have enough men\nTo defend the town in the ... so he looks around and of course when they came in they all say liberated some allies POWs there was some Americans Brits poll said\nThey'll say liberated some allies POWs there was some Americans\nBrits poll subs French except for and they've been working with the whole says for some years and he is able to um some of those were captured Jon their weapons but it's still not enough men so he says is eventually into the German prisoners that they have taken and um he way on this field expedient\nA quite a number of German soldiers a than a man checkpoints alongside\nEx POWs and us soldiers\nAnd of course this is known as students foreign legion where you throw the costs accent as well into this twenty on ... and of course when they uh S. S. actually attack it is Americans fighting shoulder to shoulder with German and British POWs and contacts everybody else to defending the ...\nAh the townspeople and of course the ah the women and children of this stuff so it's an app to him ... story\nVisit foreign legion that this is a collection of people who if you put them all together in a bar or some place they would take very many drinks before some of these people were going at each other's throats\nIn the in in this period of intense pressure or were they able to get them to do work together without killing each other\nI think the ... was that ten they rule in in this together\nThe whole is whether that ticket out if they would ask behind they would fall into Soviet cabs ... the the gentleman's could expect to a nice trip to Siberia and I do like\nA if not being shot on the spot or for the others of course uh they just want to get out and get back to the American line so the horse has become\nThe saviors of the men and women and children that are also there as well so\nIt's very complex on top of that we have one more play I we haven't mentioned wishes they each episode back a communist pot in his hands will also operating in the forest they would like to snatch the whole says as well because they see them as being checked prophecy because they are on check land so we had another ad is dying mentioned to this as well\nDid they manage to to get in the way of the operation and these are checked partisans\nThey try to as the Americans were taking them out a man's road blocks on the very edge of checked her a trail of the very end border and uh a couple of American officers had fish a showdown with the gun in this book called the loaded and pointed\nAnd it was you know a case of who think fast fortunately for everybody the checks playing fast tend to allow the Americans but that German uh allies and everybody else to pass through the whole says into safety in the area\nWe have concentrated on the horses are a unique part of the story but of course as you noted the American forces discovered a lot of humans there as well refugees and the like did the everybody a person's horses that they all managed to get out safely\nWell tunnel read um initially didn't want to take out refugees because he thought it was a military operation but then when he he came up in the south a couple of days later and he sold the plight of these people and he decided that he would turn a blind eye\nTo what was going on and if they to join this great long straggling Columbus people which was code name operation cowboy or to move these papal horses and everybody else into the area\nThat will be all well and good because you know a lot of these people are was sedate and Germans and they had a I have been born in the area or move there on the Nazi occupation that checks hated them and the checks were determined to get rid of these people out of Czechoslovakia\nAnd wiping off the wall was quite a few unpleasant massacres and a lot of victimization so these people wanted out as fast as possible into the west\nNow at this point of course the U.S and the Soviet Union were still technically allies the Cold War had not be gone but I gather that this incident with the ghost writers are began what we might call I suppose the the period of post war irritation between the two\nYes you could say that because at the end of World War two is the beginning of the Cold War you see it everywhere are with us British and Soviet forces come into contact and indeed a color a Soviet ... tanks\nCame up to the eastern edge of the town just as the Americans were starting to leave from the other side and there was a very tense standoff with ... read a captain steer the others with a Soviet general and uh the Russians were determined to clear the road they tried to basically bully that way through", "show_name": "The Jim Bohannon Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Thief River Falls", "day": "03"}
