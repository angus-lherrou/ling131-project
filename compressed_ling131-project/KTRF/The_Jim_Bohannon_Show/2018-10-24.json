running as a candidate he promised to build a wall to kick out illegal aliens he promised to end birthright citizenship\nIt gets into power he triples Obama's DACA program and he hasn't built the wall he could have got an e verify and that tax bill that they passed but he didn't do that 'cause obviously it wasn't that important to him and I feel that he's really let us down\nHe he used to it when he was campaigning he had angel moms are kept up on the stage with him and he hasn't done anything for them\nAnd I'm really upset you know he hasn't fulfilled his campaign plot promises and he's he's
