when people do rebuild it's like I this is the first time I had extensive damage\nAnd uh I'm I'm gonna do it all out of pocket and I'm fortunate that I can do that because you always hard our local well\nBut I mean it's if people do this stuff themselves rather than fire in the first guy that comes along or the pickup truck\nAnd says I'll do that for X amount you know and then they normally have to get that read that but you know I I was at the local Wal Mart earlier picking up so you know\nRun in and grab some stuff to get out and I was talking to one of the workers and I said\nYou know you guys are still open six in the morning till ten at night and I if I got to go in and get oil so they're like to go in at three in the morning when there's nobody there granting get out right and ... and ... well you know we're still so under staffed because so many of the people that work at Wal Mart\nCompletely lost their homes and I um I didn't know it was that bad right here I knew it was you

right\nYou know I've been through super typhoons in the Philippines open our places like that where you don't evacuate because the government who is who you're therefore says we're not going anywhere in fact we're going to go out and take care of the people who need our help during the storm ... so it's you know it's not an irresponsible act and not always leave now and\nI don't know about it this way and other countries of course that's a different circumstance and uh\nAnd the like in this country as a general rule they won't ask you to evacuated list is a pretty good reason to do so I'm I'm
