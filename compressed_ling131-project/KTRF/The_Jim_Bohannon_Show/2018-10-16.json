some numbers involved so I'll I'll look into that [noise] All right Dave and found a lock Wisconsin on the ... hello Dave\nOh Jim how're you doing this evening fine thank you yeah I just want to call up in and say that uh you know I agree with you one hundred percent\nIt ended up being rest mitigation and any executive that has taken any type of training is taught to mitigate\nAny any rest or myself personally I work in a factory\nAnd I don't have the opportunity to work around a whole lot of women but when I Do you know you kind of tend to go out and sent out feelers and walk on eggshells for a little while to see I don't want to say what you can get away with but the where where's the relationship or would go\nUm\nAs far as you know what what what was able to be discussed and everybody is is okay with it\n\nOf the trouble is that today I'm not sure that everybody is okay with much of anything\nNo they're not everybody is really too sensitive about things they need to put on the big boy bands and just go and get a job done\nWell that would certainly be a step in the right direction not likely to happen I suspect anytime soon Dave I found that the particular law that ah that we're talking about here in California\nCalifornia the law says that every publicly traded company in California must have at least one woman on the board of directors or face a heavy financial penalty now than uh\nI I doubt very seriously the laws constitutional\nBut we'll see if in fact you buddy cares to Bush had far enough if it made it to the Supreme Court I suspected it would be tossed out of the out of out of bounds but of course putting a woman on the board of directors\nIs not the same thing as the the the standard hiring process and in particular we're talking about the problem of hiring or executive assistant to work closely\nWith the say a chief executive officer that's where the problem seems to reside [noise]\nUh so it it is similar to what we're talking about but I suspect not a not directly\nSo one eight six six five oh Jim bow and the cliff in the champagne Illinois next elope live\nYes I can take my call yesterday at a\nComet or to make about the uh what you might call the uh Billy Graham mentality of a man being cautious and their interactions with women I think Mike Pence was accused of that a while back of being so cautious I'll have a woman I have lunch together or live in the car to go to that sort of thing\nWithout his wife president yeah so that's where I live\nThat exactly I see a great deal of wisdom of that on on cue very distinct ... one of the second well let me start with the second one that you will is that just to avoid that possibility of an\nUnfounded accusations if it's just me and her and the car she could say was ever a few aunts and I'm as guilty by by default in the same as as a Kavanaugh found out so painfully hadn't at least in a week but\nThe number one reason I think is that just to avoid the possibility avoid that temptation of a situation I\nDon't you hear stories of guys have gotten in trouble with the girl in the hotel room and just always all I don't know how we got there we didn't intend for that we were just\nOn a business trip and we just had dinner and but just for a walk for room separately and we just ended up together I Would advise that kind of situation just avoid the very first step down the slippery slope and don't have the dinner together don't have the business trip together all the odd situation out right yeah\nBut of course if you do that you have affected Lee eliminated women from a a let's say positions such as the executive assisted you can't be an executive assistant to a corporate president without doing just that you wouldn't even be affected the role you've got to work closely with them\nSo right off of that you're you're taking a category of work which is an entry level to upper management for many people and you're essentially saying do women there I mean that's that's what we're talking about\nThis and in that sense it is a an unfortunate unintended on her side effect of the hall me too movement is that guys just have to be extra cautious to avoid this type of situation authorizing\nIt uh it it\nDoes so see my most I must confess thank you for your thoughts cliff to John and Susan bill California have a show hello\nHey I Can't believe I'm On I ... I Believe you are on why of course have to you but go ahead\nWell this is ancient history but it still bothers me today especially when I listen to the radio and I hired a lot about cabinet off saying well this guy\nI'm having to defend themselves against false accusations I was in that same situation years ago a backing round Ninety seven I'm sixty six years old now\nOr at the time I was just a hard working guy was very ambitious and uh I kind of fell into a trap\nAre always ... shed based on financial prospects and uh I was just\nBrainwashed ... big pie in the sky dream that she was worth millions of dollars and she wasn't going to help me by actually so I could start my own business and basically live out on my ...\nYear you were saying that that she offered you financial help in the exchange for sexual favors I'm just trying to I guess you know well it's hard to say\nUh well above the way we are coming up on a break anyway here so uh why don't you think about that I'm not trying to put words in your mouth but I'm trying to to understand so stand by we'll continue our discussion here in the second\nThe general had a show right here give us a shot and we'll check back in the moment\n\nThe Jim Boeheim show on T.
