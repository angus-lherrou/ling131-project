at all regularly that you automatically blackout is simply not true\nWell I'm not saying if you drink as it is not true but when\nHe says there's so many people that said yeah I just find that hard to believe and I\nMean again there are various levels of of drinking I mean he said that he's he drank more than he should have but of course the real issue here is not whether or not he at one time even if he had blacked out\nA better than another self is not what's at issue here the idea is that he would have done something horrendous like sexually assaulting somebody I mean for example I uh I I drank too much on occasion but it's sort of didn't improve my my capacity for sexually assaulting anybody you know I just simply\nI lose interest in the world you know\nYeah he's ever been arrested in either think that it's so I I certainly understand that but when I sat on a college student in the eighties I find that hard to believe\nAs well just the idea is that the majority of college students in the eighties did not suffer blackouts as such a again or even if they they drag more than they should have there are gradations of drinking and they do not in my mind constitute\nAn issue of uh of
