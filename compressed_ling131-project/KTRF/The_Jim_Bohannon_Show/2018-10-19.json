Botox and as I look out on this great national crazy quilt of public discussion these days with all of its animosity but like it's hard not to notice the glitter because goodness knows we are a celebrity obsessed society\nWhat does the glitter because goodness knows we are a celebrity obsessed society\nAnd celebrities have an outsized into very disproportionate influence on the national discussion to recent examples jumped out of me there have been many over the years certainly a\nA recall the the big discussion that the President Trump had with Meryl Streep some years ago or not ever face to face fortunately or it could have gotten\nA very confrontational but I Know the two recent examples of a pop stars who have become part of the national discussion Kanye West coming out and a strongly backing President Trump\nAnd before that\nNot that long ago a Taylor Swift the country star\nWho came out regarding the uh the tennis did as a Senate race of what she of course is a a native of that state and her opposition to Republican Marsha Blackburn over Democrats filled president [noise] and I looked at those first of all I Will give due credit to each there's no question about the fact\nThat the both of these people expressed their opinions\nAs Americans for which they have every right so to do and uh probably did so at some jeopardy into their own careers\nAre certainly a with a a a a fan base that is a predominantly African American Kanye West has not gain any support or a new listeners by virtue of supporting President Trump\nA he's a he's probably suffered some economically Taylor Swift of course in the country genre well wondering only looked back to the Dixie Chicks remember them\nAnd ah I doubt that Taylor Swift will receive any a career benefit from her statement so I I Greg courage to both of them they spoke their minds even if it may have angered beat the base of their uh popular support\nBut that's as far as I think it should go\nAt heart of course in such statements by age is the notion that we should somehow listen more to people who are essentially well known because of their well known ness\nThis is John Green and if your teeth or steamed from coffee\nTea or smoking powered swabs is the answer in five minutes you'll see two shades wider teeth and in Seventy six shades even better there is no messy strips are trait

governor Phil president uh again\nI don't care I I just I Can't get that upset or or encouraged or discouraged by what a celebrity has to say who who doesn't offer anything particularly original or innovative job in Medina, Ohio now good evening John\nHi how you doing John fine thank you thought first let me say that I don't know if you've\nReceived this particular comment before this compliment but you are one of the most articulate man on the planet\n[laughter] that's very guide you really are anybody who's interested in public speaking\nI mean it should aspire to communicate as well as you do you are just in that regard you are just amazing well thank you very much on on a bike I'm humbled by that and and the blood related absolutely true you're like really articulate\n[noise] um I basically agree with everything you have to say about ... except for this\nI'm not sure I trust her motives\nI mean tell us what is not primarily country anymore she has been primarily pop and the question I get it that fans of top probably more to the left and they do the right it was a different story with Dixie Chicks I gave them credit because they were primarily country\nAnd they did actually they did suffer because what if that that that's a big yeah\nNot sure I'd trust tiny at West motives either\nUm I'll have to wait and see if\nI'll have to wait and see if anything happens it does and as a result of his support [noise]\nI'll I'll just have to wait and see\nSee what you're saying and ... and again the uh I'm Willie due to wait and see as well and yeah Taylor\nI see what you're saying and ... and again the I'm willing to to wait and see as well yeah Taylor certainly has a has a personified a cross over I Would not to argue with that uh for one minute to good points ... thank you very much sir to David in Dallas so low David\nHello Jim how're you doing tonight and thanks [laughter]\nI've been listening to your show and I have to agree with your previous caller about the motives of Tania where else when he made a big spectacle of giving Donald ... praise and I just happened to wonder I I have to wonder if he was really sincere or just trying to jump on the term ... to ... notoriety\nMaybe although it's hard to imagine that it that it'll help pay rappers career\nThat's kind of what I'm going into yeah but I just I Can't help but wonder you know I you know all the comments that Donald made after he said there about how great he was a very smart man and then they all he could eat welcome there anytime\nA what would you know that being said Donald really thinks that the what would he have said are kind of got up there and told him what our or about holy was all this other stuff but he's still be a great man and you know when all of his stuff\nAnd I think we we I think we know our president well enough to know now that no the the president will lay on the heavy\nHeavy uh compliments if he liked what you say and heavy complaints if you don't so do I I think of this you use really of Andrew drone question there David no obviously uh uh what was said had everything to do with what the president had to say in response\nAh Charlie in Manhattan, Kansas and the good evening Charlie welcome\nA surge jumbo how're you doing I'm well sir thank you\nWell you know a lot of people in this country uh ran into him all the time going back to your age maybe a little over but people don't know how to critically think I mean let somebody else to sink in for him\nIn a one day I heard that I saw it on the Internet today park sold it for ex President Carter\nWas a great thing because he said that Kavanaugh was not\nA because of the out first and they wait inducted himself his performance ... in ah the hearings boy you know he I don't know is Carter been there a court room with a capital than in all the\nDecisions he made a user and one thing you see what I mean\nHe is using one thing and and again I'm I'm curious how Jimmy Carter would react if such charges had been thrown at him I've interviewed Carter so I don't even have to to ask that rhetorical question I Know how we would react\nHe would react very intensely he would probably out Kevin Cavanaugh in that regard not to mention a although we we should in this context that Kavanaugh wrote an apology that appeared in the op ed pages of the wall Street Journal's saying that if he went overboard that he apologized for that so [noise]\nYeah I I can I must say I I put Jimmy Carter in the category of ah who cares quite frankly I don't I consider him a has been to some extent never was and he was a better ex president than the president so\nYeah I see what you're saying and I I appreciate the your thoughts are Charlie thank you very much for that Pam in Sioux City Iowa good evening them\nHey I just wanted to say hey listen show all the time on my way home from work and make far I'm actually calling from my car on that\nI think what the kind of a west and the cello slashed ill and\nI'm an independent I'm not ... I'm not a Republican and I am an end to end game and I think I don't think it's that they want to they're trying to tell people what to do I think their point is they have millions of followers\nAnd they just want to let their followers now how they feel I don't think they're trying to tell them how to how to vote I just think that um they just again they just have millions of followers\nOh they do that and I and I'm sure that you're correct I mean the problem I have is merely the fact that there are a lot of people who may very well form an opinion based on what some celebrity says and that's the part with which I differ or that they both have the right to speak out of without question without question are great\nGreat great but I it again and like I said I like I I really respect you listen to your show a lot and again I think that\nI think they're just trying to reach all their followers and just trying to get the vote out you know\nThat that ... in which case ... together because as I say I firmly believe that each of them probably injured their career to a certain extent so if in fact it was that al ...\nA boy when you take a hit in your career for something you believe in the well that's that's worthy of applause Richard Durham North Carolina now high\n[noise] hey Jim how you doing I'm well thank you\nI'm a on my way home also from work in a I'll listen to you on a regular basis and a pretty shaky show I ah I Believe I've always said this to my wife that\nI Believe that um celebrity have a certain responsibility when they get to a certain point of saying it is they're\nSaying it to get into politics that's one thing where they are actually active in politics but when you have so many years the day that\nAbsolutely do not know what's going on and they idolize these people and if they believe that their idols want them to vote a certain way that's the way they should go not knowing\nWhat the consequences are feel that that's a long way to use you're saying\nYeah I I again uh I I think what they have to say and how they said both both does a couch a very much uh so I see what you're saying and and the that would be actually wagging the circumstance is good for them back in the moment\nThe Jim Boeheim show on ... twelve thirty veep River Falls Minnesota [noise]\nOur Katie are at ... am twelve thirty in Ninety three point three FM

I'm whether I'm oh gee meteorologist Jeff ...\nFree [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n\nIt is\nThat time again flu season and so let's talk a bit about it and just while we can expect this year with a medical officer from the Centers for Disease Control Dr Lisa gross cough or less gross cough or what are we expecting this year\nI Wish I could say I'm we wish we could say uh we can never really predict for the coming season\nWhat it's going to be like how severe it's going to be we're right now it's it's just too early typically in the United states and flu activity begins to pick up in the fall around October um but right now we just can't predict what the coming seasons kind of be like and that's one of the reasons it's important to get vaccinated every year because we can never know how serious it is going to be\nExact and for those who say well uh I was vaccinated last year I was vaccinated in twenty Thirteen there\nIs something they need to realize and that is the ah flu\nViruses are very sneaky thing that keeps changing on his\n... yeah they are really little wonders and in terms of how they change and flu viruses change constantly um and that's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season to the next ...\nThat's one of the reasons that in most seasons as we move from one season into the next the vaccine has changed to reflect what is thought to be the thing that we're going to be seen most of in the coming season um so that's one of the reasons to point to get vaccinated every year\nLook look back to last year than the uh what kind of a season was that\nYes so last season the two thousand Seventeen Eighteen season was a very severe season I'm One of the most he's severe seasons we've had in the last decade with an estimated nine hundred thousand hospitalizations and eighty thousand deaths um we had\nOne hundred and eighty recorded so far pediatric that's from last season and one of the the things about it was that it was a season where um the activity was very\nSustained across the country for many weeks at a time and really affected all age groups across the age spectrum very severely so last season we did have a very severe one um\nAll of that said we can't really draw any conclusions or make any predictions about what we're gonna see going forward for twenty Eighteen Nineteen based on what happened last year\nIn terms of vulnerability I guess there is a constant about flu and that is that the older and the younger you are the more likely you are to be vulnerable\nTrue um there there are some groups that are more likely\nTo develop severe disease if they get sick more likely to get hospitalized more likely to have that ... and those are the very youngest in the very oldest um those under five years of age particularly those under two years of age and those sixty five years of age and older\nI'm older said we we also know that there are individuals outside of that age group for example those with some chronic medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill and even with that said we also know that we really can't predict who\nCould have you know if you take any individual what individuals\nAre going to have a serious outcome what individuals are going to get sick enough to go into the hospital or die I'm even previously healthy people young adults\nCan get severely ill children who have no prior medical problems can get severely ill from the flu\nIs there more than one vaccine available this year\nWe have a a good number of different vaccines that are available this year um the two basic types if you\nWant to divide them into two broad categories are we have flu\nShots and then we have um the nasal spray vaccine shots are given with a needle generally and they are made either with no virus at all or with virus that's been an activated and killed so it can cause disease and then the nasal spray vaccine is one that's made with live viruses but these are viruses that have been weak and so they can't\nMultiply enough to cause any disease\nOf course most of us are not at all competing to make that choice ah ah other than the cost factor and I wouldn't be one to scrimp on those which one was more effective at at least based on past years\nThat's a really good question and it's also one that's very difficult to answer because I'm ...\nOne of the many things that very about flu is vaccine effectiveness varies from season to season and that can depend on the person they're age their health status how good the matches between the vaccine and what's circulating and also can vary from one vaccine to another um so the most important thing people can do is\nTalk to their health care provider about what vaccines they have available and they can help select the right vaccine for you\nIn addition to taking the vaccine water other precautions that we can take against flu every year we are told be sure to always wash your hands a lot\nWell CDC recommends a sort of a three part strategy for preventing flew um and also severe illness from flu and one of those things is to\nUm get vaccinated every year if you're within the age group that's recommended I'm the second and and this is one that can help not just with flu but with a lot of the other respiratory viruses that circulate around the same time flew does um that's a\nEveryday preventive strategy is things like avoiding contact with sick people washing hands covering cops if you get sick yourself I'm avoiding contact where you can spread of germs to other people those can help again not just with flu but with other respiratory viruses and finally um\nIf you do get flu and your doctor prescribes flu anti viral medicines take those medicines", "show_name": "The Jim
