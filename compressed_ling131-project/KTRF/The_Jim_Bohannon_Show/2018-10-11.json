life\nLet's talk to or not only I guess Jordan Goodman America's ... mad but to see the new calls in from medicine lodge Kansas good evening Stephen\nGood evening Jim or or remember one night a night\nOf very for those who don't know that Steven was in the same unit I was in in in Vietnam but go ahead\nYeah but you are in Austin for and\nI Know I I was I was actually listed also but anyway what do you have for a while you have for our for our guest\nAbout gold but it's so it's been for me I'm a Seventy year old\nAnd uh I uh\nIt's always been colder value for me uh it's it's really a state the same or terrier rated in the last year and I was wanting to know\nIf it\nIf he feels it's still a place to hold value\nI think of it as an insurance policy okay if it's against disaster but that's been going down because when interest rates go up go goes down after many other commodities and interest rates have been going up and looks like they're going to go up higher and that's been hurting go go gotten over Thirteen hundred dollars announced\nNow it's roughly twelve hundred dollars announce even lower than that\nSo I I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon I mean we've had all kinds of disasters in the world and gold is not growing up it's just not what it used to be if anything bitcoins become a new kind of safety valve and even that haven't been working my way as well so have a little bit of an insurance policy but I don't see go going up dramatically anytime soon\nWhat about other a precious metals platinum or silver\nUm all the same Silver's ... gone down dramatically a platinum as kind of a a a place a play on a kind of like converters I guess I'm so car sales have been getting weaker rightly so none of the Russian smells really been doing much they all get hurt\nRising interest rates Jim okay very good thanks for your call Steve appreciate that very much and I might add thanks for your services well\nNow a this is one of the little economic lessons I learned I guess a classic example of a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing but that is that in uncertain times that gold another ... precious metals will go up a but I gather there are exceptions to that\nYeah well I mean these are uncertain times although I'm some ways they're good times I mean the economy is doing these like we've got all kinds of potential problems with China and so on\nBut I mean this is not a time like two thousand eight when you know it looks like the whole world is going to be falling apart [laughter] so ah\nNo goal just isn't doing well it's it really is a direct correlation with a interest rates and I mean the federal service raised rates a lot and long term interest rates have gone up dramatically and the ten year treasury has now over three point two percent\nIt started about two point one percent so it had a big move up pretty short sharply and I think it's going to go maybe\nThe three and a half percent by the end of the year that are bad for gold silver platinum and fight him\nBut is it do you see an interest rates going much beyond that\nYes I Do I think we're in the beginning of a major long term bond fair market\nWe've ... basically had a thirty five year bond bull market where bond interest rates peak about fourteen percent of the Nineteen eighty two\nAnd they went down the absolute though was about one in three quarters in the middle of two thousand Seventeen and since then it's gone up to three point to and I think it's going higher let me just briefly explain why interest rates are going up beyond what the Federal Reserve's doing right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the ...\nIt's right on the demand side there's less demand for treasuries because the two big buyers China and the Federal Reserve or out of the market right now China actually has been the seller of treasury bonds not on a buyer for political reasons another way they can get back at us over the trade war\nAnd the Federal Reserve remember they were buying all these bombs sixty billion a month the so called quantitative easing program that's over that's what over for about a year and a half now and now they're doing qualitative tightening so when bombs come do they're not buying new ones not renewing and letting them mature\nSo true of the big buyers of bombs are out of the marketplace and meanwhile huge new supply Jim and we've talked about this before but the deficit that we have are being finance with that\nIn the third quarter that just recently completed third quarter we added four hundred billion dollars new debt just apt quarter alone\nToday there are options of the thirty year bond the ten year by they did not do well because we're having a huge supply because we're having trillion dollar deficits so more supply less demand\nYields and we'll go up and prices go down\nThere you go the older supply and demand thing All right we're going to come back and talk to the more we will certainly returned to the issue of China and a terrorist and the like about that when we come back after this break go take a a very close look at that gift that keeps on giving the student loan indebtedness\nWhat eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six Americas money answer as mad as our guest Jordan good when they're getting money ... dot
