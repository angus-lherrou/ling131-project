Caesar say Iraq it seems obvious I think to most people that something needs to be done proactively prevented leap to keep people like this\nFrom harming others most importantly but even themselves or a person who could behave in such an irrational manner can be dangerous to more than the general public they can be dangerous to family to friends and to themselves\nAnd while I think part of the answer probably is increased support for mental health facilities\nBut the fact remains that of course mental health therapy in treatment is not an exact science and there are some people who simply are beyond any kind of a cure or a preventive action other than some form of detention\nNow I recognize that I'm Talking here about an area that is Laden with potential for abuse there's no question about that if you can in fact take a somebody's behavior and use it as the basis for a detaining them\nIf you will incarcerating them or maybe involved in something less drastic like a a a confinement to a home with the ankle bracelets what have you you are talking about entering an area in which there is potential for abuse and the political abuse and goodness knows a system in which let's say\nA somewhat ad in the Internal Revenue\nWho uh targets conservative groups it's not that much of a stretch to say that if you can use the tax laws to do that you could use the laws of detention to do

point beyond which one's behavior\nHas to be held to account and there has to be a way for society to say enough\nIf you are incapable of controlling your urges then society will have to step in and have to intercede we are not obligated to sit back and a perennial you take a punishment of this nature\nIt is not a not an obligation at all and I would think that in the case of a Caesar I say ...\nThat he has long since passed the obvious basis for such a law\nThere was no such law the books now\nAnd you can't pass the ex post facto law that is to say something that makes a certain thing illegal on Wednesday so the day before on Tuesday if you did that you can be arrested you can't do that no such laws exist proceeds are say are but for future sees are say ox well\nAt the very least we need to consider some kind of carefully worded and carefully enforced law which will allow society after a certain level of irrational and dangerous behavior\nUh to intercede and um that's my thought one eight six six five oh jumbo our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six I Hope that uh that we will approach this subject in a rational and a\nResponsible way it can be done I
