that you made Ken and that is that we do in fact spin a bar too much time talking only to like minded people [noise] uh most people today are spend their time with like minded people in person\nOr on

...\nWhy we hate each other and how to heal talking about the impact of pushing us away from knowing for example who lives two doors down\nA a warning here ah ... alert coming up yeah back in my day good being an older fellow I can recall pre air conditioning and we used to sit outside of a summer evening because it was a cool place to sit on a porch and neighbors would be outside and we would just naturally start to converse\nI remember when we got our first air conditioning unit\nIt was awfully comfortable in that house but I Confess at that point oh I I still do the people I had known before but new people to move into the area I was less inclined to know your thoughts\n[laughter] I don't think that the games are allowed I think that the wisdom advisory I'm so let me give you another one that that's not from my book but this is one from the book but it's the same exact point in the last Seventy years in America the average size of new home construction in the U.S has grown by more than three acts\nMore than three times larger average new home size now compared to the midnight in fifty but what are the things we know is that when your house gets larger and your life get large it gets larger the separation from your neighbors gets larger and you end up having fewer of those thick relationships in your community and so there are places in America where people are thinking a lot\nAbout what do you do to restore that sense of walk ability so that neighbors know each other and rely on each other more and there is there's a move in some communities again it it feels artificial sometimes the ... but\nOne of the things to try to do is move from a big huge back deck like I confessed we have at our house to a front porch which is closer to the proximity what are your neighbors are walking by there is happiness it's correlated with having gone through that shared experience not just the getting to converse\nA pianist it's correlated with having gone through that shared experience not just of getting to converse with your neighbor 'cause you're not locked up inside your house but frankly having even something in common as boring as the weather on those days when it's really hot and you were sharing that front porch of because you didn't have the air conditioning it was something you went through to gather\nHumans are relational beings we are social animals were not just nouns\nOur verbs we want to do stuff and we want to do stuff in common with other people\nA lot of times shared experiences even if they're on the perfect\nOr become the foundation of future character and future bonds even scar tissue or on your under fourteen they're older and you're a seven year old is something that becomes a foundational experience for future memory\nNow than the drop in our average lifespan now that's a real physical problem though it's not about relationships\nOr at least I don't think it is a this has been one of the hallmarks of the American existence shura the next generation has been or opportunities higher income or education and they live longer what happened\n[laughter] yeah I actually think it is related to relationships at the national institutes of health now there's a new consensus emerging in the last five to seven years um that the number one health crisis in America is actually loneliness ten years ago you couldn't find anybody at the national institutes of health\nThat would have told you anything other than obesity as the number one driver of health problems\nAre and and public health expenditure and the U.S now about Seventy percent of obesity is viewed as a phenomenal of lonely that sort of downstream consequence of loneliness it isn't the case that people get fat and then they lose their friends it's that people get lonely and then they get fat\nSo at the near term biggest driver of costs that American health care is obesity is defined as being more than thirty pounds overweight and a a pretty hefty share of American about thirty four percent of folks are obese most of that as a downstream consequence of loneliness\nOpioids addictions overdoses suicides a whole big range of the new drivers of early mortality are things that seem to be related to not having a lot of social architecture and your life not having a lot of friends not having a lot of community\nNot having membership and a lot of organization this is really new we've had pretty good public health data on what people die of four eighty to a hundred years right now and we've only one time and the last sixty years\nEven two years is declining like expectancy in Nineteen sixty two Nineteen sixty three that was a flu epidemic that bridge over the calendar year and we had two straight years of declining life expectancy is you're turning Eighteen we're gonna have a third consecutive year of declining life expectancy in the U.S\nAnd it is driven overwhelmingly by deaths of despair suicides an addiction and overdose and opioids is one of the the big drivers\nMost all of that is related to decline and community that's not to say there are also\nEconomic consequences but there was an interplay between declining economics and declining community so bunch of places in America\nThat we think about sort of the industrialized saying you have economic collapse and community collapse working in tandem fewer jobs are less sense of meaningful shared work with other people and the declining sense of participation\nIn neighborly association of America and these kind of crisis or or the crises are vicious cycles\nAll right that covers the problem is most of which I think we were vaguely aware of all not not as well outlined certainly as in the book them but the second part of the subtitle why we hate each other and how to heal what are your solutions\n[noise] I'll give you a three and four big one's a number one we have to figure out how you put your phone down at the dinner table it sounds to some also maybe the broader way to say it\nIs we have to figure out what our technology as for because technology is amazing I'm a nerd about this stuff and I strongly believe the digital revolution will create more economic output than the world has ever known I we're headed toward a place with more high quality low cost stuff than anybody's ever envisioned\nBut just getting more stuff doesn't actually satisfy people it has to be put to use in service of actual relationships and community and right now we we need ... there was a guy named Andy crouch who has an interesting book called the ... family and he has a phrase\nA called the need for us to become near near Amish are almost almost Amish and the way we use technology which is our new tools including digital tools like the
