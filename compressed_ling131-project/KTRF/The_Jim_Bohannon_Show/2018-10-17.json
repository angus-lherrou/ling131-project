what I hear and all of what I see my own eyes\nAnd I'm really disillusioned or the way that Democrats are going about their whole political scheme to win back seats it's it's\nIt's unbelievable they hate that day and and and and you've heard it from senators and congressmen on the Democratic side of but yes I'm a Republican but I I Believe it I end up not a handout\nI I'm not a racist I'm not ...

Jim how fine thank you that\nI was telling the lady is is your call screener I said I'm a Democrat but I did not agree with the way judge Kavanaugh's case was handled\nIn fact I thought turned into the equivalent of clowns show and I don't think he got a fair ride and I think a lot of these Democratic senators run for re election they're going to pay a heavy price of the polls are these I certainly hope they do\nThey may uh let me let me offer the rationale here and and this is not an excuse I don't consider it an excuse at all but I Do think that this was the reason you were talking about a number of Democrats who would not in the general course if things go down this path\nIn the Democratic establishment is feeling the thundering hooves the bows on the far left\nThey remember what happened to Joe Crowley the New York congressman beaten by uh uh Alexandria Ocasio Cortez\nAnd and there have been other similar cases Dianne Feinstein of because of California's primary laws running against it even more liberal Democrats than she is in California they are running scared now is that an excuse to do what they did know but it is an explanation\nWell as I said Jim I think he was inexcusable I think that one problem I had with it if these women had a problem with judge Kavanaugh\nWhy didn't they bring up these uncorroborated stories back X number of years ago when he was up for consideration is in the United states court of appeals judge they just say ... and I can't forget how that Ford woman\nSent Dianne Feinstein that letter and the effects that oh by the way girlfriend said aren't to like give you the green light to make it public it just it stinks to high heaven\nWell it's certainly it did I Would agree with you absolutely stinks to high heaven as a

decision based on what you're hearing whether or not having to buy for your life\nYeah I mean here we are we're sitting back talking about this calmly I've nobody is accusing us the no one was accusing those other people either on that committee but again as I said a moment ago when I made that that offhand comment about the Justice John Paul Stevens which was obviously are meant to be nothing more than provocative\nBut I mean that's all it tastes anymore is some off the wall Koch may charge and all of a sudden be guilty until proven innocent that's\nCorrect in fact I was reading the night the those charges that that Dr Ford is pretty much that she doesn't want to ah pursue that any farther and she has no ill will toward\nA judge Kavanaugh um is is like at all just evaporates like a like a favor\nWell yes I I don't know that if I were were judge Kavanaugh if he were to accept that and quote a a forgive her he's a better man than I Am I'd have to tell you\nIn any event I
