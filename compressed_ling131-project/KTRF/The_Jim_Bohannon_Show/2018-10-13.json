I have two wildly diversion diverge questions you have to allow me for your for your author's as\nA member of a very overcharged in this country it was set our documentary years to go on the history Charlotte I recorded on my TV that the freeways desserts Chicago or destroy our brain dominance ... false secondly\nYour guests talk at a book about the successors to appalled I mainly mainly talking about the so caught up in the ... caught a mob and how they were used they were they were they were successful you helped write\nA business for the political system in Chicago choose as powerful cover up for a a criminal beach could your guest as quite as far as\nI daresay they can attack a Lowe's All right uh I was not aware of the free base played any particular role in this at all but uh you tell me gentleman well\nProbably ... indirectly and back to the business community\nWould have been a made up of many free masons and who who joined together to as Brad mentioned to try to take a bone down uh the reason was not as altruistic as you might think because\n... was a terrible public relations disaster for the city\nOr he he was a gangster who who love publicity who wanted to be liked while meanwhile the the people like a Frank ... who was actually named Frank NATO\nAnd others on on mob uh they went down in a more traditional business role and that that kind of fit in with what the gentleman earlier asked about the the business aspect of this the ah the the parallel and even the ah\nThe event the eventual emerging into legitimate legitimate business\nUh and I think to to touch on on the other question\nThe gym caught a mob for example all all of those people pretty much grew out of the old Capone mob you have people\nYou have people growing up they they start as drivers or their enforcers are there going around picking up money and collecting and a lot of these people are are thugs is young young man and then they grow into a you know they grow into positions of power\nAh it was pretty insulated even though Capone was well known for not being\nEthnically pure ... you know he uh he had all kinds of ethnic backgrounds and the people that Betty assembled but the people that he trusted him that he assembled with them or they they tended to stay close\n... uh and the successors as you got it and others are\nUh we we talk the book basically ends um in Nineteen thirty three with with the end of prohibition um but even that\nWe get into the transfer of power between between compound to a Frank ... you know Frank ... is more commonly known 'em and then there's sort of an Epilogue A final chapter that looks more broadly at\nUh the fact that ah ... the battle between nuts\nSadly at ah the fact that ah ... the battle between nuts and compound both in reality and sort of the mess or the impact that has had and continues to have a on the city of Chicago and its politics and the interplay between a crime and government tend and media and all sorts of those things without\nProhibition would component of even existed as a mobster\nHe would have been a low level criminal who never rose a much beyond where he started in life or in the in the slums of Brooklyn probably\nUm you know he's he is a the protege of a fellow named John ...\nWho was really the first corporate minded gangster someone who realize that this could be a business\nAnd when prohibition comes in and creates this whole new market a that is patronize by legitimate people not people who consider themselves outside the realm of the law he capitalize on it and sort of paves the way for for ... to do so and wants tore I was out\nUm compound steps and um and it's this influx of money and and attention frankly again as Michael said could punt courted celebrity that makes him into the icon that he becomes and certainly we would never be talking about him or in the twenty first century if it hadn't been for prohibition\nIn terms of the the sheer power of the polling mob is there any comparison let's say with the power wielded today in northern Mexico by the drug cartels\nBut certainly the same the same kind of thing a particularly if you you look at the way a so called legitimate government can be be in league with these ah ... ... with these kinds of groups [noise] ah it was\nReally pretty much felt like a pony around the city for a long time and I ... I think that probably was an oversimplification again he'd become such a public relations problem for the city that that the uh you know the people around him are privately\nCollaborating with with federal agents to get rid of him because the the idea was we have to it's early in the depression and he's a he's a bad or you know he's a bad black guy for the federal government in general\nThat's why why Hoover himself and I'm not talking about J Edgar Hoover ... president Hoover\nTook a a major interest in and taking you know taking Capone down because at this time components feeding all of this popular culture\nThings you know all the Warner Brothers movies like little Caesar and scar face and a public enemy and he is in Nineteen thirty one is uh the first film when Dick Tracy pecan famous comic strip\nAnd also a Dick Tracy is I I was ... myself found out from Chester goal to create or the strip that uh that trace it was based on that so you have a component is going into popular culture and and bomb them blossom the\nPrototypical gangster almost every major gangster that's followed to some degree has been based on a bone and every every a detective who had a snap room for door and a trench coat or Amazon or even dishonest were were patterned after after after and if\nWe're going to take a quick break come back with some more of your calls and the more information about Scarface that'd be untouchable and the things we never knew back in a moment\nJim Boeheim show on T.

any number of of instances you can point out which ah\nChristianity was not always on the side of freedom the overall thrust of it throughout history has been in that direction and the countries which have become the most free at the nation's in which Christianity has been the dominant religious spores and conversely the countries in which\nAre the greatest persecution has taken place with the exception to view a totalitarian communist nightmares like North Korea or the area of the world that is most consistently on free\nUnstable on wealthy would be the swath of territory from roughly Morocco across North Africa eastward\nThrough Egypt in the middle east and the further east do you get as far as Pakistan that swath of predominantly Islamic countries is uh the armpit of this planet in terms of most ah\nStandards of uh of human conduct of behavior and the living conditions\nAnd since Islam in that swath of territory is so dominant\nOr if in fact it were a pasture or a pastoral paradise\nYou'd have to give them credit and since\nIt's not been so the blame must go in that direction I'm not sure exactly what it is but uh it's just unfortunate\nAnd uh again yes of course there are many fine Muslims in the world but in many cases it would have to be said that they are fine in spite of their faith and not necessarily because of it [noise]\nSo I find it odd that there are so many apologist\nFor some of the excesses of Islam particularly a med portion of the world where it is the predominant faith and so many people are willing to persecute or at the very least look the other way\nAt persecution of Christianity which certainly in recent centuries has become a force and one of the principal forces in support of the notion of free expression of individual rights to host of other things that could be put under the general\nA title of the western civilization just a sad circumstance [noise]\nOne would like to think that the the release of the river and Andrew Brunson is a sign that this is changing in Turkey\nMy guess would be it's more of a sign of the pressure placed on the Turks by a President Trump and not necessarily a sign of any kind of significant change in their policies the Turkish government is moving\nPretty stride and Lee in the direction of an Islamic point of view not good for turkey not good for the region not good for NATO or not good for Europe of course the tiny chunk of turkey remains of the European continent with the bulk of of course in the in Asia Minor\nIt's an unfortunate circumstance\nAnd we're happy for Andrew Brunson happy for his release happy that in fact this story has had a happy ending but for some of the others that has not been the case that I'm just curious\nHow you folks feel about that one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five four six to six\nThere are many things in this world which are get curious er and curious or as they used to say in the Alice in wonderland\nAnd it is it is odd indeed\nThat one of the central forces for personal freedom in the world that I think it's safe to say that that is generally true of Christianity or can be so persecuted at times and the ... and for the civilized world to look the other way as it as persecuted\nWhereas a a a force which with the exception of the ... versions of a of a communism is still exist in places like North Korea there is no more despotic or I'm Free portion of the planet\nThan that portion of the world which is predominantly Islamic that is not a condemnation of every Muslim\nBut it is I think a fair condemnation\nOf the poorest of the world which is predominantly Islamic where are the home grown democracies of that area where are the homegrown supporters of personal rights and the like uh the home grown supporters in that part of the world for freedom of religion for example\nAh the answer is they aren't anywhere they don't exist\nIt's a it's sad will come back we'll take some calls but it just struck me that while I'm happy for a Reverend Brunson that uh this is a\nA happy episode and what is the remaining ... a very unfortunate dismal and depressing world condition and that is the the persecution of Christians who are considered I suppose handy by regimes such as the\nThugs who currently run turkey one eight six six five oh Jim bow our number one eight six six five oh five or six
