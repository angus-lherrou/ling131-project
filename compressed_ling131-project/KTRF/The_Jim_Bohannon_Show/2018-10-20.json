about\nMega millions tonight but we do have by the way the the wedding numbers which are Fifteen twenty three fifty three sixty five Seventy in the mega ball is a seven and that's for a one billion\nIs uh seven [noise] and that's for a one billion dollar jak by one thousand millions okay if you if you were to win that I'm which of the odds against our three hundred and two point five million to one [noise] um\nWell actually ah since most winters opt for cash you wouldn't get a billion you get five hundred sixty five million the billion dollar prize refers to the new the option [noise]\nYou know for example I suppose you could [laughter]\nYou could opt to receive a dollar a year for a billion years I [laughter] probably not a good option but does most of us would a would grab the the big money I mean what's the difference really you know for the in the lives of most of us between five hundred and sixty five million and a thousand million or a billion\nI mean it would not change I think the impact on my lifestyle measurably you know what do you do with that money well that's what I thought I Would ask you what would you do with the money what would you do with the money it's\nSo much money [noise] uh there was a movie a few years back and started to Richard Pryor and in order to to uh get an heritage and she had to spend a certain amount of money and the whole thing was about his efforts to extravagantly spend a certain amount of money which as as was pointed out\nIn that movie that was the whole premise for the picture a admirably done of course by by Richard Pryor\nOr that it's not as easy to spend money as you might think it is [noise] and ah I'm just curious what would you do with that kind of money that this thing about that a thousand million that is to say you could take a thousand people and give each of them a million dollars\nOr put another way you could take a million people give each of them of thousand dollars assuming that you got the ... billion that's ah\nThat's just an astounding amount of money I mean if you're if you're a Bill Gates were talking a pocket change your talking chump change we're talking or when I leave in tips got a thing but for the for most of us that's a lot of on an even Rush Limbaugh would find that to be a lot of money okay [noise]\nSo I'm just curious what you would do with that I mean obviously you need to think big\nYou got to think big like Richard Pryor character in that movie thought big can't just say well I think we'll get a new job but the Chevy I Know you gotta think bigger than that actually you might want to replace that particular vehicle or maybe with a fleet of vehicles [noise]\nThat money to try to get rid of his looking at that time I have not heard of the\n... and ... enjoyed mind by any ... to do that a lot of charity I keep it in a\nWhile well that that's certainly a very uh outdoor mystic thought to read it and we uh we obviously a wish you the very best there there's a person who who probably deserves to win one eight six six five oh jumbo what eight six six five oh five or six to six or Andrew in South lake Texas on the head of Joe Hi\nGuys taking the call or actually given there's a lot of thought in the past and I've got a pretty foolproof plan for somebody to give it all the ...\nSo all of it tries to do that I Want to make sure we all heard what the Andrew said you said all of it\nAll of their attorney general says okay this is the tax load then then I Would use that money he can borrow from your own trust and just four point five billion in a low income properties\nThan with the money from those that they have to trust you got all the charities they give a billion Saturday in real money plus interest and you got ... billion in profits yourself\nWow how'd you get up from from a billion up to four four point five billion that that's that's quite a right of return they're\nTwenty percent down on a ... billion or the properties\nOh okay well you've given us a lot of uh do you do play a mega millions were Powerball\nOr only occasionally\nOnly occasionally well obviously here's a man who's ready for it gee whiz Andrew okay that that guy's gotta gotta planned out already Lewis in Mitchell South Dakota welcome to the ... Joe\n... doing fine thank you all\nI'm not as planned ... but uh uh I can tell you that are from a divorce or five years old uh I was supposed to be\nRemoved from uh my\nMortgage that I had only and I haven't been done so the first thing I Would do is call that mortgage company and a pay that off first\nAh and then uh always had a dream car around it for about seven years and then I had a solid uh which was the addicts has generally so it's going to cost me about eight thousand to get another\n... I'm curious how how big is your mortgage\nA I Am\nThere is how how big is your mortgage\nA I Am only guessing gym because short now wait for five years you're I'm guessing that that's probably about a hundred and ten thousand\nOkay so figure if you're you just to committed there between the mortgage and a and get your version of the general leave the old dodge city out here you're talking about two hundred grand there so that would leave you about a five hundred sixty four point eight million dollars [laughter] what do you go to the rest of that I I\nI I um I've got three kids and unfortunately ah through the horse or a they don't talk to me anymore but I Would uh uh secretly set something up for each of them about two million apiece and uh\nAlso I'm a big animal lover so uh here in South Dakota I Would probably try to set up a no kill shelter and instead of having volunteers run it a\nHabit the something to where they're paid employees a man that's about all I can think\nWell very good okay neither the uh of course to me at the age of the three kids at six million to down to five fifty eight point eight million let's assume that you you get a ... you're talking about it was ... even five hundred and fifty million dollars but but you can see what I was talking about earlier it's not easy to spend this kind of money [laughter]\nOh no no no uh I Know the movie you're talking about I really enjoyed it and uh it's true you\nYou just don't know how to go about spending that kind of money and if you actually had a plan I think you would probably be a kind of person I wouldn't want to know anyway\nWell you know I as I say I would be very boring but I Would be buying all kinds of a of a a very a a safe and sound or bonds and the like I I Would I Would be setting up my family forever and all that would allow others to really really blow a ton of bugs\nHonestly there aren't a lot that many things that I really want to do I mean you know the travel the world [noise]\nOh I suppose if you could afford it I mean you know sure take some some big vacations and and see a few places but I mean that's not a passion of mine a mansion a\nLot of passion of my cars I mean you know most of the cars I Would want to buy would get me a a a a speeding ticket that would cost me a driver's license and in rapid order I mean it would be tough for me to think of things to blow this money I'm not a gambler\nI'm not a big drinker anymore\nAnd uh it would be tough for me to think of what to do with it was All right thanks very much the Lewis Carroll in Rochester, Minnesota next on the jumbo had a joke as we have now a one billion dollar mega millions jackpot tonight and does so far as we speak they've not announced it there are in the winters are good evening Carol\nIn GM good to talk with you I listen to since ever since you were and have you been on fifty years\nI've not been on fifty you know I have had this show for twenty five an hour that I've spent eleven years they their president eleven years is the backup for Larry King when he had this was his radio show so I've been doing this shift if you will for a little over thirty six years\nWell I've been with you since the beginning it seems like that's about the time I'm getting ready for bed and it's just nice to hear what you're talking about and you've had some great kids so I just hang in there and keep doing what you're doing\nWell I Will do that if I had 'em on that money they'd give some to my kids of course and I'd like to take a few trips but otherwise\nTo me is just me is to help others and\nWe have a wonderful YMCA and my sister and it's getting old and I would build to win at each end of town and I make sure that we had\nEmployees or carry for others and I have free membership for anyone who wanted to come and you\nAlso have connected with it a food pantry and I just think that that would be a good way to help a lot of people because there's families that\nI can see that\nBy bringing their children to the way they get a wonderful start in their life and it can make a difference in\nService to their life is just the way they are handled in activities that are also and I hear that feels good to me and then the other things that are for ... for that so to\nOh yes yes I Will\nGive too much that would get them on the road to be happy to accept it so those are two\nBut those are certainly wonderful things that are that you would do Carolyn I thank you for sharing those with us\nI Would tend to do things like that I think my old hometown of Lebanon in Missouri which was instrumental in in most of the things about me that are good I Would certainly give a large chunk of money to that home town of the national radio hall of fame would get a big chunk for me one thing that I Would not do\nIs give so much to an organization that it would tend to be corrupt do that is to say give a money all out of proportion of want to certain organization is ever had before\nWhich could frankly ripping organization departed I Would give a big gift to a number of places I can think of but but a huge gift I think could be damaging I think about that and so I'll be back with more
