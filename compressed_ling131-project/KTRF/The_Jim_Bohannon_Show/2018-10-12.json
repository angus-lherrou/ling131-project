Hi and good evening welcome to the jumbo had a joke from Westwood One radio we're one eight six six five oh jumbo one eight six six five oh five or six to six online you'll find that said jumbo hadn't show dot com you can follow me on Twitter at\nJumbo talks well Michael is a history and yet in many cases you considered Michael as an ongoing presence the hurricane itself as a broken up and moved on to cross the Carolinas but uh the aftermath\nUp and moved on to cross the Carolinas but uh the aftermath well that still much here and now and that we have proof of that in a corresponding Clayton ... who is standing by in Destin, Florida tonight and I gather that things are still pretty much a mess they're Clayton\n[noise] gym you're right you know will hit the forty eight hour marks and Michael made landfall in Mexico Beach Florida not far from where I Am now a early tomorrow afternoon and yet there are still plenty of unknowns here\nThe search and rescue efforts are ongoing in fact they just started today because many roads are still\nImpassable there's people from the Panama City beach area who left who are still not able to get back in ... there are so many roads blocked off there are trees down it roadways from Tallahassee\nAll the way down close to the best in the area or the amount of damage that this storm has done I've heard it described as a credible a as unlike anything that people from around here I've ever seen and people in these parts are familiar with hurricane\nI talked to a couple of people who surveyed some of the damage today they described it shingles a through died of of in two sides of cars from Ruth they've described that different things free down on top of cars and things like that\nHundred and fifty miles per hour when they get caught a lot of people off guard not gym that the storm coming\nBut that it kept ramping up as far as the dirty and when it hit it hit hard\nYeah I Know that a a Boston based a from a Kevin Clark and company\nAnd they produce models for catastrophes and they are estimating that hurricane Michael caused about eight billion dollars in insured law says that does not include loss was covered by the national flood insurance program that eight thousand million and that's an awful lot of money in terms of people\nWho are willing to return to their homes are just looking around the Destin, Florida area Clayton are people able to for the most part\nNot yet you know tomorrow we're thinking that it may be a little bit more realistic but still people in Panama City the officials that is\nOur warning people who evacuated not to come back yet they're not ready\nThis new generation but that's worse than the helicopter parents worse they call them lawnmower parents\nAnd they\nLike a lot more just remove every opposite go from their child's path\nEliminating the entire\n[noise] method by which kids grow up [noise]\nI mean it sounds seductive Lee compassionate or we don't want our kids to suffer [noise]\nWell I don't want them to ah to suffer from dread diseases or or a crippling auto accidents or anything like that or a sexual assault or a lot of things I don't want our kids to suffer from but the ordinarily bumps and bruises of life [noise]\nThe the day to day method of of learning by doing and by making mistakes\nThat's a necessary part of growing up and in fact that's the goal if you really want your your child to grow up that's how you do it that's how you grew up is how I grew up making mistakes\nI a good look back on on my mistakes in in various categories there are a few I suppose that I made that I look back and I still cringe about many of them I laugh about what it was I dug\nA at a lot of them I can look back in a positive way and say that wasn't fun [noise] but I'm a better person because of it\nAnd it sounds to me that there is a whole generation not everybody in the generation but but I ate a major subset of this generation the parents engaged in such behavior\nAs if they\nNever thought about it [noise]\nAs I say it is difficult for me to even conceive of any parent who who thought about this for more than twenty seconds to not be able to figure out that this was a terrible thing you're doing you're setting up your children to fail\n[noise] why would a parent what to do that I mean\nI guess if if you're not very bright [noise]\nYou could convince yourself not me but maybe you could convince yourself that you're being compassionate by child without ever stop there do they will learn nothing I Will see to it that they go through Eighteen years of the formative life and learn not paying yet\nBecause every chance they had to learn how to get in the way and make sure that they don't learn except maybe they learned that a mommy and daddy will always be there to make it all better [noise]\nNot the way it's supposed to be and again I Am sure that not every parent does this I Know a few parents in that age group\nSure that not every parent does this I Know a few parents in that age group not a lot but the ones I Know\nActually raise their kids with discipline and with standards of performance and with punishment\nFor when they fall by the side with corrective behavior all the things that are yes hassles ... and sometimes even painful for the parents but that's what you signed up for when you when you reproduce I mean yeah you're having the kid this is what you're supposed to do\nIts it interesting that that we have a generation of young parents who apparently can't figure that out [noise]\nEverybody I'm Talking to right now talking with that one eight six six five oh Jim boat [noise]\nWe were all raised by parents who started out in life making mistakes who grew up who had children and they let us make mistakes\nSome more mistakes than others some lessons more painful than others but the general rule of thumb was I Want my child to grow up to be an adult so that they can cope I won't always be here\nPeople who are parents get older they die the kids are supposed to carry on that's the whole point\nI Would have produced kids who can make a go of it after I'm gone [noise]\nIt it just strikes me as I said I'm just wondering uh how you feel about that or am I to old fashioned them I stuck in the past and my lacking compassion for young people who should always be protected from every conceivable moment of pain embarrassment or heaven forbid\nChallenge to their self esteem\nWhat eight six six five oh jumbo is our number one eight six six five oh five or six to six I I just just curious about it to me it is just astounding that this could happen all that there would be a few people like this year I mean in a nation of three hundred thirty million people you're going to have a few\nBrain dead do fire guy except that I'm not happy about it but I accept it but this sounds like much more than that it sounds like a trip by the universal trend to be sure but enough of a trend\nThat you have to wonder are these people thinking\nAt all I don't think we're talking about parents who sit down and and and deliberately calculates this is how I sabotage my child's life they're not they're not saying that to themselves they're not that they may be doing it but that's not what they're trying to do\nJust uh just sad and bizarre as I say [noise] life comes with challenges\nAs they say no pain no gain\nSome pain of course we don't want our kids to undergo other other types of pain I mean it's it's essential it's essential one eight six six five oh Jim bode too well Wanda in Hopkins ville Kentucky good evening welcome\nYesterday and then I think the problem today that the parents have become the chill day and then she'll have to come to panic\n[laughter] well certainly the parents have become the children are in many cases I I started like nobody's become apparent [laughter]\nI've seen that speak today passed in a way that oh my God it not matter if they just yeah and I love that they just wouldn't it would be unbelievable\nI cannot believe that no they can't stop no respect to go I'm I'm just because of his generation no respect to know that God allows it's it's just horrible\nIt is horrible and ... ... what's worse Wanda is that it's entirely foreseeable I mean kids must be taught to be rational reasonable people uh kids left to their own devices or are they will they\nWill produce some pretty frightening circumstances\nList is inside a yeah I mean they they their children to go out I mean I'm just looking at some things are it's just something that just wouldn't even tolerate some things are just\nSo unbelievable like well these people put planet that those people come from ... well what do\n... ... it's a great question what planet and they do they come from I I tell you wonder are they all are to read the lord of the flies\nA very interesting book a work of fiction\nBut uh it's an allegory there is a lesson to be learned in the book the lord of the flies it is what can happen when kids essentially grow up on their own and don't learn these valuable lessons All right to a bill in Walla Walla Washington hello bill and the welcome\nYeah hey how're you doing fine thank you will start to recall here might have to carry at best a break but go ahead\nOh okay we'll CBS that gives the origins ... take it over for the parents there's nothing a parent can do\nTo do this all play on their child because now the child is taught in school and everywhere else that all they have to do is go to a teacher and say that they were abused even though they might not ban and there is just to be paying any ...\nWell I tell you that your way shouldn't I gotta I gotta agree with you bill it is a a situation that uh has gone way overboard\nUh we're talking here about basic discipline not about abusing a child and you're right or that kind of problem must be stopped with the law or to more of our calls and we'll talk of just a
