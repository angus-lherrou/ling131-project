Christian aspect of that [laughter] so\n\nRod are you There God can you hear me\nYes you're on the radio go right ahead\nOkay yeah my phone is like out of their own well okay\nLike oh sure I I don't consider myself a gorilla held at first but you know what I heard on Wisconsin Public radio I listen to public radio a lot of it they were talking about George Washington when he became president he did not want to ... them and I just think that might help\nWhat a shame they take it out because\nYou know if it if it got people that I don't care who's name it they're whatever letter or name up on\nThat and that way I see it we don't need any help with other white\nUp on that cap in our case it'll or whatever something happened at a port woman and I can't imagine a traumatic experience like that but ah that Comey is not the issue right here at the fact that Obama when he killed somebody for ... all we got to wait until after the election\nBut now the issue is on the other for how to get it or they're like\nWell you've covered a number of the issues of the day but I'm not sure this directly relates to uh the topic at hand I Would just make one note before it deferring to a doctor Creighton\nOr it was very naive of George Washington or anybody else to suggest that there would not be factions\nFactions are almost proof that we have a free government if you have a genuinely free society you will have differences of opinion\nAnd like minded people will get together and organize to try and convince others of their point of view it is an essential part of society now can faction lives will be carried too far well yes it certainly can and perhaps we're seeing a manifestation of that but the notion\nThat you can have a free society without different factions is an impossibility and I refer to Dr Creighton\nI Would have to agree with you entirely about that I think there's a psychological motivation ultimately for the unified groups to ultimately ... divisions\nSo I I think there's no way of avoiding sanctions or what you do want to avoid as you mentioned is uh the extremes of polarity between two factions so that there's no workable solution to the system\nAnd we'll come back and explore some of that here in a moment but the writing a call from Steve in Chatham county North Carolina good evening Steve\n... uh always enjoy your show in the shake ... thank you ... ... when it gets to a point when you go to a restaurant or or you go out and then\nI ... I don't know ... ... is the person or the establishment is less ... whatever the hell or are those standards wants those who\nGets to a point where you can't go out and have reason to say without someone screaming at you spit on you know and you send things you can't\nI really don't care of your\nDisposition just let's let's have a reason to bake I mean if we can talk with a screaming at each other ... which ... which I don't do\nAnd yet I'm the I called the Clinton machine the Clinton machine has is just you can use to give up the fact that two years ago two years in the ...\nYou know you lost the election of ... I\nGuess what if you love this country if you if you're being honest and then you're going to try to build it up not tear down\nWell again I'm not sure the extent although certainly I've had my differences over the years with the both Clintons especially in regard to uh honesty and and corruption I don't know that we can say that they are personally responsible for the uh the outbreak that we've seen the ... across the country\nUh I Do a Dr Creighton find one thing that I find tragically ironic\nAnd that is that much of what we're talking about here is conducted by groups that roughly called themselves antifa that is to say anti fascist\nAnd the tragic irony is of course that those tactics\nOf a silencing your opponents by intimidation and violence would have been understood by any of Hitler's brown shirts a reference that I'm sure would go right over the limited intellect of most of these people but that is that is is the sad a problem\nAnd that cannot be tolerated when you try to do that from whatever political perspective but you are so pure and you are so virtuous that you don't have to listen to anybody else then the only answer in my book\nAnd you can certainly agree or disagree as you choose the only as written my book is to arrest\nProsecute and if convicted incarcerate such people that is out of bounds you cannot let society be reduced to ... to the level of ... who can put together more of violence in the street\nYou know I I think you're going to several important\nPilots in the street you know I I think you're several important porch or whatever\nThe porch so I Try to make in the book has to do again with the ... psychology of what's taking place at least a large portion of society and it's ... for some time now that there's an increasing degree\nOf of the offices within the society and the judge to increasing degree of moral perfectionism obsession will\nThinking is in society as a result when when when one encounters those types of psychological structuring individuals are those individuals are very prone to what we call projection\nAnd that is that they tend to\nUh take aspects of the the denied a self\nMake up and to place them on people around them\nAre so when you have a group like anti FAA\nAre claiming that the anti fascist and you look at their behavior it's very very obvious that the behaviors that if you're one would expect from the fascist group and so you see this constant accusation coming from the left projecting on the ride for everything that they're doing\nA and denying claiming that it's the rights\nDoing it so that I think the motivation for some of this behavior in terms of how to deal with it I agree with you entirely I think one of the greatest problems that we're encountering in society today\nIs the lack of enforcement of the laws that are ... that are currently on the books\nFor a place like a Portland for for the mayor of Portland to sit by and have people rioting\nOn the streets and refusing to have the police intervened this is a breakdown of the necessary a legal sanctions and boundaries that are a free society must have and if that's gone then it's going to be just a free for all\nYeah ah again it it it is not something that uh that that can could possibly be tolerated and and I see things like that and there have been other examples of some time ago when there was a a police shooting that brought the rioting to Baltimore and the mayor of Baltimore told the authorities to let it burn\nA as if to say if people feel aggrieved enough that they get a free pass are behaving like civilized beings and that is\nAs as you say it I I think I'm not putting words in your mouth that is is pointing us in the direction of anarchy and that is not unacceptable outcome nobody is so aggrieved that they have a right to break the law with impunity nobody\nWho's teaching yeah go ahead\nWell again absolutely but it it's the role of the Gulf than a political local level in the federal law enforce the laws of the country and if they fail to do that than you can expect a increasing outburst from these groups because they're essentially unable to behave badly\nExactly are we are you telling them yes you're tactic and intimidation is working and ah people respond\nPositively win or are they are told that their tactic is uh is going to be tolerated stay with us more to come as a doctor Richard Creighton takes a look at just what is at work here what is the psychology\nInvolved in the the way we are currently conducting a business in this country at the public policy level and it's a\nIt's disturbing but again it's a knowledge and the knowledge is power maybe we can learn something from all of this one eight six six five oh jumbo we'll be back in just a moment\nJim Boeheim
