elected to finally put a stop to it\nAnd the numbers are but I've seen a reported on Fox tonight they were fourteen thousand plus some growing up as high\nOur I what I've seen a reported on Fox tonight they were fourteen thousand plus some growing up as high as ... leaving there might be more than one caravan that starts\nAnd then people have the attitude they're just going to break into the country\nPresident Trump calls up the military and their and I've been guessing talking to some experts of what it would take an unbelievable force to be a human wall to prevent that these people will still try to crash through apparently then you get into the use of force\nAgainst this and you know where that leads that's gonna be a very very big moment I'm not sure if they'll reach the border before the midterms I'm kind of hoping they will so that we see this graphically what's been going on day after day but\nI Want to play you I got a whole bunch of things this hour to catch up on I Want to play you this goes back and I've never been able to get this guy and I've tried mightily I'm a Catholic but guys like this they just sickened me he's the bishop of Tucson why Zimmer\nWeisberg\nAnd um this was during the period of time of the migrant children and allegedly their mom somewhere their mom some we're not you know that whole thing how emotional it was over the summer\nThis guy was at a con fab of bishops and arch bishops and cardinals with all the pre scandal problems he brings up because he speaks in a roundabout way but it's clear what he's saying\nAs a Catholic the worst thing that can do to you is ex communicate you you are kicked out and the methodology of actually mean occasions saying you've seen so grievous leaguers so you're very soul is at risk\nOf going to hell\nThis guy gets up before the bishops and says these border patrol people in the administration not just on the border everybody associated with this that's doing this Trump policy we should consider X. communicating them\nSo that they realize they're risking their soul for this guy and his policies I'm thinking of how dare you\nIs this guy ever speak out about Democrats who masquerade as Catholics on the life issue did we hear him on that so I Want to play that for you analyst or a minus ... village and people are\nSent me detailed reports in the Roman Catholic catty kids about immigration and it doesn't match what this guy's saying it says the country has a right to protect itself\nThe caravan coming our way a lot of young men and their verses women and children and that's one thing to take a look at by the way well this is going on with the midterms I'm coming to your calls in just a second here's an example of how wild it's getting with Democrats\nThey are running the one thing they're running on is Republicans want you and your kids not to have health coverage to die if necessary\nThe preexisting condition argument again\nNow I've had on people that have explained I think fully that's not the Republican position at all so there is a major house race right where I Am in the Philadelphia area it's in a place called Bucks County\nBrian Fitzpatrick is the Republican Scott while I was a very wealthy guy a grandson I guess it is a great great grandson of a um\nA guy who was the vice president of the United states under FDR until he got kicked out because of how far left he was wow is is very far left so he's been prosecuting this campaign saying that Brian Fitzpatrick and this is a key very hotly contested race as far as the house of representatives\nIs a guy who essentially want you to die of have to take away preexisting condition coverage and all that is the Washington Post writes a piece saying that's a lie\nAnd ... should stop saying Brian Fitzpatrick brings it up there were holding a debate on Sunday night in a synagogue now as I understand that this may be a synagogue is very liberal Scott ... wanted to their Scott Wallace is seen as the guy who's anti Israel and that is true the Democrat\nIn the middle of this Wallace can't take it anymore that fits Patrick is using this a Washington Post story to rebut this why\nAnd he drops the F bomb\nNow this is on the is it pronounced the beam ... if you're Jewish synagogues being by an elevated platform used for reading the ... the tour of during services\nAnd then the rabbi and others chastised him for this in other words he blurted out the F bomb towards this stuff from fitzpatrick while in the holiest places I understand it inside the temple\nAnd then he sort of apologizes but not really and he says he's passionate and Democrats want people that are passionate about this what have you heard during this particularly in a circumstance like this guy throwing out the F bomb\nNow if I had to sound the sound was on a well this is what ... wanted his place but a TV station may have gotten it but just think about this and this is classic of what the Democrats are prosecuted\nJust think about this and this is classic of what the Democrats are prosecuting which is out here and say what even the Washington Post as the Republican did not do that would not do that it's a lie wow I Can't take it\nRight there and they you know the secret spot this guy just blurted out I Can't imagine is\nJust never have run into something like this in a circumstance like this I let me go to the cars let's go to Katie in Redding Pennsylvania hey Katie welcome in\nAnd I'm just sitting here listening and she ... she man that kind of late that guy in my opinion even lower than trailer trash you know\nWell it's it's ... and if I get to say on next time I Want to play it you got to stand up Katie this guy is worth of the family was worth three hundred million is silver spoon he just came in is trying to buy his way he lives in a luxury golf course really in South Africa this candidate who came to Bucks County and people here are in shock\nIt's one thing to drop the F bomb during debate that's hard to believe\nBut it's another to do it on the home court where you want it to be in the sacred ground of the temple\n... exactly I mean in my opinion is just a few things in the world that you just don't mess with\nGod yeah one of them yes [laughter] yeah exactly right\nIt's hard to believe thank you Katie thanks very much that's why I'm bringing it up as an example of when they get frustrated on the Democratic side\nWhere this is going it's a David in Greenwich New Jersey although David\nI'm thanks for taking my call and you're willing to point a to a real estate friend of mine who does business who was there\nAnd not only I mean we're liking to that to like be alter the Catholic Church but not only did it drop it there but he's telling me you should have hurt him outside when he was leaving\nFor our OJ thing this crew coming up from Mexico I'm doing the math\nAnd if you have seven thousand people times twelve dollars a day to feed them let's say Mexico's and you're talking about eighty five thousand dollars a day I'm concerned that I'm bothered that depress you see these folks walking ... who's got a backpack who's got nothing who's got nothing there's there's nothing\nThat right well what we've seen radio to Roger point we've seen video at people and that money given that supplies and listen to this I didn't play because it's in Spanish a Univision reporter the translation embedded to your point but the caravan\nSays he's met migrants from known terrorists hot spots like Bangladesh how do people from Bangladesh end up in this sort of a re\nA because you can walk into any part probably of South America anymore but it'd be great if the press would cover it each feeding and the speeding actually stations in the medical stations and then on the third point now where I live down here is\nI can see across the Delaware Bay and maybe even when he too mild but I can see the lights at Dover Air force base and it's it's constant day and night at least the bombers and the each of these monster transport troop trans brothers and equipment transport they fly or you don't hear\nA anytime something's getting ready to happen or go down as we would say it's they stop and we've had nothing now for two days okay nothing would pretty much tells you something is going to be going on in the border pretty much\nSo well right and the areas it's going to take an unbelievable number of troops to do this peacefully though but thank you thanks for all the great points you made here's how you get in eight six six fifty jumbo eight six six fifty Jim I Want to play you quickly one more guys this is Steve Schmidt\nHe is the former McCain advisor used to be a moderate maybe now is full bore he's on MSNBC he's sickened by all this here's what he says when he hears we might use the military we might be doing this at the border here is ah Steve Schmidt\nAnd the idea that when a mother through suffering through a parish for risk and sometimes death\nAll around them when they reach the border and they see a uniform with an American flag\nAnd they are no longer safe but that baby is ripped away and put into an internment camp because this is a moral outrage that harkens to the worst excesses in the history of the countries that have separation of families\nAt the slave auction walks through the separation of Native American families it is a moral or I read the Japanese invaded and this is the failure of the Democratic party to address this is a small issue not as a profound staying on our national water\nAs a poor family on American policy to frame the question for the country Indus file age of ... what is it that we are who are we as a people\nThat is a great question thank you for framing it now answer that\nWe are people that are tired and you can tell me who we are do you look in the mirror and sanction as I Do we are people that are tired of the American worker the American citizen in the American population being overrun in this manner by a bunch of people that have gained one way or another by it\nWhile inflicting damage on countless communities countless people you know I Wonder what Steve Schmidt would say to the families like the young woman takes time we killed\nIn San Francisco by a maniac who have been deported six or seven times I Wonder what he would say to that just collateral damage just one person\nThis is a stain on our national honor is it or is it finally seeing someone that's going to step up on this problem that goes on day to day maybe\nNot on not like we're seeing\nNow but it's a similar problem that we all know was out there that's why he was elected that's what people want him to do that's what I Believe my name is down here down of sitting in

sort of\nIn Houston, Texas selling out or having the arena completely besieged by fans and then guesstimate of maybe a hundred thousand people tailgating or outside big screens and the like just in athletic tonight of what went on their\nEight six six fifty jumbo though will get you in now yesterday here in Philadelphia guy named Eric Reid used to be a he was the guy right there in the beginning but Kaepernick\nWho took a knee remember that the national anthem played for the uh forty niners\nNow plays safety or freeze a strong safety for the Carolina Panthers they played the eagles yesterday here in Philadelphia and I'm watching before the game and Fox to their credit did talk about it a little bit there was this confrontation which uh read started going crazy\nCalling Malcolm Jenkins who's become kind of the face of the protest but he's not doing the kneeling or the raised fist or anything anymore and Eric Reed went after him as a sellout\nAnd calling him and Neal colonialist Neal colonial is insane all over the kneeling thing which is still going on now the NFL this year I think is doing better because they have some exciting stuff going on there my home's kid for Kansas City and all that they've got some interesting story lines this year\nBut I still don't think I still think there's a bit of a a problem you see what some teams still not selling out still some of the TV ratings are soft\nDepending upon the game in the middle of this comes Amy Schumer comedienne Amy Schumer she's sitting out super\nBowl fifty three\nShe will not appearing any ads\nIn solidarity she says with Colin Kaepernick\nAre hitting the NFL with the advertisers the only way to really hurt them I Know opposing the NFL as like opposing the in are a very tough but you want to be proud of how you make your living stand up for your brothers and sisters of color is what she posted on Instagram\nA Schumer suggested last year's half time performer broom five should also resign other celebrities like Jessica Seinfeld Christie Brinkley offered their support Christie Brinkley last week ... reportedly turned down a chance to play the super bowl halftime performance in support of cap for all righty then\nIt's continuing it's still on we'll see who they get in for a Super Bowl halftime which is a plum type of thing to put it mildly but are there you go now Amy Schumer out\nBut I have to say as three four or five weeks of the NFL somehow or another the numbers have gone down drastically\nAnd or you're not seeing these sort of spasms that's why yesterday's fight and what went into it\nWas pretty incredible to put it mildly eight six six fifty jumbo yet you on board the caravan proceeding toward us or several caravans are one of the big stories I see tonight around the caravan is Univision there is a reporter embedded with them and in Spanish\nAnd the translation he said tonight is that um he's seen people from Bangladesh\nFrom El Salvador places where there noted hotbeds of terrorism or terrorist activity joining up in this carbon he's imbedded he's Univision\nHe's not some conservative Breitbart whatever\nThat's out there it's Univision saying that and that's a real worry now I don't think we can definitively prove that Democrats have somehow that I don't think they have the ability to orchestrate this but do the various Soros organizations are they helping to organize the chaos so to speak maybe\n... got to do a better job of digging that out how is it these people can travel all this distance without substance I mean where's that coming from who's funding we have seen video at people and denounce money and all that\nWould this be the type of thing that Soros you would think would be interesting sure absolutely if they get here though
