really their insiders and talk about Russia all day long on that\nLet me ask you a bit about that than since you since you brought it up or is there any such international body there is of course a world courts and uh there are various ah\nAh bodies that the United nations most notably the Security Council of uh like I'm not sure that I wouldn't necessarily in many cases be particularly prone to to depend on such international bodies which I find in many cases it but didn't end up at best and the and the hospital to U.S interests that red worst\nBut I I Am curious if it's such a pug bodies even exist usually law and regulation a trail far behind technology especially in this day and age\n[noise] no you're exactly right and it always sounds wonderful and it's really dangerous because there's a really really really powerful weapon and I'm as pious plan on the side of how we all get along to them by ah I I don't want this weapon\nGiven to anyone that's not mature enough and the world is certainly not mature enough for this weapon and they will take it over they will regulate speech they will suppress their people they will\nThey will use it for propaganda and group think I mean it's just way too dangerous which is why\nYou know I always thought the United states should control most of this still\nAnd and we're saying this because again it's a fundamental lack of accountability we have a new wittingly put all our chef says one big cloud and so you can punch sure that you can get a huge when all you can find the fact that we have that\nAll sort of in one space it's almost like we should go back one eighty and do everything paper because it was harder to screw up altogether and then you take the fact that people aren't really held that ... the bad actors are in locations they are making a fortune outfits that lying is acceptable normal\nSomething that's so it goes against the grain of sand people in this country ... just can't be foolish and that would be really foolish and the United nations I'll forget it uh maybe they have but it's just so far\nAway it so yeah I I think the real solution is going to be technologically\nYeah I Would have to think so as regards what you just said by the way this notion of a paper is oh so twentieth century well you know what is there are certain certain things about twentieth century that that uh we're better uh the mere fact that we have a technical capability does not mean that we should automatically embrace it and in point if for example\nAh it's been noted that there is no central computer in this country for election results are in which someone could hack in and also the outcome well thank goodness for that\nI personally am not encouraged by this move away from paper ballots there is a perfect trail right there of how people voted\nIf somebody hack something or something gets deleted you can have the validity of an election destroyed in an instant ... and uh I personally am of the opinion that the paper ballots are the way to go and if anybody thinks that that makes me a retro or luddite weld boo hoo\nWell we we do have short attention span of sure don't like the way for people to count I don't want it to the baby out the bath water ON Technology there shouldn't be\nBut but there is got to be something there's got to be safety measures put in place so that everything's not
