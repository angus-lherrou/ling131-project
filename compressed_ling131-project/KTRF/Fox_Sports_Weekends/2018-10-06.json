[laughter] [noise] she was having again while we got baseball got base will happily have first the first added October\nFor big Dave college football but look I spent all week just riveted to baseball big lake\n... why not I mean you know for what it's worth I think it is a sham but the wild card games are actually interesting and fun to watch\nYou know I mean I think they should be series no no there's no doubt about it but I'm I'm just saying at least they were decent games for the most part you know they were they they they were good and then you know for ... it it seems a little bit um\nI guess what is what's the word I'm looking for it it seems like it doesn't have a lot of inspiration is the first couple of games because like\nI watch the Milwaukee game yesterday and it was good for a couple of innings and then\nYou know the Colorado kind of lost it you know the sort of they and their guys weren't hitting you expected ice right to see a lot of hitting from Iraqis as far as I was one nothing a feeling yeah yeah yeah so you know I I understand the purest out there that like you know good defense good pitching and all that other stuff I'm\nI'm I'm just one of those I Want to see you know I might I might ladies tricks thing along ball so do I want to see the film running\nPolite I Am you know when you first one he ... he gave them eat but I hear you and I I loved it I thought it was a great day yesterday of baseball we had four games yesterday\nUh all the favorites when all the home teams wing yesterday right and uh it was it was starts with Berlin's are linked ha ha and throws my God and offend me champions meant he would say she'll man in these teams legit I Love that in the middle of that line up\nAnd they were uh the Bruins are\n[noise] he can just be nasty nasty stuff that was the end and that you know that more in Berlin that came out and did what he did it just reminded me you know ... it's lonely at the top but\nThe Houston Astros there they were the world champs her last year for ... and\nAnd they might have been you know I haven't paid a whole lot of attention to baseball this season but they might have gone through it a little bit quiet or if you will the whole season and now they're you know the put themselves into it but what they did to the clover and those Indians who my goodness it's\nYeah and look they start off early right bringing home run there and and Springer and now to pay for nothing in the fifth inning\nThe or the tribe comes back to make it forward to\nBut then a lemon seventh happen then they and they tag on a two more and that's the ball game right there\nSo that's the first game of the day the second day the game is the second day a ... game today link\nIs what you'd reference Milwaukee Colorado and I think you're right and then everybody expected that to being offensive series yet ride around looking out on paper I just saw ... yeah you know Milwaukee's a team that can that compound the ball and obviously so or the Rockies particularly\nWhen they go home and look it was changed the against Anderson yeah and if there's ever going to be some off and she thought it was going to be against us eight or ... yeah and yeah but you know when there's the problem is chasing pitch well you skate some wild in this but he pitched well and again they that walk\nThe bullpen it's game over if you live and that's why I think they can come out of the national league because as good as the Dodgers are if they have a lead they're on top of all because of their bullpen\nBecause they come at you they got to worry a ... and of course I ... and Jeffrey's and you know they they can just that they can just end the game early this artist allowed to go deep way\nYeah yeah and you talk about the strategy that goes into a you know what the what these managers do and especially the men the mid game a strategy with the pictures were perfect pitch rotations it is very impressive [noise]\nYeah I mean ... you know they're closer go choo weddings and they are only gets it gets the one I I mean they're they're they're nasty and look David\nEven ate yet really right right ... you know they they got a little mini rally they get they get the three in the eighties but well I mean they've done that they've completely shut down the Rockies yeah completely shut down the rock and then of course last night\nIt was Red Sox and Yankees and it was wild early tail looked good early my gosh right his stuff\nOn the way the bottom of follow the ball when he was like you look like what's curling right over to the plate and it just drop I mean it was unbelievable I was watching it from the airport in and and before I didn't have it on a plane but I was watching it from the airport and he has some just wasted stuff in the first the first couple of innings\nIt was yeah I mean night at eight strike out now he goes five in the third and it was interesting because Jay happened pitched really\nWell against the red socks this year yeah and Jay have owned the Sox\nAre career why write a bad first dating they jump all over all ... Martinez who has been you know the to me that he was the signing of the all seeing all the difference right yeah and he has been all year long\nHe eats a three run Homer to get it all started\nThere were all five nothing yeah\nAnd then they have to hold on it gets dicey arid judge lead off home more than nine to make the five four\nBut ... and he changed three straight pitch it yeah that second pitch was a cookie right daddy daddy chopped for a strike and then the ... then they get them on a on a on a curve\nBall that that just drops out and freeze in their\n... ... it was ... at the temporal ...\nRight after when he took that ... the old ones fast ball down the metal that force team or I was I was shocked and then you know and he strikes out in the voice out strikes out then the red Sox hold on to win game on\nThis may well you know what it is a great time of year you know hockey started when I landed in LA I think the kings were playing the sharks I saw that on the TV\nOr watch the end of the Dodgers game I mean those are so ... it's it's a great time of year we talked about October is a great my\nBeat out and that it's it's the best the Dodgers\nThe Dodgers were a are dominant right the Dodgers just started just of another clash with the Braves gr Shaw was ridiculous last night and talked about you mentioned him at the start of Clinton curse Shaw meant eight innings\nOnly three strike that's what he was economical his pitches ... eighty five pitches ... eight innings is shut out ball just choose heads he gives up\n... ... just shut out ball just choose hits he gets up a lead off double to cool to match it other than a than a and then feel to hit yeah the rest of the way man you\nNeeded it gave me you know reassurance at what an ace is supposed to look like I mean and it doesn't always have to be\nThe caves up there we just talk about but you talk about a true ways as you mentioned managers himself for all those innings you don't see a lot of that in these days you don't see a lot of pitchers going distance because they're the big way managers or should treat him a ball counts and all this other stuff but he\nWas a true ways last night Matty would hit the big home run yeah and that gets started\nLook I I don't know how I don't know how to [laughter] I'm a breath bridges can't compete against no I ... yeah yeah and I was wondering I I'll be\nVideo of the I don't even know what it was it looked like the guys weren't offensive mass or something like that in this kind of it's kind of freaky I didn't notice that one I didn't see that one\nOr two was freaky I said earlier you know if you if you buy me a favor right but you any body solve this cause like if anybody knows this dude and has an idea of what or who the guy was\nPlease let me know because you're H freaking me out the guy was should the third base side of home plate next to this blond he's got to put on and like links said out of fencing type of\nMath he looked like ... ... what you look like it was we were like ... the Greek [noise] did you\nI did it look like each he was sitting in the front row it ... it looked like ET was sitting in the front row\nI mean it was crazy I was like I couldn't I couldn't control in the game to watch you to do that oh my God\nThe things that things that people do behind home plate like I was I was saying that there was um I was watching the the bird game\nBecause the umpire Katie is a good friend of mine who smoked cigars go used to live in Phoenix um uh and he was doing I was so proud to see my plate and then and then and then to the left of him there was this blonde lady had short blond hair and there was this guy I think he was wearing them\nI think it was when it ... or something you were ... he stood out but the the reason why was the ladies stood out short blond is every time she wanted to ... to do something\nOr you know like get a strike out or hit a big hit it hit the ball to put our hands together you remembered I Dream of Jeannie away Jeannie blinked magic she would do that every time one for every pitch\nAnd it caught my eye was like wow really you think you think you have control over it and so she kept going up forever [laughter] and that's what it is one stood out in the Milwaukee oh my\nGod oh that's great yeah I mean you're you're right that this one just just got me a you know I was Tam or find sound engineer so I Would say did did you see the video\nOr of the ghoulish a narrow [laughter] I just ... you didn't watch the game live ah no I didn't catch that one was good that is a it's creepy I don't know what what's the deal with that person is it looked like maybe they had like a ... mosquito net over their face\nAnd I understand I I don't go out there yeah I don't know if it did you watch it do you where you're distracted by did you see it\nI honestly do not see it to be honest with you I miss that you don't want to make that part I watch the game balls in and out I was doing a lot at once I was working as a game or the ...\nI Am the fake I'm watching the game and like all of us I Can't stop looking at this thing so then I started to wonder\nSo I was getting my friends are Bob them like you know you see that's what's going on then I start to wonder what's that Tom Brady at the game\nLike Tom Brady that want to be seen so yeah the ... at the fed and I think that at all\n[noise] the bigger the bigger question who's the blonde you're sitting next [laughter]\nBecause of ... which is [laughter]\nYeah right right right yeah but I don't even know when she was whether\nWell as they were close enough you know given by association [laughter]\nHave been Brady was\nLike this during your GED past ... says I Want to go she decides Yankees\nHe's big time and he's got a couple of boxes probably for himself now\nWell and this is ... linked just sent it to him here I'm\nLike a man without a face [laughter] going on while that is really creepy\nShe first I thought I was wondering is it the network\nBugs and the guy I think so because they look like hey look I'm I'm right now more than a front\nRow behind on play but I don't want to be seen so could you block my face oh\nI see somebody like about it on by it was somebody of somebody who's ... ... ... I don't know\nI I didn't I wasn't sure the ... winter yeah there is if any body ... nose up this man of this ghoulish figure where you sit next to the game that I didn't I\nOf this goal which figure where you sit next to the game\nThat I didn't I didn't know what the deal is it I mean not [laughter] or their fear age seven seven nine of Fox by the way they re just eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox if you had theories evil right it is\nBecause he freaking me out may it's freaking me out man it's freaking me out like you have no idea\nIt's freaking me out ... years out by that time it is\nI Love October I Do I Love it I Love October I Love October for one reason\nAll the sports collide he's right it's a great college in of all the sports my favorite month of the year October isn't\nThat's nice my love and I'm at I'm Eileen fan so I'll be honest with you know you go do what the way you dress up as what he would he would he would he's on his I dress up every year by what are what are you going to tell you that they do I don't know whatever the kids you know I I like the kids choose my costume right okay so whatever they want I last year I was a a\nSome sort of the dinosaur figure can solve that some craziness going sometimes or\nThat the the the the big one wanted me to wear so I go wherever they like what they like it is a big Jay of college football huh\nAnd uh just just to get you up a little bit of this it's coming from 'cause there's some really good early games obviously Texas Oklahoma Red River rivalry yeah and I'm I'm curious because Texas place you'd come football man surprising\nSo I didn't think Texas additive him ah especially when you see the way they started against Maryland but since then they have played some good football in Oklahoma for what it's worth with all the talent they have and of course they have some injuries is issues as well\nBut for all the talent that they have it seems like Oklahoma has a net terrible knack of letting people hang around or just make things interesting it's her they're not as lights out as you would think there would be so this could get a very interesting and we see now things are bounce to the underdog or the other side if you will many a times uh in especially in this series\nYeah look you know we all saw army and army hanging around push Oklahoma overtime yeah yeah\nSo I always stayed hung around on on even usually early hung around bell or for up until the fourth quarter yeah ... was in the game against Oklahoma so I'm curious to see their taxes could keep ... I I'm I have my doubts\nBut I'm curious to see if taxes can connect with them well of course\nYeah I mean I I think we're right now to this point the most impressive when is there went over TCU right yeah I'm In you know and and you look at them and they have enough for a four game win streak says they drop that want to Marilyn their hot or do they have enough to to stay with them for four corners that's that's the big S.\nIt's a big question the\nAh there's some there's some good games today though uh ... again ... Texas and Oklahoma we talked about Ella shoe and Florida number five dollars should I still think that's too high for him against the twenty second ranked Florida Gators\nI I I'm\nHaving trouble reading this game Florida and LSU yeah\nWell Florida has a hard time getting her off and started sometimes and you know LSU has their issues are scoring so expect a low scoring game if that if that's the case then that definitely favors the the the tigers\nYou thanks have slowly you think it favors the\nThe if it if it's if it's a low scoring game I mean it's it's a big if it which team's going to show up 'cause I I like ... defense but you know off its essence on some trouble guards on arts I'm getting\nIn and look for is often says no joke is is you know juggernaut either ... right right he drew Miller Leighton\nYeah\nMm they I'm I'm ... I'm curious because all those quick passes\nThey're not going to work against ... that's not going to work in sales you know I think ... they ... on a tight yeah on the receivers\nThat I I'm not sold on Florida's office of line and whether or not they can handle that demeans the difference maker for LSU yeah have you and I ... you like kind of see the same way Miami, Florida state's is always a fun one chains they see for forty states used the\nMask one yeah yeah yeah for the state struggling I I think Miami I think Miami mainly for for the fact that it's that in state rivalry that that takes over there I think I think we'll see it a good\nGame out of Miami Today yeah yeah\nI I think you're right or burn Mississippi State tonight when now but good game are you waiting for all burns it really kind of flex\nI was thinking well sooner or later you're gonna have to find a way to separate themselves before they get ready for the big game against Alabama right I mean because you know as dominant as Alabama looks you know you're trying to figure out who can possibly challenge them who's going to make things interesting how the less I in in you know\nBe a fan of unimpressive I I look they beat why she started to season which was a good when right\nWhy she came back and became must we forget yeah yeah yeah they came back a little bit of Washington and have their problems in the red zone and three trips down there and I think and I can't remember nine points so they lose to el issue at home and uh and and and again going back and forth\nThey beat Arkansas and it was not very good and uh\nAnd we're just like wondering what that what the heck was that because you guys know I'm In Ohio State fan I I was shocked that Ohio State even had a chance and again because they were awful for most of that game\nOffensively they could move the ball\nPenn State's defense we all thought it was going to be an up and down shootout like the big twelve it was it was a competitive it ... it wasn't even really competitive\nAnd then all of a sudden in the fourth quarter penalty ... one of the quarterback was horrible yeah yeah yeah Haskins horrible yeah Haskins just got it there was pressure to face every single a bright lights yeah he yeah he melted had one of those orally now did everything he possibly could end the biggest problem that I\nWith that final play yes it was read option and he had the option to hit you shouldn't have even been in that situation you've got treatment solely was putting out like a Heisman level performance like he was doing everything and the decision was made read option and they hand off the ball it made zero sense to me\nIf you're going to find your they're fit worked we wouldn't be talking about it\nWell I mean that's that's all you but I got to do what they call it was a horrible cough and ... all your work that out\nSo I but if it works is still terrible call\n... ... I was fan Anthony this fan he was very polite he just said it was dead quiet and airplanes some country songs planners to our Sinatra's plan over loudspeakers is I Love you coach said the terrible call\nAnd James frankly it was maybe about Fifteen feet away twenty feet away and if if he hadn't been restrained I bet Franklin runs up to the to the\nTo the the only man because the families right the famous writer wherever he wasn't going to like get\nInto the he wasn't going to get into stand the test but other than going to do y'all the guy he was ... due to Adam\nYeah and he was it wasn't even that bad of a sort of a heckling it was just sort of like love your coach but it was a terrible call man Franklin just gotta night it was a he's had to run back in there so\nDon't be mad at you blew it conflict or not and I saw a ...

think you have the dignity consideration I'm after a while you you begin to look look bigger ... tremendous don't tell the Murray has tremendous don't um but when you do see these numbers the numbers are kind of parallel you do wonder how many how much of that is due to a system maybe elevating the plate yeah Jenny\nBeth was there she joins us now live on Fox Sports radio with a later\nAfter sexism Oklahoma guinea is so great to have you and I I Know sexist one but we got to start with ... ah did anybody\nYou know check in with him and said are you sure you don't want to play football at the next level or are we sure about that\nOh boy this kid is impressive I I think that's what's crazy first of all thanks for having me guys I'm you know Kylah or was this storyline heading into this one and unfortunately he's going to look back and think of those\nCritical turnovers and he's going to think twice about this performance but what we saw from him in terms of his athleticism like that Seventy seven yard\nA touchdown pass the Hollywood that was incredible then we saw that sixty seven yard run for the score and the fourth quarter that was I mean\nThe guy's an athlete and you know we talk so much about his future as a baseball player but you know how can you not look at how\nTalented he is as a quarterback of the football team so it's really something is going to be thinking about the last I checked with him personally baseball was all the uh all about the future for him but he wanted to take this Oklahoma teamed far I Know he'll be bond with\nThis performance night in terms of those turnovers\nWith a flip it on the other side with Texas Longhorns do this I knew that it could be close but I don't know if there are many people that do judge who could really knock off Oklahoma\nWell what's cool about this Texas team 'cause we've now been around them for a little bit and you know you look at that first law against Maryland which that was a\nVery interesting game Maryland was playing for a a falling teammates they had these horrible weather delays there was a lot of interesting circumstances to that match or benefits\nYou know the first the first weekend for for Texas but since that game um I feel like they've just found their identity and a different way and\nSomething coach Herman said to me when I interviewed him post game he said we figured out how to finish and we finished today and yes they did allow Oklahoma back in the next and that fourth quarter but this team is playing inspired and the players all week you can sense the confidence that's what I got from that and they were saying we want to play this game\nWe've been waiting to prove what Texas is about and I didn't really get that in the last couple of years with the Texas football team and it just proves that over time and ... what ... doing is working for the program Jimmy\nThey keep surprising us you know you mentioned that Mary Adrian but we've also we've learned over the years in college football that if you make your mistake really early ... there's time to recover from that and now when you don't wins over us here in DC you in Oklahoma\nAnd uh you know some other interesting opportunities Oklahoma states still ahead on the schedule\nOr the Texas Longhorn him a mixed year for the national championship\nBoy I think that if we asked them that they'd probably say hold up let's just wait to see because there's a few other big games they've got coming in terms of the conference but are they you know taking the driver seat in the big twelve absolutely and a guy like\nI I got to look to their quarterback and Salinger because\nI think that he's been criticized last year and this is a player that not only is respected by his teammates and coach is just the confidence he's playing with five total TVs today three hundred and eighty six totally arts I'm pretty sure that the career high for the guy but just\nLet us as always thought from collar but the guy was moving we saw the legs get going and um the way he's been able to kind of command the often is something that has really been a difference for the team and I think that they're responding well to him as the leader and they have high expectations are the group\nI'm over the last few weeks it seems like there's been a little bit of a change in terms of the office of political overtime Herman maybe injecting himself more into that is this something that is true if you take in more ownership remote control the office of reason which because it appears that the officers playing better\n[noise] well he you know what he did say last week he had to take over some of those calls which did happened last week the reference of coordinator was set cans of a fluke\nKind of a visit to the hospital so\nHe was not I'm with them but he said he was a bit too conservative in the past with them and the two of just kind of developed a different kind of trust\nThat they feel like they equally are good each other and just are feeling more comfortable together so I think a lot of ways it's just a more comfortable often as a whole and they're willing to take some of those chances that maybe they weren't able to do before and the damage showing that he can be that guy for them\nJourney did you get a chance to talk to any Texas fans who sort of a I think now feel like the program as a whole\nHas turned the corner you know I I'm always interesting when you have a a a real blue chip type program like this I Am a fan base has gone through a few years of feeling like this is not up to our standards I'm always aware of like women that moment that they sort of feel like we're back is today it\nWell you know I got that sense from the fans that one of course they're going to celebrate the victory but I think the fear is if you look at the fact that it was forty five\nTwenty four heading into the fourth and\nOklahoma called their way back into this I mean it was we we were down to the very on there and it could have been a very different outcomes are\nAnd I think that's the that's the one place for the fans are going to fear that they still need to be better but light coach for him and said we found a way to finish and that's what they're going to build on after that but the fan base was excited and I mean just the\nRed River okay and this was my first time first time covering it just to see the Oklahoma fans and the ... fans were at the Texas state fair\nAt the cotton ball I mean I don't know if it gets better honestly this is an instant classic that I'm Still kind of coming down from because the energy in the atmosphere with something I have never serious\nYou know Jenny and thinking about Oklahoma coming off this law do they believe or do they have the sense that it still can buy their way back into the playoff contention\nYou know I I talk to their S. I. D. post game and he said that Lincoln had some really powerful words in the last\nAnd um and he said that Lincoln had some really powerful words in the locker room and he said he handled it really well and this is a team that I think in two thousand six when they lie to protect the last time I think that in the team they ended up going on\nTo the playoffs and I think I I'm pretty sure that number sounds\nRight I I I Know that they've rebounded post there and look at this team could went out and meet taxes again and that championship game which can be pretty special so\nI I don't want to doubt Oklahoma I think unfortunately the center's lead that and the question mark and it's going to remain when you allow it seemed like that put up forty eight against yeah that's going to be something you're going to be thinking about and they made a lot of improvements there I Know that the the leaders of that defense guys like cat Murray they're not going to please and that man with that performance\n[noise] we have not I am eastern\nSix specific on Fox Sports radio\n[noise] check out\nHis name's Collin Keller great she I said please don't godly Tom Parker might harm it Archie Jonas not [laughter] people such good these are the names that bring you the best sports talk\nOr your week days you know I agree\nWith some wonderful things are you with us this is Fox Sports

Thursday um\n\n\nI'm a new car member and discover called a match all the cash back you've earned dollar for dollar to end his first year learned more discovered dot com slash match limitations applied liked us off this also raises them off road way right [noise]\nI'm a little upset\nGoing on up to me uh up in the blue served still ten minutes to go with the aspects of just taking a Nineteen Seventy that number twenty four\nBoise State don't call the Boise Boise Boise\nI used to live there for a couple of summers that some a minor league baseball broadcast\nOh did you local knowledge Boise which yes one of those things everybody calls the Boise a and that's the that's the locals way of knowing what an outsider's and you're like oh you called the Boise\nA we call this guy Bill Hancock is the executive director of the college football playoff\nKind enough to join us today bill we really appreciate it thank you so much\nI I was really struck by uh the interview and quotes that you gave about a week and a half ago with regard to for instance some of the group of five schools like central Florida and you stated that in your opinion they do have a path\nTo the college football playoff I I'm not sure I really see that can you explain what what their past might be\nWell two things first thank you for having me on yes secondly you're the knowledge one of my pet peeves because there is no street in Boise\nThat's right oh I S a F you see their point was from a really was funny because I when I moved there I'd never been there and I get there and I'm watching the news one night\nAnd and the the age or says Boise and I go [laughter] she talks about like what is not and and so\nAnd then the next day her did it again and they did it again and again and so I started asking him why have the the rest of us all just been doing this wrong and they're like yeah pretty much [laughter] okay I Walk anymore\nOh that's in theater and I'll tell you one of one of my favorite places actually when I was director the NCA tournament teams would get assigned there and they would complain about it until they went there and they would come back and then they would say wow what a great play\nNo doubt about it when I found out I was moving there I ended up getting paranoid guy on the golf course one time I told them I was going to do at the time I said Boise and uh he goes oh boy who goes that's kinda like Bakersfield and not nothing against Bakersfield but when I got to Boise I'm like\nYeah that's not like Bakersfield at all that that's [laughter] there's nothing similar about those two places except for the pie in front of their name I'm not sure that guy had been to\nEither more or less right All right All right well thank you for doing it so so yeah I couldn't go you please a ... on that idea of the group of five teams\nYeah happy to do that frankly when your game probably a good schedule when your games and you're going to be in the\nUm and there is no better example than Houston two or three years ago they had it all to eat up they had a great victory over Oklahoma\nThey were they were rolling that they they were all set and then of course they had the unfortunate last that navy and I think they lost to SMU later on but it it can be done play a good schedule when your games and and you're just you're being\nDoes play a good schedule when your games and and you'll just you'll be in the heart\nYou know it's oh it's so early to speculate but right now it seems like the usual suspects are in contention Alabama Georgia Ohio State Clemson I'm for you guys when you look at the layoff does it ever get boring potentially seeing the same themes in those four spots\n[noise] [noise] oh my goodness not not for the committee now not for us or it's just a matter of evaluating the resumes evaluating the games that we watch on on video\nAnd now it's not boring at all it's just it's exciting actually what what we're in a phase there's no doubt where\nAlabama and and Clemson are in a very positive cycle so Ohio State so as Oklahoma Denver ... college football college football so I worked in cycles and and that will be that will continue to be the case\nBill Hancock executive director college football playoff joining us so a bill ... let me let me continue in fact and and ask about a team like central Florida which is you said you know play good schedule with all your games will be in the hard certainly people could ask about the teams that are on their schedule although there's only so much that's in their control they did with all of their games\nUm and and I looked at them and what happens is the following year for instance it feels like the polls at the beginning of the year certainly take into account what a team did the year before because what else do we know when teams are zero in zero however central Florida\nAt the end of the year last year they they win a game like all bird and then they came back the following year and dropped about Fifteen spots in the pre season polls and now have to climb their way back up again so what's the deal there\nWhich is why the committee doesn't use ... to the polls that all we don't pay any attention to those calls a ... and you always talked about that at this I Know those polls are great for promoting the game\nThe great to get excited about their teams before the season but the preseason polls on me but they don't mean anything\nBecause you're right it's based on what happened last year and and maybe based on whether they have a quarterback returning that we just don't pay any attention to them\nYou know in in thinking about quarterbacks I'm looking at it seemed like a Notre Dame who's made a quarterback change with in both they're more exciting obviously when officers because there are a little more balanced but they're sending a nice position right now when you look at the fighting fires in the fact that they're playing an independent schedule where does some of the things that you're looking forward to separate them from a team that plays in a conference\n[noise] hard for me to talk about specific teams that I don't usually like to do it but I I I Would just say\nIt it's it's the same way we evaluate all team's strength is scheduled do they have at at games against the other teams that are in the race what about common opponent and and none of them will be evaluated the very same white\nYou know the comment about Notre Dame reminded me of something if you went on the basis of returning quarterback look at the teams\nAs last year that didn't finished with the same quarter back they started with um and I would say Alabama and Georgia is it pretty well [laughter]\nA Bill Hancock a executive director college football playoff joining us uh they'll also want to ask this just because I Know a lot of our listeners feel this way at all can only tell you I Am as well like I'm I Am one of those fans that holds\nOffer more teams being in there at the end of the year whether it'd be eight whether it be like what used to be called one double a in has sixteen or anything like that\nWhen a fair to ask you that what are the chances of that sometime soon what's your answer\n[noise] when we created the play off we evaluated a whole spectrum of different options including [noise] go back to the way the football used to be whether it was had a chance for number one or two to make all the way over to sixteen team tournament\nAnd we settled on for because we wanted a brac with one of the playoffs the one of the bracket but we didn't want to take away from the regular season we have the most compelling and the most meaningful regular season in sports\nAnd none of us want to do anything to take away from that I read an article last week and said a bigger playoff would change the culture of college football I I happen to believe that ... and I know the president and the commissioners did when they when they set up the playoff and when they set it up\nFor twelve years of course we have eight more years to go on this agreement and I'll add one more thing I think in in the year twenty twenty three ... uh it'll come it'll be time to think about the future\nBut until then our our our leadership groups are quite happy with what we have and I say let's all just sit back and enjoy this\nGreat for came events that we have\nYeah yeah I Know that's interesting that that are twenty twenty three is the time that that you know you might reevaluate are or who knows what will happen but I also I ... I I don't know I I Wonder about this though from from from this perspective I mean did you look at other sports even for instance the NFL um you know\n... you say it might less than the regular season I I Wonder about the idea of ever having a way to finish the season where guys like you wouldn't have to necessarily sit in a in a board room somewhere and decide who's going to go where in other words is there ever a way where college football\nSimply sends people to a playoff based solely on whether they wanna division or a conference similar to the way other sports operate\nYou know blows whoa whoa\nWhoa ing champion will emerge on Fox Sports radio\nIndeed knows it's hard to find qualified candidates when you're hiring like finding a unicorn boy you post your job on indeed it's easy to find people with skills you need a\nNurse practitioner for plus years experience acute care certification indeed have the huge pool of amazing candidate\nAnd screen or tools that help you find your most qualified applicants and in the Irish shortlist of unicorn even more than three million companies worldwide you didn't need to hire post your job and indeed dot com slash higher indeed the world's number one job site source Concord and discover\nWe believe anniversary should be a time of celebration not obligation\nThat's why we think annual fees are ridiculous and now just for giving us a try we're going to get new card members a one year anniversary gift they'll never forget\nAt the end of your first year will match all the cash back you earned dollar for dollar no cap and they'll catch is because we know if you try us you'll like it and that's worth every penny try it and believe it at discovered dot com slash match cash back match up or only for a new car members limitations apply\nOkay to Europe than twelve thirty in Ninety three point three FM forecast for northwest Minnesota\nFor tonight expecting mostly ... guys with low temperatures dip into around thirty degrees lumber wins out of the north and nor the then for your Sunday holding on to cloud cover but still looking to stay dry there with ties approaching the middle part of their forties\nThen for your Sunday night rain becoming likely could even make systems know showers late in the night with most in the mid thirties for Monday any rain snow makes changing over to rain mid forties and said that chance for rain into your Monday Night til though around thirty five\nTuesday slight chance for a shower they're up to a high forty six for Tuesday night rank and makes us some snow showers lows dropping into the mid thirties and into your Wednesday rain snow mixture early in the day changing back over to rein in science warm up to forty fallen\nInto your Thursday and next year Brennan snows in the cooler signed up for thirty in the year ... forty three for ... twelve thirty in Ninety three point three fmri and Michael camera\nMight run his route in a way to get somebody else open it up like that [noise] we need to get a Baker made you're talking about Oklahoma and Cleveland and [noise]\nIt's done children [noise] thing that we would do to do even those little things [noise] 'cause you're a rookie quarterback his second start and he's saying it's stuff like that we need to get ... [noise]\nThat's a shot at you Jack [noise] he's head coach Hugh Jackson is in year three in Cleveland and you're telling me he doesn't have people doing the little things doing the things they're supposed to do [noise] Baker Mayfield is staying with [noise] with ground aren't really going to stay [noise]\nNot good that's an indictment of his head coach\nYou can podcast all of our shows like searching Fox Sports radio when you're twenty four seven sports entertainment that we are Fox Sports radio [noise]\nFriend Mike\nYankees beat the eight seven to ... try to do it tonight by going with a full time gave tried to bullpen bullpen it is a thing called painting is the thing is like clubbing for hiking bold than it is a thing or swinging\nIt's a thing now where teams are going to try and the play offs to instead of starting a traditional starting pitcher if they don't have good enough starting pitchers were going to do with bullpen narrative fuel momentum ... guys coming in to pitch\nThe majority of the ... I mean I might be strange at first but\nEventually it's a lifestyle the gains accepted and and I know many people are down on gold panning and why are you having bullpen pictures come in and teach the first couple of these well not every team has two or three really did start as Lindsey that Jesus man with white Carmine yes the last man standing\n... pm eastern damp boxes horse race\nBetween the odd couple [noise]\nMy point is this here's my\nPoint Chris Broussard Enron Parker Iran if he were to go somewhere else other than the Lakers regulations you go to ...
