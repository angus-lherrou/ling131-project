I I got to be full disclosure I\nHad a long day yeah I Do a better job a full time and\nA show and then we had to my niece's partied so I'm watching the game to party and then I go home and I'm watching the game and and\nI actually stopped it was it was after the the that Utah pulled away from UCLA was current route right I was all on baseball and I I does does and I it was\n... I ... you wouldn't be expected anything different come on man I'll be honest I there were times where the game was watching me more time that I was watching it I had and now it on TV and I was in bed I was like as I got to get up you know at one thirty two o'clock to get over here and get ready for this show ah my my thing the TV was watching me many times [laughter]\nYeah I was ... I was the top of the search you\nAnd I remember letting my ears do this\nTo topple the thirteenth and they did the red Sox just scored on the throne our mhm right and and and I'm going and I like let myself all the fall asleep [laughter] thinking that it'll probably be I'll probably get re overcome that it's probably over\nSo I let myself sleep and try to try to stay in a way\nAnd then I wake up and I'm like oh my God just to check the score [laughter] and it was one of those moments that it's it's a question that I have for you and our crew\nAnd the audience which is when you went the baggage X back being something and woke up to it amazing surprise\nRight like I expected when I fell asleep I fell asleep expecting the red Sox to be up to three ... right I expected Boston to have won that game last night right and the Dodgers come back and now you come back\nBut they play five more innings\nAnd they it's just incredible drama\nOpposite of among the I went back and I visit to the ... the home run you know\nI mean it was it was it was just unbelievable federally\nWell I mean you know here here's the thing I as I said I found the the the TV on watching me more and uh I think when\nI fell asleep the first time was probably in the eighth any or somewhere around there somewhere around I Can't remember what any was\nBut it was it was just going back and forth nobody was making headway is built on that wasn't the because the other was still in pitch and um but yeah it's just it it just went back and forth and then all of a sudden you would hear this loud share something with starting in ... what\nWhat happened oh OK doctors up okay a boss who came back up ... oh man it looks like and you fall asleep so I kept going in and out the entire evening and so finally I think it was around the thirteenth fourteenth I was just like I Can't do any more I've got to get some sleep because now I'm a I'm I feel ... denies\nThat word I just thought that I feel I have a guy you know I don't know if you\nHad to turn off the TV but then I woke up earlier before the show I Walk around one and caught up with this you know the the highlights and everything it was like wow seven and a half hours are you kidding me I could you imagine being at the park for that long and it was crazy but it was a great again\nThere was all there is also it's what I Love about baseball\nWhich that that that drama that theater\nOctober I Love I Love the sport when it when it's like this to him in\nAnd not to be greedy but that's why the playoffs should be two months [noise] your great work but that's what hurts destroy [laughter] because there's too many meaningless games where nobody cares about the result like it's just All right yeah\nIt is but it's not a name back in time for you to pitch it it's not an exact science for you to put to good teams against one another I mean if if you could have all the playoffs while I mean but even then I mean there are times there were some teams are just so far and away the doctors the Dodgers took apart the Braves it was nothing\nThat wasn't a series\nYou know what I mean that's my thing but no my my point is not that you know you ... it's called the warriors right so you're not going to have a the climactic playoff series in gains\nBut the more playoff games you had the more chances you have the playoffs the more chance you have for game last night that was the one that on a football ...\nPortugal Jeff where again like last night that was the one that on a football weekend people will talk about right like people talk about what you were worried they last night\nRight you know like ... ... what was going on I ... I I Want to talk to people just do on a high from way like they were at the game a ... [laughter] we have probably a rabbit that game but if you're at that game how incredible\n... have you read that game how you would you you couldn't possibly leave until you know the outcome you you could not be one of those what you did see or you weren't there 'cause they're how many sports moments that we had in the last decade where people leave early assuming something's gonna happen or whatever\nWe ... them are on a Lebanon am eastern on Fox Fox Sports [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAll you gotta do is become a new car member discover card will match all the cash that you

undressed get ... get a bath and still we still on so\n[laughter]\nYou're hundreds literally had all night long just a ever a game postseason game ever almost eight hours my goodness the so can believe it\nYeah it's it's it goes down in the annals as one of the\nUh one of the timeline of your life game especially if you're a Dodger fan right oh yeah well he draws you know we we have games I'd be big from Philadelphia and a a grown up with some of these sports fan\nYou I can tell you you know they shouldn't in places in the whole time to time one of your life with certain games that you will always remember that are like indelible and you're a Dodger fan particularly last night that's one of those that is automatically\n... after you know there's ... right next to it\nNo doubt it's a it's a it's an amazing amazing amazing like so because of that I Want to introduce our crew right because I noticed a Dodger fans there we have a new producer that\nWe'd like to welcome [noise] that's right [noise] I Do that we need to break in lake [noise] smash them on the\nAnd uh of course the the groove graduated and now he's working prime time Fox Sports radio and uh and then of\nCourse a triple em is off to uh the Big Ten and now we like to welcome from the blue field of Idaho Ryan Dennis\nAround we bought hey there you go I like it averaged links making it sound like I got to get jumped in to get in the end of this crew here\nWhat you do oh okay wait for it [laughter] [laughter] oh\nYeah I was just telling a in the break it it's it's been a been a while last time I I think I was here the or the birds won the super bowl but it's it's\nFor you to you and I bonded over the eagles so uh and I walk you're already fell right now though you know the normal\nPet star before we know prick your finger for a little blood and burned the sink and your mom the uh usually that's the need to pass pass but to me you know you're good to go you're going to\nPass I might give it a pass no no no [laughter]\nI got to work for it okay a couple of guys come on come on what you mean like [laughter]\nHow you doing there are you ready to go\nOh absolutely guys that are like you said it's prime time ... you know prime time in the middle of the night out here but hey it's a big Dodger went out here and you know we're finally seeing everybody get home from the freeways right now\nYeah that's a that was my question loser like there's no way or the Dodgers\nWhen you're very teetering you're about to go down three of the series is all but law and then you have the errands throw hygiene\nAnd then you winning dramatic fashion with Muncie not always be a ... or ... theories now still alive to one but you got momentum going made to pay a night game with the quick turn around what's it like from a Dodger fan\nIt's wall and yeah it's fantastic at this point and\nFrom the Dodger fan it's wall and yeah it's fantastic at this point and you know obviously with Eighteen Indians is basically to full games and they're starting pitcher evolve the he was supposed or you know he was supposed to make the starting tomorrow and now he's you know\nWho knows at this point same same kind of thing for the Dodgers so we'll see and you're right we're going to have some momentum who knows maybe we can even\nYeah I I I gotta I gotta bring him a are made the fig because you know he's a major dodger's fan I Know he's a huge Dodgers and ... what was it like for you\n[noise] very stressful extremely stressful for any Dodger fan especially those who were in attendance at that game\nA standing on pins and needles there's so many different you know highs and lows from Cody bell or to getting picked off of a base when they had a chance to do a rally and he killed that to the very next part of the ... where he saved a run gutting out the of the runner at the at least as chancellor at home or at home plate so there are so many highs and lows that go into a game like\nThis are you 'cause you're cleaning that lead Jackie Bradley use how bad the I bet the postseason he's had\nUnreal and I felt like this happens for almost any championship team there's always somebody that you don't expect\nThat comes through and plays huge for you I Know for the Dodgers last season this happened uh with them with the Austin Barnes who lost his starting ... catching job this year a back to the U.S money ground all the way the resurgence and bars because right now has been struggling\nKinda Russell did back a little bit but Barnes is one of their best postseason hitters last year I've not doing much of the regular season and you guys have you've covered this sport long enough\nOther athletes I just know for every World Series champion there's always somebody at the bottom of the order or somebody that you don't expect that has an amazing series in so far or just an amazing postseason run as a whole and that's Jackie Bradley for Boston right now\nYeah you could go back to resist the series and pick it out one of the guys came down to Cody Ross no doubt I remember\nHim oh yeah ... yeah wind your rebate for the giants to a man who didn't have the greatest\nRecognize you wrote in childhood for those kinds of guys who step off because you go there were always another dog giants yeah more than ... right right\nNo it's true\nI I mean the ... just that whole vibe\nYou know you demeaning you she ... she came back would you do it\nYou must have been a while like ooh now\nYou're going down the by the ... you're ... you're about to go down three oh series is over\nAnd that's what made it such so much more of a high stress game for the red Sox it's almost you can't afford to ... get away from you the only thing that what made it more just waiting for the red Sox is that it went this long and you had a chance and you didn't and you had to burn through all of your pitching and you have to burn through your game for starter\nOh pitch basically an entire game you pretty sick standing six and two thirds I Believe is what he pitched a before the walk off home run so that's what made it a little bit tougher from their standpoint but from the Dodgers you literally at everything on the line tonight there was no margin for error for you whereas Boston it wasn't as big of a deal\nYeah yeah All right let's we live uh for a moment ... ... ah right here I think it was\nAll they are free to [noise]\n[noise] well hey at all\n\nWent and praying\nThat have had\nThe great Charlotte Steiner on a and find them daily sports though yeah man I Love Charlie Spanish he's also now\nWhat what what a great call how bad and like I mean it was always rifle\nI mean does it does I mean look at it kept off a long marathon but again it's it's as as you mentioned it's kind of what you expect with baseball you know 'cause\nHe's a unique is all of baseball that's the beauty of baseball is that you can have in like what you're going to have a game like that some ethics game that never ends\nThat's I mean and there's there's a ton of standout performances across the board and this and this eight hour and you know in the a fiasco or you know talk about ... performance as a rookie on the biggest stage and I was ... and I have to be one of the doubt\nAnd if he if he did that brief moment that figured that brief moment or in the ... division series and we looked a little shaky and then he's been just money ever since\nNo doubt absolutely Oh absolutely yeah real yeah so and for the Dodgers this is just more of the same where they're getting a contributions from from everybody and different spots there is a different hero every night it seems like you know ... was the MVP\nOf the NFL CS he only had a couple of hits in that series but there are ... the bigger hits the biggest hits of that series so\nLife is that the team has been all year long they've had their struggles nothing has been easy for them but they keep finding a way to get victories um so it's encouraging for them look the only needs to get one you want to find a way to get a game there was always this when one game by the time as cliche as it sounds they found themselves in a position to get a win tonight\nAnd they were able to tax the Boston Red Sox pitching staff which only worse than the Dodgers favorite because they did not have to go and use rich Hill who is scheduled to be their starter for game for although oddly enough\nThis we introduced wind to you or do producer of course we did talk to ... but because remembering the trend thing I mean get a chance to introduce them fabulous and I'm an engineer and I was saying yeah there it is right now those two producer\nJim hello good morning but please don't take that as a front oh no it's All right it it only took link mentioning my name for you to remember that I exist so it's okay if I [laughter]\nI Want to push your now actually [laughter]\nActually you're right\nVery but ... ... women were wearing a goes we referenced Jew for the store and I was like damn I didn't I mean Hussein\nMy job is to stay quiet and push buttons McGough thank God at all you like to ... shut all planned I push buttons dribble exile right um no it's interesting with that Dodger crowd and you and it's fun to kind of borrowed a term from Gulf and say that\nBack nine you know if the of the game the ... of those innings there and and just the the fans just it was almost empty by I mean not not empty but it was very a lot of fans had left just because\nI don't know for whatever reason they're exhausted at the end of the lives that well there via [laughter] if you're paying like five dollars to the end there if you're paying five hundred dollars or a thousand dollars for a ticket to the world series I mean hey you're getting your money's worth right you're getting two games in one\nA guy you know you know people get really chilly when it reaches sixty degrees out here so maybe the people needed a sweater and couldn't take it anymore so they had to hit the hit the road so oh my God the lottery so many so many athletes were empty by the end of that game and it was sort of like\nA man he missed the one hell of an ending there so\nYeah as you might as well we've been small problem Dodger fan is they'll roll on\nBig big like jobs and leave early Miami Heat fans remember was it like they they come back in a playoff game or something and they some of them have left for the yeah I don't understand that some ... right yeah I looked at those people\nWho were playoff game you're you're at the world series I Believe it would be the world's well once again\nBut it is it is though a an eight hour a fair I mean that uh I don't care ethics at Santa Cruz game you know I ... I I have to\nGo on but here's the thing would you leave a movie before the movie's over\nI'm\nMad as some of the whole movie seven and a half hours yes [laughter] even the godfather originally had an intermission cubs come on that's gotta be a little I was wrong with that we're wondering I chose to show if the umpires were even allowed to use the bathroom or like they're holding it or not you know\nThat's a that's rough you're you know you're going to get your ... dug out the the you know I Hope one at a ... tough quick relief why\nWe got we got to get to some football coming up next in our weekly raider report is coming up from Lincoln ... hold you do is everybody\nRemember a lot about that I really fell is\nWhat you got to the ad regard I got to get out with you on Fox Sports radio\nNews breaks won't catch\nUs by surprise um um um that color your Fox Sports radio is a completely different place for this is something that you have a passion for entertainment well we're going to do is give you something a little different we are Fox Sports radio\nAnd I think that's it\nIf you suffer from E.

this\nYou know really I mean this is happening I kinda understand\nIt because Kobe fans feel like liberal on\nBasically moved Coby out of the conversation when it came to the greatest of all the time that it was Jordan was made Kobe fans believe the Coby was right after Jordan because six raised in five rings\nAnd all of a sudden now is just Jordan and live Ron okay and Coby is not going that in the conversation okay\nUm you know the Terminator series and the movies\n[noise] yeah yeah you know on one of them like Arnold Schwarzenegger sweaters and becomes like the good guy so even if he is one of your competitors your adversaries if he is the greatest that what he does and he shows up to help\n...\nJust let him\nThe Lakers are the most interesting they've been in six years it's not close\nThey're going to end the year with the best record they've had in about five or six years it's not close and what are we talking about here the stories the other night when the Lakers by the way got a really nice way and against Denver down to if they're good players because they all got into a fist fight with the rockets the week before there was a story we get\n[noise] who the Lakers beat now gets Coby was attendance nobody was there\nHe watched him he watched la Braun play in a lake or uniform and then after the game\nYou went over and he said something to look at the facial expressions on Kobe them abroad as the two of them are inside the house the Kobe build\nBut what prompts wearing the jerseys Kobe used to wear look at them look at the way they're looking at each other just Kobe like him Kobe ... actually acting like he like somebody actually hate to hate them does he like him or does he like in ... this is the most annoying I mean high school was mature compared to what we're doing right now\nIn the world of Laker fans I never heard\nPhiladelphia called doctor Jay to ask him if it was okay to bend sending got drafted I never heard Boston Cole Larry Bird I'm Sorry Larry said OK and Jason Tatum is good because I Do ride\nHow we we signed Gordon Hayward is that okay with you 'cause he's white and you can also and that's kind of like you is that okay what do you remember serious Bucky what\nOn God's green earth are we doing right now\nI mean we just always trying to pay homage to the great well what I was a statue [laughter] there's a ... and the raptors you always got about out\nOf a bronze statue in about three or four cities by the time those old things over\nBut he doesn't yet right now he's on uh Kobe's team Kobe's team they're healthy Coby built staples statue to jerseys and the rafters ... hey you got out he has to really ... yes history\nWe didn't even see this in the NFL with Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck we didn't even see this and pain was still on the team they caught him they caught\n[laughter] one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time they caught him\nAnd drafted a new guy and I didn't hear one cold than be like a excuse me a Andrew\nUh I just would like you to know what city you're walking into what Jersey and what position you're walking into you better respect theirs because if you don't I Hope you know you're not one of us yet\nYou are not one of us yet because this is the house the pay ... did you ever hear anybody saying that in Indianapolis\n[noise] ah yeah I mean kind of they talked about this bin ... they got a huge statue out front of the outlook of soil stadium a everyone can associate the Indianapolis Colts with pay manic so yeah I mean he kept the large that over there\nYeah he did but nobody ever like did not have their arms open to welcome Andrew Luck nobody ever but you know let's go back to the line of questioning that we saw pre season\nUm when a when\nThe reporters like hey ah so how are you going to kind of a you know indoctrinate yourself to Laker fan the bronze like\n[laughter] me [laughter] he's like who who me\nIs that really aware that that's LeBron James and I know what Laker fans are saying you got to win a ring or else it's a failure great great it's been five games he can't win a ring yet\nYou got to calm down Kobe Bryant has tried he's tried to get everybody to calm down it's like come on his side I'm On his team I'm Glad to hear whether he's being genuine are not quite frankly who cares\nWho cares this is the greatest player in basketball today he is definitely in the conversation for greatest player ever if you don't believe that go take a look at the Cavaliers box scores this year and tell me I'm wrong\nHe ... and the fact that he's not being welcomed with open arms by all and more importantly the fact that Laker fans in more addicted to a false soap opera\nThan the actual games that are being played which by the way are entertaining for the first time in five years is beyond me and quite frankly I work at a Laker fan in the eyes just tell them this is not speak worldview it just doesn't your team is good\nTo be a fair and be a fan of the team nobody nobody else to turn in their Colby card to root for all abroad and the Lakers and twenty Eighteen\nYeah but when we became this debate coach where everyone wanted a debate about who's better than home going back and forth having arguments people building cases where they got\nThey made it harder for fans to be able to say I'm a Kobe fan but I'm Down to brown because Brian is here because even though they weren't pitted against each other they didn't match up against each other and the finals there's still some of that rivalry between does fan base is because it's Kobe next in line behind Jordan\nIn does fan base is because\nIt's Kobe next in line behind Jordan and he'll be on the line\nBut that's not being a Laker fan in but there's something a Laker fan I mean I couldn't I couldn't I make the argument Bucky uh everybody ribs Kevin ran for going to the warriors the year before I actually just months before he had been beaten by the warriors in a series where he was up three to one\nMhm so couldn't we say that Steph Curry and ... Thompson and dream on green and the two teams were being compared with one another\nWho's better was rather staff would you rather have Katie Katie didn't blink is like okay now I'm going to switch teams there's not one warrior fan on God's green earth was like whoa oh see I have to break their Katie All right we've got to step in play and\nProgressive as new home quote explore was built to save you time and money by allowing you to compare multiple quote options all on line to head to progressive dot com today and see if you can say\nHardwood bucking bronco mark wheeler box sports radio boss he rose or you wrote some interesting things on a on the raiders situation will get to that coming up in a little bit\nAnd I thought we can start talking about the raiders right now with French while the NFL writer Yahoo Sports who joins us now live Frank really appreciate you coming on\nWhat what is the view right now of what the raiders are doing I sort of understand\nOr rebuild in the post ... trade I don't really understand I still to this day don't understand the ... power NFL people assessing what John Bruning company or doing\nYou know I think that you almost have to separate the Mac trade and just say it was a mistake I I guess maybe the raiders don't feel that way because they did it but ... if you'd separate out everything else they've done I mean\nWe can criticize some of it for sure but\nThey apply for a strong picks the next two years there they're going to be able to rebuild this thing I you know getting a first check for the first round pick our mark Cooper I thought was excellent I I don't think I'm already Cooper who's had four games of was Seventeen are those fears or the first round pick but we'll see what the hell is and I I just think that\nThere is a pass for the raiders to rebuild and get better I I don't ... it probably comes around and\nGetting something out of the Carr Fire replacement for polio Mac which was difficult but the match right just loomed over everything because they just don't give up a generally racial player like that which which they did that I think that set them back pretty big\nYou know speaking to the you talked about the raiders seven five first round picks um is it up to ... when you go back and looked at John grew to history or when it comes to fix it hasn't been great how confident are you that he is a guy that can do review especially if we're thinking just rebuild is going to occur through the ...\nYeah and that's ... that's a ... you can have five ... need to have the right guy to ... I don't know I I mean the raiders you know Richard McKenzie a great either if you look for the call Joseph Gehring calmly these guys are they're not getting much out of them and that that's not good it's not good at all for them\nAnd I just wonder I you know it it's hard to miss on all five too though [laughter] take enough you thinking of throws at the airport you're going to hit on a couple at least so you know it's I I think that I think we had an advocate main thing I feel about current in any way\nIs it's fun to pile on him it's fun to make the jokes everybody's doing it\nI think we need to get a little bit of time I get a Mac trade again that's almost separate it's almost a separate economy at this point than everything else they everybody realizes that was a mistake\nBut I think other than that rescue crews and a shot at least dig it was all part of this whole idea of what seven games into a ten year contract I Would see what he can do nothing\nI mean nobody's impressed me so far nothing short and perhaps many people so far out on some other graphics that OK already you know somebody like that and her ... and so\nThere's been some progress I think we need to give him a little bit of patients so security can do\nBryce Rob with Yahoo on the NFL joining us on Fox Sports radio a Frank these huge and Texans on Thursday night want a bunch of people some uh you know their fantasy games and and they won five in a row and so now everybody seems to be really hot on on Houston\nBut what what is the read on the progression of just watch them back from injury and how might they be affected by war will fall or not being out to the year\nIt's huge I don't know that they really have anybody to replace well for here is just a difference maker you might not put up the stats Andre Hopkins in other super gather happens us but he he takes the top off of defense you need a guy like that the structure feel especially on Watson who is so good on the people I\nIt's funny what are we talking about the the Columbine oh you know the the velocity on his throes of from the radar gun is not going to the arm strength and here he is he's in maybe the best people throw in the NFL earliest it up there so not having a folder and you're off and it doesn't affect them a lot but\nI don't know what to make it attracts them at this point I really don't drop\nIn lines terrible that that that has to be mentioned up\nFront that's not a good thing or the defense of good and now Watson looks like this\nAnd I turned up front that's not a good thing or the defense of good and not watch and looks like he's finally comfortable he finally looks like he's beyond the what you know whatever issues they had coming back from the ACL the other one for in a row great for them but I you know\nThey beat Indianapolis I'm Frank right wing for when they shouldn't they did the cowboys were chasing Garrett didn't go for it when he should have this team back I don't know I'm I'm I'm just curious the taxes are came to ... me but if the ... and we saw on Thursday it that's where we're getting in and they're going to win this division and be a contender [noise]\nYou know we can't do quarterbacks without talking about pets more homes or what do you think about pets and homes and what he's been able to do with the Kansas City chiefs who just want\nYou know I don't know about you guys but I Can't come up with and maybe it's Marino all the way back to Dan Marino I'm Guy who is married\nKind of a command of the position with a physical skills in his early in his career\nThis young of an age usually you know I started to really mastered a position when their\nPhysical still skills start to drop a little badly I guess at Rogers it you know he was still well within his crime when he started to get it but I see my homes and I thought it was it a pre season I'm sure you guys did too especially the ... the person was high opener for me where I saw\nWhile this guy isn't just a big arm you know he's going to throw the ball through the wall he ... he understands this progression he understands where to go with the ball he understands what Andy Reid wants them to do in this off and\nI said wow this is pretty impressive from a young guy let's say that that carries over regular season ain't got even better I think I'm going away by this guy and I realize there are some blowback of oh why we crony I'm so early well the reason is that there's no reason to believe this is the flu key is\nThe here could only young quarterback as I remember at that stage jak 'cause he's just married the immense critical guess with the mental commander the position it's really a precedent hey let's also let's get around to read some credit to I mean he lost it all sounds a coordinator obviously not nature that\nChicago Bears I think we have to get Andy On which a bit of credit for pattern of homes development and if I was speaking culturally here right now I began to read simply because he deserves a lot of credit for what ... homes with done so far\nRice Rahman Yahoo is with us on Fox Sports radio Frank all the talk of a team going to London every time we hear it it yeah you know getting closer and closer are we really getting closer who's going how are they pulling this off at the top putting it all\nI don't I hate that I have since\nDay one you're going to have such a difficult time feeling a competitive team in London and\nWhy it's just greed to me it's just kind of fell agreed to it it's great for them to have any ... any regular season games in London to maybe I'm just a nerd when it comes to the schedule and wanting everything to be you know everybody's got equal equal shares and all that but\nYou're getting some team seven home game so how does have eight and that's not fair that's not cool I don't just what age expand your brand in England a little bit so instead of Thirteen million and you make Thirteen point one billion I I I just don't get it I\nI never understood the London fascination I Know they have fans there I Know that they like and I felt football there but not sending a Premier League team to oh why why are we sending NFL\nTeam to that [laughter] I don't get\nParents I don't I don't understand the fascination I really truly don't I don't think it makes a leak that or wherever team you send over there you're going to have to make such concessions to make them competitive for\nSolar free agents I what are you going to give them a higher salary cap and everybody else but I mean I just [laughter] I just can't imagine if you have the choice of playing in\nChicago or Houston or London\nUnless you're really adventurous ... why pick London unless you have some ties there I I just don't get this ain't revel why this makes sense and I don't think it\nBrings the NFL from Ghana Thirteen billion dollar industry to twenty and she's just [noise] it is very marginal and I don't get why does the un it oh it but it's I think it's going to happen some day just 'cause the NFL she inspects\nNight and yeah So Frank out real quick you tell me a decade from now the jaguars play where and the chargers play where\nThey're crazy question I have no idea where the chargers play but it's not LA I really don't believe so and I do it the jaguars or weapons team I just think that they're setting us up and they ... playing these tracks for a long time [noise]\nFrank great great to have you thank you that's what it calls I appreciate\nIt OK race Rob NFL on Yahoo joining us Fox Sports radio I don't know where it's going to be
