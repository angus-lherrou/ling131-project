half time now [noise]\nRams are freebie back into this game as they are now trailing the Green Bay Packers tend to have [noise] you'll get the stats and the first half years Iran started slow but they're picking up some momentum and actually eat from this has been sort of the rams Hamel all season long they've had a number\nAgain so they'd gotten up to a little bit of a slow start they sort of feel out their opponent and then they all ... in Wyoming oh wham o is\nRight or by well earlier today we had a remarkable game\nTruly remarkable game as it looked like it was going to be blowout city the Bengals are blowing out the Tampa Bay buccaneers until Tampa benched James Winston and brought fits magic into the game during his right now they're all moose Johnson he was ever Chris Myers and Laura I'm getting a\n... and ... and ... this was an amazing game I guess everyone after the team even those Cincinnati ultimately won this game\nEveryone's talking about the situation with the buccaneers where does Tampa go next now that fitzpatrick did what he did today\n[noise] ah I really think you have to stay with Ryan um you know James continues to talk about the importance of not throwing the football over a buddy continues to do it and then there was one statement last week that that I found a particularly interesting um during her prep was even with the\nThe two interceptions in the ... and and being minus three he he felt he made the plays necessary to get a when\nI'm you know he made the Big Roads the Sean Jackson or after taking a stack 'em that was ill advised a and there was actually sack again\nOr they were able to complete a big play to give Chandler cotton zero the opportunity for the fifty nine your field goal and and he walked away from that in my opinion\nNot feeling as though he had dodged the bullet but that he was integral a in and winning that game and and he was made to throw but he also put his seeming a tough position so again today a you know I think\nWhat we saw today was all for those interceptions are probably on gene this last week or more to the interceptions was because one of his receivers that on the wall routed brought a defender\nOr that he did not anticipate to be there but I I think today there was a couple of overthrows\nUm he just he did not quite well from the quarterback position he did not see the field well um so I I really think the Tampa Bay has no option right now but but to go with Ryan ...\nMost you know this as a player or coaches hate when you continue to make the same state right or if you're a young player you're young quarterback or any position a you make mistakes okay but in your fourth season as a quarterback\nYou cannot the narrative can't be the same we can still be\nTurning the ball over especially in the red zone but you you can't it can't happen no matter how much talent you have no matter how much on strings or whatever that is if you continually turning the ball over especially in the red zone in scoring position they can't you can't work with it\nNo no and and and that's the biggest thing because this is you know they're doing great offensively they're throwing up all kinds of yards and doing different things\nUm you know for my explosive standpoint but as you pointed out you know when you start to lose points and then let's let's just say today that it was it was definitely the first few local uh uh the first interception costs and if you go what's happened the second one probably cost them some points there and then obviously the pitch six so\nUm yeah you're you're just you're mistakes are are are very critical so um it's this is the sixteenth game he's had a multi interception game I I think I saw a graphic on our telecast they once he got the four I think it was the third time and his group that he's had four interceptions\nCrazy so you know that that's just that's irresponsible and as you pointed out making the same mistake and not learning from your errors in the in the in the past\nThere always Johnson is joining us right now is a nice bounce back when for the bangles even if it got a little shaky at the end show mix in a is an emerging star all the controversy involving these young man coming into the NFL\nToday is first hundred yard day of the season ... what are you seeing Joe mixing how good can he be\n[noise] how he can be very good uh I think I think he gives the complimentary element to Cincinnati is all fence um you know I marked off the defensive coordinator for the box was was concerned about John makes another one game um and and he proved why this afternoon so it was one of the points that that more of an\nReally emphasize with us or friday when we sat down and talk to the Bengals players and coaches are ... and he wanted he wanted anti ... and in some of the run past option opportunities or if it's a fifty fifty it's not a it's just a real\nYou know heavy past situation let's let's let's go with the ... let's let's try to get a physical element back into our our pets and and they kind of went that way today I think you saw\nOn a on the opening drives or Cincinnati that uh they were they were really starting to see Joe mixing the ball so um you know I I think he earns an opportunity to to become a bigger part of it I thought he ran well I'm ... there were several times when there wasn't a lot there are any and he was getting yards\nAre on his own so yeah I I think that that it's something today that they really need to take a long hard look at it become a little bit more balanced moving forward\nAnd we talk about aging green and we are I'm In the office of weapons to Cincinnati has the surprise for me and I've been for a lot of people it's not so much AJ green we know what he brings me to say what the emergence of Tyler Boyd\nAre really being a a one a receiver for Cincinnati just talk about the importance of him or to a recipe for these big play for ... to target\nYeah without a doubt um you know you kind of disappeared and that Kansas City game last week and\nUm but he's had a couple of big games or and so far this year I had another one this afternoon or you have to have that complimentary guy when when when the fences all of a sudden they have their plan to take away AJ green and the players to it you've got to have somebody else it's there to be able to take advantage of that and\nYou know ... was that guy in the middle of the fuel from the tide in position and now it's titled Boyd\nOr you know I I think that Alex Erickson as the guy that or is she is in progress as before and we used to use them or is that slot type receiver and and some of the jet sweeps and different things that they used with his skill set so as Cincinnati transitions out of that three tied in personnel grouping that\nThere was so successful form in the beginning of the year because they've had so many injury is hiding spot you're going to see this pretty wide receiver group start to become more comfortable and start to become a big part of what they're doing all kinds of\n... so the Bengals are five and three moves right now halfway through the season they had a plus for internal margins today but they gave up five hundred and Seventy six told a yard so the bucks so I guess Bengal fans want to know should they be taken seriously as a contender or are they still pretender\nUm the the [noise] you know the the big thing for me is um you know you look at what they're doing right now and there seems to be um an adjustment going on with\nAnd there seems to be um an adjustment going on with her last coming in and trying to wanting to put his spin on what they're doing a defensively um you know this is very similar to what Minnesota does it it's kind of that Mike Zimmer style the fence that they've\nThey've still really kind of leaned on\nA ... like the kind of tweak it a little bit I think that they were waiting for the by week he's been trying to add bits and pieces\nUm so I think we need to see what happens after the ... uh they've got good players in place or their linebacker position has been hit hard by injury or but they've got a good front they've got a good rotation or I think there are secondary\nUm is more than capable that they should not be a team that allows people to get behind them a critical points in the game it's a seat the shock jocks without a double moved to see my evidence or at that stage of the game be able to get five yards beyond your safety\nHarvard and he's from so long\nI wasn't expecting to talk to this man for another week especially after\nWhat happened yesterday Florida Gators had a big battle against Georgia down there in Jacksonville it did not end well joining us once again from serious XM NFL radio the one and only\nAlex Marvin as Alex your hopes are high for your gators yesterday but Georgia proved to be a a little too strong\nYes you would be correct about that strong like all the drinks but I also resent\nThat they call it the world's largest outdoor cocktail party I Will tell you that it really is an unbelievable incredibly passionate feeding a you know in Jacksonville every year for Florida Georgia in Georgia the better team and\nI think with a knife or for Ford is you have a little bit of a litmus test to you know with George or being superior opponent we now know where we're at it seems like the SEC east as a pipe dream for the skaters team but you know you just chalk it up hope you rebound next week against Missouri go at it again but Georgia was the better team do question\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what's going on today are a lot of things and the biggest story is what happened in Tampa where James went and got bench after throwing for interceptions and look back Ryan Fitzpatrick Internet a remarkable comeback the Bengals did ultimately prevail\nQuestion moving forward is what is Tampa Bay going to do at the quarterback position your production Alex\nMy production is Ryan Fitzpatrick now the question is who is making\nThis decision I Would assume it's going to be dark cutter who is making this decision but you know when you when you think about Jason light the general manager you know he is tethered his uh\nHis boat to the gym is Winston doc so to speak right I mean he's the one that picked him at twenty Fifteen with a number one overall pick he's continued to stand by James Winston er during all of his off field difficulties have resulted in the three game suspension earlier this year but how telling you is it\nThe Tampa Bay players when voting for their team captain did not vote\nSeamus Winston a captain I mean this is your quarterback right and and his teammates did not vote him a captain they didn't know drove in Korea captain either by the way to pick me tell you a little something there as well about the two highest paid players in the franchise I think outside of my cap and so\nI think it's Ryan pits Patrick you know and at some point you have to ask yourself to if something were to happen to James Winston let's say a torn ACL I hate to think like this but I'm just saying if he were to get injured playing quarterback for you right now and you're not committed to him\nBeyond the season you are running that are that risk much like what Jason for red in the LA Chargers that you're going to have damaged goods on a player and you're going to be forced to pick up the fifth year option in their contract that would be about twenty million dollars in salary for James Winston\nI'm just really not sure where James says when I was just a terrible game for interceptions wasn't like they were tipped passes or things that you know we're ... these are just bad decisions and it just seems like the deep passing game is better life it's Patrick is under center\nHe's done he can't you can't hit your wagging to the gym is Winston anymore in my opinion a given his inability to not turn the ball over in a row down the the things that he's been working for the past three and a half years he still doing those things\nAnd on top of that is also the bill ... ended in maturity you cannot pick is if you're out you know and we were discussing so what do they do about a quarter back in the future the matter what they decided to do it can't be with him and my right in that situation\nI Believe you are and but the question that is what are we doing here is the head coaches a general manager where we act with this box franchise right now\nI mean drink some light is done some good things look at the office of talent that he's assemble through both free agency or you know and also the draft I mean there were some really talented players on the squad that's why they traded to Sean Jackson it would hurt the fence and obviously the rumors flying about that but of course God when I was a guy it'd be starting on those teams you know as one of the top two receivers and instead he's the number three\nIn Tampa so you know and he might be ready to move up and start making some big plays himself but I think that's the thing that gets tricky plus the bugs are too good in this regard you figure their team that's going to win six seven games this season maybe\nFive hundred but probably around that level that's not going to put you in great position and the draft unnecessarily get someone so you might have to give up ... to try to move up I'm not sure what the free agent answer is we have some guys like make fools who's going to be out there but does that really the long term I mean the falls is what Ryan Fitzpatrick without a beard I mean\nThe long term I mean the polls is what Ryan Fitzpatrick without a beard I mean so right yeah ... you know what I mean so it's just it's a curious time right now for this book's organization but I'm with you James Swanson has done nothing to show that that you want to pick up that fifth eruption pay him that amount of money\nUnless he's to turn around a season we he's got a lot but then the question is is if he's not starting next week Wednesday starting again in Tampa\nAlex ... Jay Z what obviously guinea a lot of acknowledgement is comeback player of the year and and rightfully so he might be defensive player of the year again but let's talk about the comeback Adrian Peterson a while I mean I'm thirty three year old running\nBack when they when he's dominant it's been very simple I mean look at the numbers I mean every game the day when he get Ninety plus he had a hundred and four hundred and forty nine yards rushing today\nA John Regan's revisited hum but try to put in perspective Adrian Peterson come back and what it means for this red skins team\nYou know it's funny you mentioned ... because I Believe it's ... and John Henry Johnson only running backs in NFL history over the age of thirty three that have rush for as many yards in one game as Adrian Peterson just it ... for Washington today against that hapless New York giants defense you know maybe if they had snacks Harris oh wait they traded\n[laughter] to point\nOut and how about that you trade your best run stuff guy and all of a sudden you get gassed by this Redskins team but you're right about Adrian listen to them I was you know I raised my hand as someone that had really counted amount of took the NFL I mean think about it right in Adrian Peterson wouldn't be on this team if various guys hadn't gotten injured\nDuring the pre season he was supposed to be the bell curve running back Adrian might be somewhere else but\nWhich you've got an Jake route and two things your number one he's trusting in Adrian Peterson running the ball\nJ. when you look at the analytics he's one of these guys that cause more first down runs just about anybody in the NFL so he's allowing Adrian Peterson to try to grind it out on those down so he's getting opportunities because that's the type of back Adrian as he's not a ten carried type of guy to be truly effective you know he's got to be a little bit more than that so\nYou look at that and also using them as a pass receiver and now these are complicated routes that he's asking Adrian to run and he's not putting them out wide or anything like that but what he's doing is he's available on the screen game is a check down for Alex Smith and then boom\nGood things are starting to happen one other thing we should mention about the Redskins as well they're run defense has gotten so much better I mean and you know you look at the Alabama connection that you know drawn paying Jonathan Allen those guys have stepped up I just think that this Redskins defense much improved as well it's giving them all to try to win this division although again is hoping Philadelphia at the end of the day is going to take it\nA year and just talking about Adrian Peterson I never counted him out because I realized you had a couple years where he was an active uh due to offer to build things and then rehabbing from injury\nSo he doesn't have the normal wear and tear you would have on a running back at thirty three and I know thirty three and ... is running back in any capacity now it's like oh taboo\nBut the fact that he still has something to prove not only to themselves but to the league\nAnd you know you put them on a team that loses their number one guy and you bring him in I mean he's playing with house money right now he doesn't have anything to lose a step you know helping these teams are Redskin team who led by another veteran in Alex Smith\nReally holding the locker room together and galvanizes team moving forward\nI'm so glad you mentioned that because I thought to Chris Thompson the Redskins running back about this and he was saying that\nAdrian lights up the room is it was just such a joy when he first got there because he's\nA funny guy he's a fun loving guy and listen everyone knows oh my gosh we're playing with Adrian Peterson right I mean you're you're talking when Adrian was in the league this was two thousand seven right so let's put this in perspective he was drafted in two thousand seven some of the youngest players on this Redskins team or run the eleven years old\nWhen they made it into the NFL and it's like you get to play with a living legend\nIn Adrian Peterson owned by the way physically he is back to where he he no he looked good I mean it was in the long run that he had today and they you know that he scored on\nI mean he was getting calls from behind that would have happened to the old Adrian Peterson but it was late in the game but man oh man I mean he just he works out so hard and he's so committed to that in fact he told me I talked about this\nBack in the pre season or that he had taken up rats\nOne not not wrestling like pro wrestling but ... you know like he was doing that type of work I think he also did some boxing or this off season just trying to mix it up on top of the herculean type lips that he does\nYou know all the time I mean the guy is it in a lot of ways it's like ... Walker in that regard ... just the physical free who's taken care of themselves physically to be able to reach the heights that he has\nAnd speaking of legends Adam ... Terry passing Martin Andersen today is the all time leading scorer in the history of the national football league or you're a member of the hall of fame too many I mean obviously is going to be a hall of famer but\nHave the we have we come to grass you know with the idea of the special is not just kick hers partners you know how you'd try to put a their careers in perspective with other football players how do you approach that\nBy the way I don't know if you realize this but ... actually kicked off to Herschel Walker\nNineteen now back in\nNineteen Ninety six and he made the tackle on the play is Herschel was running down the field so think about putting that in perspective there for Adam vegetarian listen I don't think there was a punter that's going to gain a lot of traction going going ahead I think right guys going to be that person for a long period of time no offense to shame Locklear I just don't see the momentum\nAt least right away for a ... I don't think it's a matter of him getting in the hall of fame I think it's a matter of the first ballot\nRe Mel Luna is the proper pronunciation now this blows me away or you went to ...\nYear there are people who have been missed ... pronouncing my name is head coach of calling me from our bureau hey nice to meet them ... hey I'm from I'm like okay\nThat was lifted a second but I Do go out there I saw Thirteen Years only how many people are still calling you from ... yeah all the time I I just ignored it just try to correct you don't have I have [laughter] I'm like ah\nWhatever well my attitude about a ... by law is it'd be washed away with a Heisman Trophy which I Would imagine he's going to consider he had talked about the record is twenty five touchdown\nPasses zero picks so far this year and get this he may become the first Heisman winner who never actually plays in the fourth quarter of a\nGame you know you had to take a ride angles ear and out in the fourth\nQuarter all season long\nHave you seen them plenty of these that good or it's just\nI thought he was a good when he came in in the national championship through that pat I I thought he was good I Would like all this kid had this might be the first Alabama quarterback biggest drafted did actually is an NFL quarterbacks I mean when you consider the best quarterback the Knicks savings had has been AJ McCarron\nYeah yeah ... by law is better she'll get used to it it just sort of like a by the way markers\nMario that not marry at a mall or a Yoda\nHad him on the show he said my name is ... ... it's mark is more Rio de\n...
