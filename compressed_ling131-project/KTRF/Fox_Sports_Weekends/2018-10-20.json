even there it wasn't again for the most part here's the thing there are there there are a number of people that I've talked to throughout the week that want to know what's going on I before for well I mean when you talk about the details ...\nThe fact is the raiders have three first year players on or off it's why you do it's gonna you're gonna have to if you're John Gurdon us off and you're going to have to get creative you're gonna have to move the ... you're going to do things differently because you cannot\nStand bacteria and expect protection to hold up they they ended up one match protection what your seven protection which means you're only basically had two to three guys out routes\nSeattle just played zone they bracket at the top receivers and they are they played everything else like everything else underneath you're not going to live on like that\nNow you know you know you can't ... and ... and that's a huge problem with them\nThe problem is is that they can't protect
