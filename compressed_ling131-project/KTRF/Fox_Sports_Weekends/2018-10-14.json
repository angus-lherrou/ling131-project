Bruton John group that is I'm Sorry to read the writers lose twenty seven to three Seahawks smack 'em up Seahawks\nThey lost the rams when they started to get some office of things going last week they carried over to this week Russell Wilson goes to twenty two three touchdowns did get picked off a they ran the ball the bunches well thirty seven times they rushed the boss seems to be the theme this week I Know it makes you excited it does as a former lime and you guys know forward\nThirty seven times for a buck fifty five or the sea hawks but I Want to get to the raiders and I and losing out for\nTheir car not looking spectacular no three years ago remember the second income and he was the second coming he was supposed to be the guy the raiders were supposed to be the sexy picked to get to the super bowl he gets injured and really just things have gone downhill ever since but\nThey bring in John group was supposed to you know being a ... game this franchise and bring them back to some success that they had when he was there and that's not the case\nOr looking at um at one in five I'm looking at their car only throwing for one forty two I mean we have some of these rookie quarterback to outside of the day zero touchdowns I mean nothing spectacular it wasn't like\nWell he had a bad game because we've ran about thirty something times no that wasn't the case in either Nineteen it centrally Seventy nine yards I don't know what they do well it's not defensive Lee and and and this is supposed to be something that he's going to help the team with that's not the case ... actually could help\n'em and it's not even offensively and it's not the quarterback play I don't know if their car needs to get back on the John ... quarterback bus\nBut something needs to give what's going on with John growing then he's writers\nOr number one the most glaring things defensively if they're not their inability to put pressure on the quarterback right today they have one sec but their last in the league and sex and John gluten jokingly a couple of weeks ago said her you know the you know the looting and to not having\n'em a little Mac anymore and and just trying to find the good pass rush you know he can laugh at often joke all they want the fact that they're in a position to where\nThey can't stop anyone they can't slow any one down and if you can't do that then how can you expect your secondary to hold up and we're seeing that game after game\nAnd all ... they just I met they don't have it man they're they're sort of their cars taken you know so he's looking more like David Carr\nYou know and I swear are are but I play with that you know trying to trade in the guard you know I I play with David\nAnd it is just not clicking for them and the fact that none of this is bothering John gluten because\nIf you look up the definition of job security in the dictionary then there's a picture of John gluten in his raiders head with a hundred million dollar check in his head\nHundred million dollars no matter what that's what I just say no matter what you guys fire me think about\nThis thing about this this is the first year of a ten year deal four hundred million if he goes three years and when three games they still can't\nFire which is crazy because you former player\nAnd all these guys were looking at right to you know right now I'm a screens and who play today and played Monday and Thursday they don't have you know guaranteed contracts except for the guaranteed money\nMhm yet a coach who is a good coach for sure I mean he's had a heck of a career he was a good it was a good coach right it has had a heck of a career or you know\nNot this season is guaranteed a hundred million dollars a guaranteed thirty million dollars if he's another culture guaranteed the ten million dollars if he's another coach\nWouldn't do players ever get mad at that did you just it's just part of the games ... I'm not you\nKnow worried about that the fact that I'm I'm well I'll be more worried about the fact that he didn't want ... like as a player if I'm In the locker room that's that those are the things that would bother me because I wouldn't know how much he\nMeant to our team and if you focused on the other things\nAnd not putting your best players on the on the field then that's a that's a concern for me as a as a player\nYou know put his money as his money it is what it is it doesn't count as a salary cap so it's not stopping him it's not stopping them from you know paying me or someone else they just decided they wanted to go in a different way other than a little Mac and he wasn't they deemed him not worth it\nWhich is it's crazy to me because we right away to pay dividends for the Chicago Bears although they lost a day\nYou know if he's revitalized that\nAbsolutely there that's a real team now you've got to go in there and you have to beat the bears you have to somebody you can say oh that should be an easy victory quickly I Do want to have some love to the sea hawks who do get the victory and I mentioned it Russell Wilson looking like he was a\nComing back last week you had success against the votes to be one of the best defenses in the rams and then boom you circle back to this week and all of a sudden again three touchdowns again for him and he and he's looking like the rest of the Wilson that we know so maybe the sea hawks are getting better and riding the ship as there are five hundred now it's six a three and three and the first six gay\nWell I'll tell you if you look at their their stable of running backs and Carson and penny in Davis a an even Russell Wilson himself\nThey now have the ability to really\nPush the temple and we saw that in London today against Oakland they came out and I believe there first Tony plays Fifteen of those were runs ... and they said hey look we're going to rotate running backs we got three good running backs were going to rotate them\nOr we're going to use them in the past in game and what that does is that allows you're off into line that has been a sore spot for them for the last couple of years it allows them to be aggressive\nWhen I started a game I always wanted to start with runs because I didn't want to be passive and backing up I Want it to be aggressive and we saw that from them today so if they adopt that mentality moving forward there'll be much better and it'll take the pressure off of that are much maligned often to month\nOr so congrats to see how they get a victory again three and three on the season for them another team and this is your guy your fantasy man and somebody I guess that bucket Brooks always gets frustrating when I talk about his thing is greatness and that has been robbed his burger\nIf that Bucky Brooks always gets frustrated when I talk about his thing is greatness and that has been rocked his burger who's had a pretty good season I mean in and out of success as far as the W's at first\nI Know him and Antonio Brown add some you know the people were\nI think maybe us the media were making it bigger than it really was um you know because we need things to talk about but the fact is the last couple of weeks been an a B have gotten the job done and they got the job done literally they won the game because of that connection as they got a touchdown I Know it went like this\n... cut you off guard out oh that was being\nRocks burger talking about the root causes the running back okay so I Want to get to that just a minute but real quick with a B a B is starting to get an explosive matter of forty a yard long reception the longest of the season was today\nAnd I'll see you tomorrow on\n\nThis program brought you buy progressive insurance last year over three million drivers switch\nTo progressive call one eight hundred progressive or visit progressive dot com today and find out if you could say [noise]\nDuty Westbrook thirty four yard touchdown reception\nFrom Blake Bordeaux trying to bring it back twenty four six sewing extra point is coming up here and that just a quick would give you by the way in this game that Prescott has fallen out a couple of touchdowns through the air one on the ground and then in the rams are up\nTwenty three on the Broncos Broncos on the ... trying to put some points on the board odds when he began to that game talk girlie a hundred and thirty three Russian yeah this is a rushing day\nFrom I Know you love and it for a couple of touchdowns for\nTiger early in Baltimore up Twenty one to nothing on the non talk all day the non talked about Tennessee Titans are Alice Collins has to rushing touchdowns or the ravens right now we're joined by Alex ... as we are each and every weekend Alex what's going on and how how was the wedding\nAt a wedding in San Francisco was absolutely fantastic of course the barriers other team the Oakland Raiders not so much my goodness as as a bat club in Utah called Miller just could absolutely destroyed today\nBy Frank Clark and with in Seattle it was a slow start for this team it didn't look at a time but they're starting to get something going in a positive way on the offensive side of the football in particular rushing the ball right now again I Know what's the raiders I Know they are horrendous team\nAt this moment but I tell you I mean watch out for Seattle make it a little bit of a push here at least as far as the wild card race goes not gonna say make or break a tray of challenging the rams that are headed for what about NFC West but the rams are but the Seahawks appear to finally be headed in the right direction once again\nWe are and what direction or the raiders headed in what what are some of the things that they need to work on to to ride this year because the thing is thinking back\nYou know ... and ... I don't know what you can do on the fence right now I really do I mean they're they're just they can generate any past Russia you know when you boil it then you expose that secondary that isn't very good and it just seems that when you talk about a makeover of a team in the off season you don't get it you know look there there are players look what's happening in Buffalo they got fifty three million dollars and and\nThat money on their salary cap right from players at the new regime got rid of in a second year but you look at this raiders team and you know look if you if they did a poor job this off season putting the types of people in place\nTo run the types of things that John crude and wants to run on both offense and defense it's pretty darn clear I don't know if there's any salvage ing where they're at right now the injuries of hit the team a little bit on the offensive side of the football you know losing both tomorrow Cooper today in F F ... concussions that was a rough go of it for them but\nIt's going nowhere fast I guess the good news is if you're a raiders fan well they pick high in this draft coming up we can finally get that passed the team in the right direction but defense to get\nIt may not be ... though that's for sure Alex ... on Twitter serious accident in FM radio where you hear him and of course you hear him all the time with us Alex I mean we we had a debate before the break\nUm the guys in the studio and the other side here was saying that hey you know maybe on bills probably going to come back and get all the carries and take all the rats and they'll say hey man James Garner's out a heck of a season so far especially for guys kind of came out of the blue\nAh what do you think that they're going to do is to come back this week\nI was thinking of what were the effectively I don't know I won't say split the carries for a bit and ... it's hard to keep them off the field but you know you feel good now after the spill is knowing we can take levy on bail out and maybe the third series of the game and that's a James Caan or series we can rotate these guys a little bit you know would lay the onto\nCan provide a little bit more of an the passing game but with the ... but the weird part about it for Pittsburgh is\nAnd it's a good problem to have but they have to be careful way beyond go returns\nTo not disrupt the flow of this often and and I say that because right now they're starting to hit on some things and they have found their their ... the guy that they had been missing since he Miller a tight and Vance McDonald he killed the Cincinnati Bengals today he was such a big reason as to why they won that contest he is really becoming a difference maker for them\nThat they haven't had an Jesse James ... is a is a good player not a great one we've answered Donald has served him as far as getting the targets in that often but the question is it brings back how are you going to distribute the football can you get back in that flow I get a good problem to have I think the Steelers can figure it out the only thing for the Steelers can way beyond that also played defensive back because it's\nProblem I have I think the Steelers can figure it out the only thing for the Steelers can way beyond bell also play defense back because they're still not a very good secondary\nYeah they're they're not a good secondary but bin ... burger the ability to spread the ball around um is is the one of the best in league at doing that he hid\nEleven different received very rules about eleven different receivers including himself\nToday you know just having that ability to to not only you know hand the ball off to a to a ... bill moving forward but his ability to get the ball to the dough right guy in the past in game how important is that\nOh I mean he's fantastic and and look he's got it from everybody right Antonio Brown I mean he was quiet throughout the game\nThen he comes on strong laid you gotta you know Judy Smith Schuster has been one of the great additions to the team as a second round pick I mentioned Vance McDonalds you know James Connor had his today and look we never talk about the stores are offensive line right\nThey just quietly go out there a week after week generally protect Ben Roethlisberger due to a job and pave the way for one hundred yard Russia I mean that and you know you get in for the Bengals today it's devastating you know it's the same old same old for you at your seven straight loss of the Pittsburgh Steelers they haven't beating them at home and since two thousand and Thirteen\nAnd the question is well here we go again is at Cincinnati that is going to get maybe maybe there are nine and seven ten and sixteen but when it comes to winning the division when it comes to getting past the Steelers they just can't get it done\nA lot more of as our guest Alice I Want to go to a game and the ... with the jets and the colds you got two quarterbacks one who are we talking about a little bit earlier and Andrew Luck where everybody knows each towns and everyone knows how good he is\nBut it just hasn't been the success with the costs that you would hope for and then on the other side you have this young rookie quarterback who was able to have a good game today he throws twenty four thirty two eighty couple a touchdown one pick 'em\nHow good as Sam Donaldson and just kind of give me your you know through six games\nYou're a while you feel about him and going forward and maybe a grade\nOn the jets in my mind I'm given the jets today because I thought they were the worst even football coming into the season\nI really didn't see much reason for optimism for them because I figure Sam Donald's going to take his lumps they're not the most talented team on the offensive side of the football and defensively they they have their issues but they've played a lot better than I thought the offensively Todd Bowles now having to take an active role in the defense let's not forget because\nCasey Rogers or defensive coordinators been battling a serious illness oh Todd really you know the reason he's the head coach in the league is largely because of its success as a defensive coordinator so we took some real positive work there but you know what's benefited Arnold is the fact that they've stayed relatively healthy at the wide receiver position Robbie Anderson is a truly great deep threat\nAnd what what he said a couple of weeks ago I thought was interesting as well and by the way I don't forget the emergence of I was there a koala running back with Sam Donald told the media look I got to stop hesitating I've got to pull the trigger I've got to make sure that that what I'm seeing on film and then when I see it in the game I have to trust my instinct\nAnd you can just tell that he's playing a lot more loosely right now he is and as you know hesitant to maybe throw the football as he was in the past and he's not making big mistake look the jets haven't played will beating teams by any means here in the culture just absolutely disastrous on defense\nGiving up thirty something close points again that being said though the stress team has been impressive for what they've done and maybe just maybe can stick around in the postseason race to about December\nWhat what's going on over here in in in Indianapolis with Andrew Luck I mean is it is it too much to ask to have him a throwing the ball this many times they just can't get anything going to the lack of weapons the lack of you know ingenuity and the play calling what can we do please stay home Angela\n... there's a this is the fortieth different starting off into line that he's played behind today NFL career forty ...\nOkay so I think they realized that maybe some of these guys are just better to just pass because they can't field a credible running game but but they they don't have a marquee guy and I packed field Marlon Mac you know I Believe he played today but he's been battling a hamstring injury all season and even with Marlon\nThese sort of a you know he's not at that ... type level I don't think anyone can expect that type of production prone to the cold every every game going to be a shootout or you're going to have to have Andrew Luck put a points and you know plus twenty four points to even give you a chance\nEvery week I don't put this on Andrew Luck I really I put it on a roster that you know Chris bottled inherited that he's still trying to make right I think the coaching is outstanding I think they're going to be good in time but they simply don't have enough pieces in place\nAt this point to be a credible contender in the AFC South and by the way the\nHouston Texans better be sending a nice group basket or you know over two or any sort of a gratitude over to the heat apples colds or by the way at the end of the year because of the colds just gone for not gone forward in overtime a couple of weeks ago played for the time you're looking at a Texans team that has cooled off considerably rather than one that has now won three straight games\nAnd it's pushing Indianapolis to oblivion in the division race\n... that's a great point right there but they get it it was an ugly victory as I think Jay Jay watch we did like basically it's ugly but hey we'll take the wind or they'll definitely do that Alex we appreciate it thank you man I I'm sure you're still in the enjoying some ah some wedding desserts and what not\nThis is sick and San Francisco such a great place when I got about six hours to kill before uh before my
