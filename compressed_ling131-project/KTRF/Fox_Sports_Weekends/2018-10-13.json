London right now the raiders getting ready to take on Seattle where\nAre you are because you're a man of lumps than you are ... there are many times you've been there you were a ban of NFL Europe yep\nDo you like the uh the the football on this starts the the London games yeah\nWhile eagles re there in two weeks ... well I Love it I I I've been over there uh for for a couple of games I Do a lot of stuff for sky sports over there I'm kind of NFL international is headquartered there mark ... international\nA there is a tremendous amount of passion tremendous amount of passion for American football in London I think Lincoln will get I mean anybody that goes over there and you're there game day\nIt is a it's a party they tailgate as well as any um city Philadelphia buffalo you pick a great tailgating city in America Green Bay they are up there with any of them\nWell I Love it I I I'm with you I I Love the fact that that we have the the ... the one of the games are from Hamas and I like it better when it's staggered so way and it's nine thirty on the east coast\nYeah like I guess they're not doing that now as we not this week\nSo yeah I'd I'd like to have the four games on Sunday starting at the ninth or ... yeah that's one third it's already over at Wimbledon but yeah I like it like that too and I think they liked it over there but I think of it it affects the pre game shows I think the kind of back and I'll find it a little bit right now\nYeah yeah I I don't know if you kiss with pre games just getting football I Love your whole weekend we had football Thursday night policy yeah we did a great one team that showed up yes\nAnd and I want to talk about just to start to show the mess that is the giants we saw a team that quick break before our eyes you saw quarterback who's cooks and we saw again another diva wide receiver have a meltdown right in front of your eyes\nWell he's not he's not a part of the game plan and uh they they he the things that he is saying and complain about he's not wrong the the scheme is bizarre I don't know what they tried to do they had a series of ... I'm just pick out one series and the whole game where they were first in twenty\nThey they cannot overcome any mistakes they don't attack down the field so first appointee they threw three straight checked out and as soon as Jim Schwartz gets third in twelve plus he goes to a picket line defense\nAnd he forces you or he doesn't force you you they all they did was cave into the checked out and say Quander road they'll pick up as many ... they have the most futile looking off and I can remember\nAnd outside of three plays by sake one\nUm they literally were stuck in quicksand the whole night and that is that it has not been a great eagle defense's point Minnesota Viking shows you that the Tampa Bay buccaneers shows that they've had a lot of problems with the backing they've got a rookie out of Pittsburgh planes safety who's never played safety before\nThey had no way to attack that at all\nSo it's it is a is a horrible look\nThere one in five during the crypt they're thrown dirt on right now I've been one in five in the sleek and we came out of it in Indianapolis on here we had the best running back to the league in ... and we we won eight of our last ten file we're in the playoff ... all the way the Senate and finished down to seven but I Can't see the steam coming out of it\nAll right so ... above the ... let's dive into this Giants' even the reason why this office is what it is but let's start off the obvious is Eli just completely shot\nYeah you you know he's he's out good right now he's not good he he he has no ability to extend to play\nUm he doesn't trust his office supplies so he's reading the rush\nThe weight bad quarterbacks read the rush and I don't blame him in some cases\nBut they and then he has not been accurate you could look at his stats and it says sixty percent whatever but he's not he's not that guy a lot of flash passes questions shutdowns yeah they're they're not taking shots and when they do the balls ending up out of balance I mean they're not accurate down the field they are to for twenty four\nAnd six games on thirty ten plus I mean all they do is part and so they haven't been any phase of all they do is part [laughter] but I go back to the the biggest issue happened when they drafted Eric flowers with a knife pick\nAnd he just got picked up yesterday actually but when you miss on a pick that high the problem never goes away\nSo what they did was they overpaid for Nate shoulder innate shoulder is a good is a good player if he's in the right scheme if he's in a scheme with Tom Brady in the polls getting out on time regularly he looks okay he's a pretty good player\nHe's not he's not an overly physical guy he's had a great run blocker but he's not going to get your beat mentally\nHe's going to he's a good enough athlete to overcome some of his weaknesses which is he's not a big strong guy he was tied in Colorado and he converted so if you have to hold the ball and he's got to go up against ... some of these guys that are good pass Russia She struggles\nAnd so that probably never went away and then they had to give a big chunk of their salary cap to try to fix the issue\nAnd then the right side of the line is just below average\nNow and then there on the research center I mean you could just you know he's he's got no time he's got no confidence his arm looks shot in a just there's no simple the ball he can't get the ball down the field oh tell back home and it might have been the wrong for them to say it\nBut he was right like when he's asked a question Kenny throw the de Paul the boar he goes I don't know yeah no that's true I mean we're like you and I he's crazy and he's a cuckoo bird but where do you want me to say he's right here he lies got no arm left\nBut you know I'm not defending hotel here in any behavior but they pay them the most money ever too wide receiver and the history of the game to change the game and not give me an opportunity to change\nMoney ever too wide receiver and the history of the game to change the game and not give me an opportunity to change he thought they're going to put more has played he wants to return to punch now he's screwed up in that area the week before you know but he wants to look too good to have them I Know but\nI mean he's he's like you can give me all this money they write this check for me to help them when these games and not give me an opportunity to win the game\nNow now I ... it will let let me ask because they would go back it's silly game ever giants have the ball first and goal to for ... set up by big say Kwan play out first play and you can't argue with to run genetic one\nSecond play have served play neither are said\nHe lie manning should be fined a game check for that performance by he was hair they can't make the pros now keep in mind he was never that good now he completely blows that was one of the great crabs has\nThe performances ... we have seen in the end of that was blamed for those life span\nFounder nights at two AM eastern eleven PM put it back\nOn Fox Sports radio\nI can only mean one thing [noise]\nYou know it's not Jesus Smith dressing up like Lady Gaga waiting to\nSee now the playoffs are on the team but only one can call themselves [noise]\nWorld [noise]\nPostseason MLD coverage is right here on Fox Sports radio\n\nYou'll find that fast one on your TV show to Fox Sports dot com for details pass pass why [noise]\nMm\n[noise]\nOut with you on a a\nWhat a game day Saturday at Fox football Saturday we love it absolutely love it great news there is a quick way you could save money switch the guy go go to guy go dot com and Fifteen minutes would say fifty\nPercent or more on car insurance by a bribe ball bigger aim for Lincoln Kennedy I mean the guard Ghana and about to put a neat bow on the on the giants and triple come back up but uh I I don't know where you go from here are you when you spend all that money on motel back home\nAnd you're in line still struggles and you have no quarterback or I don't know where you go ...\nWell I mean you're going to they're going to be by all by all means they're going to be at the top of the draft again\nI don't think they're going to come out of this thing\nUm you know winning the last ten games are going in any kind of district it just it doesn't feel like that at all it can happen one game you know can lead to another but I don't see this team coming out of it so you're going to go back to the draft and now you have to go fix the quarterback position\nAnd so then you're going to and then as you can see with all these young quarterbacks outside of maybe Cleveland\nThey're all going to struggle to win around freshman quarterback I mean it's just the way that the league is it's just too hard\nYeah and uh conversely\nMe eagle the world champion eagles\nReally write it there's sees in and got back to three and three and a clearly there was a clash of the division of every one about where they are the conference right now\nBut it would be ... there was a clash of the division Carson way big such incredible throw one thing you should never do is throw cross your body unless you are blessed with the gift of ...\nWell you may talk across your body or against it to the end zone late right to find out Sean Jeff ... is the most unbelievable throw us all week\nRight I mean he's washed out a little pocket and he he's rolling too is right and he just hung leashes Howard sir as our foot Alice job because the right thing by quarter back in and tries to turn it back up to help\nWell the eagles have turned her ... she's around and there are legitimate contender again for two reasons one Carson which is completely healthy and he is on fire\nAnd I'll shine Jeffries back to the line yeah but that combination right now of ALS Sean Jeffrey with cars which looks almost unstoppable\nAnd anybody that thought out Sean Jeffrey is a guy or number two that guy is a monster like they can't stop him right now Aguilar is getting better\nAlright ... is who he is which is basically him right now along with traveling tells he looks like they could be any defense out there and you'll see it\nTravis tells he looks like they could be any defense out there and you know the office line has struggled are still questions about it we'll see the health of Jason Peters ... Johnson going forward but it doesn't really matter that much with Carson's plane like he is\nHe is such a great pleasure it's just such a great great\nPlayer I mean he could he is back and I know he's missed the first couple of games but he he could be back in the MVP race if he continues on this tears that he's on right now\nYeah at the ball on the money or there's it's it's funny early on the other hand it twice by living Vernon ... and ... came back with some big plays that really keep well actually the end of the\nPlay for fifty yards and you know to me he was running a dummy route there you can see is is you know it's just scrambled drill in in cars and could have taken the checked out on that play and played it safe and just give it to urge for ten yards but that's Carson\nThe guy is looking to rip your juggler out of your throat on every single play because you can yeah well he can\nHe can is right uh and then a real quick on the Peters before he got hurt before he left the gave me the tour and by that he didn't look too good\nWell here's the Olivier Vernon you know had a couple of good Russia's against them you know he he kind of knock them off his vows beat\nIdle ears on his and he is but he could still lined up and physically in the run game move move bodies now but I don't know if what his condition is right now she's got a tour biceps or whatever um I've always said that a great team that wants to be great will make ten moves\nFrom the start of the season to the end of the season they may have to make the move for running back here are just because the health of that situation and so I don't know who that is they're not going to overpay um I've I've heard all the names that are mentioned but there may have to make a move\nThat will tell you I mean the the talks with buffalo are real furlough strong McCoy bills one or two and three the eagles are obviously not going to pay twenty three for thirty year old back I got to believe at some point the bills kind of come to reality and that things could still happen\nIs that well I mean that that wouldn't be that would make sense\nOr look they they got a one year rental and the super bowl or the J uh jai everybody knew that he had a bad leg now I didn't know it was going to lead to a torn ACL or I didn't see that coming because that's not what his condition was\nHe had a lot of arthritic condition coming out of Boise State he had it but they got a one year rental for for from pick\nFrom ... like they would do that for the first shady go get them all rental and put a legit back behind it that you catch the check downs run the ball out all the things that they need to be a bell cow he would love to get out of\nBuffalo yeah yeah so that makes it does it makes a lot of such a high quality I Want you to meet the rest of the crew were going to be a dad and his ... we're going to talk a lot of your key college games today is that we'll get into including Georgia and LSU\nIncluding a Michigan and Wisconsin to Oregon and Washington and whether anybody can beat Alabama and then of course tomorrow night is going to be an incredible match up sheets and teachers have all your all over that will get into that as well\nBut first let's meet the guys are five producer triple a met Mike mayor good morning Michael\nGood morning fellas how we do an aunt and always good to talk to you and Paul the one at a special treat to have you with us today and do you have big shoes to fill with Lincoln but you are more than\nA qualified absolutely and we we love having you every week at the gas but you sliding into the chair and we really appreciate all ... all the always gets me hype done on his reviews of my guy Baker Mayfield\nSo Baker fan mud on on a ... I'm a big crowd one guy who I Am a big browns fan so like hope is high in Cleveland right now\nFor those dams zebras of him in Oakland Raiders game and if they had a ... or they repeated with Paco right now\nRight exactly and ... and even if you go back to tire a tailor you go back to the first game they tied it it's a black cake where you're at the end and then the saints game if they have a kicker\nHe's five and ... it's unbelievable like what you're just\nBaker I mean does the word right now ... be the more sunlight or more of this year that the place he may last week the black kick was he looked like Superman flying through you know the New York's skyline to block that kick\nRight and and then let's not forget like not just the fact that the brands we are getting ripped for taking Baker making when everybody thought Sam Donaldson they\nEverybody killed the Denzel award tickets for and maybe they'll say oh they should have taken Bradley Chubb\n... is like a contender for easily the defensive rookie year he's been playing out of his mind like it it doesn't blow all he took points off the board of the Baltimore yeah and I only want he ... he ... yeah I mean Baker maybe it'll shut the goal line there the other half for me the black kick\nI mean they took the heat won the game legitimately took nine points off the board so I mean right now I mean he's changing the game for so you're ... Bradley chop has been ... look he hasn't been bad but he hasn't made any game change he plays in Denver\nNo no uh let's meet are fine sound engineer I was Sam is the Big Ten we say I was Sam\nAnd the quarterback is really good if he has a great day today\nJust the way we saw Oklahoma just run up and down the field of Texas and the fourth quarter I did look they don't have a quarterback like that but it's really brought to the extent plays is a good player\n[noise] they they have a chance of putting thirty points up on taxes they it just comes down to help Texas defense and Sam Alger what they can do to\nYeah yeah and then ah we touch or just a bit but Washington number seven in the country get Eugene deployed Oregon is a great football game\nThis ... this is going to be interesting because you know Washington doesn't play a lot of shootouts in Oregon and a ... year they wash usually slows the slow start\nAnd it's gonna be interesting ... early against browning and or in the huskies\nWell O W organs quarterback is you know he's he's up for just about every single word that's out there right now it needs to play well today it so that is a tough place to play\n'em you know this is the more the game and the pack twelve everybody's going to be looking can there be a gene that could come out of the ... the winter today is still alive\nHer patrol for Fifteen touchdowns yeah no I mean look he's a he's a line be physically he's he's got everything that you want\nYeah I mean and and I are you are you surprised how quickly\nThey get got it back\nAnd Oregon yeah well the quarterback is you know it certainly helps and you know he's a local kid he's right there from Oregon he's got the entire state behind them he knows what's at stake or he's incredible athlete so it it it helps with that [noise]\nLike coming up Alabama has meant zoo and the question that I Want to ask you\nAlabama how you put up forty five points or more yeah six straight weeks in a row art is the most dynamic a fence Alabama's ever had it might be the most dynamic office we've ever watched\nAnd ah we gotta talk about the quarterback yeah because the quarterback toggle by law\nHas been perfect I mean you're really perfect you know\nI Want to give it to Alabama dominated ... with you and if this whole season is just one big waste of\nTime okay where Brian ball bigger aim for big Lincoln admit I'm after the guard gotta were the fellas right here on Fox play I Love it here\n[noise] thing happens so fast in our world people don't know what what sort of keep up your here's what they're doing to follow us on Twitter Twitter that Fox Sports radio\nWhere he's when you win the no\nNation on Twitter at Fox Sports radio\nThat's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you see veterans rights they knew Michelin premium ...\nDesigned with exclusive sports like signaling you're offering must lean to Michelin relates to the curb of your when she's giving you unparalleled street free long lasting on\nSo when the going gets tough\nIt's a different you can see available rumored pep boys that was on another\nFind retailers Geico presents I Witness interviews with inanimate objects\nDidn't belong to a colleague of mine on the the never return hell no I'm here to describe the events\nOf ...

that experience and ask yourself if you still\nHate he lied to things happened hey you ended up with Philip Rivers who's a better quarterback being [noise]\nDo you not agree with him that the chargers organization is run by Muslims\nI'm trying to see where where a lot I was told [laughter]\nOkay so anyway but be that as it may uh we had the whole like going into Thursday night\nHe lie manning hall of fame think people get very upset and one of the points I brought up is I don't really understand even the idea\nOf rooting against somebody getting in the hall of\nFame now you've got your favorite players and you want him to get in cool\nIf somebody else not your guy who cares like around like they did this museum in Ohio you don't have to go but that's not where the conversation went the conversation simply went to whether or not ... going to get in and too many\nPeople kept responding to me by going you're wrong you shouldn't be a hall of famer I'm like I'm not having the conversation as to whether he should or shouldn't I'm simply telling you he will so right now you're all remembering Thursday Night Football\nSix years from now you won't\nIf I asked you what happened on Thursday October eleventh or whatever that day was two thousand Eighteen you're not going to remember you're not going to remember a game against the eagles what's going to be remembered\nIs he alive manning is basically patriots kryptonite for the rest of his life\nIs he yes for is that fair some for that defensive line they had a Tom Brady look ... or okay\nIt's a fair conversation that is way too can text you all for sports radio in the hall of fame [laughter]\nIt just is\nA you know that the quarterback gets way too much credit gets way too much blame the quarterback hits the credit\nHe won the super bowl MVP twice against the New England patriots and the greatest dynasty that the sport has ever known ... you know outside of Lombardi ... what is that you want to say I want to say a lot actually he's going but I'm not here to tell you why I'm simply telling you what is okay\nLet me going to go so let me try to find a way as to why he want\nYour ... probably Ninety percent correct that he will\nBecause nothing that's a little bit about getting number one he's Manny right in ... in his father was better than his record because he was on bad New Orleans saints teams so he gets some slack and there was an amazing cops will players pretty good in a league but he had horrible line horrible team with the same Peyton\nTop five quarterback probably about ... they are always going to write so\nHe lie while painting is dominating and he's become a demand and then but he adds misusing the playoffs were like all of a sudden was your brother doing what he but he couldn't having some playoffs success specifically going up in those years that he won the Superbowl\nHere's the thing as Steve mentioned earlier he's like own for in any other player ... let me add on to what Steve didn't get to\nHe's won well in one way is a career that's almost five hundred mhm let me also add three hundred and forty five touchdowns a lot of hope that there's a lot of that is a lot of\nTouch them two hundred and thirty two interceptions nuts lot interceptions he led the league and interceptions multiple years yeah how about ... years\nI remember Brent farms all offense is being really good I Believe you spend more than anybody\nHas he had much more playoffs success um well if you're a Super Bowl wins one [laughter] no I didn't you make a point or you can try all that we all do it too much are you know I'm I'm\nCool with that we don't have we just go by the better player there's no comparison Brett Farr was a better player\nI'm young ... they had a losing season as a Packer are not being funny I don't did he left other other than maybe like the last year or two but I Know yeah they are losing\nThe nerve to get the Vikings an assay championship\nIn almost Wayne yep yep don't Brett Farr don't look we we we were starting to rain on Brett Farr a little bit too much here Brett Farr wasn't MVP three times if I'm not mistaken he ally manning was how many times\nIn no particular order I Would like to call that Brett Farr I didn't like going to be here I Would like to read to you the top ten all time passing yard edge quarterbacks no particular water\nOr you know that Drew Brees is number one that was a recent story and therefore you know the number two words Peyton Manning there's the rest of the top ten in no particular order Warren Moon\nPhilip Rivers John Elway Ben Roethlisberger Tom Brady Dan Marino [noise] and Eli Manning\nTell me again I get in the hall of fame\nBecause Eli Manning as that way too many seasons where he was bad he was either okay too bad\nI don't disagree with you and let me adults are they going to go to the I'm not looking for someone to tell me no look why don't you want I'm looking for someone to tell me that he won't\nI told you I Ninety percent agree with you ... percent that maybe someone will look and say so All right let me give an example Brett Farr through a whole lot of interceptions as you mentioned 'cause he played a whole lot of years he threw three hundred and thirty six or eight to five hundred and eight touchdown hell yeah again it\nRemember he like many came into the league with Ben Roethlisberger and Philip Rivers see the same exact drops same here\nI'm all those three who's got the most yarns passing please be Ben Roethlisberger\nHe lie manning six rothfus burger is seven Philip Rivers as a matter\nOf fact projects the way things look right now pretty sure those other two are going to pass them so they don't play lawyers well oh well when he falls to protest in eighth old time but he's going to the hall of fame\nNow we also have to be you want to talk about context Matthew Stafford is going to have the most passing yards of all\nTime well listen carry Collins who seventeenth so I get it like they just jog Matt Ryan is Fifteen ... uh\nAt it like the the job you're Matt Ryan is Fifteen or you know Carson Palmer is twelve obviously we should run this through ... that's why I was a quarterback who made I don't necessarily\nJust give me yours but I'm looking at Brett Farr\nI'm looking at nine and seven once the ... look his very first year in Green Bay eighty five Ninety seven ... seven five thirty three thirty three Seventy five eight and eight Ninety seven twelve before twelve or fourteen extending fix my point is thirty or thirty three Ninety seven's well before we had one for a twelve year\nBook at all those years of being either good to great give me he lies record\nThat's the ... yeah well you didn't we didn't they will be here where you got to have ten armed guards\nAre now you might have been a little excessive I ended up that might just over the top ten or they did every day I mean there has to be the most boring job [laughter] or do I do anything anymore because they want now is ten of them so they're going to be basically\nSecurity guards on Instagram and we're going to answer Graham profiles for eight hours [laughter] that's all they're going to be\nDoing now that's not what we're all doing exactly yeah but they're just although maybe just maybe like if you're a security guard for like\nUm who's a wild\nGeiger counter McGregor security guards might be able to swim yeah you bet you bet you busy\n[laughter] okay ah ... still wanting to oh this is a living in a bad again I didn't go baseball baseball Supreme where's your friend\nEnded up with your neighbor and a big moment that and I am brewers alright bust you brought a I Know you've been waiting shopping at the bit or to uh to get all of this he like many frustration offer you just had\nOh yeah I Can't believe you know there's got to go check it I'll go jacket Bucky\nIs going to happen it's not about whether they say should I found this is so fascinating to me because when multiple people this week I Try to have a conversation that apparently I'm simply not allowed to have the conversation is not don't you think he should be all of famer\nThe conversations do think he will be he is going to get in it doesn't matter if I or you or you or anybody else\nThinks he's he should get in getting in I just don't know how the guys getting it I really don't\nI Know is he talked to an all time in all of the matter and he has two Super Bowl wins over Tom Brady I think that's why\nHe had the million interception amongst us okay out Brett Farr tie a complete oh he's not come on that and I'm not saying that far but if you're going to point to that then I that's the only thing I can say\nI Would point to his record Bucky that's what I point out is one of these one twelve and want to wait as a starting quarter okay oh it it it'd be flip out in the right and that's a great\nPoint he's looking he ... he\nMight want to as a bench into a safe haven today a five hundred I think it's only been to the well six times\nYup yeah maybe Kim and his own for the other two at the obviously is Superbowl okay so you guys make these great points watch Kelvin you think he's getting there huh [laughter]\n[laughter] ...\n[laughter] when you\nGo ahead you were the other law [laughter] as far as what what's your name was he went oh what's that job what oh we went and got away with one million dollar ... oh no it's not only in ...\nThat is that right now I read your wrist way past their records were that just the way you know right 'cause there's not a\nBad night All right a ploy quarterback no yeah you you got it when you ask the buck might answer by the way I could you ask you then I usually don't laugh\nHarder to come on you can't be no way you're telling me you do not believe that you'll get in\nMaybe senior committee or Letterman\nHad Thirty years he's in now ... and he broke the battle over to me\nThe only one out there is only one that I only went out with other he wanted to be the one I Want it\nTo be the guy at this moment and the Dodgers like please don't have this moment week because that's the reason why it's hard to get rid of them they just have a month or two we like man maybe ... ... ... ...\nYou know yourself week is kind of like ... who was ...\nWell no you're not dynamic he is I mean if you don't know the story if we go over the six years with the Dodgers every time the organization and it spans decide you know what that's not our guy we're not doing this boom\nSomething happens to be a lot of great month and a ... we got to keep this guy like we're keeping this guy then\nHe goes through to strike it out um you'll make he'll he'll have a throw from rice field that one of like two guys could do it all fits\nHis arm is his arm is unbelievable um but anyway I mean that's what that's the Congress have been having this conversation all week even before going into the Thursday night game Bucky and it's fun\nHaving this conversation all week even before going into the Thursday night game Bucky and it's funny to me that people can't see I get it I get why everybody doesn't want to wrap their heads around it I'm with you on my head is my head is wrapped around it six hours from now get yourself ready go jackets speed super boring dog and a half a\nCentury or what is this whole if a moment that he might have been falling brave as I recall it off his helmet\nWait a minute yeah I usually and asked them anyhow that was that was that it was better\nThan better analysts and ...\nAnd the easy past ... doesn't marry feed a team that were Seventeen I Know\nI mean we can put turned over and he won the super bowl\nBy the way when he threw that passed David ... read or did he almost get sacked before he threw it\nI mean did he did he not did yeah I was just you know that when they bought so that's why I say oh they're better off to one\nTell us that you could say what's this all day moment and then you can go oh that's the that's the only one like first of all it's one of the most ... things ever happen in the NFL second of all um how many other guys could I go fight or in the hall of fame that don't have a moment anywhere near as cool as that\nBut also hall of fame is supposed to be reserved for the steps in league with\nHis rivals burger going and what's his moment\nI'm if oh yeah I mean we've had arguments on this really if he's in him being\nWhich was why would then be in the first Super Bowl they one was not because of him true I mean that the second one he wasn't the super bowl than VP\nOkay so now you're going to go to the Superbowl or ask those Tony ... ready I did\nYou're ready for a quarterback who also has two Super Bowls and neither Superbowl had anything to do directly with him\nPeyton Manning thank you and they're going to say but the difference is what's the difference\nHe he's out at any point you would like to think that the guy that you're bringing into the hall of fame that at some point you felt like they were the best of their position\nThat I Would agree man I mean it's possible it's why why it it isn't and twenty watching because all of them are out there oh did you do\nPoint there has to be a thing where you like you know what he'd on meaning is the best dude he's the best student again\nWhen there's never been a moment where he's been one of the two or three quarterbacks that your life in the VIP circle you our meetings\nAnd let me ask a real quick to Martin I hear it's going back to Bucky disrespected been Rocky's brother just respect to your you didn't last of you and I told her I just\nDon't know who you're with look did you get what you just gotta wait for a little bit of the people who's with\nUs is that person because mark also\nWas trying to disrespect him using you know look at look all these things that you like the one that just like a Big Bend no big men's record is one thirty seven and sixty five right one the one that you do\nYou see the difference he winds games yeah how are you seeing my time when I hear everything you're saying so and he's still getting it\nSo that has such a three hundred and forty touched down to a hundred and eighty or we looked at a ... I was like three thirty touchdowns to like do like two hundred and Ninety cents or something like\nThat is one behind ... silver on the west so from that class happens instead of sex from the two thousand and four class\nYou a big men fill the rivers are those who can't get it\nEvery quarterback from Nicholas ... oh yeah they do so so fills up\n... who wants to you all it wants to participate in a in a one will be about uh probably what eight year long bat [laughter] eight year long that's about eight to not only do they fill up getting into all getting in ... he today on all the way getting in I don't want to last\nA little different I Would if these were the NBA we were talking about point guard Chris Paul rest of what I Would be with you in it felt to me rightfully so there are a little more like a everybody will be the greats of the greats\nRight I mean yeah you're right you're forgetting marketing your clue you could you rather is Philip Rivers is nowhere close to being\nDone ... but I use when new ... or your\nCareer and your all time in every quarter backs that you're gonna keep him out\nHe's going to have to have a moment though for the right you got to make her bowl you don't have the yeah I'm not even saying after winning he gets to a Super Bowl with all the numbers in another talent that we know that he has like him him his own time and not telling the\nPlayers always dance house moment revolutionary heat and the game ... office mate has ... medals wanna watch football\nMan what a minute you just call the office and it's named after someone else\nHow do you do so how did you learn about how how did they in fact you credit for that man he was he was the joystick\nAnd that he made it up and that's worthy of what's ... what's his moment it's got to be a Super Bowls got to be this what's the emphasis moment\nThat followed you gave me the moment ... ... that's not a moment [noise] uh no that's the thing that's a thing that is but she was sitting in his moments ranch formative you have more of the game has changed the game integrate beer like Barry ... okay I'm not comparing the bears and it's but what I mean is very centers that have a moment per se but he has well he has a million\nIsn't ready all day I got out of a failed you one time because\nBarry has a collection of moments like the woman who made the pages player who was that bucket that just did a three sixty like all the way the safety yeah don't anywhere but I just started mine wasn't you know okay that is why caught him I look like [laughter]\nOkay 'cause what what is it was a bowling balls debate yeah balls were babies you try to get that you want to get a sponsor your subway or somebody\nI have a I have a ...
