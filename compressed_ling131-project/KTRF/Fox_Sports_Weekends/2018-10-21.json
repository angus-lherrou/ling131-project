radio studios Fifteen minutes could save you Fifteen Percent or more on car insurance ... the guy could account for free rape quote from ten to seven the ravens fall over the same sense of and again we just saw them are Jackson coming for men and not black goes back into a lot of that going on\nAnd on like you mentioned if you're a Flaco you are [noise]\nNot really really on the they're not really filling it with other things as you are my uh pitch cow in this case we're talking about football so we'll say run our past count [noise]\nHold on to see their touchdown ravens [noise] who's that was that the\nTide and Arabs ruins yeah Flaco to Andrews touchdown ravens of course to wait for the extra point which are no longer given so currently sixty seven back in the day we just bought um seven yeah\nNot any more you gotta wait we've already seen this extra feel an extra point attempts today as well seven seven Washington Dallas tide is the one of those old school division rivalry games right here back in the eighties so seven seven there\nWill give you an update but I wanted to say that guy right there the show in Adrian Peterson in the when you're looking at about a hundred yards from the ground for him in ...\nAnd then in a two losses I think one gave me at like six yards and then the other gave me that I think twenty something yard so you so\nHe's currently on pace to break a hundred now I think you're fourteen carries Seventy six\nYards or so that they realize that the recipe or to take the pressure off all of not only their deep friends about but they're receivers\nUh is just run the ball Adrian Peterson has a lot left in the tank he is a he is the ... the leader of that all fenced in when they feed him the ... at least Nineteen to twenty times the game he has the ability to eat a large chunks of yard itch\nAnd they that has to be the formula because her cousins definitely can when you some would you ask them to do too much and use it Adrian Peterson basically use them up at this point 'cause every year we go he's done and then he finds a way to prove us wrong\nUm and also quickly give you the score of the uh the rams game they're up twenty two to seven on the forty niners at half so I mentioned something speaking of rams in LA or the Dodgers\nAnd the Redskins will be your World Series teams that kicks off Tuesday\nThe Redskins as ... the Redskins Red Sox Boston right but I ... that's going to be a game that I knew the violent game that the new the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers will\nBeat up on Tuesday World Series and I and I can't still is because like I can still the credit I Want it to so bad but Steve Harvey ... and I were talking yesterday and he was like hey we can have a LA Boston everything you can have the rams patriots\nThat's not far fetched right not far might argue that the two best teams because they beat the cheeks not farfetched and you could have potentially Lakers Celtics that so far this of the team that is I've already the warriors would\nBe like a a hello but the Celtics represent the east isn't far fetched they've been the number one see the last couple of seasons of yeah more than that for her that's more likely to get a caller Leonard ... might have a lot to say with that he's he's got that wrapped it seemed like good just to see the difference between him and the Rosen right there\nUm but at the end for some reason a Kevin Durant injury or Steph ankles go out like they used to\nMess around and get to the Lakers and the Celtics\nAnd the uh the the patriots in Iran's how crazy would that be\nThat would be um one for the ages that look across all major sports who what's what sport\n... it'd be kings and they don't have to be the kings and the Bruins\nNow that I Am a residence on the show\nLe you let me down the thought she'd be a hockey guy you gotta hockey a haircut was come playoff time all over from making\nNow that you do have a hockey haircut what does the hockey haircut and it looks like you wedded back kind of throwing their hats I mean no helmet like let's go out that yeah I got out here because we've got a hot [laughter]\nAnd you might as well that was from he's from the New England area he has to be yeah he's got to be a a hockey fan\nSo because I needed a far fetched that is\nI Would imagine it may not be because the kids have been good last Seventy ... in Boston has been good as world you know can't be that far fetched where you make a clean sweep across all force that will be that will be wild so which ... which sport I guess sport would be the least happy you know we always want the bigger teams\nLike would you want someone other than the rams and the patriots no I don't have either yeah I thought it was ready to get anything better right I mean ... rams in Kansas City\nYeah or I was gonna say if you keep our patriotism that will be exciting now will be exciting for sure um maybe the just for a namesake the Packers patriots with ... you know airlines has gone up a girl or maybe the saints because it's Drew Brees up against\nAny of the top elite quarterback that's why you have to either yeah\nI'm about the only thing that can supersede at I don't think the NBA I could get anything better know that that ... not rivalries the Lakers and the brunt of the Lakers and that'll be for the Lakers seventeenth championship ... the Celtics and the ... everybody out a storyline\nThat is the that is the the holy grail of of of MBA championship that\nIf that were to happen this year that would be like I mean first of course I'd be beside myself 'cause I'm I'm Lakers all day\nRight uh and to have an opportunity to beat them in the finals anti them from old championships come on and then you know the bronze\nGiven it to carry for pulling a break in case of emergency parachute right hey there's others you know see Gordon Hayward come back I mean there's all this storyline ally going going up against Kyrie Iran do against his own team that does is Rhonda ever comes back and I got we got we don't have any anybody and in the red zone right now I'm gonna look\nDo we know make sure no okay quickly\n... who got us all a lot of your thoughts about last night I Know you're watching your ... and even if you want to Laker fan you are who fan so I Know you watch the uh what are your thoughts on that\nA first off I Know the bad blood between a CPA three Chris Paul and raise Armando they just you know yeah they're both the same guy in the same guy [laughter] right so that that doesn't surprise me that they got into it and to see\nHow it escalate it was crazy to me and you know shame oh Brandon Ingram for flying back into the Malian punching through you know throwing punches if someone from behind not swearing\nUp yeah I don't know I don't agree with that so I I Believe it will be fine is suspended the longest\nThe thing that that that I noticed that a lot of people to notice though was when the mainly happen normally this is what you see you see your teammates\nAnd I know where you're going to take care of each other or you're going right\nYou see your teammates pulling you and their guys off for the ... and trying to keep them away from the other team what I saw\nAll for the ... and trying to keep them away from the other team what I saw was the ... or the low brawn James\nSpending more time consoling and trying to come down Chris Paul then his own teammates now I don't know now for me it looked weird and I'm not on the team right\nCan I can I can I wait a minute okay go ahead\nFor me it looked weird and I'm not on the team so I could just imagine what those young guys in the locker room are being the land Steven pins right\nThe the uh job ... to ... all around Rondo all of these guys are like yo\nWho are you and what are you doing these numbers\nFor seven three sixty five we trusted voice that make you smarter feels like you've never met when you're wrong so tell your friends\nOnly listen to the right here Fox Sports radio Fox Sports to think about that sports with attitude\nBy the Houston Texans looked at take down the Miami Dolphins\n... Thursday at seven thirty Easter non boxes now [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBucks will last Sunday salons Kelvin Washington with you and a lot to get into we are joined as we are every week that is with Alex Marvin as serious X amount of fell radio Alex ... on Twitter Alex what is going on but uh how are you\nTalking about Neal colonialism today so not only in my learning my football on what's going on with week seven but also a little bit of history as well\nI just I mean I'm I'm stuck you know I already think your robot I mean how can we consume so much information is ridiculous uh there's a lot to get into I Want to start here\nLet's break down some people are calling it ammonia gate I'm going to call it ... gate as it smelling so ah I saw your tweet here you reach waited something from a Chris Nowinski a doctor saying about the uh jak Prescott earlier in this game\nHe gets the Redskins he was he looked like concussion what's protocol went under the tent comes back out and plays but there is a great video from CBS covering the game where he hits the smelling solve a couple of times\nAnd then you have a the injury going on eight ... Adam gays and devout they Parker and the dolphins way to get to that afterwards but what's going on with his concussion political and our guys are still getting out there and maybe just saying I'm OK put me back out their coach\nWe know that the smelling salt thing has been an interesting one maybe from could talk a little bit about this you know it might framing or who's now ugly to report he wrote about this a long time ago and guys that were getting hopped up on this stuff you know on the sidelines apparently it is legal I don't know what the after any long term\nHealth ramifications when it comes to this but she'll see players doing smelling salts but the concern was this now I I I Do on the couch this by saying that there have been a couple of cowboys media people who you know reporters who were pointed out that that Prescott does do smelling salts or you know the ammonia capsules\nUm if I'm On a regular thing for him but for a player who potentially as foggy a you know who may you know may have some costs of symptoms to try to get used backup potentially by taking an emotional capsule and breaking it open and smelling it that that's not good for anybody not a good look for the league of course you know the other thing was what was he in the medical temp\nOr was that more a matter of looking at his hand or which appeared to be the injury or is that actually going through the concussion protocol testing so the NFL investigate they they are not afraid to find teams I Would imagine at some point there will be a statement whether the cowboys were cleared of this or not\n[noise] um yeah it's not only saw a issue has been around we used to do it we still a crack a bunch of uh a bunch of them will put them in the empty water bottle yank it up a little bit just to give you a guy who did the before the games even started this was the thing to do to\nTo just awake in years since ... gives you end up in the mindset of\nOf of getting ready to go compete so I mean I don't want to have a problem with it I don't know what the lasting effects of it they are just like they used to give us are still give us toward our shot no one knows what the last rice uh affects of toured or shots are either or any of the ... of the other opioid they give us for pain or or\nOr the anti inflammatory so I put this only saw in the realm of all of that if you're going to give out a cornerstone ... by the truckload then all of a sudden the food and Drug Administration\nA pause ... and all of shows because people have been dying and then write so all of this fit into the category of\nYou know things that professional athletes partake in that may or may not be good for them and until something or study comes out to where they say OK visited it they'll just find a replacement associates\nTo where they say okay did did it they'll just find a replacement a substitute for\nPart which is the worst thing right I mean ... you don't need another generation of guys that are dealing with opioid issues and you know pain management and things like that because you know youth is wasted on the young I mean you think you're going to live forever you think that things that you do in your twenties arm Superman\nEspecially great athletes right and you know no I can overcome this is part of what makes\nAthletes so great it's also the abuse of this sort of stuff is what led to the FDA actually running an investigation of NFL team to a few years ago to find out okay who's prescribing what you know where things at right now in the medicine cabinet so to speak right and you know how do we account for these things in fact if you're a player and you need to get a pain\nNumbing drug right down your row team\nThe home team has to go get it for you I don't know if you're aware of that now they have to yeah they have to send someone out I'm not joking like someone with a script with a police escort to a nearby pharmacy to go get it\nBecause they do not keep it on on the stadium cites anymore it's one of the things that yeah that stemmed from this but\nYou know again it it's something that look I Hope that people keep the NFL in check because if it weren't for the media banging the drum about the concussion protocol through the years as we look back a colt McCoy you remember when he was playing for the browns on Thursday Night Football everybody in the world knew that he was can cost except for the people on the field right and the guy was allowed to continue playing right if you don't point these things out as reporters\nThen you're not going to get them investigated you're not going to have these things happen and that's bad for the players long term because\nAgain we don't want another generation of guys that are having issues that could be prevented\nI agree with that one hundred percent\nSpeaking of injuries or what is going on down in Miami where Adam gays and saying that divides the ... uh Parker's Napoli healthy and then he's going out through his agent and saying that he is and this is poor management and the cost of the team you know chances to win what the heck is going on a ... break it down\nOkay so let's understand that anything that happened before two thousand and sixteen involving Adam days in the Miami Dolphins\nHe doesn't feel responsible for K. he didn't select the voluntary Parker and the dolphins have been frustrated through the years because of on the parkers had along injury history hasn't been available for them look he has an ... you know some incredible talent at times when he plays big Buddy Guy incredible speed but he's never out there right and now we're getting to a point\nAbout whether he's in the weather is truly injured or not the dolphins are saying he's not a hundred percent to volunteer Parker's age and the saying he is what I just wonder is does this come to a head you know starting before the trade deadline October thirtieth can the Miami Dolphins move him their teams that are in the wide receiver market because a team believed Yvonne tape Parker is worth trading for\nAt what point the dolphins by the way who continue to cut ties with people that run afoul of Adam gays I mean how many guys have they cut that have gone on to play elsewhere we saw Jordan Philips earlier this year and I was with buffalo as a defensive lineman recharge a a job he get traded we saw Jarvis Landry get traded\nNone of these were Adams guys will at some point it stops being the players fault it starts being the coaches fault while you're not winning and that was a pretty darn bad effort today against the Detroit Lions that you know look I Know the dolphins are injured and they lost Albert Wilson has been their best often supplier all that being said though I mean this Miami Dolphins team\nTo lose the way they did today to Detroit you can't trust them and you know I'm not saying that they can't stick around five hundred type team as a year goes on but\nAt the end of the season I think the dolphins after three years and Adam gays have to ask themselves are we truly headed in the right direction and by the way how do we solve the quarterback issue because we saw ... while a return to earth today ... Tobar gets rocked today it it's hard rock stadium\n[laughter] what a through my experience in in in being that I've seen in my career\nTeams have a way of devaluing you when they want to move on from you they will just certain things they do to reduce your value so all they can move away from you without regulation or all without records\nAnd uh making a player inactive and using a injury\nAnd now he's already injury prone would just have to move on from ... that's a tactic that I Know for a fact that they they use\nIt's dirty pool right here a lot of ways but\nThe weird part is for the dolphins aren't cutting off their nose to spite their face right I mean maybe they are saying is look if you don't think the guy is very good or you just don't you don't like the way he practices whatever you know that's one thing they're blaming it on an injury why our team's going to see through this device and say Parker movable I mean the reports are today\nThat the dolphins are listening to calls for about people asking for a trade but so if you're saying they've on tape Parker's entered argued trading for damaged goods\nCouldn't pass a physical for your team I mean the dolphins of muddy the water on this as well by even talking about this but again it's a team that can't get out of its own way I mean really that that's what the dolphins are I mean another team to create their own distractions although unlike the Pittsburgh Steelers they're usually not able to overcome\nIt one more for me ... or ... radio outsmart as on Twitter I Want to go to Eric ... who has some very very strong words for Malcolm Jenkins er during the coin toss but even more so afterwards when he spoke with reporters\nI don't know if you saw but he basically yeah yeah you saw great so for those who didn't he basically said that he called Malcolm Jenkins a coward and he said he was a sellout so or just what are your thoughts on how that all transpired and and and what came out of that\nI think the nastiest thing and he said was calling him a neo columnist\nRight and Neal colonialism by the way according to what ... is the practice of using capitalism globalization and cultural imperialism\nTo influence a developing country in lieu of direct military control or indirect political control now this had to do with ah the ability to John I'm African countries\nWeren't even being blown out in this gangster right like it was you know like this uh this uh for forty niners ... game where the rams up thirty two seven over forty niners raiders I it it's a blowout let's just take them out there in this they're relatively in that game uh you know against the Texans so let me ask you this then\nNext week\nThey can't go back to ...\nThey can because they're paying them so they can go back they could come out and say look Blake was\nYou know he just wasn't himself or he was himself and we need them to be someone else was backing because they don't have a suitable backup they don't have a guy\nWho keep you know come in and and it is all world so they don't have a a previous starter as a backup they have ... Kessler\nYou know and and so they can go back to Blake mortals and try to design a better game plan for them and and they help him in some aspects\nUh them not having a limit for Annette there's definitely a putting a lot of put more pressure on him\nBut they did say for Carlos Hyde so obviously they you know something is is is going on a little deeper with a with a friend that had a string of than we know so when they get called high bag they'll ... I mean when they get him already and up to speed to play that will relieve some of that pressure like you I mean\nAfter twelve attempts they were like okay that's good I mean come on over here we had enough twelve attempts to phone bills\nYou know it it they just ... you know\nThey couldn't do it anymore and I said it did it last year the same guy who rush for more yards at a playoff when then he passed for you can't sustain that\nYou and your specially when you're not a Romney it's not as Michael Vick kid I was possible like that is not a recipe for a dominant team and yeah the defense is there but if you can't put points on the board than defensively doesn't matter how good your job or\nSpeaking a deep as a gray stopping the red zone by the cowboys and only allowing the Redskins and get a feel good at making Thirteen to seven because Adrian Peterson was running all over me got down to a about the seven a yard line and they weren't able to score and had to go kicking field goal so great stop there\nBy the cowboys I uh I I Know you wouldn't complaining one album more from Albert ... so that means we'll get your fantasy ticker update as well fantasy figure out to the district the X. box sports radio\nThat twenty eight ... theory\nOut changing marching Boston Red Sox from the pan out\nIs Angeles Dodgers on new champion states coming soon here all over\nThe Fox sports radio\nNo two wars commercial for\nThe real life cater my mentor these are things that he thing how can I Do in getting that concerns the grandparents may have without the main concerns delusion that keeps the mind isn't it cooking the barrage of bad word\nPlayer was most unpleasant whereas commercial out on business insurance through progressive is anything but this is a progressive commercial but come to court today insurance for about ... billion users [noise]\nThere are less veterans are proven tough to perform and temperatures of a hundred and forty degrees and forty below zero because when you can start an extreme conditions you can start an everyday conditions like running late for work\nAppropriate on line [laughter]\nCreepy purkis runs\nProven tough and only those visit any of our fifty five hundred locations nationwide and let us do more for you [noise]\nDoes that sound of a school they'll bring to mind homeroom lunchtime the day's end for the end of school entirely I thin kids dropping out\n... communities in schools we work directly inside school to help those students who had nobody to come to school is often jeopardized by hardships the loss of a loved one poverty lack of housing or bullying here from a few students whose lives we have touch\nThey've always had a lot back they've always done anything to help me\nCommunities in schools we empower students to succeed in and out of the classrooms\nHave certainly had any questions than any other personally anytime they needed more narrow\nOur mission is to ensure that at risk kids had someone by their side\nThey don't live in a way it is in the constitution\nThat I mean it isn't just never gave up on me I can do it and I did it\nCommunities in schools where in schools to help kids stay in school see how we how often do you think need communities in schools dot org\nAbout Seventy percent of us adults age sixty five are older have high blood pressure and only about half have it under control blood pressure medicine can protect the heart brain and kidneys but many people aren't taking it as directed this means that they may skip doses are stopped taking it altogether\nTo help patients healthcare systems can involve the entire health care team to ensure patients are taking medicine is directed simple pie blood pressure treatment by prescribing Ninety they refills in combination medicines coordinate pill brief pills and prescribe generic medicines encourage the use of home blood pressure monitors\nAnd address the natural barrier such as high co pays and deductibles\nPatience follow your health care teams instructions on how much medicine to take how often and how long to take it\nAsks questions about how do correctly take your medicine and why you need them used weekly pill boxes or a reminder system to keep track of when to take medicine\nTo learn more visit C.
