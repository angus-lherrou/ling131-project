time you know they all they all knew I hadn't\nSlept and the one guy leaves he says he didn't get nothing for many of my paper man he was just discussed and laugh and then before he left or because you made a promise to us because all the time when I'd be doing drugs and stuff I Would always promising this platform\nIs going to help when I quit I'm going to come back in and help everyone you know get out of this horrific addiction everything there are many times I was and crack houses or bars or whatever and I would talk about revelation which I read about when I was ever in jail you know

really kick\nIn my living\nA real life\nMy fifth year reunion with my class everyone's now is out of college they get these amazing jobs they've started families or they've kept with the same company since high school stay in my mind they were way ahead of me\nAnd it was very it was bothering me inside and then it was just going wow everybody's ahead of me and I'm doing stop to show up you know I got into you know I was a card counted then I took took accounting class professional card but I hadn't even started it yet or whatever I just read the class so I'm\nI'm bragging at at the reunion about skydiving with a parachute not opening and or my car accidents and my card counter things that they've never seen or the mafia coming after me you know so I'm blowing their minds\nAnd so we don't get on the topic of uh yeah how are you doing for work how you do or not you know what are you doing Mike how many kids got home you know how your family you know I'm just completely\nPutting up just wall you know to these other things so they're all thinking I'm nuts basically but it was a very it was\nThat starting there was a very much a driver and it was like there was a lot of non started to be a shame you know I'm going you know this is this is not who I can be done that I prayed I said you know God all I Want is to meet the right woman and have you know kids and and uh you know it'd be that the white picket fence so to speak\nAnd then got brought bad at all to me and handed me on a silver\nPlatter until my could\nJeopardize and animals are in ... by then I was very functioning cocaine addict too I look back over here was perfect well no there was a lot of dysfunction even though it's hard to for the addiction to to hide it all the time kids didn't even know that and that's how good I Would assume it was a lot of\nWork hiding the cocaine and then the crack\nThe kids didn't know okay even like ... just to give our kids are sending their kids over there because we were the fund you know this is back in that you know when they were younger and was cocaine but then when the crack came on that took us down fast when cocaine turned into crack and and the kids\nAnd my daughter at that time and we we got right when it all kind of blew up she says we're very dysfunctional family or I don't know what that means but don't ever say that again we're not dysfunctional such where where what do you mean what it sounded just horrible I didn't know what it really really meant you know and [laughter] so that don't sovereign\nBut I lost it all off and then she lost at all\n\nAnd in the midst of a lot of this dysfunction Mike was all ready running\nMy hello\nI tried every pill even when I was sixteen years old I bought one of my first paychecks when to buy a pillow at that grocery store I worked at\nThis teenager spent Seventy dollars on that would be two hundred and eighty seven dollars in today's money\nOr law so I spent the most expensive pillow thinking it would be the best it was a down pillow and it was the worst because they you know I Know now they just sell us air I mean I I mean how\nCan that be it feels good down and goes but I couldn't return it that I Do remember they would not let me return that pillow but then through all my life I'm trying different pills and I always had problems with sleep and wake up in the morning we had a cake but mostly these sleep interruption or not being able to get to sleep right away\nSo and in two thousand four I had a very clear dream of the name my\nPillow and wrote my pillow all over the house in ... in connecting the wind in the pie and and you know these logos and I'm going\nThat sounds really corny you know um but I go well where's my pillow you know I mean if you ... it's hard for you to think back now 'cause there's my everything and it was because of my pillow got big everybody took up demise but my daughter came upstairs and there was she looked and there are pieces of paper written all over and\nLives he says uh she gets a glass Russia I don't know she's eleven years old maybe she said what are you doing dad now and I go\nI'm going to Memphis pillow and I realized I hadn't even got the you know what what is going to be made of it was going to do it's going to be the best thing ever have seen it and and this can be caught my pill and\nShe looks at all these piece of paper she goes that's really random dad and she went back downstairs well then the kids seven to their mother at the time Wednesday I get over this pillow thing and then he said oh it's just a phase it'll be it'll be over with and I was it at that\nTime I wasn't doing anything I sold my little bar restaurant so my total focus was on this pill now well then I still had to figure out the material so we tried over Ninety four different kinds of phones and fails to put it in there and one son daring and I've now managing\nEleven hundred twelve hundred employees of the manufacturing that's what he does now but she is like nine or ten years old and everyday ring up from school and then we tried different kinds of stuff on the deck and the fall would fly all over the neighborhood and betrayed little machines to get to work and finally we get it in a work once we had the pillows all made\nWe had Margaret ... house everything and we had no money left but we had like three hundred pillows\nEverything and we had no money left but we had like three hundred pillows\nAnd I went into the first two I walked into a was a bed baths and beyond I'll just say the name in

the teams of twelve take on\nWell this guy runs those solo dean is also written multiple books including ultra marathon man confessions of an all night runner and his latest the road to support or reliving the ancient battle and effort run that inspired the world's greatest what race and dean thanks so much for joining us\nJust listening introduction I think I Need to take a run [laughter] oh dear yeah I don't have a beer Enron yeah\nBefore we get into your running and other accomplishments we love to talk to almost everybody who walked through the store\nAnd we love to talk to almost everybody who walked through the door for all of our interview process where were you born tell us about your parents and one of the things in childhood that using ... to become the guy you are today\nI was born in Los Angeles\nSo California born and raised a I'm a hundred percent of Greeks I'm from a a great grandparents\nUm [noise] I remember running home from kindergarten when I was six years old I was the oldest child and when we had my my youngest sister I said we've got a I've got a brother who's a little bit younger than me and then my sister I remember my mom is having a hard time getting me home from school\nAnd my dad was working two jobs so I just said mom you don't have to worry about getting me home and she said well how are you going to get home\nAnd I said well I'm going to run home\nAnd I remember really enjoying running I remember sitting in the classroom or just waiting for the ... you know what young kid especially a boy wants to sit still and pay attention I mean a young boy he wants to run around and go wild\nAnd I remember sitting there in that classroom to ... you know counting down the moment to tell the bell rang and then running home\nAnd I still don't want us to fill in pay attention so you know\nEven though we're both ...\nAnd so tell me this you you you start to I guess do it all boys do would you increase the challenge just step it up a little bit more talk about how that happened increasing your distance as as a kid\nWell there's this idea of never stop exploring and in running it's very symbolic Iran that I ran a marathon when I was fourteen years old so that's you know twenty six point two miles\nAnd I thought maybe the furthest that anyone could ever run a and then I heard about people running further than that and I I couldn't believe it I heard about fifty miles foot race and I thought that's impossible a human being can't run continuously for fifty miles\nI got to try it so I signed up in Iran fifty miles and you know at the fifty mile races as well congratulations you qualified\nAnd I'm thinking qualified for what for the insane asylum and they said no you qualified for the western states one hundred mile endurance run\nAnd I could not wrap my head around the idea of someone running a hundred miles nonstop I thought you know there's gotta be campsites along the way you know how many days does it take and they said no the starting gun goes off and you run as though you're running you know a mile race around the track you just run for twenty four hours nonstop\nOr they were very independent um almost separate nations have a sort but they all polluted and all kind of used best practices\nOr to better themselves and I think the Greeks you know the Greeks have said we can't turn anywhere else I mean we're kind of we we've got to help herself they've been very self reliant is is one quality that I've seen with Greeks\nAnd um you know we're we're a definitely a minority I I think that a Greek Americans make up um something less than half a percent of the U.S population but I'm per capita\nThere are more Greek PHD's than any other class and its millionaires is while they're more Greek millionaires\nThan any other ethnic group and this is I get per capita or small small base of people yeah\nYeah and I'm Lebanese and and we're a little behind the Greece but here's a group of people that come into this country and I got to tell you do not many ... I got made fun of a lot didn't bother me because my parents said don't worry about it\nYou know for every person that made funnier there's ten people love you and I found the true to do to the nature of the American experiment and the American people there really generous they wanted to try out my foods the family foods and they were deeply curious and that one no go ahead and the crowd you just have to learn to ignore them and get on with the rest of your life [laughter] and then\nI've got a Lebanese friends I Know where you're talking about there they are they're funny people really great\nPeople always just say let's turn something really ugly under something funny yeah we live short so let's talk back to that fifty marathons and fifty days and say that these days you\nYou start in St Louis on September Seventy two thousand six with Lewis and Clark marathon you ended on November of two thousand six with the New York city marathon a talk about some highlights some low light to dean because they're got to be moments even inside you are you going what was I thinking\n[laughter] plenty of those moments\nOf but you know it was it was great exploration I mean it was a for for one you know just for the listeners to explain how I did this I had a a big school bus\nAnd my mom is a retired public school teacher so I brought my kids along to my daughter and my son they were young at that point and my mom would wrote school them so she basically home school them as we're driving around the country for fifty days at their schools were sending them the lesson plans emailing them to my mom\nEvery Sunday night and she teach a lesson throughout the week and we all of a sudden became like that of a kind of this traveling um road show where\nAll of my kids' friends from school were so curious you know what were the experiences they were having it and then their parents learned about it so now their parents were falling out and people started learning about what I was doing and they were coming out like we'd have fifty sixty people show up at the starting line of a race\nComing out like we'd have fifty sixty people show up at the starting line of a race in Iowa on Tuesday Morning for an\nEnd yeah though and marathon for flying from Alaska guy came in from Japan to run with me they heard about this and it just was like this Brotherhood they can't sit or they came together after that was\nYou know the ... the really a poignant and and beautiful moments and some of the low moments where I remember running a marathon in Alaska and it was snowing and cold\nAnd the next day I was in Arizona and it was about a hundred and five degrees running through the desert and I remember finishing the race thinking\nThis is marathon Nineteen I can barely walk you know how many had to get out of bed to all morning and run a marathon let alone you know thirty more after that so there were some moments where I really doubt it I could do it um and just you know\nKept that American Spirit to said you know when I get out of bed in the morning I Would say I don't think about running a marathon just get to the bank you know the bathroom and spice of water in your face\nYou know okay that's great to just put on your shorts you know one leg at a time okay lace up your shoes okay get out the door [laughter] get to the starting line okay just start running just put one foot in front of the other uh so became at points are very uh cerebral challenges twelve and physical one\nYeah I Would assume that you know I I've gotten into my ... wife and he has the same role the young guys on the court and it's not anything else but these two simple words next to play\nNot to play before and not to replace five boys and the next game or the NCAA finals just next play\nIn so many of the kids in an athlete who played under his to ... talk about how that helped him focus on just the next activity in front of you life didn't become as intimidating that way\nYou well and it's ... you're right I Am with running you know it gets very grant writers said yeah instead of mixed play its next step your next step\nNext step because you tend to look at the market especially during the marathon you know you might be a mile and you might see a market and says my Eighteen\nWhich means you know you basically have over eight miles to go and you know you might be cramping at that point you know you might just be completely exhausted it's demoralizing at the heavy weight and your shoulders to think how am I going to run another eight miles on top of what I'd done\nDon't do that I just said next step put the blinders on about the future don't reflect on the past just being the present moment in that now next step next step so I really I can relate to the next play mentality\nYou know there's a great thing for life I think kind of stay in the moment and not get overwhelmed by the agency's in life which can easily overwhelm any of us if we look too far down the road or too far back\nInto the past it it can be paralyzing let's talk about this cross country road trip because my goodness we talked to one person who's biked across the country for Dave Dave Thomas's foundation he's a Wendy's franchisee who said my goodness I Want to raise the money for kids\nAnd so he wrote you wrote across the country on a bicycle and we followed them along what was jogging across the country like and by the way what did you learn about your country when you do this and that fifty day into the state or adventure and what's your family learn\nYou know I'd I learned we're we're a very diverse country I mean you you hear that set all the time and that's almost cliche but the regional differences I'm not just with the food and you know the dialect\nBut with philosophy and the way you approach life is so varied as you run across the country\nUm but the one the one you know the ... the one uniting thing if it were all free and we're all freedom loving people\nSo that support I got along the way was remarkable it's almost like Forrest Gump I mean some day that'd be running and they'd be forty or fifty people running with me you don't have the remote highway [laughter] out in the in the desert I remember running over the Rockies in a snowstorm and people showing up on the side of the road with hot chocolate\nSo we you know I I learned that running can transcend our differences and bring people together I mean there's so many things in this world that that divide us right be it you know political beliefs to Carver scan the God we worship whatever\nI Wonder how is that they're running a and people were running with me it's a commonality all of us human share and it brought us together regardless of you know the food we ate um you know the accent we had so uh it was really beautiful seem that the support people that came out after not talking about elite runners some elite runners but\nSome people just coming out to run a mile or two by my side\nYeah then I by the way what's so interesting to me I'm a dear friend of mine just Italian guy who was one of my mentors and he said you know if you can do these three things a lot you can have a happy life play sports a lot because you're not talking dance a lot 'cause you're not talking\nAnd and last but not least and this was as you said love a lot because then you're not talking\n[laughter] I Love and you're not talking about the ladder yeah I think I'll go with a letter to when we come back and I think that's what's transcendental is you're running where people you're not going to get them into an argument you running together you might chat a little bit but there's something about just running together just throwing a ball with your kids you don't have to talk throws the ball it just the movements\nOf the movement back just a beautiful thing as the same thing when we come back more with ultra marathon man dean Cornell says this is our American story and by the way to hear all that we do go to Alan Iverson network dot org such our American network dot org more after these\nMaps\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\nYou hear a lot of ... college here on our American

and the ... the Greek runner feeding ... deputies that ran the marathon and uh it's uh it's basically a history book as well so\nYou know ironically right now the book is it's\nNumber one on Amazon and the category of Greek history and I'm not a historian but I doubt very deeply into the history\nOf of ancient Greece and the evolution of running a marathon and I also learned a lot about my identity and I think this gets back to what you talked about um you know being a Lebanese and wanting to know more where you came from\nSo I actually went back degrees to the very village my grandfather came from and his grandfather and his grandfather before him and discovered a lot about\nYou know why I'm all about and how it became who I Am and where my people came from and that to me it was fascinating I think that's something that that you know we look at the the\nPopularity of things like ancestry dot com\nOr twenty three and me you know the genetic tests that can tell you where your ancestors came from ballet did I learn where my ancestors came from I visited these places and ... how they lived you know generations ago and that was really fast and they had to write about all this in the book\nYou know there's one point in time where you say at the START I was surrounded by three hundred and fifty warriors huddled in the pre dawn missed at the foot of the crop a list of Athens for me the quest was deeply personal I'd been waiting a lifetime to be standing in this place I Would finally run alongside my ancient brother\nClose out with us those words who was an ancient brother you just mentioned them and that feeling running and starting to run by the crop all is\nIt so that ain't your brother was his name was ... and he was part of a class of people called he drove me they were professional day long runners they were foot Harold foot messengers and his mission was ... when the Persian invaded Greece at the bad marathon\nThe Athenians said we need to recruit the Spartans to help us we need reinforcements were badly outnumbered they dispatched is this man ... he used to run a hundred and fifty three miles nonstop to spark to to recruit the sport in\nThe battle and it was because of his ... undertaking and his mission that\nDemocracy is what it is today I mean he basically saved democracy Greece was the first democratic state and the Persians won to crush him had he not succeeded in running a hundred and fifty three miles to recruit the Spartans our life to be very much different and\nTo me that it it was incredible to retrace those footsteps and to do it um my cell and twenty five hundred years later\nAnd that's where we love doing here on our American stories into the story of the people we have long am I doing this that sounds like your story
