structuring efforts are quote an increasing area the emphasis for the Justice Department and there\nHas been an influx of resources to investigate it dust I'd be disappointed if there was an uptick\nIn prosecution [noise]\nSo by lawyer called and\nWhoever the prosecutor was on the taste Rod Rosenstein actually was the\nBarbara justice in Maryland at the time I'd like to see him go to jail now go visiting but he called him\nOne of rods deputies\nHe said well that's the way it goes and we will ... will negotiate no or probably keep half that money you might have ... down some but you know\nAre we keep half that money and you might have your email and negotiate that down some but you know use the you know we'll negotiate some kind of a a deal\nTreating it all too casually like it's negotiating some thing\nAt a garage sale not thirty thousand dollars above businesses of families\nSomehow I don't know how\nIt all came down but there was another lawyer showed up\nAnd he'd been working on the structure thing for a long time but they all told me you know keep my mouth shut and not tell anybody about it\nI think all these papers but when I went to the farmer's markets that weekend everybody knew that the governments told my money everybody woke up and say well now I Know how we goes I told him the story\nAnd they are where they they couldn't believe it [noise]\nSo it wasn't too long after that that uh [noise]\nI got a call from Baltimore city paper and he was questioned about you know this\nBecause he saw the docks come out of federal court in Baltimore\nAnd I said you know I'd love to tell you the story but my lawyer said what do you get this thing's settled\nOut better just not say nothing except for the government wanted everybody say nothing so they can still your money and nobody knows what's going on so he said well you know that's the way you want to look at it but I'm going to do the story and do look good on your part far right from what the government says\nSo his government allowed to speak about him but they say that he's not allowed to respond\nBecause people already thought we'd done something wrong I mean everybody her her parents thought we had done something wrong I think my parents my to do it done something wrong\nThen so I told him the whole story\nWhen we got our settlement papers you know we knew from the\nCase on the eastern shore with a\nTailor family who knew what their settlement was the last one was different housing method I did something wrong in the settlement now and then do it\nSo I'm a lawyer call them\nHe says because your client went to the press and they send us an email it said it\nRosen teens deputy Stefan ... actually out an email that they were treated differently because quote un Mr Taylor did not give an interview to the press admitting as\nClear as day that the government is acting according to a rule of vengeance not according to the American promise solve the rule of law\nSo he said it wasn't going to do me any negotiating you know they were keeping a close to thirty thousand dollars and it was it into the ocean ... miles as I went to the press [noise]\nIf we were fought him\nThey would have got\nTo the whole three hundred and sixty thousand dollars away the causes and checking account that here so that was another thing they were holding against dissident fight is that you know you're not going to win and they were going on three hundred and sixty thousand dollars [noise]\nThis is what you call black male\nEither pay us thirty thousand or going to come after you for more three hundred and sixty thousand and by the way fighting us in court will cost you a lot more than thirty thousand so you might as well just pay us right now\nA pretty good business to be in if you or the government they can do this all day\nLong [noise] and do but not a great business proposition if you're Randy and Karen especially when you're trying to do your actual his sense of farming [noise] it's a no win situation for them if they lose\nNo matter what [noise]\nSo this hour has decided to forfeit the thirty thousand dollars of their sees the money to the government\nAnd tried to move on with their lives [noise]\nBarbeque a lot of time to go out and fight and\nSurely can't fight the government\nBut in the meantime there's two for justice had been working on some of these cases\nAnd our main contact with them and they came out we had a meeting\nBut says cases already settled they just\nReally wasn't a whole lot they can do [noise]\nAnd when we come back we're going to hear what happens when liberty lawyers get involved in that sort of the Institute for justice his lawyers are they protect people's property rights from the government and always remember why the constitution was formed as we all know that most of our cops and prosecutors are good guys\nBut the bad ones and boy there were some bad ones here folks [noise] and you know it right\nThe law on behalf of the citizens starts to take action [noise]\nBrandy salary story here\nOn our American stories here although we do sort of our American network dot org give us your email address and we will send you are five best stories of the week [noise]\nAnd there'll be a transcript form she can read them or you can listen to him by the way if you have your story about government power coming in on your life and\nHe settled on an iris form of you settle for something when you didn't think you are guilty send those stories to us we'll run them down because this is happening all over the country and it's happening a lot more than you think\nAgain this is our American stories when we return the dairy farmer Randy sour shaken down by his own government the guy just trying to get along every day like the rest of us\n[noise]\n\nBack\n[noise]\nMm [noise]\nYou hear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American stories it's a special place which students study all the things that matter in life\nAll the things that are beautiful in life and I know I teach there every year for a couple of weeks\nAnd then we have some in Hillsdale sinus come here and tell their own story and produce

chilled\nTo the nonprofit\nKids will do for justice of the bunch a young lawyers are concerned about this country [noise]\nUh met a good many oh and they all have the same outlook\nAnd they're not out there\nTo make a lot of money I have no idea how much money they make I don't care most all the money comes in donations from people that like what they say and not people like me 'cause I don't have a lot of money to give up I mean people think I have a lot of money I mean so now live in a big house but\nYou know the house came with a land we both are they really want the house it's too big that's why I'm living in just two of us because nobody does want to live in it [noise]\nBut you know the\nPeople what people think about farmers is is ridiculous because they think you're rich because you've got big machine calls a lot of money and that's why you're not rich because you've got to have those machines to do what you do [noise]\nAnd great work has always Alex\nBy the way a major bank CEO confidentially told us that the government has essentially force them into being their own private snooping army with their compliance department selling to mind their customers accounts\nFor what the government might deem suspicious activity giving them no choice but to report many innocent citizens like Randy's hours to the government for investigation\nThe c._e._o. said that this force snooping sweeps up former information than anything that the NSA did related to phone records and yet has received almost zero attention and that's what we're doing here in our American stories bringing this story to your attention\nIs also a big problem selective prosecution you're the government has seized the bank accounts of innocent farmers like Randy sours but refused to charge politicians like former New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer who was actually guilty of structuring his payments to prostitutes and you bet he knew which structuring was\nThis bipartisan legislation out their folks and it's sponsored by Democrats like congressman Sheila Jackson Lee and Republicans like Senator Ted Cruz and that doesn't happen too often so that's how bad this prosecutorial abuse is folks\nOf course that would change the statute so that you can't be charged for a crime that you\nDon't know is a crime it's called men's rare folks it's the heart of criminal law if you don't know what crimes that crime you can't be charged\nWith it this is Lee Habib Randy shower story and thank goodness for the Institute for justice looked him up folks give them some money they do great great work protecting property rights for Randy and maybe one day for people like you\nAgain this is our American story\n\n[noise]\nThe time were the producers producers at our
