two\nBogle birds that died in August of Nineteen eighty two but not before this hit song made him a celebrity was numerous media interviewers interested in him as the inspiration\nHere's de info Byrd speaking about his single leader of the ban in Nineteen Ninety One I think I could only\nIt would have said he's a fast [noise]\nBecause what that meant to my father and to me there's no way I could qualify that or even explain it um\nMy father passed away over ten years ago now and\nHe he got to hear that song he got to see this enjoyed the successor that saw\nPeople were calling him on the phone and interviewing him and his last days\nYou know who is this mandate of the band you know\nAnd he just he loved that and I loved that cause I respected him so much I mean he gave me everything I Am really my mother and hey we're both musicians and [noise]\nThe idea of being a living legacy that's really the truth I don't think I'll ever be as accomplished musician as he was\nBut um I've had a different gift came to me in a different way I've been able to reach in\nTouch people do sauce [noise]\nAnd that one is probably touched more people more deeply than anything I've ever done\nAnd by the way don't we all want to have our sons and daughters speak that way about us and again that's why we do these stories folks but you don't hear him anywhere else\n... music was powerful in its

the band which ... churches and inspired to someday possess the same love musical ability as his dad\nAnd these are from this um this is of course the leader of the band is tired and his eyes are growing old but his blood runs through my instrument and his son is in my soul\nMy life has been a poor attempt to imitate the man I'm just delivering legacy to the leader of the band here's their Bogle birds\nIn the industry we recall any book that lasts for more than a year or two we called them perennial write a book that's lasted for ten years would be a a very big success but\nThe irony is if you pull up of the New York times best seller list and you go to the the fine print at the bottom it says among the categories not actively track this time our perennial sellers so there's this term\nWe know that these books that that last and last and yet most of our focus in the industry whether we're making books or music or movies is about new things\nIt was in two thousand Fifteen actually for the first time in the music business that catalog album officially out sold new releases\nAnd so we know that the things that were made a long time ago if you think of many of your favorite books and movies and TV shows and restaurants many of them are not brand new it's actually the ones that have really stood the test of time that we return to over and over again\nAnd yet it it's strange where most of the energy and these industries go and so what's so fascinating about cereals connelly's sort of journey as\nHe's writing about this but then can he actually do it right you know he's writing a book about creating lasting enduring work well\nI I was fascinated by the idea of like could could he actually do it with the sort of like a a literary Babe Ruth ... hit the ball where he set out to to hit it where he pointed and told the crowd or the picture that he was going to hit it\nAnd the book it it it never became a sort of a massive\nCultural trendy sensation\nBut it did endure you know it it was published in Nineteen thirty seven and then in ... through a World War three political revolutions through bad divorces new fashion styles massive technological disruption and so many other things that if\nIt was given a second edition ten years later so Nineteen forty seven or Nineteen forty eight it was published\nAnd then in two thousand eight it was published in its third edition\nAnd it's still reading today and and here I Am talking to to you guys about it and so it's a book that's outlived him and almost everything else published at that time it's earned the author a cult like following among fellow writers and creative\nAnd I think what's so impressive is that he\nSet out to achieve this thing and he and he did it he has another quip you said you know I like my my work to outlive a dog or a cat and it is interesting how how many books\nLive a dog or a cat and it is interesting how ... how many books and projects that creative kill themselves to make\nAnd how femoral most of them are\nJames solitaire is one of my favorite novelists I was reading one of his books not long ago and on the back which wouldn't it wouldn't have been written by him but it it described his novels is having a sort of him perishable freshness and I I just love that idea I I Love the idea of making something\nPerennial some thin him perishable something that stands the test of time\nAnd by my goodness when we're watching Shawshank Redemption on TV or the godfather for Ninety it's time we know we're watching perennials right and they give us more satisfaction that so much of the new stuff that we know who's going to be old stuff really fast\nHere's Ryan sharing some stories from his own background that prompted them to create books and other work the stands the test of time\nI've always had this lifelong fascination with things that were old when I was a teenager everything I liked was all my favorite bands and release their albums decades before I was born um they were still going strong by the time I came around I I remember picking up the great Gatsby in high school and thinking\nHow incredible it is that this book that was written to be a critique of the Jazz Age right it was a timely periodical\nCould've in Jordan and somehow been so so timeless and and true even to a a random high school or in California you know sixty plus years later and\nMy first job as a writer I was a research assistant to an author named Robert Green wrote a book called the forty eight laws of power this was a book that didn't hit the best seller lists until a decade after it had come out and and yet quietly and slowly it sold\nMore than a million copies and been translated into dozens of languages I I Would guess that in a a hundred years from now people would still be reading it\nUm another book that I worked on you know got a Seventy five hundred dollar advance which is tiny advances what they call a kiss off advance in the industry meaning that the the lowest amount of money they can give you without hurting their feelings and they hope you'll go away\nAnd that book went on a cell over a million and a half copies and and you know now ten years after its release it sells about\nThree hundred copies a week and I\nI went on as a marketer became the director of marketing and American Apparel and it was interesting that that this company which of hundreds of millions of garment\nEvery year the best selling items worthy items created at the beginning of the company's trajectory it was\n... and and they had this mission of making making things that would be sold in Vinton shops in the future and I I just love this idea\nOf making things that can laugh with with my own books you know perhaps the readers haven't haven't heard of me or they certainly wouldn't have seen me on the New York times best seller lists are for the most part\nAnd yet quietly and and like clockwork they sell about five thousand copies across the various titles that every single week and the marketing for them has long since\nFinished and yet you know surprise uh one of my books did appear on a best seller list last week\nA year after it had come out and so it's this idea of making things that resonate with people that really solve some problems for them you know the the best books to have written as a creative would have been what to expect when you're expecting because every day\nAnd every part of the world\nOr a couple of gets pregnant and they don't know what to do and so I'm I'm fascinated by that kind of work the ... the work that indoors and it saddens me that so much work that is made doesn't indoor and so I was fascinated by this question of sort of what similarities\nTo these works have in common and I set out I interviewed a all sorts of of authors and editors and\nProducers and a marketers and entrepreneur is and and I tried to get to the bottom of what makes things a laugh then I you know I found a few things I think first does that work needs to be unique if it very hard for it to endure if it is not\nDefinitive if it if it doesn't stand out stand alone and yet on the other hand\nIt should do a very simple job within one on one of my editors said to me one time she said Ryan it's not what a book is\nIt's what a book does and by that she meant it has to do something for the leaders not necessarily about what it does for the creator it's about what it does so what to expect when you're expecting it it helps you with this difficult time in your life\nAnd and I think that's what the best the best work does you know it's this this question this is a blank\nThat does planned for black if you can't fill those in as a creator\nYou're going to have a lot of trouble I I was interested in the test that max Martin one of the greatest songwriters certainly the most prolific and popular signers of all time it's written for everyone from Celine Dion to the back street boys to Bon Jovi Taylor Swift and\nHis subjects his music to what he calls the car test to get in his car in Los Angeles\nAnd I put the top down he puts it on the stereo and he drives up and down the Pacific coast highway is the music\nAdding to that experience that the idea that even music is designed to really do something for the audience is something I think that people ness and and so that that's an essential part of this sort of creative process\nAnd when we come back more from Ryan Holiday on his book the perennial seller and my goodness what a fascinating question what makes things last not just our products maybe even a marriage\nYou hear a lot about Hillsdale College here on our American stories it's a special place were students study all the things that matter in life\nAll the things that are beautiful in life and I know I teach there every year for a couple of weeks\nAnd then we have some in Hillsdale fine is coming here and tell their own stories and produce stories and I can

they'll [noise]\nEnded up telling a lot of creative there's no magical from that you can hire there's no magical button you can press there's no magical\nMedia outlet even being on this wonderful show isn't going to guarantee that my book parental seller is going to find all the people who are interested in finding it and so if you're not going to do it who will\nPeter drunk or the management expert who said that each project need someone who says I'm going to make this succeed and then goes to work and does it that that has to be you\nKnow so I push create is to think of marketing not even as an obligation but as a a central part of the creative process can you be as creative\nIn your media appearances and your marketing in your ways of getting customers as you were in writing every page or you know developing the\nUh the vintage of wine that you're you're selling or the the boots that you wanted to produce right how can that be as much of a of a canvas to paint on to make something special as\nAs the than you you made itself and\nA lot of creative fail at this I mean the the the shelves grown with and watched movies and on read books and\nYou know our phones are filled with downloaded music and hard cast that will never get around to see him in so that urgency that sense of I've got to make people care about this is really the essential task of the writer or the creative of any kind you know if you build it\nThey will not come that is not how it works you have to make them you have to invite them one by one and until the crowd is full until the the seats are filled and that's why you did this work in the\nFirst place right certainly no one slaves away on some creative artistic project purely for their own satisfaction or otherwise why would they have ever released it in the first place and so\nThat idea of of taking ownership of of it is the difference I think between something that sells five copies and something that's almost five million copies and I think every artist would rather whether they admit it or not reach five million people than five\nAnd there you have it Ryan Holiday his new book perennial seller centrally answering the question what makes things less\nFrom products or\nTo marriage or anything else you care about in your wife [noise]\nAnd by the way I Love the line not important what a book is about\nTo support it's important
