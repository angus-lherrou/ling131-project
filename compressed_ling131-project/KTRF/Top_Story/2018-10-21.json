days a week to inform you for the very best to sports proud to have a beer the one and only Brian oh be quiet\nDoing great Andy ferman I'm I'm very fiery today because I was watching the lake show last night just all of a sudden fight night broke out over there at staples between the lake\nJust all of a sudden fight night broke out over there at staples between the Lakers and the rockets you see that with Ron do and\nHe and Chris Paul ... he has very soft fight the fresh face yeah you know that's I think my favorite of yours\nSee your face to face I could see a guy's\nGiving an elbow shoving maybe even sub or even the guy basketball\nBut to me when you spit and the guy's face on the street on a gay during the game but on a subway or whatever it may be that is the lowest form of life you could ever do this written the guy's face that he lied said he didn't do a book Chris Paul was wiping the spin off his face if they try to punch them back\nIt was yeah I I couldn't believe it or being in your face you go\nSomeone spits in your face [noise] it's a it's an invitation to catch hands like that's the way it is and also when Chris Paul when you put a finger your face that that's when you get blessed with the hands as well so I can understand why\nBoth uh players were picked up the one thing I don't understand is why Brandon Ingram pushed James Harden and the first place I don't understand that was a complete overreaction\nBut yeah you can be frustrated but you don't go like shoving people and get tossed in the process so it was just melt down by Brandon Ingram well\nThe good news is I mean if people are LeBron haters out there and there are plenty of those uh this takes away from the old one to record the Lakers have at this point in time because they're talking about the fight and the occasion rather than the fact that the Lakers are all went to right the right as it goes so lucky for LeBron in a sense\nWell a little bit yeah but it it's going to take a little while to jail and Andy trust me I don't want to do a whole thing on the Amy Schumer deal and the ... stuff and all that but I just want to say this 'cause Sammy K brought this up in Bronx talk\nAt all I Want to say this when she's basically saying white players need Neal or they're complicit and blah blah blah\nIt's like dude I we really this stupid because ... your point is until you Neil you're not supporting the goal right or you just ... right now but I don't really think about that Andy like how many black players in the NFL\nHave not taken a neat does that mean that they're against being treated better in this country of\nSo why does not want to Ask Amy Schumer that question say any you know if they're not nearly does that mean they're not supportive I may ask age some investigative report or someone on my on those news talk entertainment shows entertainment tonight ask her that question instead of the gods ... question asked that question and see what she has\nTo say and you know if you don't show that it's summertime lately that I could care less\nI yeah ... it's a dodge and idiotic take where it's like a less you Neal you are not supporting the end of racial injustice really right I don't see the logic in that maybe that completely wrong maybe that's what it is\nWell I'll tell you I Am supporting my guy Jim Harbach I liked him how he got a lot of heat and all of a sudden he needed when yesterday against Michigan stay here to the game yesterday against Michigan State or the record of one in five as MSU and Ohio State now all the world rings have to do is be Penn State and two weeks\nAnd then November twenty fourth play Ohio State so you know what this opening day last Notre Dame looks better every single week there's no today is undefeated\nAnd Jim harbor right now late it on Michigan State yesterday twenty wants to seven I'm happy to hear by the way it wasn't a game with a lot of points but it felt like Michigan was in control most of the way this is what it sounded like well Michigan jumped ahead in the third quarter to take a listen\nPatterson football factory pro were thrown throwing be found the right\nSide\n\nHave you on that seven and one will hit a hard time saying Michigan\nWas a touchdown man who wrote it sounded like [laughter] I'm by the way though Andy how about this in terms of total yard itch\nMichigan gave up Ninety four yards\nTo Michigan State Ninety four yard that that is great the fence and Michigan state's off and you gain Ninety four yards you could literally gain that in one derive gain that for the game that's a beat down right there man well\nThis is not a good Michigan State team I Know that held the night before us but also in Michigan State did not have a convert any of the twelve third downs they had all day yesterday this is not a good Michigan State team and I I tell you what I'm losing any sleep over it because I think what happened last year with what happened with those players that amazes me that marked Antonio is still there as\nCoach didn't they get rid of the president the president's gone the athletic director is gone but he remains that\nTo me is amazing but that's a story for another day\nYeah yeah it is I just want to hear that final call again Andy from and listen to me again with the wind [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] it it doesn't sound as bad when you isolated it's just when you hear the whole call\nBut I'll say that Sandy I don't want to overreact to the other way when it comes to a gym Harbaugh\nAnd what you mean by that is sometimes our opinions are more of a reaction than an opinion because Jim ... has been getting crushed\nFor losing too many games based on what his contract he earns all of these things\nHe just hasn't had the success there at at Michigan he hasn't fared well against Ohio State we know that he's had a couple of big losses skins Michigan State yadda yadda so I don't want to then all of a sudden with Jim Harbaugh rattling off seven straight wins and writing the ship I don't want to make it sound like\nA like a gym but this is what Jim Harbaugh was paid to do he's supposed to take down teams like Michigan State so I don't think that we should go above and beyond that just because some of the critics have gone above and beyond nailing him when they have an ... do well you know what I'm saying\nYou said something very interesting because I pick up on every word you say because it's worth listening to that is by God gave me two years in one mouth because I listen you said that he's getting a lot of heat yes he is because of the money he's been paid in the contract he has\nI agreed to some extent but are you telling me that if he got paid less money or some other schmuck was coaching Michigan not well not a big name my car by making less money will not get that heat I disagree I think\nMichigan has that history of football and they're supposed to be Michigan State which is an arch rival of theirs\nSo it doesn't make a difference how much money he's making maybe the more money well if you make a lot more ... look look at the we talked about that with the grueling situation ... absolutely right I mean but he's not getting the heat that heart bars getting because he hasn't been there is all I I don't know the\n... you think that Steve Wilkes with the Arizona Cardinals is getting the same amount of heat is John ...\nNo ... such a bad team you know going in there will be a bad\nTeam to Arizona has a worst record already there one in six words NFL ... okay how about the forty niners cows Shanahan getting a ton of heat right now I Know that Jimmy ... down to pass the test because if they get a pass you know as well as I Do the main\nLadies we need to

I mean I'm not going to say he's an upper echelon wide receiver but he's at least capable\nRight he's at least capable of making some noise on any given Sunday so I think it's more than just Cam Newton in Christian McCaffrey granted those guys are the bulk of the ... I don't think it's the entire often but you go against the number two rushing defense in football that's what's Philly has they give up about eighty or per game\nSo if they're able to slow down to Carolina off and that average is five yards perk Harry and put it all in the hands of Cam Newton that's going to be tough if you make any off one dimensional with the Phillies pass rush\nAnd that theme is throwing the ball and that's the only way they can gain yards man that's a tough tough team to beat and the eagles have one third in the past Fifteen at home as well\nYou know and me I I look at this game I I think the over under was like forty four forty five points I don't think they're going to score the others could be a low scoring game for some reason maybe I just with the defense on the on the Russian side of the ball with Philadelphia and maybe weather conditions which I don't know right now but I Know in the east coast is kind of dance\nAnd it could be wet so I I think they're not going to pass the ball as much as they would so I I don't think that over on the line I think it's going to be way under that I really do I think it'd be a low scoring game\nYou might be right might be it's tricky when you get forty five you start thinking about it it's a twenty four Twenty one ball game you know right that's not high scoring so in today's NFL if you're trying to get under forty five you don't have to have a team scores you know like thirty eight points to have a chance\nForty five is relatively right in the middle in terms of an NFL total so we'll see that Philly off and they looked a lot better last week against the giants and again\nIt was the giants so I Want to see what they do against the Carolina Panthers today because that Carolina Panthers defense they can make you one dimensional as well when they slow down you're running game\nSo we'll see if Carson when who seems to be regaining his his form from last year if he keeps going in that direction that not an easy often to slow down either even though it's musical running backs at this point\nI'm going to quote the great Brian no because I remember a lot of the things to say most of the things they do say this is a tremendous gain more so for the eagles and the Panthers should they lose today they've got to do what you will always tell me a lot of teams do they get real tight yeah real type because there'll be three and four and then they'll be looking like they have to when they have\nTo win and and an end to the press will be on building the pressure that they receive from the media will be unbelievable that you'd be right that they may not be headed back to the playoffs as a Super Bowl returning team that you know they'll just be out of it now next week they go to London of all places like jak civil dental by\nAnd then it doesn't get an easy because he got Dallas New York then they've got a little bit of a respite with the giants again so this is a tremendous game for them but really is more so the Carolina they lose today\nThey may have to pack it in I hate to say that and you'll be right they lose today I think it's over\nBut you're right it's a big time game because that's a tough schedule and that was one of the main reasons where I said I don't see in them being a playoff team because they're the team everybody's gunning for as the defending champ\nI just I don't know I I really [laughter]\nYeah well you might not have to trust them that could be the good news is the Detroit running defense is so bad you might get a heavy dose of Frank Gore and Kenyans rate today and take a lot of that pressure off of all the O's plate you know\nSo I I agree with you I think that the lions probably come in after a by I think they probably get a road when I I don't love it I Love the over more than anything more than picking the game I think there's going to be a lot of points scored today I Would take the ...\nFor more than anything more than picking the game I think there's going to be a lot of points scored today I Would take the over forty six and a half I Love taking the over\nIn these games and the heat Andy because you just the defenses will we look at the bears when they're trying to tackle Elvis Wilson last week\nSo amazing and you saw the Kenyan Drake fumble at the goal line that the bears recovered a team Hicks on the sideline big defensive lineman he would doubled over he's just like like suck you in a win meant it is so slow\nThat again\nThat was the key mixed on the sideline it's hard to play good defense in heat like that so I Would take the over in this one more\nThan anyone he mentioned that because we first start discussing this game you talked about maybe Detroit going from a dome it to the elements of people assume elements his reign when snow or whatever it may be heat but remember also and I got to believe that players of players and like Miami has to handle those elements to even though they are the whole\nTeam they have to play in the heat I mean ... there's going to be easier for them because they're they're bit defensive lineman after playing that as well so we'll see if they will [noise] right\nYeah there are a little bit more used to it obviously there are a lot more used to it but that doesn't mean it's easy so even if you're used to it it's it's not a walk in the park so yeah that Detroit often and especially you think about this past rushing if it's passed\nHeavy and you're having great success and you're able to keep Matthew Stafford clean and it's tough to to not will if you're constantly trying to rush the pastor or play pass the fence what have you ... it's just really tough to play good defense and the heat\nBrian no Andy firmly colas Fox football Sunday or by the way for free
