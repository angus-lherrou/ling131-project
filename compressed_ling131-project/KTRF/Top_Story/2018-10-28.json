L. O. B. how're you\nDoing great Andy ferman always a pleasure to be with you here every Sunday you know that you're intros have been just wild today you renamed the show Fox Sports Saturday and Sunday well we didn't look curse our yet you introduce yourself\nFox Sports Saturday and Sunday and the first hour yet you introduce yourself I don't know what happened there and the third person there's like a three man show we're doing it three men we've here apparently I\nWas good I had a question for you though\nAs an option for you after that\nThe guy with President Trump criticizing the move by Dave Roberts to go to the bullpen rich still had a one hit or did you have an issue with that\nAnd the way I did I mean the guy was rolling along on or was he had like a one hit are going on there I mean why why would you make that change I mean you know we are so I mean manages right now in baseball so\nI in tune of getting to that reliever and then I didn't get into that closing them out of what may happen I mean maybe he'll learn maybe people will learn right now you can get your rear end burnt you know if things are going well sometimes go you've got to go with the gut rather than a goat stats\nYou can get your rump see it as we run the fields of a Bronx talk radio over the you know here's the thing Andy is what I always say if you aren't first guest thing I don't want to hear the second guesses so to be fair maybe President Trump\nAnd some of the people that are highly critical of they've Roberts going to the bullpen when rich hill got hold in that moment maybe they are like what is he still in\nBoise pulling the guy that's got a one hit or if you're saying that before you have access to the result okay I'll listen to you after you have access to the result right in rye imagined doesn't get it done can ... get it done so forth and so on what that bullpen right\nSetting they're like All right makes then no big deal one Harry look good but bullpen for nothing lead they should be good they should be fine and then you circle back and you're like\nWhat was the kid if you want to be a ... at the time I don't want to hear it afterward\nAnd there's no again that could be second guess more than the game of baseball and you know as far as President Trump is concerned he may have gone after they've Robin because maybe they've Roberts is a Democrat\nI don't know I don't know why I wanted to have Robert you just they don't go with him you really don't\nBut I'm hardcore baseball fan you know ... words fan\nWho knows what he is I don't know but I Will ask you this you do that radio show on a daily basis and then one of the city of Portland, Oregon\nI have to know this how much World Series talk what's on your show this week just out of curiosity you're in a non major league baseball market it right World Series at one point in time but was V. event V. event\nUh right now no one's talking about it not many people are even watching it\nWell not a lot and we weren't talking about it a ton but I think that also has to do with how the game's played out at that point it was eight to nothing a Red Sox lead in the series you know\nAnd it wasn't like games one and two there wasn't anything that was huge you know\nThere was a huge story line where like I got to weigh in on this it was one of these where okay why didn't they start their left handed guys why was there no Jack Peterson ... next month the who hit the walk off Homer in game three right there was no Cody Ballenger like that's\nThat's not a huge topic at all so it didn't have a whole lot of legs it didn't have a whole lot of traction now these last couple of games without what happened with Dave Roberts last night the marathon Eighteen inning game there are some layers with that that can be around for sure\nYeah and it was funny because the Eighteen again I'm not so certain how many people even stay up to three am eastern time to watch it but you make a great point is a great talking point because people will go the office the next day and say did you watch it and it's a ... did you see that you know what happens\nThings like that so yeah I I just think right now that baseball is just sort of a flux if you will as a downhill spiral and I don't know what they're going to do it I don't want to talk about it because I Want to talk about college football and what happened yesterday and I ask you right now let's give the first four teams right now and and the AP rankings perhaps this week I'm going to go with Alabama Clemson for one to\nArrive number three I got to go with the undefeated Irish\nAnd then another throwing the Ohio State even though they lost last while ya know LSU and what are you going to put in their\nOhio State Ohio state's eleven NBA people right now you got to know what got them in the way it's going to it's going to jump around I just don't do you do rise by ... by ten points at but what do you do\nNot agreeing conference by conference I mean you look at Oklahoma they've got a week's schedule they really do do a pack twelve I'm not going to go any body that impact well Washington state who do they do they play so what do you do tell Mandy\nYou've got three teams he's Alabama ... well a a head of Ohio State right here right now you'd have to go with LSU looking when Alice you've done they smacked around number two at the time Georgia\nThey smacked around they went on the road and beat Auburn and I know Auburn isn't ranked anymore but written statement when you beat a team that's highly ranked\nYou can't circle back and be like wow I mean look at their the ranking now where they're really low you're you're right about that time you're right it's like it mattered it's hard to remain highly ranked if you'll lose the game or a couple of them you know it's impossible almost\nAt Michigan certainly is more worthy than Ohio State at this point they're only lost his at number three at the time being right now Notre Dame you compare that to Ohio State losing on the road to Purdue it's apples and oranges\nThat was a terrible loss royals there but you know what though is going to be really interesting and ah it'll play out because the end of November\nMichigan will play Ohio State we'll see what happens there with the Big Ten and it was it a win that so it's kind of wide open but you still have some dominant teams and like the three dominant teams in my heart of hearts or Alabama ... I got a flu Notre Dame in there I really do that the dominant right now during the ...\nYeah I mean what you do not put it on the team in there they would be in right now I just can't go with dominant when you're struggling and barely beat Ball State Vanderbilt\nA hit you know these teams playing top and\nThat in his second game of the year for Ball State that's they're Super Bowl you know right\nAnd then then they've got role but I think that only goes so far if you're truly a dominant theme even though these lesser teams get up to play you you still should win comfortably and they have it so I Can't go with them as dominant but yeah they would be one of the playoffs teams right here right now there's no doubt about it\nAll right well we move on but it's not going to leave that to arrest him over to the national football league the jets the bears the jet stream for the bears the three three my line Chicago given up seven and a half seven and a half points to adjust to that what do you got eight\n[noise] why do we mean handy to see why I don't get it every week it's called the Internet you was it was it the minus nine and a half that to point unacceptable\nAlright well why am I getting this seven and a half then I and I don't know I don't know if you don't know\nWhere are you at what do you want to reveal the site of choice that you know what goes on and one of them out the site than okay [laughter]\nAnd the biggest challenge I guess right now is going to be for the jets rookie quarterback Sam Donaldson according to new media reports\nEver providing and then the three sources for prevention treatments and recovery [noise]\nWe're working hard every single day to reduce the secrecy and remove the shame of addiction\nSigmund shattered live rise up against addiction so not in life and lost to the to the children to shatter proof movement get involved today and learn more at ... dot org slash race\nThat chatter ... dot org slash rise\nHorse right now [laughter]\nGo back\nAnd let your colors cry\nBombing Iraq [noise]\nSlave labor I'm telling you buy bold predictions for college football this year I had all the action may scream [noise]\nIf your fees are covered right here on Fox Sports\n... or so with Fox NFL kickoff joined several ... of top opinion makers as they provide unique perspective an expert analysis we sent our last day at ... am eastern on Fox Fox Sports [noise]\n\n\nAgain America will take a peek at just about ... minutes when he passed the hours this is Fox will fill Sundays Brian oh I'm Andy for a minute by the way we're probably brought you buy guy going I got some\nGreat news is a quick way you could save money switch the guy go go to a guy go dot com and Fifteen minutes you could say fifty percent or more on your car insurance now Mr no I got the updated lines okay I really do I hope so I've heard before\nOkay let's do this with the sea hawks at the lions both teams are three and three she looks lost to the ribs us it was a good game thirty three thirty one lions beat you adopt as thirty to thirty one and as far as I'm concerned the line I'm looking at right now [noise] Detroit given up three to Seattle\nYes wow Andy holy cow yes but do you mean what do you mean that is correct I'm Glad that the scores are up to date as well because you're worrying me with the point spread the or at least you have the scores of the games correct\nYou know they don't go there as well look I let me just clear my main here if I may number one I Am not I'll be quiet on I Am not a gambler I\nKnow I read these lines okay yeah I have no idea that I look I understand it's a public service that most people will watch games put little shuttle to on the games I've done that at times okay but the people who lives in a week or ... the public service of giving them the line on these games at all be someone informed of what's going on\nYet I had no idea that these lines would move so much from last night 'til this morning oh I don't the Andean\nGood game day of course they didn't move on\nYeah I I ... I mean this is ... what do you see going down in this game because you look at too good running attacks surprisingly with the sea hawks who couldn't ball hardly at all now all of a sudden they cranked up that running game was Chris Carson and you look you carry on Johnson that young rookie\nFor the lion's who's had a really strong season to get too good running games\nYou've got kj right coming back for Seattle which is big you get tied into addiction back as well\nSo that helps you get Seattle coming off of a by week but Seattle's him play good pass the fence and you don't have a real Thomas back there so this is talk of bandits it's just they literally Vegas has it adds typically the home team gets three point that's exactly where the line is there like hey that you call it what do you so you know\nI I Would say that is the CEO of probably run the football more than any team the league and they could have a big big us that poor lines decent we both agree on that however I Would say there's the lions have more of a balanced office I think that Seattle does and they can Al Gore Seattle's attack and I think that Seattle\nCould create turnovers\nBut I don't see it happening I don't see I I like the lions doing this game I really do not by much but I like the lines to invade but three or four\nYeah well you get snacks Harris over their Damon Harris than coming over from the giants in a trade that should help out\nThe lions horrible rush defense or they've been giving up an NFL high five point three yards per carry this season thinking about that Andy ... three yards per carry that's crazy I tell you this ...\nThis is a spot for the lion's because they've got a much better shot in near division than the Seahawks do when there's with the Rand looking up the rams that's completely out of sight but right look at the rest of the NFC North from the lions point of view if you put together a good performance and beat a Seattle team\nWhich isn't close to what they once were and they are totally ... if you win the game\nAll of a sudden you're born three got a winning record\nIn this game all of a sudden you're foreign three got a winning record\nAnd you're at least neck and neck with other teams in the division the Packers could easily lose today at the rams the Vikings could lose at home on Sunday night to the same you know you can be right there in the thick of things if you win a home game against Seattle and it worries me because it would be\nA complete lions thing to do which just had not show up and lose the game at home after a nice performance last week against the dolphin\nRight and Seattle's got it on the football that's basically all they do because why they run the football because I think they're passing attacked a somewhat weak I really believe that so I'm just one dimensional last science and if they could run I think they can\nRun against alliance and gain some ground heat up some ... run the clocks they've got a shot I don't see it happening even though the Detroit Lions as susceptible to giving up a lot of yards I don't see it happening I think Detroit was this game\n[noise] yeah [laughter]\nIt's rough man I Would go the other way it's not a strong disagreement by me Andy\n'cause I like the lions it's just one of these it's a classic spot for the lion's to pull the lions you know yeah ed at NYU and you don't have a great rush defense in Seattle can be multi dimensional offensively I I don't love they're passing game nearly as much as the lions\nBut I Do love Russell Wilson I think he's dynamic he's completely capable of at least\nPassing for a decent amount of yard edge making some big plays you know it's not like jak Prescott before you got to mark Cooper in that passing often it's better than that and I just look for the alliance did they shoot themselves in the foot somehow some way do they do that today\nAnd I think there's a decent chance after\nChance and speaking of people shooting themselves in the foot I mean look at the Cincinnati Bengals I took them for a second because I keep on going back to what ... told us several weeks ago don't fall in love with this team they're hosting the Tampa Bay bucks Tampa Bay street free bagels a foreign three but more than that\nThey've lost two straight and everybody was talking of Cincinnati Super Bowl Super Bowl that foreign three right now where they really\nOh they ... they made that they want to pay a little over there but they they just want to go to the play offs to hell with the ... really but the point there's just so hungry for a winner and\nA team started off so good and now they dropped to this is one of those watershed games because it's going to be if they lose this game the players are going to be a rough road to hoe if they learned today\nAnd they're expected to win but these teams look of themselves in the mirror and almost the same tremendous officers on both teams\nAnd what happened last week I don't know what happened to the Bengals office but they've got demolished in Kansas City forty five to ten bucks beat the browns and over time so that was kind of a you know lock the fate of twenty six twenty three but to me Jim is Winston led the bugs and rushing last week and I see him running roughshod over the Bengals defense today\nI yeah you've got a lot of injuries on both sides defensively where you look at Tempe and they lost their middle linebacker Kwame Alexander who is a good player might not have Gerald McCoy today which is a big setback their secondary the Tampa Bay secondaries incredibly banged up so I\nThink since he's going to get back on track\nOffensively today\nI think you're going to have a big game from the bangles\nAnd yeah could Tampa score a lot of points to make it a close game being contention to win it yeah absolutely because the bagels are banged up defensively as well but I just the Cincinnati rebounding at home\nI just don't trust Tampa at all and what their rash of injuries I'm just going with the home team on this one if you think about the home team typically getting three points\nIf their favorite by four you're basically saying ... one point favorite at home if you look at it that way I'm guilty must have within the as a one point favorite at home I ... I Do\nI Do too and and I my line has a bank fails given up three and a half to Tampa Bay today\nThe I've got it at four but again pointing to have no biggie no big deal right\nThank you thank you very much and look the Tampa Bay defense is is close to the bottom of the league so I think that they can roll with their with their receive is AJ green and Tyler boy but you know you don't know I'm Jim is with is filling up a lot of passes and a leading up a lot of yours\nAnd again I mean you talk about it it's not excused because as part of the game as part of football injuries and that thing goes defense has really been banged up and I don't see them really doing much defensively so we'll see what happens it could be a high scoring game I see I didn't like the Bengals I think that they must have more weapons on all things I really do\nYeah I Do too I uh I\nAnd that game was ugly they lost thirty three Eighteen they've been pretty darn close I'm taking the giants to beat the Redskins today in the game in New Jersey I like the giants today although I'm Still thinking it's time to move on from Eli Manning but the point is this who do you move to that's the question\nRight yeah you just don't have that that are up and coming quarterback that ... I ... you know fourth round pick he hasn't been an act he hasn't been active [laughter]\nYou know fourth round pick has been an act he has been active for a lot of games a year\nOr so yeah it's going to be Eli by process of elimination\nBut you might be right on this pick ... that man that just read it just seems like such a sucker line doesn't it or they get like wouldn't Vegas put their arm around you and they're like hey buddy hey would you like some spending cashier how about the Redskins huh\nOnly a point and a half they were to get the job you know how bad the giants have better diets goodbye Adelson\nIs just the start trying to do you a favor with the line that's where I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa I Know Vegas doesn't do favors and with the wind is low for the red skins who are clearly the better team I got big time questions here\nI'm with you right there and say what you look at the rich because you don't know what team what shows up first of all the pretty darn good at home but this was in a way game but you lose it the Indianapolis early in the season and then you'd be Green Bay the following week you just don't know what team shows up that's the problem with this Redskins team\nYeah and they haven't scored a touchdown in the third quarter\nFor eleven straight games isn't it amazing ... straight we know that the third quarter is typically the lowest scoring quarter\nBut eleven straight games not one touchdown think about all the drive all the flu the things that could happen in a special teams ... nothing no touchdowns it's amazing to me\nBut they're gonna have to\nFigure it out and be consistent on a week to week basis because they've had a couple of nights performances\nThey held Christian McCaffrey ... Elliott two combined fifty four yards rushing the last two weeks it's really good so they should be tough to get sick one Barclay and if you make them one dimensional and Eli Manning is under Senate you've got a great chance but this does seem like a sucker bat I wouldn't bet it is\nBut if I had to choose I Would still go with Washington to win the game\nAnd I ... I guarantee you one thing I bet you that this game will not be included and you'll be three on those picks\nI Know it just reeks it just reeks of a truck or bad and I just I cannot in good faith go with the G ... yeah I just can't do it can't be one of my three picks I could go with something else that's much better I didn't think it would be\nTrying a different way of life with a guy called Fox Sports radio studios but there's never a line on this game but it's the best of the day to find a barrel betting just freaking next [noise] around\nThe red Sox won gave away from another championship time to panic Dodger fan do you go to blame this one I Andrew Freedman analytics when it comes to the world series\nWe've got a chart on Fox Sports radio\nAll the different that's when the Michelin Man is on your side helping you see veterans Dr Saper Michelin premium white ... designed with exclusive smart likes to ... or ...
