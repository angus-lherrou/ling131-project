I was doing the show with\nThe firm salaam last night during the game and I did that numerous times so did I think we're approaching the time where people start freaking out about potential college football playoff scenarios you know where it's\nLike is might seem going to be on the outside looking in and what what is is that if they get home there's been this has got to be a Trojan\nLike settled down man he said he hadn't even had a committee pool we haven't had the committee poll remain out\nYet you know and I didn't realize that people are freaking out about potential scenario here relax\nHave a pop tarts take a breath really right\nYeah it's easy but no today will be there\nWhen all is said and done they will be there and I love that because I think it's good for football the the Irish or their idea like that I think why they're there may be on crazy but you know that the Yankees are good for baseball when they when I think the Green Bay Packers are good for football when they went and I think Notre Dame is good for college football when they when I was that\nYeah I mean a lot of people would agree with that it's definitely a theme that people have a strong opinion about either love them or you hate their guts and you'd think their fan base is largely largely pretentious and there's\nThere's a lot of truth to that there's a ... day and you're right I get that but yeah that's good when you have that divisive type team man the sport always wins out and so yeah it'd be great for college football if they're there but you know we'll see how the rest of it shakes out when you look at the top\nOf the standings here when you look at the rankings Andy\nA couple of teams dropped LSU loses the Florida\nOklahoma goes down to Texas Auburn got smacked around by Mississippi State so that's number five number seven all drop yeah his top ten is going to look a lot different heading into next week\nAnd no doubt about it and that's good that's great because it creates a lot of fight a lot of conversation and you know the gays probably meanwhile they really do you still looking at the top but not the top of the NFC North is that upside down I got to turn it upside the Chicago Bears on job attack us to one in one they've traveled to Detroit\nLions I mean rarely a truly what's what's going on with the bears on a ... I mean are you kidding me I mean come on what what\nWhat's happening look he has this one aberration game against they really horrible and bang the\nBuccaneers defense Chris Conti was hurt\nRemember the guy who got trucked by Vance McDonald remembering when it was this is the Monday Night game when the Steelers and the buccaneers and Vance McDonald the tide in\nGave that stiff farm from hell to Chris Conti will Chris Conti is on IRR yet Vernon hard graves is on IRR so they've got a banged up in a bad defense their defense has gotten shredded steadily\nAnd Mitch ... he has a good game at all I've been\nHearing is oh look at MIT strip is gated well look at the if the rules in the deep but ... it's like he had won an aberration game look at the bears week by week here's what they've scored twenty three twenty four sixteen\nForty eight do you not see something that stands out among all the other game that spike is not normal really no not at all so Mitch ... performance is being grossly blown out of proportion but then I kind of put a kind of a little cold\nWater on you for a second if I may may I Do that when he got hit because when you talk like this about you know everything's out of control and you're right you know I'm not going to argue with that it reminds me of like the uh the Phillies Seventy sixer fan boys remember when they said they were going to win at all in the play offs but the Seventy Sixers are but I had\nTo give these fans are I mean that's what they live for that's what they live that's where the law and there's all of that really made you an eye out to be the voice of the common sense than\nIf I knew some of these people are out of control I get that but let them live let them have some fun\nNo no I was well within logic I Will not stand for fun like I'm all for fun Andy you just can't be unreasonable\nThere's a lot of will get into it a little bit later but this Baker Mayfield auditor love fast you got the ravens defensive coordinator Don Martin Dale talking about he's going to be a\nLike a bread Barbara John Elway and it's like he's just as bad as if he had four turnovers against the raiders and we're talking about Brett Farr or John Elway\nWhat I settle it down years so that's the thing you can be a fan you can get ... you can be optimistic but as soon as you get on reasonable that's where it's like being a fan isn't a good enough excuse to beat dumb he says you're not\nYou're talking about a coach and then I'm Talking about the media when shame Darnell came to New York they went crazy with him what happened to him now he's yesterday's news no one told us about Sam Donald anymore he's not the savior for the jets at least this year maybe next year he will be not this year it's over\nWe had his day on opening day and that's the end of remember the back page of the tabloids going crazy there wasn't a statue for this guy but you know what the only statue that she'll be billed as for Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay and they're going to win today tactician I don't really that\nI Do not know that a beat Detroit today come alive you want to put some Scooby Snacks on this one yeah\nYeah I don't think the lions friendliest when one of those breakfast okay you you name it ... some of these problems out by a breakfast that's how you gonna buy me breakfast you sent me the Ohio used a semi to bill sent me the most jails and your check [laughter]\nOn control the machine\n[noise]\nAll right when it comes to safety nothing is more important than your vehicles break if it's hard to stop here squealing or grinding noises during ratings not by O'Reilly auto parts you'll find the ... from trusted brands like break best and worst mess let the everyday low prices play it safe with breaks from O'Reilly out of wires better ... better prices every day\nAll right I mean the\n... and I need to play the ... cat for a northwest Minnesota they will you know they kind of you with their hands in the mid forties would have to answer the first night with all kinds of conditions in that area than showers and Monday morning they ... they ... they don't have anything Shelley Shelly continuing ...\nI mean it would have to answer the last ... mostly credit conditions and on the table and cloudy with a ...\nWell how areas and shower shower with an Eighteen again\nShe didn't look out for a lot of the fire was mostly credit conditions in areas or shall we say twenty five miles per hour in fire Wednesday Willie Nelson\nConnie with the highest eighty degree as well how's that for ... hours and hours and then when they when they need to do twenty seven that kind of condition that area it's a challenge the freebie conditions and on top of each the highest ... any any the plane the Afghan whether I'll genealogist corny signing\nOn to give you information who are you and what are you doing to check the numbers for seven three sixty five were that trusted voice that make you smarter people quite sure if you've ever met when you're wrong so tell your friends why don't we listen to the right here ...\nFox sharks to think about that with added to\nFox is a new home Thursday Night Football this Thursday the rating Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles take on the line many New York giants\nThose giant Thursday on by\n\nSpeed habits\nWill explain that have just about a minute twenty fifty hour we call the Fox football Sunday he's Brian O'Dea do for a minute by the way I have this as a present for my part to Bryan\nBryan you could become a new card number and discover culpable match all

school based on and that Detroit Lions game just to let you yeah\nWell thanks man I appreciate that will celebrate all are you going to be today\nThanks I Know you've got a tweet as well I Love to hear it\nYes this is from grizzly chief here right then and said it's been raining all night here in Casey and looks like it will probably still be raining at game time might not be an offensive game for the jeep today that plus jak defense make me weary\nOf the chiefs wind today might be slapped best interesting there is some entail needs help from grizzly chief\nPsyche grizzly chief you put the paint done you know these guys go to those games with the war paint I mean again you see you get upset with the fans that go crazy that are over the top like your ... and ... and it's just luck than for the bears right and\nThat's fine I mean that's your project I get crazy when I see watching a game on TV and and the camera pans to a guy understands that we're in like a ... it's really I\nMean a a guy that we're not really I feel like the Halloween there'll be unbelievable in the state and I've always wondered when you're driving to a game that they were these costumes in their car driving to the game\nYou have you with that like the raiders fan that we're going to raise noxious outfits I Love that stuff you don't like that\nI cannot imagine driving my car to again getting ... going to a stop light turning to my right or to my left and seeing the guy in the car next to the Batman outfit I just don't understand I couldn't I couldn't picture that really I just could not All right I'm just saying\nYou know what I have an dressed up for a game\nBut I don't look down upon it I like it that's other people's deal at school with me I have a much less of a problem with people doing that than I Do like they're crazy opinion and now you're worth like ...\nAnd I am a insert team here they're or they're going to win at all and it's it's just ridiculous man I Know that that's why you and I are so well\nVersed because you know we kinda like rub shoulders into some sort of a way you know I might this damn paper to you I'm I'm the ... paper I Know I Am in a sense um rough around the edges\nYeah oh that's good man that's because not all bad oh I'm going to talk about\nThis team they got to win and they could have had a second when the one two and one that's the browser lost an overtime game to Oakland forty five forty two last week I had to make these even worse I don't know why they do with just get us all said there was a bad whistle which costs the browser full recovery you know and\nWhy why would you like pour salt on an open wound you lost a freaking game the coaches they're probably news updates\nPour salt on an open wound you lost the freaking game the coaches they're probably knew it was a bad call but the least got confirmed it like on Wednesday or Thursday to say oh my goodness what a punch in the guts if you remember the places like some six minutes and thirty nine seconds left the regulation Derek car the quarterback of the raiders lost control of the ball at the miles Garrett\nAnd you're not a very of the browns hit him in Oakland or look on the thirty eight yard line Garret recovered began running toward the end zone the referee won't do this instead of whistle blowing before the ... because cars Ford past\nHas a stopped the progress I understood role to play a shock and the rate is punted on the foot down that was the end of it and the NFL in ... in a review said it was a fumble why they do that\nYeah well I think a lot of it is due to gambling now how the rules have been relaxed significantly\nI understand it Andy with you it's like well you can't do anything about it now so what really that really do it's all about hey hey it's we're on the up and up\nWe just missed something no conspiracy going on here we're not doctoring the outcome of games and that's all it is and it's been a ramped up now that gambling is more prevalent so\nYou're going to have more of these situations and I think a lot of people they'll look at them be like the browns got hosts it actually didn't end up hosing the browns because the raiders punted\nThe brown scored a touchdown and actually shoot up a good minute and a half as it turns out that could have helped the raiders out so you have to look at what happened next when there was a bad call it clearly was a ... should have been ruled the fumble\nBut as things turned out the brown scored a touchdown any way on the ensuing drive so it's a complete wash\nIt's just that's why they come out and be like oh hey everything's cool but it the more the myth Mr NFL PA earlier this week he was pointing the finger at the NFL which I mean almost never happens Andy and he was like I don't know that they've done enough\nIn terms of all of these gambling situations where you have some owners that have\nA vested interest in whether it be like a fantasy sports and he's like how how is that exactly going to work and we haven't done a great job of making sure the game is here and I was like how exactly can you do that and what do you how do you do it how do you ...\nYou can't the only thing that you can do is if there is a brutal hall and people start calling for a conspiracy is to say no no we missed that are bad but we're not doctoring games here we're not in the business of going to federal prison if\nBy thing Baker Mayfield can win his first start or not you know it's crazy yeah\nI I kind of opened my eyes a little bit now I understand why the NFL is doing that is the gambling situation you're right I mean and if a person like myself was not a gambler per se and I and I'm not saying that you are but you're more averse to it that than I Am the most you someone invite you dabbling in a little bit and I really do much so\nI ... yeah yeah that's not that there really isn't about this ravens team I mean\nThere are surprised team did that three in one and getting not much respect and I tell you I said in the beginning of the segment that speed kills and the ravens habits they got to revamp line if they really do Michael Crabtree and wide receiver John Brown this guy could run\nThat speech just really need this team right now is a is a remake it really is and it's given new life to the quarterback and situation and Joe Flaco he's having a\nHeck of a year and it's because of those guys\nYeah and you know you look at all the three in one teams in football right now outside of the same in jaguars\nIt's like almost all of these teams are getting a lot of attention and you don't want to buy in your reluctant because right of recent lack of success dolphins ravens who were just talking about in this game bangles bears titans\nYeah all of those teams are getting overlooked and it's not because of this year\nIt's because of what's happened in the past but I see your point Andy what the ravens and what they're doing that only ... billion Joe Flaco has been playing better than he had before and the weapons are better there in terms of a wide receivers to throw to\nThat defense pretty good I like their defense over there and you get Jimmy Smith back healthy\nUh uh well off of the the suspension you get him back in that secondary\nSo it's going to be a big test for Baker Mayfield who could not have more rose petals being thrown at his feet right now it's getting kind of thing at this point the guy's twenty seventh and pass or rating\nI'm going to say right now if they lose today in Cincinnati all the air goes out of the bubble I was going to be a will always managed to use a fan saying the same old bangles yeah especially if they kick it away the same old bangles you know that's the way definitely fans are but you know really a truly you have to understand they used to that in Cincinnati there really are\nWhat was the big three weeks stretch for them because the bangles there at home against the dolphins today they're at home against the Steelers next week and then there at Kansas City so\nIt's the day there at home against the Steelers next week and then there at Kansas City so that this should be a win for the bangles and when you've got to dealers in case the coming up it needs to be a win today for the bangles\nAnd I hate to say this as a bagels than I Want you to do well they could have sat glued to the next three\nWell yeah I mean they could easily drop a game to the Steelers into the cheap saying right outside the realm of possibility that the dolphins beat the bangles today that the like the bangles or a juggernaut or anything like that\nBut yeah I think that there's probably a man is there a better chance that the bangles go she wouldn't want her one into over these next three cars assuming I win today you give him a win against the Steelers are Casey who say they drop both of those\nAnd you know what I hate to say this because I don't want to be on the fence I'm not that kind of a person but I really would rather shit ... bad okay\nI Would say they should go one or two but I'll tell you why should I I really would rather see\nHow that Roethlisberger place today ... is is he under down swing or she just had a couple of big games that's what I Want to see in Pittsburgh I just you know it's like you say you know people say they they they go on past results well you know what although the Steelers right now are hurting I still look at them as what they have gone\nAnd the bangles or three in one I think most people looked at what they have done that is why you're not buying it with the Bengals history of one or you're not going to buy that this deal is there a failure\nYes yeah and ... right yeah is that true well that's the way that you\nMake a lot of sense I'd love to go again I Do I'll go against your bottom barrel betting but there's a better chance that they go one into\n'em but you know it's one of those teams the bangles or one of those teams until they do what you can't quite by in there the reverse patriots you should be late to the party\nOf saying the bangles are going to do something significant you should just wait until they do you do it you should be late to the party of things the patriots the demise is here\nJust right wait for that to happen before you said because you've been proven wrong\nSeason after a season after season and this might be the latest installment\nBut are you ... over you adopt which I just want to hear it\nYes yes louder and louder and louder as\nAs much you can get Andy at this much man as you're going to get over here you know what but I Will check it out with this just to kind of truce it up a little\nBit yeah\nThere's still pride over your Andy ferment but noted yeah I Would push comes to shove I
