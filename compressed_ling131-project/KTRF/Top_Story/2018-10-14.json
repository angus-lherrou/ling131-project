S. U. how 'bout Edwards run wouldn't\nYou of liked to have been at a uh I don't know like a post games celebration with Edwards run that'd be great probably still making these places are celebrating [laughter] but how about that man he went from\nWe'll make it he's probably still celebrating\n[laughter] but how about that man he went from the hot seat\nTo man up completely secure with his job member that was the big talking point was Edwards Iran they didn't get on the fire this year and you fast forward they've got one last and they've been taking down some of the better teams in college football in terms of the rankings right and take them number to Georgia yesterday it was a great when\nThey slap them around pretty good thirty six sixteen and here's the question of the day because for top ... teams Georgia West Virginia Washington at Penn State all last you know today right number five\nThey escape by the chin each inch in there with a with a pitch a as Notre Dame Nineteen fourteen but here's the question when the rankings come out tomorrow I was still agree with you probably that Alabama will be number one I think Ohio State moves to number two what about three four five I'm going to do with clumps of Notre Dame and LSU\nA M well ... yeah I think Clemson followed by Notre Dame I think that's going to be the top four right what use that I think will be the case then yeah and I you probably have to have goodness you'd think LSU vaults that high asked\nThat question there was thirteenth going into the game is to going from Thirteen to five is a big jump so I I don't know if that could happen but twelve range of things have happened\nYeah and you look at it I mean gosh if you compare\nA schedule is if you compare LSU to UCS for instance people I bang on UCF because they should be banned gone [laughter] they just don't have a good body of work that that was the first thing they play that has a winning record this year was yesterday beating Memphis\nIs it one by one thirty one thirty right that this is what you got so should LSU be ranked ahead of UCF abs so Lou ... no doubt about it and then you look at these other teams that have lost\nWhen you talk about um let's see here West Virginia went down Washington goes down Penn State goes that do go six seven eight are down so essentially LSU would have to they're not going to vote over Michigan where parents are going to do that they could they could with Michigan beat down Wisconsin\nI could see that there are certainly going to jump Oklahoma who was off\nThey should you were talking to LSU they should jump Oklahoma they should jump UCF\nI should jump Texas they she survives at home against Baylor at LSU has a better better body of work right now than Texas does yeah yeah\nAnd I tell you what I I think it also goes now with the most recent gay but how you're trending and you look at Penn State that was right they they lost to straighten pillows two straight by giving it up I choking up in the fourth quarter and I think that they're going to be out of the top ten for sure Penn State\nOh yeah there's they have no say it'll be it'll be like Eighteen this week\nYeah it probably I I'll say a I'll give you the ... the lions seventeenth let's make it interesting Hugo Eighteen I go Seventeen\nHow about yourself and then he's going in Oregon with this week Oregon probably moved to like fourteenth\nMaybe or are they they go higher than that I think they sneak into a I think they're above the teens out that\nThink they'd get would lead twelfth\nYou don't want it it's getting very interesting the pictures getting a little clearer right now Michigan I think Michigan lose it to the top ten with that went over what's\nCalled ... with everybody always willing sure yeah\nSo Michigan's good I'm happy for Michigan right them at Michigan State or\nA big win over Penn State I mean I didn't expect that in Texas so Baylor but they struggled to beat Baylor so you know there's so many things going on a lot of these I hate to use the term moving parts but there are split it all works out at the end it all it all comes together but I tell you the biggest shock us they had to be LSU\nI mean LSU beating Georgia the way they did and Georgia made everybody was looking at Georgia now we know they're not for real it it's not the same team that was there last year over the national title their their their phone is their fates they're frauds that's what they are those are frauds\nCome on man they lost to a tough team on the road Baton Rouge Death Valley it's tough place to play and no I didn't think that they would lose by twenty points but you can't say that they're complete fraud that's a theme that legitimately made it to the national championship game\nAnd was a whisker away from winning it\nSo I don't think that there are complete fool's gold or anything like that I think that they have a really really tough road ahead of them and I don't expect them to run the table from here on out that's what it's going to take to get them into the play off\nI don't see them beating Florida at Kentucky Auburn S. E. C. championship game mostly are most likely against Alabama [laughter] I just don't see them running that table to get to the college football playoff well\nI'm Still behind my national defending national champion UCF because they were done their job even at the opposite say got a flag you did that for a leg or you just try to get a rise out of it I\nWas not one dollar route far but at the bottom of the hour they give you a little jab as well a little ... little ...\nOver the so called\nPaper champs UCF and they're terrible conference and their worst non conference schedule I I just have no love no love for it's not personal with UCF it's any team who trumpet themselves who pat themselves on the back\nAnd you're playing no one like that you play in South Carolina state that's an F. C. S. school\nOr when is it when there's when no way that it is not just jazz but yet that's all I Know you I don't what is this what is\nLike if you're telling me that LSU taking down the number two ranked team in the country at home is the same thing is UCF what taking down in Memphis it's not saying\nIt's the same garbage we had two years ago a western Michigan it was it the same thing with them right\nYeah they ran into a table in nine late no one neighbor Ralph\nExactly right we move on and let's talk a little NFL right now but as I said that this team likes to dramatic I'm Talking about the Cleveland Browns they loved her dramatic they went into overtime for the third time in five weeks they beat the ravens I was shocked with that title nine I didn't watch the game and thank goodness I didn't ... that\nHad to be asleep at twelve to nine are you kidding great Joe civil to thirty seven yard field goal browns\nThough are now too and wants to take a may feel took over a quarter back they have five games have been decided by a total of Thirteen points to today they hosted charges in Cleveland charges three into they beat Oakland last week\nAnd miles Garrett of the browser defensive end is averaging the soccer game and I'll tell you what I like the browns today I liked the browns today they're coming of age I really believe that\nI don't [laughter] I'm going to go the other way on this one Andy I liked the chargers you look at the chargers first off we're out of September so that's good for them because they invent ways to lose games in September and you look at the teams that they've lost two they've lost the chiefs and the rams\nThat as soon as the charges it was too [laughter] and they had a disappointing game against the forty niners because they showed up thinking that they didn't have to face Jimmy ... low ... CJ bad third who cares well when it was well after the effort but they looked a lot better against they bad raiders team\nThat paralyzed veterans of America they gave me an outlet to my career now they\nFocus on the accessibility for our life they helped me get to the point where I'm at now where I can have a job I have a family to be a part of society and live life the way I Want to live life\nTo support our work visit the V.

Y.\nUCF has to play who's in their conference\nMy guess is every college program except Alabama would take McKenzie Milton as their quarterback thinks got frost knows that UCF hung forty five ... indeed struggled wouldn't want to play UCF in a bowl game ask Auburn there is so much wrong with the\nI don't know where to begin Andy how much time we have here maybe we shouldn't even begin you know I'm no no we have is began because here's the thing is there's a reason why\nThere's like a college football\nPlayoff ... does he also rans okay I I make fun of it and hopefully maybe he bought into what I have to say maybe unbelievable there's no way of God's green earth that those players could play a major college football because in my mind is not major college football it's not it's good football but it's not big on football sorry\nWell I think that I Would disagree with that they have a a decent amount of players that could play major college football\nSo I I don't agree with that but I'm not going to grade on a curve I hate this logic of hey that's why I used to play use in their conference\nBut if they play in a bad conference I'm not going to act as if it's a good one okay you can't give a team of free pass for playing in a week conference will\nThey ... there's no way time out to patch wells are bad conference that's a bad\nThing American athletic conference bad no no I didn't know that hey just added Sylvia comics but they've got they've got a break they did get a break and UCF didn't get the break last year\nReally top to bottom the patch twelve stunk last year\nSo what do you go to conferences okay right in\nBig deal who cares ... were hot August ... conference the oldest kid was any team in the past ... will get a break over any team of the AC who's email that I Know that ball playoff\nLast year ... Washington which is in the playoffs during the past twelve\nAnd they had a better body of work than anything that you're seeing from UCF right now\nNow I don't understand the point like I don't know why is that your talking conferences okay and I'm Glad that you you could have a team\nSo I don't know why is that you're talking conferences okay and I'm Glad that you could you could have a team and and I've been a big name conference a one or two losses doubled the brake head and shoulders over a team from the why is that why you that I used a play yeah whoa delve of course if the\n... the resume that you have if your resume say the two teams of Georgia and Alabama who made it from the SEC last year they had respectable resume they had a better body of work\nThan it seemed like UCF largely because UCF plays in a bad conference so don't give me that hey hey they play who's in their conference so they have to do that yeah great and I'm going to take that into account if I'm a value waiting which team deserves to be and the college football playoff in which team doesn't\nThink the other day in their right to give a hand out in a free pass to someone who plays in a week conference\nThere's no doubt but I Would say this I think the conference situation a is a misnomer it should be who you play not the conference here because you can play schools outside of you accomplished all your schedule we knew seems like you know like look at the Washington schedule the path towards they go out of their coverage of play crap they do like garbage okay\nThey played all have written this year that's a good is a big way way better than anything UCF does non conference wise\nThere's no doubt about that way that the UCF could if they wanted to go out of Congress to play two or three schools to bolster their conference I had a resume right of course his colleagues do was Alabama will still play chattanooga's southern out of their conference they couldn't afford to do that because they play in the U.S conference of the country\nAbsolutely everything about McKenzie Milton in terms of what these other point my guess is every college program except Alabama would take McKenzie Milton as their quarterback I disagree with that but take a guy like will Greer with West Virginia he's fantastic did you see him yesterday\nThrough for a hundred yards at Iowa State\nSo to think that just because you have a good quarterback oil will love you use the no no no it doesn't work like that okay and it in terms of evaluating what one team does against the common opponent versus another team yeah use the F they crushed pit Notre Dame struggled against it yesterday\nThat all of a sudden means that Notre Dame wouldn't want to play UCF in a bowl game are you crazy right they would and I went to the mighty UCF nice to get fat off of these week teams like the these teams are just about how ring in fear because of the UCF mighty unite the show is\nA mistake that the the Twitter\nAuthor made tweeting to you about this\nYou talk to any one of those players and they may have a chip on their shoulder and they play a higher level football than they should because they do it that chip on their shoulder because they were overlooked by the schools that they really want them to go to Sharon they didn't want to go to UCS\nThey wanted to go to schools like UCLA USC Texas Oklahoma those are the schools that they wanted to go to and they were overlooked so when you hear these announces saying well he's playing with a chip on his shoulder why because he was overlooked that he ended up how to use the F that's why\nWell yeah and it applies to the bowl win over Auburn\nAuburn loses the S. E. C. championship game to Georgia and their consolation prize\nIs facing UCS\nOf gay ... it's a completely different mind that it's a completely different motivational factor there\nFor Auburn versus UCF like you're talking about they were overlooked for the big schools there in the sugar bowl they're playing ... let's go let's go time baby that's what it used the EPA's thinking Auburn like damn\n... we had a chance for the national championship we had a chance to be in the college football playoff and we blew it by losing the Georgian the SEC championship game you know you got this game against UCF it's totally different so to highlight that and say oh ask all burnt look at what they did you're taking everything\nThat should be into account and you're not applying it to what factors into that game and the mind that both teams heading into it that matters if you're trying to trumpet use the F as taking down anybody in the country right now when it comes to the college football playoff it's crazy\nI agree and speaking of ... this is talk about the Chicago Bears the bears are Brian knows three into the office today\nAnd why I say if the gays is because the last time the bears quarterback which will ... played he had already record setting day in the past ... bucks forty eight ten Hindu for three\nI couldn't agree more I I think that it's almost a waste a breath to discuss why a team on that level should be I I just put on the same level as an Alabama or LSU it just just put it this way put UCF\nOr a South Florida and the SEC I put a complete schedule your schedule there if they want to games will be a lot to be a lot [laughter]\nSchedule your schedule there if they want to games will be a lot will be a lot [laughter] it's All right do you agree no way\nThere is no way they would be in contention for a playoff berth if they had as as though that looked like Georgia's schedule Andy imagine\nI mean you mean like I'm the one that's kind of grazing the flight for UCF look\nI think it's a joke I make fun of it the fact that the athletic director they got a flag to say that defies shy of its rebuild for him who have to do what they are that\nThis is what they are anti UCF is a poor man's version of Boise State that's what they are memorable in Boise State yeah headed cranked up and they were added ... undefeated season ... one last the ...\nProgram at the level that they're playing\n... here's the thing you have to say boy they played in a week conference at the time the ... week\nProbably better than the a C honestly but so we conference but what they did they went out of conference and they lead to played a big time team they play someone who was ranked they play any power five team where they got lucky with that at all ... yes doesn't do that\nThey are a weak version of Boise State when that program was at its finest that's what you guys are much\nThank you very much I Want to welcome everybody to the FEC puts radio studios what brought you a bike oh it's easy to say fifty percent of moral car insurance was Geico got a guy go duck comical eight hundred and I put up with all the all the hard part figuring out which way is usually by the way you mentioned the fact that the Vikings are playing today and they're playing\nArizona hosted by the way hosting Arizona wanted for Vikings two to one and they did break that ... game losing streak last week and it was a a rematch of the NFC championship game\nAnd I guess the highlight of that game last week that I remember that defensive tackle liberal Joseph stole the show but at twenty three Twenty one when he recovered a ... here and this big monster of a man rent fifty for us to the end zone and the Vikings one of the ball game\nI Love that great got some agility man it's crazy how guys in the NFL that big can move that well so amazing man but really how about his Madden rating going up by twelve points on that and this was crazy he had the top in speed\nThat was almost neck and neck with marches may remember Marta made the jets yeah ... yes who almost had to return for a touchdown they topped out at almost the exact same speed\nLoophole Joseph was about twice the size of marches debate that is amazing right there but yeah I just don't see how the Vikings drop another one at home I think they're going to be on high alert because they walked in thinking they could just show up and beat the bills and they lost by three touchdowns so I don't think they make that same mistake against the\nArizona Cardinals team with Josh Rosen pleaded Jesus facing that defense I think that defense gets the better of Josh Rosen today I think the toughest heads for that Arizona off when they're thirty first in rushing the ball and also stopping the rush that is a bad combination for Arizona\nWell said dairies O'Brian away from oil live with a guy called Fox Sports radio studios in oh this is almost as good as a\nCleveland Browns when we call it thought a barrel
