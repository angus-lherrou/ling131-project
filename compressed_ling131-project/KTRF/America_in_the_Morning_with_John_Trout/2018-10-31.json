best\nHalloween as thrill rides that are out there and the holiday travel in the in general how big of a deal is that how big an industry is it for a Halloween thrill rides and what kind of a spectacular special effects are available these days\nAbout Thirty years ago this really was unheard of the all the uh the southern portion of the Bible belt\nOr Mexico land or Six Flags over Texas did it nowadays you can find some of the best Halloween uh uh I I guess the facts and\nAnd different uh different events at places like universal studios are not scary farm and California Kenny wood and mess west myth when I'm I guess the Halloween weekend cedar point which Sandusky, Ohio and of course Disney is going to be doing\nThe Mickey not so scary Halloween parties which are great at both ... and of course a scare winds its heroines in and out of North Carolina\nAnd er and ... got how the stream so there's a lot of it has become very big business and people just love going to these events\nSo I guess age appropriate message is important for many of these things right I mean you you can't a scare the daylights out of the some kid who's five years old\nThrough and the great part about ... whether it's summertime wintertime or even Christmas Time is that there's something for everyone at these parks you've got the the really crazy rides for the kids you've got the smaller ride for the uh you know for the toddlers you've got an caustic shows where everybody really has to audition in order to actually be picked\nUp the food or you know the different types of food and plus the the older people they they list scooter is now a because normally takes about four or five miles of walking to visit entire park so these are these are ways that the whole family could come together in a very short period of time and and make memories\nYou've got the uh been there done that syndrome or people get bored easily and so I guess there's a a never ending escalation plus you gotta gotta out do your competitor and the result is that I Would have to think that some of these rides\nWind up asking even things as as tough as a as steel and concrete to do things that maybe they weren't designed to do short question how dangerous are these rides\nThese rides a pretty safe I mean if you go back to the turn of the century at Coney Island where there were a lot of injuries and it's gotten much safer technology is actually surpassed or are these injuries in fact you are very rarely hear of an incident when it does occur and amusement park or any type of the year\nUh it's usually on the news so you don't hear them very often and you really have about a one and two hundred and fifty million chance\nOf being involved in a cafe Tallahassee adding them years before I could add to that Ninety five percent of those incidents that we'll be right or Arab not the actual the amusement park but something that the writer did a that was not something that what they needed to do or what told not to do during the ride\nFor the rides based on the old aspects of pop culture like video games or movies like like say Ghostbusters are there are there rides based around these things\nYou will find a ride based on most of the uh marvel and DC Comics of course Batman you'll find several of those old around you've also got a\nAll the rides but its Spider Man for example or you've got a rock and roll it goes too which is a geared towards the Aerosmith uh people who love their Smith a it's a very big way to draw people in is to make it after a movie or a comic or something that uh that people can actually\nUh you know in get involved in and most importantly while you're waiting to go to these ride there is a nice Q line so you can see the story unfold before you actually ride the roller coaster so that's been a big thing and and a big plus for amusement park to actually drop people and\nWhat about indoor ride or does that exist and now we play football indoors now\nIndoor rides are amazing and one of the best and I'm sure everyone out there that's probably listening nose of the first one which of course his face mountain and one of the first indoor rides to come on board\nMy only goal Eighteen miles an hour but because you're in the dark and because of the special effects I it seems that they're going fifty or sixty and of course are on the the same light\nWe're looking at rock 'n' roller coaster over Hollywood studios which goes zero to fifty five and a ... a few times and and that one is absolutely amazing so you'll find at least one ride in every amusement park that's a dark ride on it's a little bit easier to uh maintain get smaller\nAnd you do as much with it because it's in the dark it seems so much faster [noise] be\nTribute go an expert on this
