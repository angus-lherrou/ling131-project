two weeks out and early voting is underway in Texas\nI'm Clayton level coming up on Nineteen till we continue our look at election day two weeks from today here's Jim go hand in\nThe midterm elections are very close now and we have taken a look at the electorate from a variety of perspectives we thought this morning we would do so from the standpoint\nOf the fastest growing segment of the electorate and one of the largest groups in our electorate the Latino voter there are more than ... million Latinos eligible to vote nationwide you make of twelve point eight percent of all eligible voters and of course\nIn some most states notably places like California Texas Florida and elsewhere they make up a large percentage of the the total voting population\nWe're talking with a key late ... he was founder and CEO of ... Welty uh helps the Latino executives an entrepreneur is to pursue\nA their economic dreams in this country and I'm just curious some thoughts about what we can say about this through first of all strikes me that it is rather inaccurate to refer to as the Latino vote as if there was only one uh you certainly wouldn't confuse Cuban Americans with Mexican Americans with Puerto Ricans et cetera\n[noise] yeah that's the three headed monster many edit monster that there are so many different points of view also the difference between a first generation immigrants ... and beyond and how many different so there is no less you know block\nNo doubt a certainly the African American vote has been pretty reliably democratic for the past uh\nUh three quarters of a century or if it's only say Ninety percent for the Democratic party that's an unusual year uh the Latino vote again it to the extent that we can refer to it as an overall varies considerably there are times certainly uh uh for example a\nA former president before that the governor of Texas at George W. Bush\nDid rather well among Latino voters for a Republican so this this can be done\nAbsolutely I mean look at Texas California uh George Bush had the advantage that he lives in Texas all his life on the third the Mexican population there along with the other Latino operations there are a great advantage for him and I help carry him to the ...\nWe would also take note of a ... a big issue and it's a big issue for everybody the issue of immigration more precisely put the issue of illegal immigration which is that really what's at stake\nAnd that is a a big issue again for everybody\nBut I'm Wondering the extent to which you feel it is a predominant issue for the Latino population because after all day two of us worry about a good schools for their kids they worry about crime\nTaxes the whole panoply of issues that affect everybody is the immigration issue and in particular as we speak now this a caravan of some three or four thousand Central Americans having for the United states it is that in your view\nA bigger issue among Latino voters then among the rest of us\nI think uh the immigration policy the immigration issue is a big issue but it's not as big as per se education a quality of life of crime and some of the other factors that you mentioned\nI Know of the fact that we live in a world of nation states\nUh there are those who would decry that and I would certainly admit that there are downsides to the nation state but at this stage in the the world a sociology ... pretty much the options are the nation state or ... or or some other form of a of tribal listed societal breakdown\nUh that's that's the way the world and there is no one world are we do not all hold hands and we do not all sing ... in that context\nOr it is my view that a nation state has not only the right about the responsibility to determine\nBy whatever basis that decides however arbitrarily\nWho gets into a country how many for how long after what reasons now an enlightened country in my view will do so based on what's best for the host country\nBut that is up to the host country at an aside that I saw in California some months back is incorrect it said immigration is right no it is not a you may argue it should be I Would argue to the country but it is not a right your thoughts\nYou know I I you you look back to that sign on site integration is right and I'm Wondering if the person a had a problem with the language where it's got to admit the immigration is right maybe it's a right to happen or what have you on a going back to your question\nYou know we definitely have to
