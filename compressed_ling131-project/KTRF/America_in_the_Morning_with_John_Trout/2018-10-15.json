fraud so who better to talk with than Jordan Goodman America's money answers man on line at money answers dot com or first of all it's been a bumpy ride of late on Wall street why\nOne of the stock market went down very sharply because interest rates are rising is concerned that earnings may start going down and the future that they've been pretty strong right now that they would go down the future um and the more about with China is certainly ... concerning people as well and that's going to slow the economy when these tariffs hit on both sides\nI Want to talk a little bit about the interest rates historically correct me if I'm wrong interest rates are still very low even with the the recent fat increases in interest we've gone from almost nonexistent interest up to historically very low interest so\nFort Scott Wall Street so hot and bothered I mean not like we're talking about a a fourteen and Fifteen Percent interest like forty years ago\nWe got spoiled Jim basically because interest rates the fed reserve captain pretty much a zero\nFrom the end of the financial crisis in two thousand eight out through two thousand Fifteen they've gone up seven times then from there are now two and a quarter meaning the crime rate is five and a quarter but you write historical things are still relatively low rates particularly with the economy doing this or this well\nBut we liked zero I guess they complain when it goes up\nI guess well some of us like zero I mean and I understand since I'm On the side that that that does I I'm more of a bar where but if I Lived off of interest income which more than a few people do types have been tough of late yeah\nYou haven't been able to ... where we live off of interest in comes the last few years because you've been getting pretty much nothing\nAnd that's the irony of this situation the feds been raising rates and the banks immediately pass that on in the form of higher interest on credit cards in student loans and car loans and so on but they have not been passing it on in the form of higher deposit rapes and paying the positives and you've got to do something different\nIf you're just going to sit there and the hope that the banks gonna you know pay you five percent on a savings account not going to happen I'll give you something I Do myself\nWhich might be of help to some of the list as I Do what are called secured real estate fun when you get an eight percent ... minimum five thousand dollars but it doesn't go up and down in value their lending money the short term commercial real estate projects website for that secure in real estate funds dot com because the banks are not going to raise that they're paying in any significant way\nOkay secured real estate funds dot com correct you mentioned that term a student loans where do we stand as regards student loans\nOne point five trillion every ad about a hundred billion in these student loans every graduation season about twenty percent of it is either delinquent or in the fall\nAnd it's a huge burden thirty nine thousand is the average amount that people are graduating with something they can do is if they allow students had high rates they could refinance it to a lower rate typically two to three percent\nA place called credible can do that so a website for that would be credible dot com slash money as they know it's to me that way you get two hundred bucks off your first payment because otherwise this is just crushing people Thirty years of paying all these student loan debts and in many many cases of the major they're not even involved that are not not working of it anyway\nExecutive that's the part I don't understand here to take on the amount of debt that some people have six figures of dead is not hard to do for a college education not to do that if you got to be something more than just oh I enjoy the subject matter is that will be something that can can pay you back to say you make a living at it\nAnd if it just amounts to a hobby that's an awfully expensive hobby\nVery expensive hobby well the latest numbers I said I'm twenty seven percent of the people who are graduating in a particular major ended up working in something related to that major within a year meaning Seventy three percent do not have a lot of people are not you know using their education directly and for for something this job related\nWell society vested interest is producing productive citizens\nAnd that's why I Believe that that ah the student loans in fact financial aid in general should be predicated in large part on the extent to which what you studied get you a job let's say a within twelve butts of graduation and if if you do something like say civil engineering where I gather there is a pretty high rate\nThen there ought to be more student money available evidence something that you can't make a living at except maybe teaching it and there are limited numbers of places for that\nThat we have no business Lindy people money for that you want to do that do it on your own dime\nWell that's already been happening that's been a lot of pressure on the humanities for example because exactly that people don't feel that can come out if they're an art or theater or ... or something like that and and get a job so there's a lot of pressure on those areas\nBut I mean if you go to the academic places they say this as sacrilegious quit saying this is not a way that's not a job training program that has\nGrown it is a job training programs from the standpoint of financial aid and again that it's high time we uh we realized that I had to fight a boy or China and uh the tariff war ... ... people have I I think often thought of China's kind of having us over a barrel isn't really more the other way around it\nAt the moment it is we're putting more pressure on them and they're putting on us we're both putting pressure on each other we have two hundred and fifty billion dollars in tariffs products worth two hundred fifty billion we have ... currently ten percent going up to twenty five percent on January first it's hurting China their stock market\nHas been down in about twenty five percent so far
