... a professor of finance would Stockton University and the public policy analyst this would involve I gather first and foremost a number of changes regarding making automobiles\nYeah that's a big one so I'm the agreement we have what China for whatever reason as lopsided in favor of the Chinese and to our detriment China makes a car\nSales here or we charge a two and a half percent tire if we make a car sell it in China they charge us a twenty five percent or more on some products China was even trying to get out of the two and a half percent tariffs and they did that by sending a car that was three quarters of the way finished\nTo Mexico Mexico would put a ... a little things on it the hub cats and a few things and then say we produce the car in Mexico so we can sell it in the U.S without paying any terrorists at all this agreement says that large percentages of the car and more than Seventy five percent of the car has to be made\nIn Mexico in order to qualify for no ah terrorists\nSo that and uh same thing with Canada Canada has uh some agreements that are lopsided in favor of for instance ah the dairy farmers the u._s. can produce a product in the U.S our dairy farmers can produce a product sell it for a dollar\nThere dairy farmers costs three fifty\nDo Canada want to put to protect their dairy farmers say we're going to put two hundred and Seventy percent tariffs on that so something that costs a dollar has a two dollar and Seventy cents tower if it will sell for three Seventy that Canadians can do it for three fifty\nKeeps the Canadian dairy farmers in business closes the American\nDairy farmers out of that Canadian market this agreement begins to and that doesn't completely ended up against the and the\nAnd presumably it would be a model for other deals that we do down the road they're principally a one on one with the Chinese when you appear to my nighttime talk show you indicated that some of the trade deals that we have made with other countries are just\nAbysmal they are terribly lopsided against the United states in other words we ... we heard Donald Trump throughout the campaign and we're now starting to learn to things or at least that bad and may be worse\nWhat in your view was the motivation of my personal thought would be that the the motivation has to do with this sense that\nThe United states is oh so rich and the rest of the world was oh so poor and therefore we owe it to other countries do shaft ourselves and ah and therefore make it easier for other countries but which is a pretty lame excuses in my view\nYes yeah I I'm not sure what exactly the motivation is but every single one of the trade agreements as lopsided in favor of the trade partner ... what we have with the European Union agreements with China\nSouth Korea which we sort of fixed a little bit last time a last week rather and Japan to their all lopsided and as a result of that were buying a lot of their products that are money flows out of the country\nThey're buying very few of our products so very few little of their money is flowing into the country we have a huge negative balance of trade is a tuna hundreds of billions of dollars every year\nTrump said I'm not going to allow that to continue I'm going to get people to the table quickly I'm going to create a sense of urgency to bring them to the table I'm going to slap\nTariffs on or in a stronger position than they are they're all going to come to the table and negotiate with us and I'm going to make sure we come up with a deal that is much more fair\nToward the Americans were going to put the U.S make America great again and we're going to put America number one let's concentrate on Americans first and then we'll take a look at other people\nAnd when we look at Americans of course there are consumers of our producers of things and I guess that the policy up till now has been pretty much one of\nLet's give everybody a slight break on some prices and a few Americans we will simply a drive a stake through their hearts and will rip out their jobs and and in some cases destroy entire communities but it only affects a few and the rest of us will get cheaper brooms isn't it pretty much the argument has been followed up till now\nThat's exactly right that if if we make things in China where they pay their\nWorkers ah they started out a dollar a day there are a little bit uh over that but if we make things in in China instead of making it in the U.S and having a shirt costs fifty dollars making in China\nBring it over here it only costs twenty five dollars consumers will be able to buy more shirts they should have a higher standard of living and that's good for consumers\nIn the meantime though we've decimated the textile industry we decimated that the steel industry and Trump said we're not going to do that anymore they can't think of just that can consumers in fact it's better to have consumers pay slightly higher prices and have us\nBe able to make our own textiles or own a steel rather than the way we've been doing it keeping consumers with low prices and decimated all these industries\nDr Michael Bostwick professor of
