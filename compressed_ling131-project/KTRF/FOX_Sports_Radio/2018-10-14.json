Washington Penn State all going down\nYour number five Notre Dame escape just by the city\n... hairs was a when a pitch a yesterday so basically it was a you know I look at the schedule yesterday it it shouldn't have played out that way but it\nTurned out to be a tremendous day and in college football perhaps maybe the best game of the day was the seventeenth right Oregon topping Washington thirty twenty seven and no tea and it's a huge rivalry between Washington Oregon and marry a crystal ball has got the ducks running this year they really do\nTake a listed is that\nIf it ever developed a metal\n\n[laughter]\n\nAll right [laughter]\n[noise]\nOh\n\nYeah she said it was a big day though we did that they needed a risk field goal attempt at the end the regulation to stay alive with us we'll take it they won that game I mean that's how it is that there are five and one to one now and the pack and the Washington goes down five and two and\nThree and one overall and basically they're finished Washington's finished for the year there'll be some minor little bowl game that there'll be playing in this year [noise] [noise] yeah\nUm [noise] I mean it's a redemption for CJ for Dell he's the running back ooh fumbled at the end regulation against Stanford\nWhen they were trying to basically run the clock out and that led to stand for beating the ducks just a few weeks ago in the same field and CJ for Dell is the young running back who scored the winning touchdown and overtime and you just heard right there\nAgainst Washington monster when for Mario crystal ball and you mentioned it Andy it's just that physicality Oregon's known for all their bubble screen you and it's just\nBasketball on grass and their prancing around and having a really nice time but they get after you man you got Mario crystal ball former offensive lineman at Miami\nAnd before the game he was leading these pre game warm up it's all on the line he's just preaching physicality and you could see it on Saturday against Washington\nAnd they're back I mean the ducks it back that kind of a couple of years where they were I got to the picture but they're right back in and right now and it's all about the huskies I mean honestly to hit I mean they were done yesterday afternoon to liberate lost that hurt them\nBasically as well so they're finished and now the ducks now you hope they don't ... you know hit a wall now Bush this week they play Washington state\nWhich I Believe what's off yesterday so that's somewhat rested so there'll be like to believe or good so we'll see what happens of Oregon could continue they fall on their face and we'll see what happens you know what he was real or not but this time right now just\nTell you that you it's a packed twelve is dead and determined to getting a playoff team because like Oregon non conference schedule is essentially use the apps schedule [laughter] that would break down and you have Oregon playing Bowling Green Portland State San jose state\nYou're not going to get into the playoffs unless all of these other teams and other major conferences just lose multiple games which good luck with that happening so that the downside of playing this sharman soft non conference\nSo that's the downside of playing this sharman soft non conference schedule if you have a last like Oregon does in the packed well you're done in terms of the playoff race\nRight and you don't want them honestly the pack twelve I'm sure they wanted to get a major conference in that bowl championship series and if you run the Congress maybe there's a chance to Washington last year but now it's certainly opens the door for the independent your independent Notre Dame I mean no did they should be really running the table they had a\nLittle bit of a heads up yesterday at home you know they'd be fence came to play the officers butterick a little bit but they did beat pit they held on Nineteen forty but honestly looking at the schedule like we said it

been an act of the whole time you've got someone that you wouldn't think legitimate look at to get under center you can't sell me on your backup quarterback alec Danny that's the guy you're clamoring for\nYou can't sell me on your backup quarterback Alex Danny that's the guy you're clamoring for ...\nBut even last year when they weigh eliminated from playoff competition they still stuck with the light matter of fact he didn't look good Thursday night but they're coached ... said they wouldn't be that change listen to what he said\nWell we believe in it or\nHow how do you believe in this guy I mean I Know the two Super Bowls I get it I Know he went what twenty four for forty three Thursday night at an interception it was shot four times and his problem is this his problem is this because this completion percentage is almost the Korea best as she is just ... percent but at thirty seven years of age\nHe's not knowable and it can never turned a shock if there were scramble that's the problem that is the ballot\nYelling that guy he's never been that guy ever it's like Brett Farr that there's a couple of weeks ago\nHe was like you got to protect the guy\nYeah it's like oh dealt that are going to run that going to get out of the pocket yeah that's what he's always been\nOkay so you have to have a legitimate offensive line he lie it stunk it up I'm not trying to say he has a has put to point the finger only at number ten instead of that horrible offensive line inside joke\nIt is a flat out a way that joke that you could always look at that our fence of lying to\nYou he was shot four times as they are going one step further\nThey talked about the Pittsburgh Steelers the last couple of weeks being dysfunctional with Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger I Would tell you right here and now the New York football giants might be the most dysfunctional team in the world of sports and I'll go one step\nFurther you know that we've talked about this ... about the lack of TV ratings which is a joke and people not going to the games which is a joke because every other professional sports league would die to\nHave the the media attention of the national football league has TV ratings maybe down a bit and maybe crowd that down a bit you know why because it costs like hotel Beckham junior the fans out there are fed up what more on like this that the this out there that says go out there and just go\nCrazy and it's an I I mean the world that's basically what it is and people like me are fed up with it how's that\nLook at shoo man you're out of the gate with some venom today I like what did you eat this morning what was the breakfast\nRaw meat [laughter] around me I don't [laughter] [laughter] very much out there\nJust had a Ross steak and you're like let me add obey J I like it but look bad this the way I look at it\nYou're right he is all about himself\nHe is the I said he's like the beginning of the song crazy train from ... you know that song where it's like I I I I can do in your he's all about himself it was amazing that interview he did with Joe Siena Anderson from ESPN every word out of his miles every other sentence was I\nWas like I I've worked too hard I feel like I put it in the work I I just said the ball is just I I I Me me me he is that guy and I think that it's too late for the behavior to be changed because he didn't like this not just as easy either like this for years\nAnd ... not be addressed it's literally like a kid whose parents doesn't say no no no can't do that and follows through with the punishment if they misbehave it is far too late for OPEC um junior to turn it around and act right because the bad behavior has gone unpunished for far too long\nOn punished he gets his way Ninety five million dollar contract what are you kidding me I mean come on\nI mean it's crazy but you know what if the teachers want to do that God Bless you it's not my money it's your money they go oh you said earlier the eagles would make the playoffs they need they could buy diesel up across that division of the plane is so bad now that went against the giants Thursday night maybe fool's gold with the when they're three and three that are Carolina next week so look\nThey may make the playoffs I remember last week you an ... without a little bit Alex said that you were wrong you know I respect you for your opinion and and look they're not the same thing they were a year ago but it just look who they're playing with in that division the giants the Redskins come on they're tearing these things are bad Dallas that they're not consistent winners these teams\nYou know what there was a fork in the road this morning and you shows Alex ... says over your guy me on my own I just I just mentioned that have the way the Alex ... dark side how dare you Andy ferment I Do understand what I'm saying I get it I understand it\nBut I still look at this eagles team and it's just hilarious to me because\nThey beat the horrible one in five now New York giants and that's all it took for people to be like hey goes or back look at what they did to a one in five team who cares it's going to take a lot more than that\nTo not only when the division but get the playoffs so I still think it's very very possible that they lose\nA the division that they don't make it into the playoffs I Am not convinced that this team is going to be able to string together a bunch of wins I'm not and you look at the Washington Redskins team\nGranted they looked terrible against the saints but it's a big game at home against the Carolina Panthers that if they win it gets what Washington Redskins are headed that division they're on top\nSo I didn't I did Joe I dislike that people have the eagles in Penn\nThat only winning the division but being a playoff team they are in pencil they might get there I'm not saying it's the lack of the century that they don't but to have them written in ... as if there's no way they could possibly screw this thing up it's silly to me it's the NFL we see these things happen every single year\nI have a surprise to you I live out his game splits lines dot com um well hang on one and a half\nHour Andy you are you're making strides man you are making strides you got the spread of the game you know my heart is I've got a little bit\nHere you know what though I got it all I got over an under\nA plus fifty and a half and I got Bengals honest one and a half so I mean you know I'm I'm doing you've taught me well\nI got to I I gotta I gotta give the right the rise\nThat amazing thing it's just outstanding yes\nI just learned how to turn it on I just got one really just got a computer really it just got an Internet over there right [laughter] yeah maybe yeah just depends\nI mean it depends different you know books and different lines but right around there I've got a minus one for the bangles it's moved you can see the Steelers money trickle in throughout the week and the total fifty one what would you take on that and he would you go over on that\nI Would go over and you don't want them I I honestly I I\nI'm not a whole more but I think the fact that they're playing the home of the things have a little bit of ... momentum going on their side but the injury factor I don't know I look at a close game right now like thirty one twenty seven thirty one twenty eight Bengals but I I got to hear what you have to say about it I like I have a tough\nWhen because I'm torn I never want to take the results of the previous week and apply it too much like over the top with the next week you know and so watching the bangles they were getting dominated by the dolphins they were getting shot out by the dolphins\nAnd tannahill but what are the worst throwaways I've ever seen before\nThrows it just a massive humanity it gets knocked around picked off\nInterception for a touchdown another defensive score\nSo the bangles the way they want good luck seeing not repeat you know so I'm trying not to overreact to that result last week because the Bengals are completely capable playing a lot better today against the Steelers defense that's up and down I expected to be a shootout\nAnd I expected to come down to a fourth quarter game and I can't sit here and say I would bet my bottom dollar and the bangles making the play when it comes time for it I Would bet on the Steelers until proven otherwise\nI'll tell you what I'm with you and I think the weather's a factor because uh they predict rain at least the second half of the ball game this afternoon which will make a real sloppy and I don't know where the passing situation will happen with the rain and so\nI I just I I think that the Steelers joined the bangles head I know it sounds really stupid but I Know it's a mental game I just think that when the bangles team she used a black and gold something happens that they've got a real tight but\nAs something will happen is that the guy like I don't miss a goal of is a special team era today may may cause that game so we'll see what you get\nFined says perfect back you know and of course the shades of the unnecessary roughness penalty on Antonio Brown and the playoff games like\nOh gosh yeah I I Do wonder how much of the recent history\nFactors into the bangles mindset today in the thick of a guy like Joe ... than just off the top of my head or John Ross one of these young guys that has it been there for a long time\nTo experience the Steelers typically getting the better of the bangles at least of recent memory is able to you know one sixth straight games so I don't know that enters in their mind set\n... elected in their mind I'll tell you how it's going to do in their mind when when Marvin\nLouis ... speech and tell us that we're
