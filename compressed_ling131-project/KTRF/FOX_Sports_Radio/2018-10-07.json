B. our you're\nFantastic candy ferman week five is upon us you know I Love the NFL about my Irish looks good on the road I'm excited about that the lovely Christina and I got the uh McGregor pay per view\nAnd visited the cop out side the octagon not just inside of it so that was fun as well I'm going to be a scientist basically a football\nShow and and we we basically conscience trade Ninety nine and ... percent of football be college and also the NFL of course but I wanted to\nSay that high percentage are you positive\nMaybe it's even higher maybe I don't want to do this if I may get on my soapbox but justice active for justice guy going OK last night and the M. M. A. okay\nHabib ... okay wow I'll say it again okay who ... ... dollars All right close to ... million baseball\nThe most disgusting charade of any sporting event I've ever witnessed it puts the W. W. E. Y. shame and I'll tell you something else I\nI don't go here as if the actual fight wasn't big enough the real story is what happened afterwards in which all hell broke loose and Las Vegas take a listen tennis match\n[laughter] [noise] well\n\nAll hell did break loose last night I tell you what it is a scam it's a shame it's a fake it's a phony into its you know they do for PR maybe look and they should have known and you know this they should have known this was going to happen\nIf this was bad blood between the two that was building since last April on kind of McGregor with all the way from Ireland to confront could be doing that media day the Barkley said when he girl that Dolly from the bus and it was on a pastor on the bus it ... it was ugly is just you you don't want to see stuff like that in the world of sports\nI I just don't see it the same way I Am and I get it from us these point of view the commentators immediately were like this is not professional this is not the image that we want to portray I get all that because they don't want that to be a common theme\nAnd other fights going forward but just as a fan just to sit on the couch\nThat was entertaining [laughter] the fight and next thing we know\nKobe ... airborne over the octagon wall diving after a guy one of his uh members of the crew complete cheap shot jumped over the wall in hits Carter McGregor in the back of the head total punk move\nIt but I'll tell you what Andy you can say it's disgusting and you can say it's the worst ever which I Would disagree with in terms the ladder statement this the fight game we seem crazy stuff left and right but just pure entertainment value I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't entertained by us\nWell I'm going to go one step further you know what I'm going to meet you halfway in that square circle right now we do but at the payment I'll give you an example ... let's go back to the Yankee game against the athletics the other night when the Yankees won in some clown was wearing an athletic shirts and hats\nAnd the stadium in New York City\nAnd he got drenched would be a yeah I watched on TV I left there was at the painting was disgusting yes what I Want to be there no ... but there were certain things that I could laugh that but it was a clown move it was a stupid move was disgusting move just like the thing last night at the UFC it doesn't do any good for the U. F. C. sports it does not do any good whatsoever\nI disagree also like to think that this does no good whatsoever when we're leading off our show with it [laughter] this is the fight game this isn't like\nYou know a try out for the convent you know this isn't like that this is the U.S the crazy stuff happen it's just hilarious to me how some people could look at the economy McGregor throwing water bottles and an opponent in a press conference setting\nAnd look at that and be like oh man that was awesome and then turn around and get on their high horse fish which could be just flat out costing an out rages that I just since the showerheads are flapping up and down it's like if it's leading offers show which not all bad for the site ... things ...\nShows and and this is a very similar to news cast as well anything that's out of the ordinary usually takes priority and this was certainly out of the ordinary yeah we could talk about the college football games and we will we could talk about the NFL and we will but it's certainly just like a newscast that's on local news if you have eight houses\nIn a subdivision and the one house is burning that's the house is going to lead on the news there is something that's unusual and this was very very unusual\nYeah right and it's being talked about and it's being focused on\nAnd that's not all bad for us to see if you think that last night won't help sell the next fight we get a rematch between ... you're crazy so to sit here and say there's no good that can come from that spectacle and that's disgusting display and it's not true\nYou know what they will sell tickets they wouldn't have a rematch it'll happen again I'm not surprised that happened but you know what it it it just staying on the sports to me I'm not approved you know\nI I thought was there I I'd say wow I brag about that I yeah I was there in ... saw an ad right but I look at it for you yeah you would do is I I was there that one and you and I'll

reports\nWere premature we'll get to that are just doing it but that's when he finished the hourly coldest day he's Brian no different than what brought you might discover card we treat you like you treat you now here's the stage for my partner my partner Brian notes from the great state of Indiana a big Notre Dame fan\nOf going to put the spotlight on them right now\nI watch the game last night halftime you know if you know did they offend you kind of biting your nails little bits Seventeen sixteen that they have over no today but I watched that defense I mean really interest mothering I've never seen deepest like that and use I really habits they go on to win they beat biotech and Blacksburg last night by score a forty five\nTwenty three tell me your opinion of that game but that's I think the Irish right now will not have a dent in their schedule the rest of the way\nWell I mean look nice when last night and you think about last week's game against Stanford\nThat was the first top ten game at Notre Dame stadium since the Bush pushed game Thirteen Years ago that amazing yeah so the beat Stanford\nAnd all of a sudden at Stanford when looks a little less impressive because you think about stand for getting gifted again by Oregon and then getting blown up by Utah last night\nBut that was a big win for Notre Dame and to come off of that emotional big win at home go on the road you're only up Seventeen to sixteen at half time a lot of emotion in that building and they play very well in the second half so yeah I'm impressed by the defense and also Dexter Williams the very running back\nI didn't like in book last night he was inaccurate far too many times so that all things considered when you both raised some like that when you didn't play your best foot ball it's positive signs for the future\nDoubt about that I'll give you the positive side of the sort of the move away from the Irish because you've got to keep on global talking about that because it made me sick so they they want and you're happy and you got your time and this and that's it well I Do but you know I Know because it's like\nAnd this and that's it I have rarely are good but you know I Know because it's like with the stuff you know I I got I really do but now we showed the patriots now forget about the patriots obituaries for now because I forgot the other day\nThirty eight twenty four Brady reach five hundred ... touchdowns by the way it's funny because they'll always remember he passed that five hundred suggest scored and our eyes\nAnd maybe we could close the argument pay versus Brady that's all I've heard for years and they've always said whoa hey I had the stats Brady had the titles I'll tell you right now here and now we're going to close the story here Brady has both\nBernie as both right now so there there's no more argument would Peyton than Brady Brady Scott I'm both he's demand period and the story\nOf that argument was settled for anybody with half a brain a long time ago I had a Tom Brady it's not even close Peyton Manning how many times that he just absolutely wet himself in big playoff moment no doubt ton at times man for\nInterceptions against the patriots in the playoffs the big picture six can you imagine Andy for a second can you imagine if Tom Brady threw up six to lose a Super Bowl how people wouldn't come close to gloss over it if they do and Peyton Manning because they like him\nBut it's not even close in terms of who's had a better postseason resume and who's the better individual quarterback Tom Brady by a mile\nRight I couldn't agree more ... and we'll leave it at that and the patriots it back in the demise of the patriots is or was too soon although I I tell you I understand that because most people want to see them lose you know that's just the right way life right don't you agree\nI mean yeah ... but that day I Would think yeah right but you've got it still be reasonable there isn't another team right now Andy or people are emotionally emotionally idiotic about\nThat even close to the same level as the patriots think about that for a scientist sport in any any sport anything that you want to poll the warriors in basketball you know we can root for them to lose I Do you do you don't like Katie joining a Seventy three when team but we're not unreasonable\nOr not like oh yeah they're going to get tripped up by the grid leads this year as long as connelly's healthy or not tell them when it comes to them and the patriots have not seen that before\nThey stumble out of the gate they don't play great in September they play a lot of young guys and try to figure it out and what do you know they always do so it was doom and gloom and they were one and two and then off at two games\nIn a you know short span of time of a sudden they're healthier at three into and it looks much different with Julian Edelman back in with Josh Gordon contributing\nTo tell you one thing that's not that healthy the Pittsburgh Steelers I don't know what's going on there and I think there's rumors in Pittsburgh that they basically want their head coach Mike Tomlin gone they said he's lost a locked room Steelers are home today one two and wants to record the fate of factors who are not much better than one in three five goes off to the bangles that's all I'm going to say about that at Cincinnati so we move on Steelers ...\nFive hundred Andy you're allowed to talk of angles you know\nSteel is left at home to Baltimore and right now I forgot to look and see that's how did I get them out a way because I'm not aligned guy but you are so we'd go there but I Will tell you right now fountains are probably win this game I really believe stop let's take them today\nThey might I mean this is one of the handful of big games featuring teams with horrible records right because\nYou had a Dan Quinn earlier this week falcons head coach say he believed that the falcons are better than the record indicates and I agree with him you go back to the old school bill parcell blind you are what your records that you are they are one in three football team right now\nBut going forward there a higher caliber then that Andy I Would look at it like the dolphins were three you know and they got ... by the one into patriots at the time so your record doesn't tell the full story going forward every single time\nAnd so many injuries with the falcons defense that the Achilles heel for them so I expect this to be a shoot out I think it's going to be a really high scoring game but for the falcons to drop to one in four or the Steelers to drop to one three in one after losing a home game that's what would happen if they lose to the falcons today\nAnd you're in a hole you can't afford to lose this game of you're either a team\nAnd what led the really has to do just gets ... really really Jones involve more the ... really right now is the first NFL in history which just touched down to the team's first four games and ... Jones hundred Seventy three receiving a it's been in the first player ever\nWith forty one won a hundred yard games in his first Ninety nine games will get those guys involved that's your strength that's basically a straight get them involved and that's\nAll they have to do they just got to get defenders involved in defending that their issue these events that's the problem they've scored in the high thirties the last couple of weeks in Las ... games you know so I mentioned that yeah I I was really real quickly though if you look at the Steelers\nBig ban has been exposed this year without levy on ... back there they've only average two point eight yards per rushed the last three weeks that's what you've seen from the Steelers and last Sunday night\nBut what Andy Reid has been able to do just schemes certain match ups would they can take advantage I wanted to see just magically what Andy Reid comes up with against the jaguars defense because if you're getting pressure consistently and Patrick Murray homes\nThat absolutely it takes a lot away from us to play color with Andy Reid\nAnd I want to see just in terms of you know the J Lynne Ramsay ... I Love the trash talk back and forth with jailing Ramsey saying he's they returned specialists let's get that straight a return special if\nThere's a big game for ... hill because if he's quiet and this one a lot of people are going to look at jailing Ramsey and say yeah it he just returned guy when when he's not but it's going to be an overreaction of type ... doesn't play well today\nYou know here's the question I mean I don't know how you feel about this but I'm shocked that the Kansas City chiefs have gotten off of the stuff that they have and what touchable homes is done and I often wonder and I haven't seen a lot of reports about this that a good story line would be would they be as successful if Alex Smith was still under center\nWould they be because now we have the parts offensively to do well maybe not as well but still little is it all Patrick my home so I mean it's a lot to do with them for sure\nAbsolutely it is they wouldn't you know be averaging seven points a game cube had Alex Smith he had the highest past rating in football that yes yeah so they would be successful offensively\nBut when you look weak in week out thirty eight points forty two thirty eight twenty seven when I get off week on the road Monday Night football in Denver\nI don't think they'd be going to this degree I don't think that Alex Smith\nWould be pushing the ball down the field where you would have fourteen touchdown passes zero interceptions so yeah Patrick ... homes numbers I think are a bit healthier than what you would have seen from Alex Smith in the same often but you got a lot of weapons over there but I think it is that just medically against\nThe forty niners you had a great throw where Patrick ... bought time uses athleticism he rolled out to his right through a touchdown pass those are some of the plays that he's been able to make that are just special look at the left hand to throw against Denver right out the right out a lot of quarterback in the league doing that\nAnd everybody talks of ballots in Austin it's I mean here's a team that has gained something like twelve hundred yards through the air offensively and only rush for like four hundred and fifty yards I mean where's the balance there so you know all that stuff you thought of that stuff out the window because I think that Europe coach and you have to do what you have to do with the person do you have\nI mean I I watch these announces on TV's while you know are there still is today after twelve plays the situation in places just pass he plays you know it's great balance great balanced means nothing if you don't get it done if you don't get the job is to look beginning to John in Kansas City but there's no balance right\nWell yeah there's not a whole lot I mean it's definitely one sided so right as long as we're coming along it's all good but you're going to come to later in the season maybe it's raining sideways maybe it's a bad\nWeather game you know you got to be able to have more tricks in your bag to survive over the long haul and right now you got a great passing game\nYou've got no deeds and you've got a decent running game\nThat route enough balance to really be a threat\nTo do some significant damage their day is going to come do similar last year they got off the great start five and no and I think you know they're losing six of seven because when they get older they'll send it up yeah he won't be able to catch up they could lose three of four they could have a similar stretch here not too far from now\nNo doubt about that Brian firmly alive
