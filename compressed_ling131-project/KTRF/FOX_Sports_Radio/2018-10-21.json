Seventy arch you cannot ... I don't care\nCollege pro semi pro women's football you can't win when you throw the ball Seventy three times you have to have some sort of a sense of balance and they couldn't get it they couldn't get it passed\nThe red zone they couldn't get into the hands of allergic to it is all field goals whatever it may be they couldn't score and they gave up five hundred and thirty nine yards\nWell and that's the thing is they're not trailing by for touchdowns the entire game you know I get that at the end you've got an ear it out and you're trailing by a lot of points but that wasn't the story line the whole game and when you're down even Twenty one to six if you ever running game\nThat would help balance out your bad defense keep your bad defense off the field you know\nSo they're not able to run the ball effectively and that hurts them it hurt him big time last night and it could hurt him going forward and you also have to throw out there the loss of Nick both uh\nBecause that hurts the defense big time as well as he leaves and he's getting ready for the NFL but you know what you can't pin this on him leaving because he wouldn't have been healthy enough to play in the game anyway ... and I can't imagine that it's just\nThe morale was so down because Nick both the left I think we're going into movie trailer mode if we go into that story week\nThat's all we ask you as a crutch that really is by the way I have no problem whatsoever with with those is doing\nYou know because every college coach is out for himself they using people that show up and put them out so look you know what's good for him he's hurt he could come back maybe later in the yeah maybe possibly get hurt again so stay on the sideline get the big bucks in the NFL and you'll probably be in the first five picks up the other trapped in April so good well I have no problem I've heard people\nSay that he's a he's a he hurt his team is that a team made is I ... hey Tim and look at the coaches liquid poachers do\nI get it but I see it slightly differently where\nWhy don't you go back why don't you get healthy why don't you train while at Ohio State going to be doing all of those things on your own time now so you could still do it at Ohio State and if Ohio State is out of contention for the college football playoff which they very well may be at the end of the season then you say hey I'm getting ready for the NFL\nBut why not at least give yourself a chance to come back if you're in the college football playoff and books\nSelf a chance to come back\nIf you're in the college football playoff and before he left we didn't know that they wouldn't be there right so in my line changes right now why would you pull the plug early on and say I am out of here no question that I Would have at least to stay\nThere and trained and gotten healthy and done all the things you've got to do outside of Ohio State I was just done 'em at Ohio State and if he wanted to go back and play in a couple of ball games\nOkay great I realize it's a risk\nBut we can't blow the risk out of proportion where if you get on the football field what you're doomed although a lot of examples miles Garrett was the first overall pick and he went and played in his bowl game so I don't think we can blow out of proportion just how great or how likely a big time injury is going to be that's all I'm saying\nTo keep the rest of our saying\nStand firm take fire ...\nSo not on our one year we sent to the severely ill or injured veterans who can't get the care they deserve the therapy and they need to walk again the treatment they need to talk again\nThe lifetime of day to day help\nThey need to live for independent line is\nWhen there's no more government funding or nursing homes\nSeems like the only option or everyone says\nWe won't leave one warrior behind not on our want to\nFind out how you can do your part\nThat find that will be W. dot org\nLet's talk about America not ... where we are the issues that divide how\nIncredible our country laughed right down the line to winding coastline\nWhether you come home to routed city street tree around seven\nWe the small town\nEvery line deserve to live in a coon\nGreen and deriving community\nAnd we all share and the responsibility to creep Judy reports from one over had thrown out there\nIn one block them out [noise]\nWe keep America beautiful\nThe nonprofit working with millions of people just like yeah see I'm lettering improve recycling I'm unify our community\nBecause every mindful action I'm ...\nTo you can join the the ... year off at ... dot org together we can be useful things\nBlack hey hey\nCollege sports for the past the the big Michigan America's top ... end up paying tax speak to our\nMid America done about outbreak us that you\nCall up your schools are wraps bright here\nIt's your legs for Fox horseracing\nOff by the Houston Texans looked at ... down to Miami don't\n...

I was gonna say real quick Andy is you can start to develop bad habits where instead of keeping your eyes down field as the quarterback\nYou start to look at big men who might be in your face and are about ... you and put you on your back you know so it's like look at Eli Manning right now it ... the two time Super Bowl champion and he's got bad habits of looking at the rush because\nNo one likes getting hit hard by an individual that's much bigger than them you know so that's like a two time Super Bowl champion\nWho is showing bad habits if you're a rookie good luck one that offensive line starts to get better\nGetting rid of those bad habits where you're just looking at the oncoming rush not an easy thing to do\nYou're right and you mentioned my record the authors of coordinator for the uh once off as a quite a former of the Arizona Cardinals he's been fired from three different organizations now this is what caused those head coach Steve we'll have to say about his decision which he made on McCoy on friday take a listen\nHigh informed on my record this morning that I Would be going in a different direction I Want to thank my for everything that he's done\nTo help his organization and his team or try to move forward seven weeks into the season based on what we were from a standpoint our production off as a side of the ball\nI felt the need to make a change and that's what I did and Byron left which will take over the uh play calling on officers out of the ball\n[noise] well I I ... I understand it that someone's going to be the scapegoat why can't\nThe head coach Steve will say we're not getting it done with him he's gone on getting a replacement this different direction garbage I hear that in every walk of life can they stop with a different direction because if I were to ask at\nThat news conference Steve ... hey coach what direction is it tell me last right forward back ... what kind of a statement is that going in a different direction I Would have all the time I\nYou're you're changing jobs you know you're you're going in the direction of Byron left which we are going to crush them on the way out they are going to be like let me tell you what\nIn the history of our fence of coordinators MIke McCoy is on the short list of the all time does I mean let's be honest with you if you think that Steve Wilson is going to say that now is going to say these things that we're just going to go to go in a different direction you know what that means they're switching to Byron left which done that's where they're going to be done\nI'm done or you ... you don't like that and I think it's\nWeak just said look he didn't get the job done we've got to move on that's all we got an aren't we easily in a different\nDirection with our producer for this this shift\nNo heat and that will not go to\nDifferent ... where do I get a different direction yeah exactly right I I went to\nIraq should have gone right now is off to London about nine thirty eastern time and again if I'm a season ticket holder of an NFL team\nAnd my teen takes that one game to London I'm kinda ... I really am I Want to see all the way home games I really do I that's what I paid for and I don't want to have to have one game off the scale and going to London england but that's just the way it is the titans of playing the charge is not a bad game today\nAnd believe it or not I have the lines I got the line so they go ... okay emulate charges LA charges given up what mine is six and a half\nThe ... of course it's right\nLook how much I watch the car I thought yeah I was in line at the what the updated lines I Love you and they were like reading the newspaper and going by Tuesday\nWhatever the line was that day I don't know how long we've been doing this show two years yeah now you're getting ... adds up data gap what are you got it said that would well I'll\nTell you why because I realized it is some sort of somewhat of a public service when you talk about these gays many people do way joined the games and although I'm not a big wager okay I gotta believe there are people out there that listen to was not only for the entertainment value when the information value but for the\nWay during his if for no yeah I I give it out and you tell them if you sent me right All right that's\nRight ... well hey man Andy sometimes\nSometimes we got to be shamed into doing the right things in life you know your exhibit happens early your parents are like what are you doing come on get it together\nIf that's what I was doing what you for a little bit it was a British aid that yeah we yeah we see it but yeah how about this game Andy where you look at Tennessee they allow ... eleven attacks last week to the Baltimore Ravens\nIn a game eleven debt is unheard of you look at the titans they'd do play soft event they give up only Seventeen point eight points per game\nSo can they slow down Philip Rivers and company yeah the question is\nCan they keep up scoring wise\nDepending on how much they blow 'em down because even if they hit their average against the chargers do you feel comfortable\nThat the titans can score twenty points today [laughter] here's your bottom line about that\nNo here's the bottom line about about the titans\nWhat is wrong but walk as Murray older I mean he was like everybody is like you know flavor of the month when he came into the league and he's done I mean he's he's he's exploded imploded it's finished I mean really and I don't think that tendency can stop the running game of Melvin Gordon and full of rivers is really having one heck of a season though as far yeah Mario to he's\nSo I had to build up the other day yeah yeah I I don't see how the bears against the dolphins look that crap id and then come back to Chicago they're playing the patriots at home and all of a sudden their lights out\nI think that they still struggle if the dolphins get the better of the bears to the tune that they did last week to that degree I just don't see how the patriots are completely struggling all day today I don't see it\nWell the funny thing is they started the sees as a house on fire with three wins in a row that the three when they hit the dolphins and they lost that game\nAnd I think it was all about the defense really I mean talk about your business and what he's done but it may but it's really got those three wins in a row and the deepest was way out of kilter last week but whatever the reason I mean if I was shocked I Am and I don't think that's going to happen again today\nWhere's the impressive win for the bears disease and\nThey beat the sea hawks okay got it right I was asked the cardinals they won sixteen to fourteen they struggle to a win against the cardinals and then they blew the doors off of Tampa Bay\n... you'd think that basic good theme of the of course not you know so I don't see and it's not to say the bears are incapable of beating a good team they just happen to this point they haven't been impressive where you're like hey man this is the team you got to look out for if you've got a ...
