I've just been limping around for the last week\nI went in because I actually went in because of a shoulder issue\nAgain another story where I didn't do anything in particular is that like I was playing to pick up game of tackle football wasn't practicing finishing wrestling moves nothing so I've got this left shoulder issue I had a couple of surgeries on it back in the day from playing sports whatever\nSo I went in to get that checked out and in the meantime I was like hey can you take a look at this calf muscle here yeah hold that\nYou know I have an idea because this is what I Would do if I had the calf problem I Would do the sympathy game I'd go to a store and buy a cane and go to work tomorrow with a cane and it's really it's a great conversation piece of people who really feel sorry for ya something where they can't live\nTheir life ... yeah but and you got to play this out beforehand as soon as they're like what happened and you tell them the story well you

him we know that the with the pipes that he's going to have a high profile gig you know he's going to do high profile voiceover work maybe movie\nTrailers could be the next hosted the prices right something like that then Alice sort of that ... that goes into younger Andy no doubt that ... that's right that's what I wanted to you with us into that right\nI Love you know the one thing that you know about me Mr know is the fact that I Know a little about a lot\nWhich means like I'm not that smart but I just have enough to get by on a lot of different topics and I know that this week is Halloween so I wanted like give it a little educational background of like the history of Halloween because I I Know you'll be trick or treating with your lovely wife right is that correct you because of some sort of a party wearing the cost of ... am I right or wrong\nI you know I'm definitely going to wear a costume I was thinking about going into a giant piece of candy corn if I could track that down and that's what I Want to go as because there's some people the Portland weekday show I Do they give me a lot of\nOf grief because I Am a big fan of candy corn how can you look down on candy corn I ask you Randy from and how\nYou know you only see that candy once a year and Halloween yeah other than that you can never find it and that's a good idea yeah\nThere are no fan of it I don't\nSee a whole lot of turkey during the year but I go all in on turkey had Thanksgiving well you know you don't have the eating all year round for it to be delicious right\nSo that's good candy corn that I Love that you know ah I I looked it up was I'm always curious like you know how to start Halloween or just stay back to the agent killed the festival of sewing and the day marked the end of summer\nAnd the harvest and the beginning of the dark cold winter time with the there was often associated with human death\nAnd the ... I Believe that the night before the new year which was November the first the boundary between the world to the living in the day became word on the night of October the thirty first they celebrated sewing whether it's believed get this at the ghosts of the dead return to earth\nJust a little information was always wanted to know when did it start what's at all about you know so uh if if I may\nAgain a little bit about a lot of different things\nI'm ... I'm curious what the most obscure thing that you've wondered about that have checked into you know Mr know a little about a lot what's the one thing where you're like I Wonder how that came to be and it's the most obscure story what would that be off the\nTie your head and wonder who was the originator of ZIP codes because I used to do a lot of money [laughter] actually I slept and I wonder like why did they start like on the east moved to the west because the ones and zeroes on the northeast and the nines usually are on the west coast\nRight the a drop out here and say oh you know area to think about is adamantly with yeah he used his things yeah yeah a little bit like\nThey our phone number eight seven seven Ninety nine on Fox no or you know kind of have a\nYou know it it winds up it can work for your radio station based on the lettering that's involved right right now does that apply to area codes at all\nWhat are the area code that translate the funny words that are three letters what are the cities and states that had a tactical approach of which three numbers they would be known as you know\nWell ah where I live I area code is eight five nine which stands for and K wind northern Kentucky south of Cincinnati\nHuh Interesting right they're seeing any one yeah you do know a lot about a little\nWhich means nothing it really does have said if you're on a quiz show like jeopardy that's where it goes back to college football but that's that's what we did yesterday I Know you're happy there was no doubt and your mind I'm sure when they were playing navy but Notre Dame rolled I'm forty four twenty two and I'm sure you watched that game but just a game of the day may very well have been that Oklahoma State Texas game\nBecause Texas right now basically that knocked out of the playoff pitcher\nThey really are they're finished I mean I Can't believe I mean they've certainly beat Oklahoma earlier this year and\nThey somewhat control their own destiny to win that big twelve titled gay but that was a bad laws for Texas yesterday\nWe at pretty much take them out of contention and that hurts Oklahoma too it's not like the worst loss of all time where you go to the water you lose Oklahoma State at night but Oklahoma losing the red river rivalry\nAnd we stayed at night but Oklahoma losing the red river rivalry slash shootout slash showdown slash fill in the blank you that hurts Oklahoma because you want to Texas to run the table if you're Oklahoma\nAnd beat them in the big twelve championship game we're now you're beating at best if you face taxes the two last team that's not good but it's not good for the big twelve as a whole because it does not look like they're going to have a representative they need a whole lot of help ahead of them to sneak a team into the uh college football playoff\nYeah and it does it get an easier to Texas either was next week they play West Virginia West Virginia rolled Baylor yesterday fifty eight fourteen so again I mean I'd rather have twelve I I Do enjoy the top because they don't play any decent says ...\nThan any into your extended forecast more clouds were building the area Monday as we expect

I'd say that but anyway\nThink they played tonight you think they're going to make it through tonight\nYou'd think they plan tonight we think they're going to make it through tonight\n[noise] but if I Do a very very score and Boston are recalled words are there for like the [noise] better [noise] anyway [noise] program are here to hurry up and fall I got that for fourth\nWorld Series when I was [noise] when our our\nSkies all over I don't know [laughter]\nI I don't even know what do you want to know what's your question [noise]\nAugust when you're on a pair of you know mark cowboy desire a lot of people say it was a bad move for the cowboys but they're the monetary marrying him\nVery much a factor of draft anyway and I think it's going to take some of that pressure off of LA are because I mean there's a lot of the box replies now yeah there's a lot of a box and I mean it was a good trade myself and I was on your own repair [noise]\nYeah I mean I Love it and we appreciate the phone call it uh I I think it's a\nIt's a little more than I wanted them to to trade in terms of a number one pick instead of a first round pick\nBut when you've got reports of the eagles tossed around the idea of making that trade the Colts were thinking about doing it thinking about adding I'm Ari Cooper and pairing him with Andrew Luck which makes sense\nI think about the jets the jets were reportedly kicking around this idea so I'm for the cowboys especially if you look in the division I'd much rather have a mark Cooper with that cowboys team then to see him with Philadelphia and have to go see him twice a year\nSo yeah I liked the move Andy and look at that a deep wide receiver draft\nAnd you've gotten the services of ... Cooper from this point throughout the rest of the season\nAnd I think that he's certainly a first round talent had you you know ... thought about it in let in the context of next year's draft where instead of going with the keel Harry or whoever you're going within the first round you're going with Marie Cooper you certainly could make the argument that you're getting better value with the ... coup or\nYou know what you make a lot of sense but I was shocked because John crude and when he was a commentator for ESPN was hailing the move that the going rate has got Maury Cooper so\nI was kind of like shot that he would just unload the guy that that is what kind of made me crazy I mean you you love the guy when you already SPN talking about it now you're as coach you got rid of him so I don't understand that and maybe they seek help us and our number three with hotel is more of it and he knows a little bit more about this trade but if I may\nI'd like to kind of go back to Thursday night because you have fish filter the Texans forty tough when he\nFinally had to go here what can we keep talking about America Cooper on I'm kidding I'm kidding\nAbout this show watching five touchdowns Texans now won five straight to play a Denver next and his thirty four touchdown passes the ... I had a damn Marino had thirty two for the second most and in the history of the Fifteen games and to me the Sean wants is not getting the accolades that he deserves you don't even hear about the guy you know more about you really don't\nWell he got a lot of problems after that went against the dolphins the dolphins defense I don't know what happened to them they were just decrepit that night\nAnd you know dish on what the loses will fall or who's the wide receiver the speed ... out of Notre Dame he tore his ACL against the dolphins that's going to hurt him going forward but the ... I didn't hear a whole lot about the Sean watching this year Andy is\nHeading into that game he had ten touchdown seven picks\nYou know that's nothing to be like wow this guy is killing it hits that looked a lot better right now after a five touchdown performance against the lowly dolphins it leads defensively right you know Fifteen and seven looks a whole lot better than ten and seven but if you're not going to shower him with praise\nAfter getting the best of the dolphins well that's why you weren't before then because he hadn't happened right\nYou're exactly right I won't I won't hurt you anymore what your dolphins because they start out like a house on fire and they're kind of hit it but you know Ryan ... and I understand that but we're\nGoing on right now but think about every audience also think about this real quickly is if you look at Patrick ... homes\nHe's been amazing so far this year right right and some of the numbers that he's put up are comparable to what they're showing Watson was doing in a small sample size last year with those six starts so imagine if Patrick my home's got hurt and practice didn't play another game this year right\nNot rooting for this but just a hypothetical here and he starts out next season with ten touchdowns in seven interceptions he think anybody's you're showering him with the praise no\nNo way the way it does does that mean why it was in a love fest what the Shaun White and he's still trying to get back to form coming back from that torn ACL any showing signs you still incredibly talented but his numbers have taken a dip so far this year\nYou know and speaking of quarterbacks this talk about this game in about three hours in London the eagles three and four at the jet stream for him in London and the quarterback for the jazz obviously he is a problem Blake board was was benched for Cody Kessler in the last against the Texans the eagles right now have the ... best scoring defense and the league\nAnd the eagles did lose to Carolina I was shocked I don't know about you I was shocked with that and the eagles right now is giving a three as far as I'm concerned with the line today but they're not actual game now\nIt's up to an hour and a half now I did you check these on Tuesday again Andy goodness actually fell off the wagon again it was yes no no no ... and now you're off to the new and you just go through that you and the other day after the U.S that good enough energy from the day of the day job with this ... move quickly over here but I'll tell you the\nYou what I'm not really a big advocate of change because you know why I'm a stat guy and\nLike when you look at the record books it doesn't really mean anything because now you you extra points at the thirty three yard line as opposed to what it used to be like was seven to ten your job which is ridiculous so you can't do any comparisons right there but yes it does change the game the Pittsburgh Steelers and their situation they go to a lot more than they go for one\nThat's what they do right now because now ... now what do I mean if if you talk to Mike Tomlin I mean he will tell you that that is it when in doubt he'll go for the two I think that they do it it was a lot more so more so than any other team in the league\nBut it's a better product it's more exciting I liked that it isn't a sure thing it is in a way up in the NFL having to do longer extra point\nIt leads to some crazy outcomes the game I would've loved the scene over time last week but the way it ended which has to talk to her missing an extra point that was exciting it was interesting it was a huge talking point you know so I imagine after a touchdown you don't just run to the fridge and like All right this is\nYou know it's already a done deal you've got to sit there and watch it like ... there's a lot of pressure on this kick is he going to make it\nAnd junk you talked to one of the ... field goal kicker is ever misses the extra point and it just shows you it's anything but a lay up now I think about it for field goals or fifty or two more automatic medic in any capacity really it was shocking to see a myth that it it really was\nIt really what I tell you what though there's another situation that they really got to clean up the Baltimore and that's wide receiver Michael ... I I don't believe how many\nPasses he's dropped and I'm looking for ... I don't think they keep drops do they have you seen that show that I don't see that one of the\nCommon ones you know it's not one of the comedy categories you can find it but you got to do some sifting you know you got to go into back alley website and\nFind it on page nine instead of the front page you know what I mean right you got to really dig deep for that one but yeah I think that\nDrops should be one of your main stats they were you involved when you're looking at wide receivers I I don't know what happened to crab trees hand I Know you remember him at Texas Tech Andy that dude caught every thing you can't raising hands in college what happened to him in the NFL\nHe was even decent in San Francisco\nComing to Baltimore I don't know what happened to you I really don't but well it's\nBeen happening for the last couple of years I don't know if it's just the lack of concentration its lack of confidence that something's going on there maybe it's writers [laughter] you're not saying I'm just saying you know it's funny though you know when the Audrey Hopkins makes that insane catch that didn't count against the Miami Dolphins\nAnd people take way too much credit away and they're like well he's clubs I mean goodness these glove you just stick your hand out there ... it doesn't work like that the ... that catch was amazing the ... junior catch against the cowboys couple of years ago was amazing it's not just a byproduct\nOf really sticky modern glove Michael Crabtree would be a great example of that the dude wears gloves and he was dropping passes left and right\nHe may be better off not wearing gloves really is not working with the gloves I say that right now we'll see what happens today and I got an opinion downhill that he was like I Do like the ... this game and a close one who do you like and this one\n[noise] gosh I [noise]\nI'm going to go with Carolina because they held the eagles to fifty eight yards rushing last week I like the rush the fence and if you can make the ravens one dimensional I liked my chances at home against Joe Flaco even though he's had success against them in the south teams\nI I Would go with the home team getting points to your dogs are barking I hear you\nBrian no Andy forever would live from the guy go Fox Sports radio studios\nAnd it's time to fight with your mouth not your fish why prompts talk radio is next [noise] around\nThe red Sox won gave away from another championship time to panic Dodger fan so you're going to blame this one I Andrew Freedman analytics when it comes to the world series\nWe've got a chart on Fox Sports radio [noise]\nMy name is Preston James I better stock options trader for twenty three years I used to be an active swing trader but that all changed once I discovered by money press weekly paycheck method these days I'm a passive trader calling in more cash well being able to sleep at night that I ever dream possible\nI'm passionate about the market and I like to keep it simple\nMy methods are changing thousands of lives and I'm confident it can change yours but let the proof do the talking by going to pay check prove dot com that's paycheck proof dot com you'll see a seven minute video revealing how my money press method grew a fifty\nFour thousand dollar couch to one hundred and Seventy four thousand unless the nine months that works out to fight point eight percent per week\nYou'll see the proof right inside my real brokerage account\nThis isn't about overnight riches but once you discovered this for yourself you can start on the same path overnight you're seven minutes away from changing everything you thought you knew about trading and investing go paycheck proof dot com that's paycheck proof dot com\n[noise] we hear early before they wait we stay\nLate steam form\nWhen they're in the latest technology [noise]\nWe take the time to train the next generation of doctors and nurses\nWe work together to make sure we have in my mind\nWe do not [laughter]\nThis is our mission [noise]\nMore than three hundred pounds working\nTogether families\nIn that way they live in the country will be there [noise]\nStand together to sort of\nWe stand strong\nUnited [noise]\nStand with us and caring for our federal [noise]\nMm I'm a firefighter ...
