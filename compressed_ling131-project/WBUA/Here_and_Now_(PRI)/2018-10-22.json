I'm Peter O'Dowd I'm Jeremy hops in each year and now it is Fifteen days before the midterm elections both parties are holding their final pitch to voters\nFor the president that means raising alarm over a so called caravan of migrants headed to the southern us border he blamed Democrats on Twitter today for quote not get him giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws today Trump heads to Houston to stump for his former political nemesis Senator Ted Cruz\nAnd joining us for the latest as NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson Highmark Hi Jeremy so concerning these migrants first of all who are fleeing violence in their home countries in Central America the president has said that they're criminals\nThis is not the first time migrants have tried to come to the U. S. seeking asylum but it is happening right before the midterms what are the political implications\nFor the political implications are pretty big because this is the president's go to issue and he has really grasped onto the caravan he's even said that the caravan and Kavanaugh will be the two most important things about the midterms\nHe's not only said without evidence that they're criminals he's even said that they are terrorists uh he's repeated some of the a commentary on Fox News that they are members of ISIS or al ... somehow in the group of people who are traveling to the border by the way they are about\nLast time I checked there about three thousand miles from the U.S border but he's been saying the Democrats are funding them so this is an issue that he thinks\nEnergize his base it's what he started out when he came down the golden escalator talked about Mexico sending rape is this is his go to issue\nA lot of Republicans would prefer that he focused on the economy and the strength of the economy right now here is a President Trump speaking to reporters outside air force one on Saturday [noise]\nLook it up again a very major tax cuts for middle income people\nTo do that it'll be sometimes just prior I Would like to have ever [noise]\nHave major tax guys we're going to be putting in [noise] that are studying very deeply right now around the block they made your tax cuts for middle income people\nNow Mara Congress has not even in session a right now and November is coming right up ... what do you make of this\nHe's just making it up as he goes along there are no plans to put their Congress isn't in session as you said they can vote on this but he said it's going to be major it's going to be for middle income people why because the tax cuts that they already passed or not popular\nRepublicans thought they'd ride these the tax cut bill to victory in November but people don't buy it broke are in the polling Republican Party polling has shown that people think the tax cut when mostly to the rich but this is\nWhat President Trump does you know he used to call this truthful hyperbole and some of his books\nYou know he's talked about liberals rioting for sanctuary cities he talked about how the arms deal to Saudi Arabia he started out saying it would produce forty thousand jobs in America now he says it will produce a million jobs he said Democrats want to give luxury cars to illegal immigrants I mean he's just improvising\nOkay the Democrats do not have a President Trump right now they don't have one leader at the moment but there are a lot of candidates that are running around the country I Want to take a listen just to maybe a closing argument from one of them this is the Democratic governor a candidate in Florida or Andrew Gillum a from a debate with the Republican Ron dissent serious\nMm\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

Michelle Obama who had this to say the following month\nLike millions of people across the globe my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping more than two hundred Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of a night\nBut then what happened to those girls some managed to escape right away Twenty one were released in October twenty sixteen and in May of twenty Seventeen eighty two more were released\nTheir story is told in the new HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram it airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha I think he said the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram they're living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we ... the access with the government's consent it was the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the girls about what happened to them during the three is that they were held by Boko Haram why am partly a\nI mean they was you know the government is keen that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we started filming with them and not governments safe house in early July\nSo it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks so it was quite well they um ... still protesting what had happened to them\nSo that that was part of it it wasn't for us when our counselors to push them into reliving and talent as well as it happens\nThough we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to but he could eat any time we were alone with the girls the government minders and security shopping down quite quickly so to vote I think the government also wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see the ... time in captivity because they were held a three is this little ... down and they were released well\nWhat do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um they was free to speak to his they did give us the diaries discreetly it and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't goods that they were forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they call the in the full vote her um treatment ... uh and in the film what we do is\nThe uh the bills that the book goes who had taken would actually just the tip of the iceberg there were thousands of girls in Nigeria have taken by Boko Haram\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatments is so through the testimony we get a sense of what happened to the book goes as well\nSo such a let me bring us because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid ah with\nSomebody from Boko Haram and it's sort of difficult to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\nYeah say what we were told by a a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the sound is that and you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a ... for you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave than you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a cell that the Gulf felt like they you know we're right\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why it say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we fast Matt Hi like she she did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well er and ended up being made into child soldiers\nSay one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have ... have been kidnapped or killed during this will say well ... has been kidnapping children but I Will say oh the men and uh some of them are forced to\n[noise] but then when the military engaged with ... and they tried to take back territory they will kill an arrest or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram it's\nKind of amazing watching how terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they're just flooded their towns out of fear of Booker run they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention globally\nYeah is astonishing I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns in these they called an ID become a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run through 'cause like her um you know they don't just could not then button and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous for those that safety by numbers on that fled the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you want to live that so you have to run\nAnd that they're they're all ... but then a lot of the uh uh loves entirely displaced people end up living within the community so\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they both have been incredibly welcoming to the numbers displaced people who have come to made it very\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they tried to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nYeah I mean I'm made a gory isn't a kind of normal front line will would say in it that it's it's controlled its miniaturize of control that I Know Nigerian military and\nTheir constant infiltration of suicide bombers to come into the city so when we with that like the second to last night it happened to be the end of Ramadan\nThat was sick suicide attacks in one night and you just never know\nWho to trust because Boko Haram uses young mostly young women as suicide bombers they stopped them up and send them you know towards checkpoints where they manage to make it into that said the city\nAnd say there is a lot of fear because unlike a kind of normal front line woods I Know you just don't know why this is coming from and why and when you said there's a lot of mistrust\n[noise] what about the girls who are now out of captivity and looking to the future and and trying to have a hopeful future of the government is making it possible for some to attend college including some who managed to escape lets us into one of them from your from\nI ...\nI Know who you love them and has it changed my life now all of the nation ... he's alright ...\n\nDo you see a bright future for some of these girls\nYes I think ... so that your book girls who are are in a un of the American university as I\nDo not the American University in Nigeria which is well older girls who were released a negotiated full and uh the escape skills who on the nights that to\nThe kidnapping happens so tuned in Seventy six were kidnapped fifty seven of them during the long journey on the back of trucks to some of these various kind of jumped off the back\nAnd half of those have gone straight to this uh University in yoga\nAnd that's why they've been the last three years and they feel positive about life and so that you put those who have only just started they've done it yet this university I have um we keep in contact with them and they say that while their education is coming on\n[noise]\nFunding\nFor here and now comes from the

new experiment in advertising\nFlocks replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content here's a promo for a block of ...\nMore or less than what they do they listen to ... take on prime time with a five minute we can't we can't say whether they live for Sunday Sunday edition sponsored by Google things over\nHere and now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that adds sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind us\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that audiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots\nAnd also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nI mean let's take this first change Fox is calling it the night and these nine second sixty seconds ... be nine sixty seconds break jazz pods jazz part with them and\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually a second year this they've got a promo in there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching as\nThe also the goal of the branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight right so brand new concept is really adds in sheep's clothing so last night for instance after Bob's Burgers there was a six minute block of brand of content there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and uh and other Mars candy brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in prime time by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for the\nSo the financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in volume do advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it would\nRise right as they say in the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain a\nJohn Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much I get so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile\nRide sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industries they're also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of the company called get around\nIt allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSend your company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car over population by using the cars we already own so instead of buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disruptive and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority but the minority in that every car will be assured ...\nOkay so let's talk about this specific how get around works right now it's available in what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYeah so you don't let her out you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you pick that car run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you look at it from the phone\nAnd lock the doors and try one and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to lead to a Porsche people share all sorts of course\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's throw a which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a massive opportunity to disrupting a trillion dollar market which is car ownership and so\nCourse the more you can shift people away from ownership towards access to more of this market grows for all players\n... well some of your competitors might also be something like ... or lift um costs automotive recently did a survey that said that those companies sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent\nWhat what do you think about that I mean are people really eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nIs why I don't know the methodology on the clock study um I I certainly know what we've seen and it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty shifting\nSo you know I think that the we we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely on Roger um they can't rely on car sharing they need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live carefree in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from their user base and so\nThat's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete shut up fast solutions to the marketplace so you believe people really do want to live without a car I think if you offered them mobility and equivalent level as you get today from ownership ... you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partners some some great companies like Toyota ... continue investing us partnerships and expanding our or Russia or partners\nWill speaking of rubber and tell you I mean these are companies also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and something that we've since day one been sort of very aware of in fact ... cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if you're going to drive itself\nWould you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and this maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense so we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those cars to be used by more people different cases\nAnd in fact as attorney becomes rounded actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals need access to\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road a ton of a ... year olds are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me than drop it off and then it would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in a world where for fifty years out in the ... sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where\nYou know the cars you know today is different the foreign factors of those cars have changed and you know fundamentally we're talking about a sort of a fluid network of cars that will be operating in around cities and outside of cities in suburban areas\nUm any of those curves might be self driving but they're fundamentally not you know self cleaning or self maintaining until there's a lot of infrastructure and sort of network functioned is required to sort of operate those vehicles and that's very close to even what we do today right we help owners\nShare cars efficiently in urban centers across the United states and we work with partners you know who help service those cars or keep them on line and and continue to operate the\nNinety two point seven WB you ate his very eighty nine

policy is based on values and interests and values that we have in this country a rule of law and a freedom of the press or both of which were violated in this case I Believe\nA an interest that we have are working with allies like Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia has been our ally\nAgainst things like a Iran's malign behavior in in the region a and surely\nIran has been engaged to proxy terror groups in malign behavior especially targeting Israel but also elsewhere I mean a Saudi Arabia claims that Iran is meddling in Yemen and Yemenis targeting Saudi Arabia and that's why Saudi Arabia's in Yemen but at any rate uh I don't see how\nA condoning what happened even though we have an incomplete a picture of what happened is in the U.S interest and therefore I think that a sanctions against Saudi Arabia if we have proof that there was a murder here are appropriate but I also\nAh suggest that perhaps the thirty three year old crown prince a has a some some growing up maturing to do and that it

would stop happening I think that would be and Saudis interest I think that the the war in in Yemen\nHas created the the largest could you see Manny ... humanitarian catastrophe that we currently she and I think that this episode especially if\nThere was a Saudi cover up and plot uh to to do this is a really shocking and in every sense\nBut do you think that the Trump Administration which has been watching the war in Yemen go on for years now a un un hasn't put the pressure on the Saudis to uh stop it that this is going to change President Trump's relationship for example with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nI think the Trump Administration wants Saudi Arabia as a good ally in the middle east and also as a good trading partner I think those are two agendas that it has and ah I'm not against either agenda\nUh but what I'm against is condoning bad behavior uh in order to make sure that agenda continues a I think we can do both and that is NBS the reason we have that agenda I don't think so I think Saudi Arabia is the reason we have\nIn the low fifties overnight lows in the upper thirties mostly cloudy Tuesday some showers tomorrow and ties in the fifties this is definitely the

endorsement to New Jersey is democratic Senator Bob Menendez and it does is facing a challenge from Republican newcomer Bob you getting\nPaper writes that this is a dismal election with bad choices which brings us to our Senate tracker this week Joe Hernandez has been covering this races reporter WHYY in Philadelphia Hi Joe\nGerman so Sen Menendez trial for federal corruption ended in the midst trial last year he's been trying to change the subject ever since a at a recent campaign of and he told voters this election is not about me it's about you and our country how has that been working out for him\n[noise] ah it's been a struggle for him I think it will be fair to say he has been struggling to break into the lead in this race he is in the lead by um you know some recent public polls but it's been hard for them and that's surprising in New Jersey which is largely a a very blue democratic state\nWell and you can has been trying to draw attention to the ethics issues associated with eminent as Syria's on Fox News earlier this month\nWe've been over four hundred campaign stops already event meeting with the Jersey of every location in our state they want change they're embarrassed by this guy you know he violated federal law abused the power of his office\nRio despite all of that uh there have been some Democrats high profile Democrats who have been sticking by Menendez Hillary Clinton was just there for a fundraising event how would you describe the support that he has among Democrats nationally\nNationally he's getting some support from the party that Senate majority pac has dropped several million into the race to cement Menendez is lead and in New Jersey Democrats largely are standing with him um uh you know top leaders in the party here senator Cory Booker his colleague in the Senate\nThey're all standing by him and I should note that his corruption trial ended in a mistrial so he was not found guilty by the jury he was\nEthics violations so what about you can says he was guilty of violating federal law that's what he's referring to\nAnd what about Bob he's he's a former executive at a biotech company that developed cancer drugs and he's been criticized for raising prices on one cancer drug here's Sen Menendez speaking to USA Today\nAnd at the end of the day is a question about\nWho's judgment you want sitting in a set of fighting\nBob you've raised by some cancer patients last year alone not once not wise was three times for drugs that those cancer patients politically need\nNow he has blamed insurance companies for some of the costs of the drugs that his former company makes he's called for changes in how drugs are priced but when you look at hue again as a candidate he's also pro choice he's pro marriage equality um tell us more about him\n[noise] well it's true that his company or the company is called ... and they're based in New Jersey they did raise the price of their blockbuster cancer drug rebel and that they've doubled it in less than a decade you would say that many patients are vast majority of patients didn't actually see that price increase when it came to their bills because it's got to go through\nInsurance companies and all that but the price of the drug did go up\nSo gene has also you know a subtle a lawsuit from a whistle blower who said that the company was advertising drugs for causes that weren't approved by the FDA\nBut you're right that ... is trying to run a moderate Republican campaign he's pro choice\nHe he's been talking a lot about women and and the equity of pay for women but he is also tied to Donald Trump he spent a hundred thousand dollars on the campaign to elect Donald Trump he he went to the\nThe Republican convention so you know he doesn't have a record voting record for people or journalists to look at he's a he's a first time a political candidate but he has supported Trump and the Republican Party in the past\nFrom the voters you're speaking with how much is Trump factor compared with Mendez is ethics issues\nYeah you would think Trump was on the ballot this year because people keep keep talking about um it keeps coming up in my conversations with people\nBut so do Menendez has ethics issues and and for a lot of people they see you know ... tied to Trump and Menendez tied to his trial and they're trying to decide on the lesser of two evils that that is you know the calculus for many people in New Jersey this year\nIt's been a long time since New Jersey had a competitive Senate election\n[noise] yeah um you know it's been about forty years since the state elected a Republican to the Senate New Jersey's pretty pretty reliably democratic and that way I mean you know we had a Republican Governor Chris Christie for eight years New Jersey is quite blue when you look at you know voter registration and things like that\nHowever these races do happen um you know New Jersey often does elect a Republican and and and ... them for a long time Republican Congressman Frank little beyond those retiring this year after decades in Congress so\nIt does happen but it's surprising this race it's surprising how close it is because of ... support and the party\nAnd just his popularity and previously\nThat is Joe Hernandez of WHYY talking about the Senate election in New Jersey Joe thank you you got it will know now that our next story might

I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed\nAnd that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity\nWhen what\nReally shape sound a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of time they're spending too much time on their phones they well in their own words often describe themselves as addicted\nBut Ninety five percent of teens um had a smartphone now and it is because it has become a normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to you and your friends text instantly to want to be the first to post a like an ... and so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but generations ear I Jim is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history and that's reflected in these big um surveys that I work with whether asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds\nSo say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to um have friends of other races and ethnicities too you know hang out with people from different backgrounds that's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped this generation\nWell that's hard to tell from the the data that we have because um\nYou know foreign policy is arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\nTrue um but because there's not a draft that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHer company's marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\nYeah they they do have to market to this generation differently because there's there's such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as\nI Jen is really interested in safety is not something you usually associate with teens and young adult but in their conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors\nYou're very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety and I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on\nAnd um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness around stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing as another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBy statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government and voting are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say they're interested in government or social issues\nOr politics Dan teams were say Twenty years ago\nWhat do you think so um well I think because there's so many other things to do there's always the possibility of uh\nMedia or new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix than you know I think some ... some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens and say well you have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard ...\nInteresting I mean I've had many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general um but they're also often really smart I I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nOh absolutely they're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all of this information and on during their quick thinkers and there's actually data showing that IQ has has gone up ... over the generations so I think ... is definitely not the issue\nSo obviously a generation Z is going to have to deal with some of these problems on their own as they get older and and and even right now what can those of us in the other generations due to to assist in any way with some of the problems of this generation\n[noise] well I think we do need to be aware on just how severe um the mental health crisis as right now among teens and young adults so there's a little awareness around that but not half as much as they as there should be that we're seeing unprecedented levels of depression\nAnd self harm a among teens and young adults now and we need to have more resources and more awareness of that causes behind that and then more funding and
