kind of commission which bundles together a number of issues into one yes or no question Danny Rivero of W ELL RN explains\nIf you live in Florida on election day you'll get the option to ban offshore drilling and also been vaping in the workplace\nOr you can vote to change the state college system and also give more deaths benefits to the families of first responders and members of the military these two items on the November ballot or the product of the Florida Constitution revision commission\nAnd the voter has to make a terrible choice\nEllen freedom was on the ... commission Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight\nDo I vote for the thing I don't like in order to get the thing I Do like and that's just not fair and not acceptable\nI think that what the constitution revision commission did is it packed things that they thought would be popular along with things that they really wanted but thought wouldn't the popular\nThat's how Broward County top administrator Bertha Henry sees it to particularly on a question that would do three things at once mandate a State Department of veteran affairs mandate estate anti terrorism office in something Henry is not happy with force every county that have five elected government officials including sheriff in supervisor of elections\nThe amendment that's on the agenda is sandwiched in between motherhood Napa by\nThe commission has been putting seemingly unrelated questions together on the ballot since it was first formed in Nineteen Seventy eight but the way freedom and some legal experts at this time is different Twenty years ago the decision about who would be on the commission came from a mix of Democrats and Republicans\nThat men in almost even split between the two parties says Ellen Frieden\nAnything that got passed through that constitution revision commission had to be seriously debated compromises had to be made and it had to be something that was agreeable on a bipartisan level\nBut this year every appointment was made by Republicans a Republican appointed officials and that can make things look political even if they're not ... as was on this year's commission on the committee that helped write the language voters will see she says politics were not at play just plain logic\nSo when we first started meaning we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really had in a somewhat of an access or natural connection\nGame is offers the example of amendment nine which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a let's make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens\nI think that you can kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beans and my voting record would speak to that but for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that just it made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue\nJust make the shorter an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment needs to be clearly understood by voters Timothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state cheap purpose it needs to be comprehensible and so the more you unfold some different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot three other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay\nJustice Barbara party in the ... the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they're voting on\nBut the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle Justice Party in had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters be where for here and now I'm Danny Rivero in Miami\nWhether you're a voter in Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there are a hundred and fifty five statewide ballot\nIn thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives there the example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws\nJoining us now is Josh all tick who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome yeah it's good to be here thank you and how does a number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other years\nOverall the total number of the red measures has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgence specifically in citizen initiated measures measures I guess\nPetition signed by registered voters\nAnd in those citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do they become law or is it something that just gets refer to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there was a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty eight team um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last day on them\nSo what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with elections and voting\nYeah that's one of the the biggest trends are seeing in twenty Eighteen or things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year ... other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri\nHow difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nThe process varies by state the number of signatures required as usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand as small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty eight for these initiatives\nSo does that mean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them on the ballot or it could have just be Jane Q voter\nThere are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual in industry or a special group at our national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to get these on about\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters so they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process as a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed\nUm but there's always some exceptions that prove that rule and there are cases where politically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part the citizen initiative process is used when the policies are being approved and the legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decide that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there all the pages blocked implementation\nAnd there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent soon as you see more initiatives you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface\nThe response to twenty sixty initiatives was in many cases to either repeal or um changed the initiatives if possible and some states allow that some don't or to pass restrictions on the process\nAnd then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty eight team with an issue proponents instead of letting it go to the ballot and letting it be the sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where minister opponents withdraw and the policy still gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that the addition opponents want it\nWhat is the thought about how useful a ballot questions are\nDirect democracy is is really important in the U. S. um every state but Delaware's a forty nine states require voters to ratify constitutional amendments\nSo even if the legislature puts it on the ballot the voters still have to vote on it the question really comes down to end the argument is about citizen initiated measures where\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WVU are Boston and your NPR station\nFrom constant

possible collusion with the Trump campaign\nIt's about allegations mothers office has referred to the FBI that women were offering money to make fun of sexual misconduct claims about him\nNPR national security editor Phil Ewing joins us now\nWhat do we know so far about this story\nIt's a very weird story it if it's a hoax that appears to be a hoax within a hoax so ah there were these allegations that came into in boxes in Washington of reporters including NPR\nFrom someone who calls herself a woman in Florida who had allegedly been offered money to make these false charges against Muller and what may be the cases that woman actually\nDoes not exist and that those false charges were in fact false charges about false charges what isn't clear is whether this was intended to embarrass the special counsel's office or just to embarrass the journalists who had been sent this email as they try to investigative report on it\nOr or is it possible that these women 'cause I Want to be clear this woman was trying to alert um did that neither was to that she was trying to alert Miller's office that someone was trying to take him down\nWe're not aware of any contact but between the women involved here has special counsel's office that it's all been done through journalist intermediaries and they reach out to the special counsel's office to ask about this and when it became aware of those uh outreach attempts then that's what it refers to the FBI can\nWell there are two conservative media personalities Jacob will end jak Berkman who are said to be linked to the story to tell us more about that\nThat's right wall is the young men who writes for the website gateway pundit Berkman has a show on Newsmax TV which is owned by President Trump's friends supporter Chris Ruddy and\nWhat they've said is the special counsel investigation is itself a hoax that it's illegal and that is unfounded\nAnd they want to expose what they call the crimes or the finality involving the special counsel's office in mullet himself and that is the background for these accusations or a legit accusations this week involving putative misconduct by Mahler\nUm they appeared in these emails to news organizations and also on gateway pundit yesterday Tuesday in the form of a so called intelligent ... intelligence report that was linked to a so called\nA intelligence agency which in its way was kind of a parody of the Steele dossier a which by the way is partly unverified a because no one knows which things in it a true in which things are not\nAnd it became clear to people looking at this on line that this alleged intelligence agency was made up of a series of suspicious linked in pages and the profile pictures of the people who had those pages where people like actors or models not real human beings\nOkay well now my head is officially exploded and we have about less than a minute left so I ... is the speculation that these conservative personalities might have been behind paying these women to say something about Muller and then what what what is the possibility here\nThere may never have been any women at all and those are payments are those accusations were themselves just a trap to try to get reporters to talk about them or none of that is clear\nHowever we do know the special counsel's office has this has asked the FBI to get to the bottom of this and if it doesn't there are criminal charges or there is some kind of report from the FBI we may learn what the real story was that was taking place\nIn Ohio in other words if somebody was masking masquerading as a woman saying that there was sexual misconduct allegations about Muller and she was with the money and exact and someone had made that up\nThey would be in trouble NPR national security editor Phil Ewing in Washington we will follow this thank you thank you me well earlier this month a federal judge in California block the Trump administration's plans to end the temporary protected status TPS\nFor immigrants from Sudan El Salvador Haiti in Nicaragua\nThat ruling men that an estimated three hundred thousand immigrants didn't have to have an immediate threat of deportation but many of them had lived there are already turned upside down during the ... plus months when they believe they'd have to leave the United states he\nWind Robby is one example of that she's a TPS holder from Sudan\nIt's a recently war torn country but she left for other reasons of fears of her personal safety and until a few weeks ago\nWas prepared to lose or temporary protected status on November second\nWhich had been the deadline he joined us in Studio welcome thank you for having me and how long have you lived in the U.S under this temporary protected status I had been here since Nineteen Ninety seven so it's quite joining it Twenty one years yes I'm I'm not going to ask at age but it feels as if that would be\nA good deal of your life yes\nThat's a big chunk of my life and you haven't returned to sit in during that time no fat so I Know you can't talk about why you came here because you have an asylum case that is correct\nWhat kind of life had you created here in\nStates and I said has been very kind to me [noise]\nI yeah I was able to say that my kitchen I have a master's degree by somebody from ... university I worked with the department of public health a\nAs a healthy debate and for Eighteen years and right now I work with western governors ... an online school is that is based in you that right now on and what can we see him as an ... so we provide\nOn line for just yes well and we should note that since it's a sensitive subject for TPS holders did the government didn't pay for your education you pay for that yourself\nSo having crafted that life you know find yourself in wrote in an asylum case whether or not you can receive asylum in this country and you were under the threat of deportation what did you think when you heard that your status would be ended and last time I find [laughter] us\nCertifying actually ah it it's um\nI haven't been here for Twenty one years and when you live in a place for a long it becomes home\nHumans alive you are as a kid I don't have kids but I Know so many of us all those who are raising up gets here a\nCommunity here is a big companies so I think the estimate across the four hundred thousand people who are the bad Honda's right now is the United states from different countries yeah yeah\nDo I understand you you actually started to prepare for having perhaps to leave by the end of this week that you shut things down I mean what did you do thinking you might have to leave\nIt is that's true 'cause um I used to own that is to rent it said that I wanted for so long and I was it was like you've that gene in twenty Fifteen I bought a restaurant and ah\nWhen did this has been ... I had to take steps that I didn't think I wouldn't need to do which is I had a I suppose I started actually and so there's some because I wasn't sure even even able to be here ... [noise]\nUm I was terrified that I'm going to also lose my job right now I was interested in because I'm with TPS a deadline everything stops so driver's license work everything that you have stuck to the constellation of ... as\nIt was a roller coaster and it was really terrifying\nYou've already sold your business you say is your dream and then you were looking ahead and thinking boy on November second I Would lose as you said my license everything that enables me to function and possibly your other job which is working with this on line university yes\nSo that had to be a a frightening time they can you understand I mean President Trump and the other ministry Asians rationale for terminating temporary protected status for Sudanese immigrants like yourself\nIs that Sudan is no longer a dangerous place to live according\nTo them the less civil war is over you say what does he went on my might be over in\nThe headlines but the situation is the ground is not that is not that great\nAnd again you were here throughout a time where you could not have gone back at all I'm no legal up until this change in American policy\nOr you were part of the lawsuit that resulted in the children minister rations decision being blocked you took this before that judge that overturn that November second date but there could be another date are you still living in fear that you know any day now this could happen\nBecause uh just decision it's a ... and there was a judge decides on their case and um this is not to find a solution\nTo our status that's why we're hoping that Congress would look into this and give it give us a chance if they'd give us a thoughtful look say we see that GPS holders are really\nW.

suicide in Las Vegas\nJon ultimately submitted that is said to the San Francisco magazine the believer and this was launched a seven year holy war over facts to gotta an ss said facts could be fluent it was the impact of the story that mattered\nHis fact checker Jim single took a binary approach something was a factor or wasn't and facts were sacred soon single produce Ninety pages of inaccuracies which the two turned into a book with email exchanges like the following limited by our colleagues\nSingle questions John and the time John said it took for the poor young jumper to hit the ground John to God has said it was nine seconds but the corner and said it was eight\nYeah a budget that doesn't seem like it should be a big deal though it's only a second and I needed them in the fall for nine seconds rather than eight in order to help make some of the major themes in the essay work\nJohn changing details about stuff like Tabasco sauce bottles in thermometers is one thing but it seems that Ted unethical to fiddle with details that really directly to the kids' death\nI don't think it's unethical particularly because I wasn't alone in assuming his fault took nine seconds for a while as parents also assume that he had fallen for nine seconds\nBut now you do no better so shouldn't change\nNine is to integral part of the U.S say at this point and I admit that I'm wrong about nine later on anyway so the essays not changing it would ruin the essay it would ruin it to make it more accurate yep\nWell now those emails have been turned into the Broadway play lifespan of a fact\nWith powerhouse actors body kind of al as writer John D'Agata Harry Potter I mean Daniel Radcliffe as fact checker Jim single and Sherry Jones as an editor referee the to the seven years of fact finding has been condensed into twenty four hours in which the fear trapped in an apartment like caged cougars battling\nAct as a deadline looms which side will win will editor cherry Jones publish it you know find out [noise]\nWe met up backstage was all for you before recent matinee\nAs veterans of the stage can you feel what we felt in the audience last night people on the edge of their seat it's like I don't want to try to outdo the critics here was describing this but I came up with a pistol Larry ... yeah thank you\nIt feels like we're at almost a fight or a or a a debate\nYeah I mean first of all I have to have I just have to take a moment and just really acknowledge the I just was referred to as a veteran actor in the company of easy for the first time ... and yeah I mean I I've never done a play before that I have an argument at the center of it to feel that going backwards and forwards every night is really special unlike some nights I'll feel\nThe audience finding me particularly irritating at a certain moment some of gyms quibble like make the audience go all discussing ridiculous but actually like the ... in in in my head they all know ridiculous until I find like as far as you up to go okay I have to have to try and win this even more\nDo you feel that because there was a guy behind me last night I don't know if you guys get here that he kept going yeah we did when when you would make a point did did you feel that\nSometimes we do like any good play you know the events of the players have to be the biggest events of the characters on stages lives in a sense and I think it works best when the three of us are fighting for it with all our lives\nThe cherry explain your character because the character isn't in the book but there is an editor well\nIt's funny because Jim single engine to God who we've been seeing a lot of 'cause they've come to the show many times in fact last night when I said the first line of the play is Okay Jim single I hurt people actually left\nAnd it was when I left the theater last night Jim single was standing there with thirty ... thirty of his relatives who've flown in from all over the country and and I when I opened the books at which they came they gave us for opening night Jim's comment was man we used to\nUse your character as this sort of what the soul of the argument\nI don't know if it's a ... she's the soul of the argument but she's the one who has to make the decision and she's so desperately wants to publish it because she really thinks it will help at this moment in time\nBut at the same time she is a journalist and damage damage every night as I come down to the moment is to play were decision has to be made\nYou and your character have not made up their mind\nUntil the moment I reach for the phone how it's who convinces me\nI'm going to soften you if you publish Eleanor every night now that guy that's going to be talking about post show the briefing bringing money [laughter]\nI Know what single wrote in my book thanks for having John's back oh I just got to talk about that\nWhen your character John to God I was saying things like yeah there are three one strip clubs that thirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalism whether it's an essay or\nNews for me to it as a piece of writing in the newspaper\nIs really different to the fact in fact oh my God we're having a play on\nThere is a difference in in in order to stick peace being written and that's it you know what would you say about the Greek history what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Daniel you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty four 'cause you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously this is that your character is not a bad guy we're in real life or\nBad guy anyway he's just he's a writer as an artist but in real life he he has\nSaid that the real writer who said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn to some\nPeople just destroyed her and they continue to do so um\nI don't think it's fair John does it work for the Washington Post who's not writing articles where you're writing articles for New York times used used eliminating the lives of people who normally would never be written about the fall is it a long line of traditions why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just say all these artists you can't do that any more\nThan that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where your character John ... has a line and most of the lines are straight out of the real life interactions\nAnd there's a whole world the facts to choose from the wrong facts getting the way of the story\nAnd your test us as the wrong facts what does that mean exactly what\nYou gotta be aware that we have a presidential jokes person Kellyanne Conway you spoke of alternative facts you're not in cherry\nIs interesting because there is a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and frequently gets applause\nThe argument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue in at the whole thing can for the policy you and your trust in your relationship without saying you know there's one point in the play where it would debating about the length of time this person fell for it and that's one of those moments of the audience is going to go\nSays no to different the masses you know Jim wants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it through a you will also make it more beautiful inherently yeah but\nIt is irritating certain play what do you think will start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case of picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and John gets more intense\nYou do both the calm the divided United States in a way and you know over this issue of facts and cherry again there you are in the middle talk about the physicality on stage and I mean there's there's heat up there\nThere is and in fact I left a little more heat happening last night I was slow on an entrance let's look\nAt it and they was strangling each yes yes I'm ready no winning that fight [laughter] it's not a U.S staying Lee Daniels okay yeah\nIt does go to those extremes because these two men care so much and it is in that sense where we are as a nation right now of of what facts mean to I hate to say the either side and I just can't believe we're talking about our country that way but\nThen you you actually got a taste of that she went to the New Yorker and you were a fact checker for a day to barely hands shaking on your red and you can you made a call you had to\nCall the restaurant tour after someone wrote a review so you had to check the description of the food and as I was doing I was like well I guess every ingredient mentioned as a fact so I'm just going to have to ask him about every single ingredient they mentioned that and I only missed one they were ready to hire a month but ah yeah that's very good yeah it's just the fact you miss [noise]\nRemember now and it was that S. son restaurant Oh yes yes I didn't underlying restaurants which I should have because I should have checked if it was in fact plural and he had had two previous restaurants or one previous restaurant\nAnd I have to ask you are actors you've all been written about do you come away from this play feeling better about the press more frightened about the press on my God if there are only thirty one strip clubs and we're writing thirty four\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WVU are Boston and your NPR station\nPosters Smith printing

com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had\nNational international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis year and now we talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level\nSo what's at stake in state house races around the country\nTim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures I ten Oh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven\nOut of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that they are and I do not just because one state Nebraska does not have both the house and Senate they only have one\nChamber but the Democrats only control thirty two wire Republican so dominant at the state level\nWill will with the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they run candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd an four consecutive strong elections so in the states if you factor in both the legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers and legislatures this was the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] will they run on issues like are lowering lowering taxes or they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that\nI'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on implementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on taxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and ah and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw the maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control\nIn a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of\nA group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures the draw the U.S congressional lines\nAnd in most cases their own state legislator line that's another reason the Republicans are in such good shape and the states is that they had the very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten\nWhich meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that\nAnd um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty census is right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eighth of the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled in less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates who will be directly involved in redistricting as well as thirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday\nAnd you know ... that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policy making in the next legislative sessions in two thousand and Twenty one but I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year or what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be that a democratic\nOpportunity year they would have the wind up their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans\nOn for a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out\nUm almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country so they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country\nAnd there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics is you'll find anywhere which is ... since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures and twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats and legislators as well as in the U.S house\nAnd it looks like that's where it's going to have this time the\nDemocrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years um they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money to their printing into\nLegislator campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... in states legislatures but um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\nUh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised although maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote for either a Democrat or Republican\nOr in many cases but what about state legislators do most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year\nAnd despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment I'm very few people know who their state legislature to our ... is and and who those candidates are in fact it's less than Fifteen Percent so it's ... it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house\nUm so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do\nAnd um and then to your point it then it does sort of turn into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\n[noise] so give us an example of a state house race uh that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special election and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a a race for governor so that that's also learned about so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to ... million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes\nControl how much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned from getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had\nSo in this cycle particular on the Democratic side and they have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend that money how they do\nUm you know sort of a voter registration projects um get out the vote projects the proverbial ground game but also big time outside TV buys um you know things you would see in congressional races you know see\nFairly commonly in pivotal state legislative races and that is being supported heavily by national party operations and so it's not just the Democrats they just increased fairly substantially for they were just a few years ago there now paying a lot more attention\nTo the state races but both parties are going all in on these races\nYou said President Obama said ... I remember President George W. Bush called the law says that he faced a thumping I think maybe it's now or something that the president has to do is come up with the word or for that first midterm election if it doesn't go out for their part\nYeah yeah that's a great that's a great point that you know if the Republicans I'm really take it on the chin and it and it turns into a a really bad night or a large a democratic night um then yeah they'll have to get creative get the word Smith's generating the dismal words", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "31"}
