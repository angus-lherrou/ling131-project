Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developers something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout star of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump's favorite Ron dissent is not as many as twelve points in the polling\nThe two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably as most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and\nHe is for a single parent health care system will have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gillum against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations but first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here in at the very least we would need\nA conservative states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs\nAnd others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now or a Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states\nWhile we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissenters said that a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is just qualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee\nWhich is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American who is also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem\nHe's had his Tallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMustard is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate the missile defenses described ... community as one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's he clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognize that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what if humidity's do about it\nAnd what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get the opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work\nThis categorization of a high lawless or you know ... this is Trump be in politics it is not based in reality I Want to ask you about President Trump\nYou know in your debate with Ron descent as you said he was just huge for the president you may know Bo's about how you felt about President Trump and his loses without acts of leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it\nPresident Trump's pulling numbers they have bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent astute first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nWell I'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do is\nUh I'm teaching my kids what it means that the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes\nAround making fun of handicapped individuals referring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe\nIt's completely inappropriate behavior\nAnd Mr disasters he is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself in a print is to Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and common sense to our body politic more people have to join the and decrying this kind of ...\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society and it kind of get a community where my kids will be proud to grow up in Iran\nJust entered says if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor\nAmazing how all this money on many for the environmental plans that you have for the state\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia\nOr we don't bow down to the president we work with\nI take for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement\nTried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama stimulus money\nAs much as I disagree with the conduct in the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Flora two point eight billion dollars\nI'm gonna take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor my differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott not who again don't agree on a lot politically\nDuring this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day on the phone\nTalk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent advantage is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to the reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting Governor Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to end of the election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of forest capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce in the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the of Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels in what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new Hershey every level almost portable level\nTo reduce the number of nitrates going into our groundwater when we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science put some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluters to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time\nWell listen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nWe recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow wrote to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum mayor Tallahassee democratic gubernatorial candidate here in Florida ... thanks so much for speaking to us of course to take care\nPart of our talk with Andrew Gillum this past Monday\nAnd as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from Gillum his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey\nShows that a man they both thought was a developer\nHad Broadway tickets for Gillum and others including Gillum brother now the textbook Corey reads Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight Gillum replies awesome news about Hamilton Mike Miller turned out to be an FBI agent part of an undercover investigation into corruption not focusing on Gillum\nGuild says his brother had it in the ticket he assumed his brother pay for it here's what he told us in our conversation tell us about the FBI investigation\nAccording to New York times is going to snap size it there was a lobbyist friend of yours that was actually a friend as many of your friends are from your student government days and in college this is Adam Corey who introduce you to men who identified themselves as out of town developers they want to invest in property\nThey turned out to be FBI agents working undercover to investigate community redevelopment agencies possible correction you've said\nThey told you that you are not their target but before you knew they were you may too personal trips with your old friend Adam Corey when Costa Rica there's questions about whether or not you and your wife paid your share of a home there you say you did\nThis is W.

has some exciting races to watch we've talked about the governor's race between Democrat Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for a Senate seat\nNot on the ballot that on people's minds Donald Trump in a hurricane his in what we're hearing\nBecause he had the Democrats and Republicans\nI'm a Republican some of the road right now\nWith your partner or agree with\nI just wanted\nThat Wendy Alaska in Miami also with her Miami their Rosie to tell a Jake Bernstein an Alexander to his Neal healthcare President Trump\nCan the sitting governor the Republican Rick Scott unseat longtime Senator Bill Nelson has luckily not let's convene are Florida politics round table\nTo talk about it all and making Acevedo an anchor for Univision special correspondent for fusion joins us from W ELL aren't in Miami hiring gay Hi Robyn I'm getting closer to you I mean your status I'm Glad [laughter]\nAnd we're the here in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin from young well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that he took tickets are handled it I mean Hamilton makes it hard for this race and his share of a vacation that a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers it turned out to be an FBI agent and I and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story the text\nIn which a dealings friend a lobbyist told them about this Hamilton ticket or that this developer hat to them Gillum\nResponds awesome but he is insisting even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket is he's just going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent isn't some polling\nRight yeah I I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to you and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here or\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answer these questions I mean almost undoubtedly the dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies and the story but I think\nI think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story um and again it's going to come down to how he answers a question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know Gillum could I think he's like the third I'm democratic I'm a I'm an African American candidate for governor here he would be only the third in the country something like that and he is they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear\nA dissenters on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the president to the people in the administration\nFlorida has a lot of needs from our military footprint our transportation or water resources what's been a big problem here and we need to work constructively what the federal government Andrew Gillum is running on impeaching Donald Trump\nI don't know what for 'em but I don't think he's got to be able to do anything productive way with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race\nWell I mean I think you need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the Santa Scott the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump's ban or\nNo I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent that tweet and being being vantage was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided well before the Democratic primary there was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for a candidate\nWell and make it as if they don't let me bring you in here because the president also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November sixth elections and that's this and he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugee some say undocumented immigrants making their way you know to Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are going to like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack\nOn the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nThink he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the Caribbean and saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those um ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan are they very convenient time for the president the books that the the issue of immigration\nHis day in in this election along with health care and and the economy um um I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and um [noise] would really see they in fact all the garbage and all the attention describe and has had in the last couple of days and they will have a in the run up to the midterm election\nUh we'll see that on ... depending on the turn of both parties I think I read it as a a turnout election\nWell let's be clear this is a cabinet reportedly was organized by a church is that and it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar and the last one that was the size\nOf a group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last ... made got so much attention that CNN is reporting that just three people uh were except in into the country so there is that but I just and just to underscore this every\nDay we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nUm you will have people who will be a of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people they're seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point in Florida it's a great example Rob and you see a Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr from one state in two thousand sixteen now you have Puerto Ricans many of them who are already in Florida before Monday about all the security Maria\nOver the weekends I have seems a coming to Florida and that are um some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor's race in in in the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic communism different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson and Andrew Gillum will kill the economy they like high taxes um Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent [noise] there and also voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher taxes higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another uh apparently you never got your mouth washed out for soap after and tell them why because you keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh daily from WFSU here in Tallahassee always colorful but who's had the edge here and I especially with the hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept\nVisiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof has been ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the edge you know I I mean\nUh you know there was a the latest Quinnipiac poll released I think yesterday had Nelson's lead a at about seven points I mean a hurricane recovery obviously inherently political\nUm you know I think Rick Scott being the governor he he had the advantage invisibility and the response to hurricane Michael but Senator Bill Nelson the I think to his credit he visited emergency operations centers in Bay county here in Tallahassee\nW.

I think that we have our political differences but we all have to be careful about our political rhetoric and I think when you are ... remember the opposite party is evil or as the mob or accuse somebody of paying for terrorists to come through Mexico to the United states\nUh you know words have consequences\nAlison and he and he gave me an opportunity there because if you're of course referring to President Trump\nAnd I didn't even know that you know regardless do you think the rhetoric has been ratcheted up the you know especially to talk about the caravan\nA which is you know and very far away from the U.S border and happens quite frequently these groups of people organized by you know left leaning church is trying to help people get refugee status very few of them ever make it across the board are your thoughts on that on the language we've been hearing\nRobin we can all agree that the rhetoric began to be heightened well before the caravan and it it's it has got to stop and just started in the ... presidential campaign\nThat the name calling and the the um disparaging comments ... on both sides but but uh it has to stop and I said ...\n... what\nIs equivalent to the ... you say both sides do you think I mean the president is is using words like mob or you\nKnow do you think there's an equivalency\n... look the there needs to be a more civil town in the way we talk people on the left or angry and frustrated and speaking out and people on the right or angry and frustrated and they are speaking out and look I I at the end of the day\nForties after cold start friday more the same sunny skies mid for right now forty four degrees and Boston is is W.

I think that I I haven't even forgive him off suffer feeling like that\nCain says he wants to get his rights back but the process is intimidating and he knows it could take years\nAll of us deserve a chance to show that we can live decently we still live amongst other people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe should not assume that all one point five million felons a and everybody shooting in Florida State prison system or have suddenly become good wonderful model ...\nHarrison the founder of Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against a madman for he says there are a fair criticism of the current process service during voting rights but getting what he calls blanket clemency with a constitutional amendment would be wrong and potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be decided on an individual case by case basis with due consideration for\nThe seriousness of the crime the nature of any harm that was caused a in a whole lot of other factors that we think reasonable people would think would be important\nBut some law enforcement officials say the current system is making for the less safe Leon county sheriff Walton McNeil agrees with Harris and that it's appropriate to take away some rights from violent criminals\nGraduates do other things like a you know the sexual batters who uh those keeping them away from kids the way from schools and and those kind of thing I Believe those appropriate steps to take but just the fundamental right to vote there was no proof that are taking their right to vote away\nThe tourist them from any of the crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole commission that showed ... who's right to vote was automatically restored under Governor Crist were less likely to commit new crimes he says taking away someone's right to vote only serves to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic a fundamental rights as a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to uh give up and turned to a life of crime because there is no alternative left to him\nThat's something James Sawyer says he's experienced personally so he went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made him feel powerless\nI used to have ideas about who I wanted in office through next certain things but I never got involved because I said what I can make a difference so really it made me feel less than a citizen account and made me feel like well if I'm not a citizen ...\nLawyer recently got his rights restored and while he's proud to have the right to vote he says he's not sure if you'll use that right he hasn't made up his mind about whether or not to vote in November\nIs kind of like a victory for me this kind of like a a book of this is part of a bucket list I'm not that political either and I'm not sure what level and I didn't I just me but I like I say I'm not sure\nSeveral recent polls have shown public support for amendment for above the sixty percent threshold that would need to pass but if it fails voting rights advocates have another strategy\nA group of former felons is suing the state and the case currently before a federal appeals court supporters are hoping they won't have to fight that legal battle much longer if they win at the ballot box in November\nFor here and now on Chris Bentley in Tallahassee\nWell another legal battle here when all the way to flip the Florida Supreme Court in a decision about who has the right to a point three new Supreme Court justices to replace three retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats\nGovernor Rick Scott said he should replace suggested just before his term ends but the Supreme Court ruled that it is the incoming governors responsibilities to lead the Democrat Andrew Gillum or the Republican Ron dissenters will shape the future course\nA hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes for November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director Lynn hat or high school in person um explain this decision will you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of tightening the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get the hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their times are up it's already a new governor is in office and that's part of some of the the\nSome previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nI it's very different but I can hear president or former president Barack Obama saying Rick Scott I sympathize with him he of course when they do his Supreme Court justice but staying in the state of the three justices who are retiring by ... Lewis picky queens\nUm all part of a ... a liberal bloc of responsible\nFor many this course for the decisions is a fourth record how important\nIs this it's critical of this is the same for three court that has overturned the legislature on issues like abortion issues like um provisions on voting restrictions on voting that the Republican led legislature has wanted to do in the past that they cut it\nI'm the same court threw out congressional redistricting maps so this court has often thwarted the legislature when they've wanted to put in policies\nAnd the legislature has responded by calling you know the Supreme Court activists judges that's been a term that's been floated around so a lot of there for three decisions have really come down on some of these hot button social issues\nAnd that's been a big sticking point in the point of contention between Republican leaders and this particular Supreme Court though the makeup of this court matters because these are issues that aren't going away the Florida Legislature under its Republican leadership is likely to continue pushing these things as they have in the past\nWell this is also become a big part of your gubernatorial race here we've been talking about it today Ron sent us a spokesperson warned and he's the Republican warn that the Democrat Andrew Gillum would bow to pressure by out of state radical groups to pick 'em these activists judges that you just referred to houses that factoring into that campaign\nWell it certainly playing a role in the conversation um but I don't think it's sort of raising it to a level where most people are actively thinking about you know who whoever gets the governorship will make the way\nYou know you're right because we've been asking people on the street you know he's got this big decision you know you've got to stick to what they they a lot of people don't know about it a lot of people\nHighs and the upper forties clearing skies nice holder mostly around the freezing Margaret blustery winds\nMostly sunny tomorrow hides in the mid forties after cold start right now is Phil forty four degrees in Boston this WVU are [noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

I don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them\nAnd we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative not just talking to when my contract is in the way over here\nAnd and these guys are making up or twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner and that's climbing\nSo at some point there's going to be higher demand\nYou're right we I mean we push college and so many young people to college just the right thing sounds like you need welders and you said plumbers and they need training\nAbsolutely yeah and and most of these curriculums or not you know they're not for your curriculums so they can go through a future builders America which is a high school program transition into a vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school\nAnd they can be an apprentice and worked their way through vocational in a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read a average you know graduates making forty nine thousand dollars a year so they're not going to have the college debt that these guys have so it's you know it's lucrative\nI Want to touch on some of the other aspects of this but not to lead immigration just yet if you had the ear of the next governor then you couldn't have a more red hot button divisive political issue right now than immigration\nAnd it's you're telling me it's necessary for your industry so what what would you want to see\nImmigrant workers are important to our industry for sure they are very hard workers often times the immigrants are ... on the job before anybody else they're working hard to stay until sundown so they have a work ethic that we don't seem to have in the United states with our young kids now\nSo I Would ask whoever's coming in we need to have a way for these folks to come in and do the work that our industry and other industries need much\nAre you saying you'd like to see more of the workers who might be fit for your industry allowed in\nI suppose that's what I'm saying yeah as I've traveled again after this hurricane that we just had there's a lot of cruise tree cruise roofing crews and\nOne thing I notice in common of all of his it's primarily a Hispanic workers\nThis area needs to be rebuilt\nAbsolutely we need more workers there I think those builders in that area or in a really bad place because their homes or go on their place of business might be gone the shop that he had his gone it's going to take a lot of builders from a large part of the country that's just the way it is what\nElse would change this equation\nWe see a move recently for a vote tech or industrial arts coming back to the high schools we spent many years not exposing young people to that type work and telling him what Doug mentioned earlier go to college go to college\nThe guys right here standing there doing this work for us today are making between forty and sixty grand a year that's a good job\nDoes she think there'd be some sort of government involvement of kind of making it more enticing what how else to get their revert\nBack to you know capitalism I think you know the fifty sixty thousand dollars and that's you know you get into supervisory Rosen your you know sixty to eighty thousand dollars you know owner owners of companies\nDoubled tripled that one more thing as a stigma that's what the big talk was where did it last Thirty years you got to have a college degree and kind of downplayed the actual getting out of your hands on and and doing work and I think changing that view is the big hurdle you got to get over\nYou worry Florida's future is it maybe so uncertain because of the warming fees and the storms that are increasingly violent you worry about twenty Thirty years down the road that floor\nNo I don't I think the dog and I and other builders\nBuild very good homes the new code quite the contrary I Believe\nOther states should follow our suit and build strong homes in Panama City in Mexico beach the structures that survived well not that much different than what we're building right here in Tallahassee they're just good quality oh let's\nGo back to your question no if it's global warming\nAnd I'm not sure what you're referring to with our state and what do I say if he is warming and and you know\nThis has been going on this weekend we went down to care about it and get to explore the shipwreck\nFrom Eighteen Ninety nine they were I reveal because of the store\nBut for making eye niners category you know what are they didn't write him back then but the damage was very similar to this wiped out of the city of ... so do I it's just you don't\nBelieve the recent report from the government that you know we got even less time than we thought maybe ten years instead of twenty\nAbsolutely no\nNo I Believe it's cyclical and you're a builder absolutely or twenty five years I\nI Do believe we do affects the environment with what we're doing what we build an area full of asphalt is hotter than an area full of grass and trees there's no doubt no doubt about that [noise]", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "24"}
