joins us to talk about it Julie it's great to talk to you again and why did you want to move to Flagstaff\nWell through the county I got a medical retirement my husband decided to retire and we just wanted a new start we needed a fresh a fresh start over ... ... because of what happened a couple of years ago yeah\nIt was just really tough being there I became separated from the county when I got my\nAh medical retirement\nSo I'm On my own with medical and doing things and we just decided we wanted that kind of a smaller town safer atmosphere and I'm just quieter common life and what do you mean by your on your own with medical\nWell once I separated from the county and like I was required to resign I'm On my job and then once the resignation took place than I Am I'm responsible for all my medical care from here on wow and how is that working out for initially\nUm well my husband has ... health insurance so for me personally it's it's okay for some of my co workers who have had to do the same thing um you know they're paying for their own health insurance on their own now and it's a it's tougher\nSince we talked last I've had I think five surgeries and seven hospitalizations\nWith each hospitalization with each surgery I had to wait for the county to approve any kind of treatment and often times they would deny and that's really that's like a punch to the got its takes the wind out of sales\nSo I Would rather take care of my own rather than waiting for them to approve or denied treatment\nWe heard so many people and we have after every single tragedy like this politicians come out and say we're going to be with you all the victims of will help you out do you feel like you didn't get that help\nAbsolutely that's correct ... our county was saying we were county family and that you know they'll take care of us were county family really what they want my my impression is they want to to sweep us away we were\n[noise] you know we were a stain on the county\nUm even for the second anniversary they did nothing there was nothing they said there should be a moment of silence you know eleven o'clock or something but that's it there was no memorial there was no there was nothing ...\nNow you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career change\nIt's different it's something I really enjoy\nSo we'll see how it goes it may or may not lead to anything it may just be something that I that I Do on my own that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and\nUh spending time with my family and walking their dogs and exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area how're you doing physically after all those surgeries\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities\nMentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start from our interview originally had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police\nAnd he got a hold of me and we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states off so that's actually been dairy healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from the\nFrom the victims and survivors point of view\nYes well he actually heard me on the on that um interview and reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nSo great and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned\nEach of us had such a different perspective in that room I'm where I was shot one of my best friend she's the one who made one of the first nine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also\nHe was our our chief of our department and he\nGives his perspective from\nA supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own niche of of what they experienced and what was running through their mind and\nHow law enforcement really how they can improve their responses for the victims side\n... I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve with law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that that just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assume they were bad\nI recently met a I'm a teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who run into the building to help save people during the shooting and after I found out about him\nI didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know Dru Joyce thank him door so great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through\nWhat are those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured\nThat they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice\nI think they expect to see someone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of normal to them\nIs it typical for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations that I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story it's become um\nMore\nMaybe I don't know natural or it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\nThere have been so many other shootings since we last spoke ... have your views changed at all on or have you developed any idea about what could be done to stop this from happening\nNow I I it's so frustrating to me and it just always seems that at the ease of obtaining weapons here but especially these weapons like the air fifteens and\nThese weapons that are made to hunt human beings really that's what they're made for\nThey're not made for going in sport shooting or hunting\nYou should made for hunting humans\nAnd it's frustrating to me that there are so readily available in this country because it seems that all the shootings these mass shootings have involved that type of weapon\nAnd do you think that anything will be done about that\nI don't think anything's going to be done anytime soon unfortunately now\nWhen we talk to you in twenty sixteen you showed us some of the things that people had given you to help you recover a star of hope at a medal given to you after the attack by one of your nurses [noise] do you still have\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners or W.

PCC Hi Mary ... so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom a Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox\nScott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate this week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poor state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue\nOf cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget and here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people uh I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that inhabit Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agreed that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people uh Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls just Cox have a chance\nWell it's tough the math is tough for him the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent in the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win statewide\nIf new some wins a merry will be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues and needs some support sanctuary cities for example he backs California to coming at zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has and one of those areas as early childhood\nAnd during the recession state funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown news and has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that if she reflected in TV ads that he's running ...\nAs you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump or the the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nI think the governor's doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know I have property in California I Will say I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property taxes are way way out of whack and\nBefore there was such a move pretty soon then if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wall the drugs are boring through in California than doing\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters are prepared to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes than Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater or last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters\nSo uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem in these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he is not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates in persuading them to vote for for the Republican and he's congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nI Swear to do the homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in the congressional races\nAnd you know there are just issued an affordability that I think a lot of these new party preference and others at which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about uh let's talk about\nGoing on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat\nBecause in California the top two vote getters face each other and the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh hearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some said this is a serious undertaking was serious allegations Scott ... ah\nMaybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary\nUh you know I think Kevin deli on just hasn't been hit her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction you isn't that a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether and a vet I'm not sure is going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nOr so it's possible certainly uh it's it's not entirely clear how this cabinet things playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was responding Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but will you know I haven't seen Broadwell but\nOne thing that one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides\nOf the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old he's fifty one uh he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us about the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California in to the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is for sun especially for younger voters here in California and\nSalient arguments are certainly resonates most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we find a ... twenty sixteen Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California\nMany of them are young people getting engaged in politics for the first time some of those folks are resonating more out and looking for a change in the Senate race but as Scott mentioned at the polling indicates you know strong favorability for Feinstein\nAs the levy watching as the head she seems to have a pretty substantial question right now but we're still you know little little over a little less than a month away\nRight and Scott there's one thing we haven't talked about that has come up in our conversations here in Southern California which is that there is a measure on the ballot to repeal a gas tax that may actually play a role in getting people out to the polls\nWell that's what Republicans were hoping Jeremy they put prop six on the ballot in fact John Cox the Republican candidate for governor really funded that drive to collect the signatures put it on the ballot polling shows it's not as popular\nAs you might expect a because you know everyone pays the gas tax if you drive\nNinety two point seven WB you wait his very eighty nine point one WVU wage

allowed back Herzog come in and say it as a category for and I said I Want to lay low ... diet you can go now you're going to say I'm going to say\nAll right NPR's Greg Allen joins us now from Tallahassee Hi Greg Hi Peter and I know you're just back from St Mark's right there on the coast uh where we heard Bernard sessions what are conditions like they're\nWell you know when we're there is a of of hour or two ago and it was already seeing flooding uh this is before the storm had had actually you know come close to shore ah was pushing water ahead of it you know nearly everyone had left town but uh as Bernard sessions said he was a there was this friend Katrina Hurley\nHe has a shop in the garage there at the marina he's not staying there he's out of the house a little bit further out inland\nBut it's a they tried to get him to back when he wouldn't but he said eating them his shop in rain floods even in heavy rains ... expecting the worst but he's going to stick it out with his food supplies in his\nGenerator now when you talk to him and other people in that area do you think do they get the sense really how intense the storm is going to be [noise]\nOh I think so I mean you know people make their own judgments about this about whether they're going to evacuate or not but I don't think too many people at this point can can claim ignorance about what a category ... storm means\nYou know if you're not right at the coast they when they're really worried about here's a storm surge which is going to be nine to fourteen feet in some places and I think people who live close up to the shore that that is going to be a concern are mostly gone you know I think you'd be rare person that was say in that situation\nUm ... what's going to have you're going to see this extensive flooding in coastal areas all along the panhandle I'm also you've got these high winds are concentrated around the dinner I wall there's going to be like almost like a tornado coming through\nAbout over four or five miles square region so that's that's what people are worried about here\nIf you're not in that in her eye wall area you know but on that one and there's no way to know unless the it comes to shore where you are so people that's where people were taking a risk if they stay in an area that has a mandatory evacuation you don't know where it's really going to come ashore and how strong winds are going to be you know and\nAnd they're talking about tropical storm force winds a hundred and Seventy five miles from the center that will be a threat not just that area but for the solar we're we're likely see you know widespread power outage and I was just going to ask\nYou about that they're likely to be a lot of power outages have those started yet [noise]\nYes we're getting reports I think it's a ... up to thirty thousand state wide a lot of them are concentrated along the path panhandle coastal area where the storm is just preparing to come ashore you know it's just just miles offshore now and the area around Mexico beach by Panama City Florida\nAnd so that's where the power outages are are clustered now but you know that they're going to grow as a as a

that we need to get resolved\nAnd it couldn't be resolved if people were willing to work together and there's also the job creation they the opportunity in this district is amazing with the military contracting and the biotech by on that that is the engine of road here biggest problem right now is the workforce we have three point five\nPercent unemployment and we can't good qualified health and it's hard it's hard to get people to come to California because a high cost of living in taxation do you think uh Darryl ice it was part of that dysfunction in Washington\nI'm Darryl than I have a

I'm not a fan of the approach he's kinda got the good cop bad cop in reverse general lazy elected the person is a softer touch a ... kind of frontal\nAnd I think it makes it a difficult to people understand I think in this district because we're not used to that kind of approach but I think the result she's gotten on the budget a tax reform\nHas really help this district help to stay\nWhere do you disagree with Trump says well I Would have liked to have seen a lot of like kept seeing a little bit more a provision for California in our tax reform on the salt treatment but that really wasn't

we have we have to do something about\nThe health care health care right now in California is\nOkay but Medicaid funding that we'd accept a lot of is driving providers out of the market because it's the state is holding back on the on the reimbursement rates very very difficult for some people are the AC a actually worked pretty well in California because we've got a huge population\nBut there and again we were seeing providers drop out of the market so there's a lot of things to be worked on health care [noise]\nWhat about what we just saw with Brett Kavanaugh how do you feel about how the Senate handled his confirmation [noise]\nI thought it was hard for college I didn't like it should have all been vetted free hearing the United states the people of the country should not have been dragged into that I don't think it did anything tonight it's created a lot of chaos and to function one of the\nThings that some voters know about you here in orange county is that your husband was caught up in a pond ask you what do you want people to know about that\nAnd and do you think they should be judging you on that at all [noise]\nNumber one that's a lie there with no Ponzi scheme so I Want to set the record clear\nThere were allegations in the litigation from two thousand nine ... declared everything it was simple it was never a criminal\nLitigation that was a civil litigation where you can throw anything against the wall and tried to make it yeah and it went to a jury trial\nSo I really do believe that it's been misrepresented than politicians when they have no record to run on frequently like to dig up old old filing this was a huge litigation but I was cleared in two\nThousand Thirteen or do you think that that's hurting you know in this race well if you can't defend yourself it does but I got the ... actually you know are are asking about it now and I'm explaining it it's\nOn my website I tell the story I tell what happened it was to south innate anybody involved a real estate understands the problems in two\nThousand eight the banks folded a\nProperty ... it was it was miserable and Mr Leavenworth for countrywide and he says there's an excuse for for closing on people but he was always a brand new brand new attorney and the group and and they get to a brand new guys\nThese kinds of dirty jobs to do what do you think the biggest issue is for voters in his district this year I think the dysfunction in DC [noise]\nYou know the news is the start of a speech and hearing and all of this chaos going on if you don't want politics they want some results [noise]\nDiane Harkey Republican running for Congress here thank you so much thank you [noise]\nHockey's opponent is the guy she was just talking about\nA lawyer and first time candidate Mike Lebanon we met him at his campaign office in San Clemente and I asked him why he's running\nWell for the last two decades I've been involved in a variety of political campaigns I've never felt compelled to run a before myself\nA after having been very involved in twenty sixteen election not to help Secretary Clinton uh in after seeing that result my wife and I both decided oh what good is our background or experience or education or relationships the values that we have the values that we want to share with our own children\nOr if we don't stand up and try to do something for our country right now\nHow much of an uphill climb as it for you as a Democrat running in orange county and part of San Diego county\nWell the good news is that in the primary on June fifth fifty one and a half percent of the vote went to the Democratic candidates so the momentum is on our side a President Trump's approval rating in our district is right around forty percent of people are ready for new leadership do you want to see President Trump impeached\nI'm not running on an impeachment platform I Do want to get to the truth I Want to see justice you know ultimately I Want to see a a a an investigation by Mr Mahler or that or is not politicized or what we have seen with the new knows as chair of the house intelligence committee is ...\nAnd information in you know the other side you know they're they're making us to be a beep beep some are angry mob or they're saying you know don't give matches due to an arsonist couldn't be further from the truth we care about our country we care about the rule of law there cannot be one set of rules for the president added states and one set of rules for everyone else that's not how\nOur founders or you know created this a Democratic Republic that we live in our constitution still matters\nYou bring up the line about the angry mob how much do you think that what just happened with Brett Kavanaugh has changed the dynamics of your race has it energized Republicans more energized Democrats more than they were before [noise] well I have\nNo idea all I Know is that uh you know yesterday day before we have an extraordinary number of volunteers more than we'd ever seen\nA and I don't know how much of that was related to a now justice cabinet or not but what I can tell you is that uh we're doing everything we can to take nothing for granted over the last month of this campaign we are going to just do an incredible amount of work and I won't predict anything other than that we will work the other side\nWe asked your opponent Diane Harkey about ah something that's been jogging her campaign which is that her husband had to pay a penalty for being involved in a Ponzi scheme she said that's a lie what do you think\nUm I think the victims deserve to be heard and the facts are very simple ah her husband a endpoint center financial was found by both the\nUh jury as well as a a judge in than an appellate court to be a Ponzi scheme to be financial fraud and dozens of seniors were defrauded out of millions and millions of dollars and her husband her ex husband or they have not paid nearly enough to those victims\nShe also ah in her answer to our question about that tried to connect you to country wide I which was responsible for a lot of foreclosures I've seen that on your website you say I was just a junior lawyer working for bank of America which own country wide and I'd have to to do with that\nNot at all she's tried to create false equivalence between uh you know the serious misconduct of her husband were talking about major financial fraud or in my work I as an attorney I'm proud of my work as an attorney I've tried to do the right thing I tried to stand up for people in the record is on my side in my case\n\nFunding for here and

fastest growing ethnic group in this state they now make up more than fourteen percent of the population a slice of the pie that has tripled in size since Nineteen eighty and in orange county where there are four congressional races that the cook Political Report labels competitive\nIt's not eight hundred thousand of right now we are over twenty percent of the county and third largest Asian American population in the nation\nMarion food executive director of Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance says the Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the Philippines China Korea Vietnam Japan and more that's been the case for decades the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the United states\nI see it's probably about thirty to thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent of the community is foreign born ... according to the sense that you see more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rise of second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim is principal and CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James Honda former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nThe first generation tends to vote Republican\nAnd ... seconds interests are friends are more on the Democratic side why is that maybe it's because of a little bit of rebellion a butt up at the same time it's similar to how\nCuban Americans Vietnamese Americans come from a country that came from a lot of\nTrauma more types of financial distress the first generation tend to say why the what Republicans because they see the\nThe corruption of government the distrust of ... and why the second generation going more democratic I think because of the American values the\nFlooded this Korean Americans that grew up in ... and uh\nI think that's part of the process or in urban areas into focus more progressive thinking then more the conservative suburban ideal\nKim says one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is the immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nIn the thought of eliminating about because a lot of my relatives came here to chain migration so and the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from about chain migration\nSystem so\nIt seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally\nOr a majority of them and they believe that what he's doing his fair for the country will definitely be the my friends I mean more\nDemocratic or liberal Republicans are progressive Republican myself\nHave definitely some qualms about that ...\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks then there are Vietnamese American business owners like Pam and sunny new and\nWe met them at a cafe sunny owns it in orange county neighborhood\nCalled little Saigon sunny told us the politics here\nAre shifting [noise] definitely changing I I think you know you look at generation one which is our parents um salmon I mean we're all one point fights\nAnd we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in uh Vietnam but we were raised in America so we understand what it means to be an American\nBut we also understand our parents where they came from so we can relate to both sides and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences in a stark difference what do you mean by that\nI'm not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know when they came from a a country where you can't really trust the government\nSo stay away from us so we came over here you see a lot of our visit family cash and when they pay you know what you don't want to say what we have our own strategy can we don't want to\nShare best practices because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why first generations that are known to be very fragmented right and um you don't want to collaborate so we grew up in\nAmerica and you know I worked in corporate America and there's there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually grew and [noise] you\nAnd being an American or you know and having inclusive easy I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown that because we do collaborate and we're showing 'em or Christian of parents said look we've worked closely with the city we're sharing a best practice we actually sharing best practices entrepreneur Z\nAnd they're getting better but because we're doing now we're able to work together and that's one of the big differences from generation one and two\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science\nAttached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this year in orange county is fifty five year old young Kim a Korean American Republican who worked for the lawmaker she's trying to replace ed Royce\nWhen my family came to this catchy we can make on me and that because we want it handouts but because we wanted the opportunity America provided to see it on our own\nYoung ... praised by the sea register for her consistent record opposing tax increases in fighting for fiscal responsibility young Kim for Congress\nThere hasn't been a Korean American in Congress since Nineteen Ninety nine this year three are running in November\nSays political consultant Alex Kim\nWe have young Kim of course local year with Pearl Kim and also I'm Andy Kim and I'm not related not related but all you know Kim is a very popular name current\nAmericans in a bigger quarter of us are occurring Kim's including myself\nAlex Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in Georgia\nAs a Republican and helping a Democrat because it's more not just about parties about also this connection this this uh ethnic connection and having\nNot a single Korean American interest right now I'd rather it doesn't matter if the Democrat Republican I Would like to see a Korean American on there to represent me\nWe heard something similar from Vietnamese American Tam knew it\nYou know I see myself especially as a business owner of the community as a Vietnamese American first before being part of the party as a Republican or Democrat\nThat sentiment very in food is in part\nA reaction to the way many Asian Americans have been treated in this country as outsiders she says they still face discrimination at the workplace in education\nAnd housing Asian American no matter how long they've been\nWhere you really from or where are you from I'm fourth generation my family's been here since Nineteen sixty one and I still get it or things like your English is so good and\nAnd you know where you really really from what languages you speak and I have to really explain only speak English or Spanish and and and you know my family's been here for so long that\nIt it's those types of questions we only get it and so it makes people feel that\nThey're not really accepted or they're not really American [noise] so what do you think that means for this upcoming election I think it's really important to show\nAn Asian Americans how crucial we are to civic engagement and how important it is for us to vote and have a voice but also how important it is to educate the general public about the issues that we find are\nConcern that we feel are important and so to really talk about our values [noise]\nAll of that is to say the politicians from both parties have a lot to gain from these\nAsian American communities in orange county or politicians paying attention to Asian American voters you think [noise]\nI think they have to and so I think those who haven't in the past are now and I think many of the ones who are more savvy or have known how important the Asian American vote is\nAnd how and why we we tend to vote as a block and so I think they see the impact that can be made by really learning about the issues of concern out\nIn the news generally there have been a number of Asian countries that have been right at
