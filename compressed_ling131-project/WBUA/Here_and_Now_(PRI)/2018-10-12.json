a\nBipartisan just dispute was Trump how you handled it\nOr they were only a few votes short of blocking the Saudis sales earlier this year so I think you could really have a problem up there if he

driving causes stayed all car accidents inadequate sleep contributes to obesity and diabetes or as a writer and the guardian put it after reading Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep\nNot sleeping has been making me stupid or fatter unhappy airport sicker were said sex as well as more likely to get cancer Alzheimer's and die in a car crash\nAnd yet many of us just can't sleep even knowing that\nAnd students top the list as homework sports clubs bravado many get just a few hours a night well now some schools are taking action Dr Charles ... is chief of the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston they have a sleep matters initiative he\nAlso teaches asleep class at Harvard University and because of the success of that class\nHarvard now has a mandatory online sleep class for incoming freshmen and it's going to be expanded to upper class and his well\nNot just ... is with us in Studio welcome thank you very much you would just telling us at Harvard was so pleased with what happened when the freshman students took his online course before coming in why what would they pleased about what what happened that they want to know extend this on line costs to all the students\nWhile they were pleased by first of all the response more than Ninety percent of the students ah took the course\nOn students were actually lining up to fill out the questioner about their positive responses to the same meticulous your program well\nWhat are you fighting against I mean anyone who's been in school knows that there is almost a you know leave to the last minute part of this where kids are working overnight but we understand that in some schools now including Harvard some other groups study groups meet at ten or midnight\nOr one o'clock in the morning yeah uh and there's of course one of those popular courses or a computer science courts that it has actually ... where the students are scheduled to work all night ... part of the course and then they have there are other responsibilities I mean\nThe football team has been getting up at four thirty in the morning to be lifting weights or just after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled in many different directions many times problem sets are do let's say they've clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning\nAnd that just is set up for the students staying up all\nThe extended to all young people because not everyone goes to college and not everyone is staying up late in high school because they're finishing their science project they have phones and they have their social media that's keeping kids up\nAbsolutely in fact just the light the predominant wavelength that is driving that light that we're seeing on the screen is in the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky\nAnd that resets their circadian rhythms and and it makes it actually more difficult for us to fall asleep\nAnd it does so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock since the strongest drive for waking just before what would be dusk a so during evolution a we couldn't see during the nighttime\nAnd the brand send a powerful waking signal so we would get our act together\nAnd being a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything well that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times zones westward just by the light that we get exposed to between dusk outside\nAnd when we decide to switch off so much\nWell there's that we we talked about some of the health issues that arise disrupts sleeping enough we read Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep which is now out in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWill I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes or nearly seven thousand people a year die in sleep related crashes on our nation's highways is responsible for one out of five car crash injuries and are\nWilling and Matthew Walker his book you know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ads for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer dementia\nIn wars of cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attacks and strokes notch mentioned diabetes are you interested well of course it's sleep absolutely sleep keeps you then keep sleep keeps you hold\nYour leisure advertised I mean if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart attacks on the other adverse outcome\nCould lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but how do you convey this to students and it's part of the culture to see you know who can stay up the latest\nSleep one on one very interactive program in which\nFor example there's a dorm room and the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out that caffeine has a six to nine hour half life and many people are not aware of that then that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner and not realize that six hours later they still have half of that caffeine on board\nSo they get information I click on the sneakers and they find out that if they\nTake up on sleep they can improve their reaction time if they're on a sports team they'll shorten the turn time and swimming they can get more\nAll free throws in one of the things that students don't realize is that it's not just the amount of sleep that consistency in the timing of sleep so students have irregular schedules\nThey don't do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually\nThe internal clock shifts you later so when we studied Harvard students we found\nThat those who have irregular schedules even if they got this same duration of sleep and inconsistent times they were shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston and that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six AM biological time on their internal clock so it's no wonder\nThat they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or when they're trying to pay attention to the middle of the night\nWow so how do you change school life so that kids can see why me maybe an obvious thing is not have a steady group but when am I right\nSo when I had been teaching a freshman seminar every year at the end of the term the Fifteen students in the seminar have to make it had like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep healthy for example\nThat there should be an eleven our interval one student argued between the end of the last scheduled activity school sanctioned activity on the first\nAh scheduled activity in the morning or another student or suggested that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nTo looking you're working we're talking to you most specifically that students that you've got to sleep matters initiatives some bringing in Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers\nFirefighters you take this problem which twenty four percent less likely to report an injury used have as many disability days and you can trace how me you know life is just better from injuries to work output because of sleep and we'll probably similar to sit here now down to work\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shifts there's nothing you can do to help their sleep\nAnd we implemented a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour canoe in detail so we did is sleep disorders screening for example for ten minutes they fill out a few a validated questionnaires way identified if they are at high risk for sleep apnea\nOr chronic insomnia or other disorders and we refer them to treatment turns out that\nOne out of three men and one out of six women\nHave sleep apnea and that means that even if they set aside the time for this you can't breathe and sleep at the same time you you're not going to get the rest that you need and when we first came to present to them they made fun of the whole thing they brought pillows to the session a\nOr getting everybody say oh I got to have my sleep session and so on but then when we started showing them the information we feel that this is a it's a right for people to have this information to understand\nThat untreated sleep apnea for example after Eighteen years only fifty eight percent of them are still alive as opposed to Ninety four percent of their without sleep apnea because it increases the risk of cardiovascular death by four hundred and twenty percent and we've had\nAmazing feedback from people say oh my God this this changed my whole life my depression was resolved I didn't stay on medications anymore my marriage I came back together it can really have a major impact\nAnd all we provide people as information and a screening\nBut what if you just you know you want to see more and you just ... you put your head down you

we've reported that the Syrian Army backed by Russian and Iranian allies with place to mount an offensive to take a blood back which is expected to be a bloodbath\nThat Russia and turkey struck a factual deal to wait till establish a demilitarized zone around\nAdequate groups deadlines to leave so what happened BBC Middle East editor Jeremy ... is in London but just back from a reporting trip in it live on the regime side fun line soldiers and Fox host pretty remarkable I Jeremy uh some of those deadlines leading are right about now so what did you see are the rebels militants leading\nWell so far they seem to be respecting the whole thing um it's the twelfth now and the final deadline is on the fifteenth submit a couple of days by the fifteenth they're meant to move both men and the heavy weapons out of the this new GM's either they've\nBeen put together by the Turks and the and the Russians so you know we'll see but it's up to now according to the ... of course have a stake in things very well uh up to now they appear to be moving\nAnd then what happens then if it if let's say it's a a Syrian group that rose up you know against the Assad regime during the Arab Spring before radical groups came in from elsewhere and you know kind of fill the vacuum there if it's the Syrians what happens when they start leaving that area are they going to be targeted\nThe estimate is being used by the un is Ninety thousand men who carry guns are into an all of that Fifteen to twenty thousand a ... you might call die Haji hobbies I think that this ... this DMZ does it basically postpones dealing with the issue\nWill meantime here you are in the front lines where did you see there including at troops that apparently didn't want to be seen\nUh with the troops that didn't want to be seeing what Russians somewhere okay we're talking but there were a tool good about being filmed all recorded in any way um the Russians very noticeable around the terms of the physical state of the area\nYou drive along and there was one wrecked religious after another wrecked religion mostly those places a ghost towns now\nLet's listen to a little of the sound that you gathered though because in these destroyed towns around the region a you found Abu Mohammed who'd been able to reopen his barber shop astonishingly\nWithin it has always hope for a few ... of the structure of how the whole region are you seeing all parts for leaves a lot of the things that [noise]\nSee some of the costs him but from your reporting it seemed like you wandered around wondering where did these people go they'd either become refugees and nice and mostly empty towns or had been killed\nWhile I Wonder that retail muscle yet another and to tell us what what what was happening to these guys and I had to conclude that probably most of them are over the border in Turkey the Turkish border isn't very far from it liberal and I think some will be dead and others will be inside the city itself\nUp ... you know the way it was used by the regime in the last couple of years is that as they did a shoulder to deal with rebels in different enclaves\nUm to give up and they offered them a way out where they would be bust up to his lip and that's where they went and that's why there are so many guys up there yeah I Am in some cases that families as well\nUm I think though that if you drive around that area as we did talk to a lot of people you to get an idea about the way that\nThe last two in the hot out of the country it has done so much not just physical but in terms of what it does to people's minds and also\nThe way that it's um it's just destroyed the fabric of everything if you if you're in the central Damascus looks like nothing ever happened but when you go out of Damascus do you go to places like the area rounded lead then you can really see what the war has done in terms of absolute devastation on disaster\nSo what do you think happens now because it's not just the Syrian diehard rebels who are being funneled into this\nA demilitarized zone and the Islamic militias along with them that if you know taking advantage of the situation there you have the courage who've been fighting the Assad regime as well the U.S back Kurd and now we have Turkey's president airline threatening to expand his country's military efforts in parts of northern Syria\nTo take on these us that Kurdish fighters look people anticipate that the Syrian forces backed by Russia and Iran will take back it lived there will be the end of the sort of the civil war\nBut you've got a you know U.S interests Iranian interest Russian interest a Turkish interests what do you anticipate happens now\nEssentially the dangers of all the Vita is that some of these guys can stop bumping into each other in a bad way sort recently when the Israelis are shut down a Russian plane so Syria is not guaranteed peace once if you like the civil war part of the war and\n[noise] he be

I'm pretty pink nests and bright colors and you can also get in a variety of different languages people saying nice coming back to you when does that ever happen\nI think that's one of all we spoke with you know what we should link actually ... ah let's do this we should linked to a young men who had this initiative on his own of you know telling somebody that their worthwhile and it was a wildly popular so willing to that as well why not you can get like ... you\nKnow hearts and their sexual media yeah I ... yes let's do it ruin it I mean\nI have to ask you quickly about an uproar over an hour to lead a tweet a from a user by the name of blue star navy moms three she made a post saying that her son was afraid to date in me to era\nWhen he graduated number one in boot camp was awarded an award house ... but he won't go on so low dates because of the current climate falls sexual accusations by radical feminist so I vote has to take him to he responded what\nWill the festival

social media people were Mimi find him too when he found pizza ... he said that was my mom sometimes the people we love these things that how does that ... it's tennis around\nBecause ... on that with gang around his mom saying into\nAnd he said I respect and hashtags believe women and I never have never will support ... came to he's coming out of the feminist I'm uptown navies and the cat died on an ally so to take your means game is on point how will look out for him I wanted to add\nTo that was my mom he's using these two to fame wisely he thinks the lines of pay Atlanta ethically hideous [laughter]\nOkay hosted a shame on al Jazeera English I'm sure that will be a conversation if any thank you Joachim it's here now\nAnd during the surprise inspection of California's Adelanto immigration detention center officials found new says made of bed sheets and a litany of other health concerns\nThe inspector general's office at the department of homeland security published a heart hurts report this week detailing problems inside the building a private company runs it for immigration and Customs Enforcement of houses up to two thousand people waiting for the immigration cases to be decided\nJoining us now is ... she's a reporter for the Los Angeles times and she's been covering the story Blum a welcome thank you this was a shocking report to read inspectors found new shoes me to bed sheets in Fifteen cells how is that possible\nUh well that's a good question you know I think that the reason that the office of inspector general issue to this management alert\nSaying these sort of issues that need it to be addressed immediately because you know a year ago\nA man killed himself at the detention center using bed sheets and there have been to other attempts also using a bed sheets so I think when the inspectors with the office of the inspector general walked through Adelanto on this a surprise inspection and found that\nThese nodded bed sheets were just hanging from from vents in so many cells I think there was a sense of urgency is just needed to be addressed\nFor should we imply then that that many people inside the facility were suicidal or could there have been for some other reason making those choices\nYeah I I don't think so um you know people are told\nThe inspectors that they use them for various reasons they said that they would unfurl the\nThe bed sheets to give themselves privacy that they would use them as sort of clothes lines but they were also told by one man that he had seen suicide attempts using these new says and that the guard sort of laughed at them off and then call them suicide failure is when a\nWhen the attempts weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that\nWere aware of that and it wasn't the only problem inside the building by any means what else did you find [noise]\nRight so the other things that the office of the inspector general highlighted that they found during this unannounced inspection in May of this year was\n... you know one of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for years since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a ... questions of untimely an adequate medical care\nUm and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper and overly restrictive a use of segregation and you know the thing about immigration detention is it's supposed to be\nWhat they call civil detention it's not criminal detention it's not supposed to be punitive in nature and so there are national standards that sort of govern how that's supposed to\nHappen and so when you're using disciplinary segregation in ways that are more punitive that becomes a problem\nWhere we also learned that doctors stamp their names on patient records without ever seen the detainees a dentist said that he didn't have time to do ... and the detainees could just use string from their socks to flush their teeth [noise] um what is the law say about what kind of medical care they're supposed to be receiving\nImmigration detention is governed by or what are called his performance based national detention standards and not governs everything about medical care that\nDetainees are supposed to receive and obviously this care is supposed to be timely you know it's supposed to be adequate for these detainees who\nAre have no choice but to rely on the care that they're given inside these facilities and in Adelanto in several a government inspection reports over the years again since it opened in two thousand eleven the facility has failed to meet the standards of this is not the first time that that this has been an issue\nWe should point out that I Belong to is owned by a private company the GEO Group and it's it's very very common for the federal government to contract these detention centers out\nTo private companies you mentioned they have a history of problems um what is the companies saying I mean is anybody being held to account for what the inspector general found [noise]\n\n\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Washington Post is reporting that turkey has audio and video proof that he was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi constantly ... ... you wrote columns critical of the Saudi Government for the post\nAnd he hasn't been seen since he entered the consulate more than a week ago his disappearance has raised questions about the close relationship between the U.S and Saudi Arabia\nThe BBC's marked low and joins us now from Istanbul and mark you have your own reporting that's similar to the post what are you hearing\nThat'd be a source close to touch investigation of said turkey has gone documents that evidence to support the claim of state sponsored murder of ... when he entered the Saudi consulates in Istanbul ten days ago\nUm this'll Sosa tells us that um ... official position is still that stick a show gee is missing about that a section ... knows for sure that he was mud\nI'm not a backstop the American news reports and all of that audio and have a ... a video evidence the recordings shoving them sticker shock she was a northern he\nKilled but also interrogation tortured before that and they're very gruesome details coming out including recordings allegedly of him being beaten\nI'm On some reports that his body was just men but I'm the Saudi or\nOfficial was Saudi authorities are still flatly denying all the allegations\nHow reliable generally speaking is Turkish intelligence um I Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media on this is not strange communication strategy with his government hearing techie where they don't really speak directly to\nForeign media for example they and they don't actually have a ... kind of communications department but they do leak through the state media so I think what's happening at the movement features that\nThe Turkish government is maintaining a study more cautious approach\nThat for example tacky has welcomed in Saudi officials here to be part of a joint Saudi ... investigation\nOr the Saudis have proposed that is the tux playing nice and saying that we're going to we don't want to blow up on diplomatic relationship at this stage but they all leaking I'm a incriminating evidence on a day to day basis and that was tightening the screws on this\nThe ... position the question about that joint committee the Saudi Turkish investigation has to be how credible\nIt can be if it includes the Saudi Government yeah and I think that it's sort of basically being compared to for example if Donald Trump was to set up a joint somebody the crimes inquiry with the Russians I mean I I really think that they say is kind of\nUm a a diplomatic nice city on the parts of the tax entertaining the Saudis on this but they are pretty clear that they have got the evidence to back up their explosive allegations and there is some more irony here as well the turkey is pushing a case\nThat a journalist was murdered on its soil while at the same time the country is one of the world's biggest jailer of journalists are people noting that at all\nThe biggest jailer of journalists I mean yes it has been noted particularly by turkey which is such a soft spot and\nI said at techies not treating gymnast in the same way as a journalist is alleged to be ... that it's not even know if my mother during which took him out\nOr how tech is locked up on this which is obviously a also an attack on press freedom and completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on liberal values but\nBut uh yeah there is some distance do between the two cases I think here in our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which have been very very close over the years but from your perspective there and his stumble\nHow much is this case threatening the diplomatic order any across the region well I think that turkey is very aware that it that you know the racial Saudi Arabia is important it doesn't want to destroy that relationship at this stage bought a I think that you know clearly ... he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is ineffective flagrant violation of its\nSovereignty aid it won't support from the U.S and from other western governments in and taking a tough line towards the towards the Saudis and speaking of diplomacy there's one other breaking news story want to ask you about today a U.S pastor Andrew Brunson\nHeld in Turkey in prison in Turkey for two years has been released today by the Turkish government\nUh what are we learning about that [noise] yeah this is a country that produces more news then it can can see him ready and the American pasta Andrew Brunson he was detained in massive Punjab the failed coup here in twenty sixteen accused of supporting terrorists groups\nOr he has family the American government is always have always had this complete baseless and they put pressure on the tax to release him president to add one has always maintained he could not interfere with the independence of the tech is traditionally which is seen as laughable abide by critics of techie and what's happened today is that he has finally being released\nA he was sentenced to two or three years one month Fifteen day sentence which basically a corresponds to the time already spent in custody Andrew Brunson will finally be able to go back to the U.S and and uh it was the source of massive friction between the U.S and and ... governments\nAt sanctions tariffs and the plunging of attack his car and say that as well not expected to east to some extent and it will be seen most likely as a diplomatic victory for the Trump Administration the BBC's mark low in Istanbul thank you so much pleasure\nNow back to the U. S. where a candidate in Georgia is hotly contested governor's race has been hit with a federal lawsuit Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running for governor and he was sued yesterday by groups that say his office is jeopardizing the votes of some minority residents ... campaign denies that it did anything wrong\nBut his opponent Democrat Stacey Abrams is calling on him to resign as secretary of state\nJonathan breeder is counsel with the Brennan Center for justice is Democracy Program at the nonpartisan group\nThat advocates for voting rights Jonathan thanks for joining us things are out of the reporting is that camps office stole the registrations for fifty three thousand mostly black and Hispanic voters based on a law known as exact match what can you tell us about that\nExact matches the policy by which if all the information on a voter registration form down to the ... or ... doesn't match perfectly with existing data and driver's license or Social Security information the voter registration form is put on hold and in some cases rejected entirely\nDo most people on that list no that they've been excluded\nThey're supposed to get a notice in the mail but oftentimes people don't receive those are our understanding what they need and so the burden is and placed on the voter to fix this problem which in other states without affects our eligibility or or voting at all\nOkay so in total camps office a secretary of state has canceled nearly a million and a half voter registration since two thousand and twelve\nHis campaign is saying that he's making sure that only legal citizens cast a ballot and that it has never been easier to vote in Georgia um what what do you make of that are you aware of any voter fraud problem in Georgia on a significant level\nThere's no significant evidence of voter fraud in Georgia and although\nVoter list maintenance is important there is no connection between aggressively purging voter all the way Georgia has been making like his worst carrots Kemp\nAt the blame here on Stacey Abrams his Democratic opponent\nOr she started a voter registration group in two thousand and Thirteen called the New Georgia project in camp is making the point that in the process of signing\nThousands of people up through that project they did a sloppy job and that he was just pulling out those improper registrations I mean it does Stacey Abrams in her group deserve any blame for maybe doing this in in a poor fashion\nVoter registration drives our a vital lifeline to get certain communities who don't have as much access to government offices registered to vote if there is information missing or sometimes happens\nThe states should do everything they can to resolve those discrepancies with Georgia is doing is making it the voters burdens resolved that problem instead of trying to fix that themselves\n[noise] do you think a candidate who's running for governor can independently also be the secretary of state\nWhile it's happened before in other states I don't think this is a unique situation I think that\nOne of the concerns is that as secretary of state or Mr camp has made\nSome controversial statements there was a statement he made several years ago expressing dismay about some voter registration drives and he's been accused of politically motivated investigation so that's certainly a concern in Georgia specifically\nAnd just to be fair I Want to add something else that campus said he says the Georgia has broken a record this year for voter registrations with nearly seven million new voters added to the rules um I Want to also ask you to expand this beyond Georgia how common are exact match laws around the country", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "12"}
