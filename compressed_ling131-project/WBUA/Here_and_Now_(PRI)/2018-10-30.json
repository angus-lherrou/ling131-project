S.\nAnd Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says he will introduce legislation that mirrors what the president wants to do\nJoining us now as Alan Gomez who covers immigration for USA Today Hi Allan Hi German and birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment which ah reads all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states and of the state where in\nThe reside so how could President Trump or undo that by executive order\nTo very good question um you know you just read the fourteenth amendment that was preceded by the civil rights act of Eighteen sixty six and both of those were affirmed in Eighteen Ninety eight but as the U.S Supreme Court\nWho to throw in one more quote wrote the fundamental principles citizenship by birth within the dominion was reaffirmed the most explicit and comprehensive terms\nSo it's a pretty high legal hurdle to to climb when something is in law in the U.S constitution and upheld by the U.S Supreme Court but um there have been some conservative I'm sort of anti immigration groups in recent years who have seized on the phrasing that you said subject to the jurors to extend their of\n'em they're claiming that somebody who's an undocumented immigrant in this country is still a national of their home country they're claiming that people who come here um through birth tourism so a Chinese think of a Chinese national coming to the United states when they're pregnant\nGiving birth here just so that their child has US citizenship and then returning back to China they're claiming those kinds of cases um do not fall within the fourteenth amendment um but as we've heard from those from the amendment\nAnd from the Supreme Court it's very very high legal hurdle\nTo climb well and there are many who will look at this and say we're a week before the midterm elections and this is just a political move that he wants to excite his base even if he doesn't have any intention of actually doing this or he knows that it will go nowhere in the courts\nYeah the timing is incredible because it's not just this I mean you look at the fact that he has been hammering on the migrant curve and coming up through Mexico for weeks now I'm declaring a national emergency and just this week that his administration announcing that they're going to send five thousand\nActive duty military troops down to the U.S border to stop them that's on top of already Twenty one hundred National Guards men that are down patrolling the border to stop what is now about thirty five hundred migrants um that are trying to make their way up\nI'm so there he's really seizing upon immigration I mean this is a strategy that worked for him obviously in twenty sixteen and when they're trying to combat what many are predicting will be this blue wave in this midterm election he's just going back to the playbook that worked for him and saying hey let's just hammer down on immigration over and over and see if that works\nShould be mostly clear tonight lows in the mid thirties tomorrow mostly sunny as well ice in the mid to upper fifties right now it's forty six degrees in Boston this is W.

hundred nine four seven\nAuto this is Sharon now\nWeek to speak with Alan Greenspan the man who led the Federal Reserve from Nineteen eighty seven to two thousand six he served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nWell I think it's basically a combination of not what the fed is doing which remember a short term interest rates and it's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note and say the thirty year treasury bond they've moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts it already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with him about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America history which he co authored with Adrian wool drudge I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nOh have more than two it's more directly related\nTo a structure of the company for example the so called rust belt is populated largely by industries which are very old\nSilicon Valley for example is a classic case of the very you know there are very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whether you Gregory in areas where it was sort of being prices mean something or whether you're on the west coast to\nWhere the issue of high tech stock prices a little one everyone talks about so one thing about this country which is very diverse and it depends where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge of this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of the new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell when you look out into the future\nAll we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity flying uh well basically because fear you know when to deal with fear it is very difficult to classify\nBudget can you can look at the consequences of it on the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore a capital investment\nAnd uh just inclination to take risks\nIn the book and suddenly I might add discussing was all over the long term outlook is all about you know we say that the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements and so having a significant negative deterioration over the long run\nThe reason for that is what the data on a critically show\nIs that you know in title ... which are mandated by law\nOf gradually and inexorably driving out gross domestic savings in the economy\nDollar for dollar on so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is our current account deficit and uh we're now built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners but what this is causing this\nIs largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging right now the official actuaries of their Social Security system say in order to get our Social Security and retirement funds and balance\nThey'd have to cut benefits are twenty five percent and definitely into the future to do you think they should do that [laughter]\nFor civil rights I think it's going to happen\nI don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there so long as you don't do it it would cause the that overall the total government that go over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation\nWhere you say inflation is a big problem out there who we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about for example interest rates and fifth century bc Greece when not terribly different from where they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise if for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nKept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nReason we should've rates low as you point employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't see the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below the usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept falling below four percent with no impact on information\nSo if does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand\nI think that what we specifically learn strangely for the first time in two thousand method\nIs there a two conditions are hired for a crisis\nOne is there a toxic assets like a secured ties to mortgages but the critical issue is how those mortgages financed and what may or finance or by leverage that that's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nWell either one of the general you know that that was a very extraordinary period in court narrowed it would've been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve keep breaks down during the period of very low unemployment that was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nFor jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that is going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's it's not lower productivity but it's an issue when you get the sort of tight labor market wage rates begin to rise of necessity\nAnd it's for wage rate rises which affect the cost of production and hence induce corporations to start raising prices basically because their costs are going up\nThat's where the problem lies there hasn't really been growing up\nI Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talk about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all explain what that means\nMore creative destruction is a process by which people do two things they continuously invest but the investment is displacing older equipment but more importantly it engenders unemployment\nAnd uh it's to process which are unfortunately is a necessary condition for growth and standards of living\nYou have to let bad things happen in order for the overall picture to be better in the future\nWell because the very nature of progress economically as we point out on the book is the result of creative destruction which means essentially for example when a open hearth runners and been in the steel industry\nA whole slew of procedures within the steel industry circle best swimmer furnaces they became obsolete and they were scrapped but they're also workers associated with those particular\nMostly sunny as well tomorrow hives in the mid to upper fifties Thursday partly sunny highs and the upper sixties now forty six degrees and

Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers was born a he moved to scroll hill when he got married uh Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrels all\nWell that this is really sad day in the neighborhood [laughter] um I Know that I'm afraid enjoyed the community the diverse than the diversity in the community of we're all hell\nAnd um he loved walking down the streets and\nI'm noticing the trees and then the various temples and synagogues and churches um that all made him feel at home um the bakeries that delicatessens and he often commented that he could hear yet ... Hebrew and it doesn't have the language is spoken\nAs he walked down the street of that community\nYou actually learn uber didn't he he did yes well do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on scroll hill\nI'm In the neighborhood I think I'm certainly had\nSome of the philosophy of the squirrel hill neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy neighbor that the neighborhood of make believe but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another which certainly I think with reflected to him is through the ... community\nAnd probably I'll say the electrodes community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence\nOr we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and the puppet Daniel tiger had this question for lady ...\nFascination me [noise]\n\nHave you heard that word a lot to\nAll and I didn't know what it means [noise]\n[noise] oh somebody getting killed in a\nSort of surprised way which happened\nYou know steadman killed that other men\nI Know and a lot of people are talking about it right now many people are talking about a lot of people are\nScared about it you know [noise] I'd rather talk about some other day he like [noise]\nThat sound or courtesy of the Fred Rogers company ... lady Evelyn goes on to change the subject to uh to that but Daniel tigers says he doesn't feel like a picnic\nA she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers taught kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw in Pittsburgh\n[noise] I think one of the things that he taught us all is that it's a right to have these feelings to fear fad and to feel angry and to be afraid that there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to grim naps where\nIt's listening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the help ... the\nThe emergency response team the police officers and firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses everyone um has surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize\nAnd identify with that they identify with\nThe helpers and not those who who cause destruction\nSeen that line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days look for the helpers\nAs part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence lets us and\nI've been terribly concerned about the graphic display of violence which the mass media has been showing recently\nAnd\nI played for your protection in support of your young children\nThere is just so much that a very young child can take without it being overwhelming\nWhat do you think Fred Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of that is to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but I think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gates was that we have to figure out how to make good mashed attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the final instead of course undermines that message\nSo looking for the help help to see the good that is still around us\nFor grabs you said that we have one life to live on necessary and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful where we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children ... and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative way [noise]\nThat were British ... what do you think Fred Rogers and you knew Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWell I think she would be horrified by what happened in ... and he would he would be concerned about the children see would be concerned that they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions in the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn that the feelings are normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express their anger and find ways to express sadness I'm In ways that are not harmful to other people\nUm and I you know I think that that comforting neighborhoods [noise] um I think he would also said we need to turn to our neighbors and neighbor in the greater sense of the world that everyone who lives on this planet is a neighbor\nHum and reach out and and to provide support to our neighbors to people of all backgrounds and oh phase symbolic races I'm sad that we can live together on this earth in very productive ways\nWhat's this been like for you living right they're outside of Pittsburgh\nAnd it's very hard I've been a meeting and talking with some of the teachers in early childhood programs to make my own background it tried that in our late childhood\nAnd so I've been talking to some of the teachers in the directors of programs um ... states that the

criminals\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let out do you live at first it's my turn can get outraged by measuring the get out it's my time you're going to get out shy prouder gets my okay here's Cordray getting a word and we are the\nWorst state in the nation the Trump Administration CDC reports said we have the highest increase in ... last year and he stayed in the nation All right so\nWhat we're doing right now does not working what am I for I'm for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there are obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nIt sure is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day or because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand\nAnd one of the things that we are that issue one that\nThey were both referring to speaks to is it would\nTake some of these low level drug crimes and take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those and it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say um you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but\nUh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment\nFor doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so there is a real debate here\nOn uh how you actually treat people\nWho have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for\nThem is that likely to be the opioid crisis is that likely to be the big issue for voters or what are people what's on their minds\nWhat seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even like the wind would tell you that\nI'm even though he's been fighting against it um Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid and because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions\nThere trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and where they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you\nWell at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind\nThat the most recent polling shows us that that it's you know very tight and ah we've got eight million voters of we do have in this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen\nIt does seem like there's a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal in Ohio\nAnd it is a big deal it's always a big deal\nThat Ohioans have approved at a ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to play out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have\nA a good good opportunity to get in there and help draw those lines and I have some effect on it\nHas joined goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking about the governor's race in Ohio Joe thank you thank you representatives from the Indonesian airline lion hair have announced they'll meet with us plane manufacturer Boeing\nTo discuss what caused a seven thirty seven ... a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning\nThe plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash\nJoining us now says Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know the shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWater has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people are saying that the plane was essentially Going Radical you're doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like something\nWith air speed indicators and a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know is that the played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going you could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that has happened in my mind goes to a\nA crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight more for seven yeah uh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things or mechanical issues some bad weather pilots maybe not reacting properly but\nUh you know as much a cause of anything else was what are called the ... tubes\nOr which measure help measure the air speed weren't functioning properly and the pilots\nOr you know didn't know that they were basically stalling the aircraft so are the very early indications are perhaps something like that based on what seems to have happened day before but I have to emphasize we don't know exactly what was happening on ... flight\nNow when you hear about a brand new airplane and this was a brand new airplane and flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they haven't tested it out enough and and there may have been a problem that didn't come up yet and here we are\nYeah it's it's so new I ... and and yeah you know legitimate to say that on the other hand you know we've all flown on on brand new airplanes and in fact you know this this max eight is is the newest kind and there are already hundreds around the world\nAre flying you know for that matter airlines like American in southwest here in the U.S airlines like Air Canada and west jet just north of the border\nAnd and you know of course this is also very rare for something like that so sure at this point you ... you could construct all kinds of ah you know ideas about why this could have happened\nAh but you know the newness of an airplane in and of itself shouldn't cause something any more than\n... you know a very old airplane as long as it's maintained properly\nBut we're not talking here nobody is talking about pilot error nobody is talking about whether anything like that they're they're looking investigators it appears or looking mostly just at the mechanics of this airplane\nTomorrow high in the mid to upper
