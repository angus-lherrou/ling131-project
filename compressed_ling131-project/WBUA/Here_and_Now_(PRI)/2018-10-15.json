B. U. R. Boston and Geico celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for drivers across America more information on auto insurance available at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto\nAre three weeks away and pundits and politicians are working hard to make predictions about how they'll turn out we often look for predictions tell us what will happen in politics and the economy and technology and in other things but as the saying goes making predictions is hard especially about the future\nSo how do you do it well joining us now is Dan gardener who's the author of future babble and super forecasting the art and science of production Dan welcome\nHi Jeremy so why is it that we humans always want to know what's gonna happen in the future when it's really hard to do that in a lot of ways\nYeah uh it really stems from a really fundamental need we have a need a psychologically rooted need for control a sense of control of our environment [noise]\nNow what do you need for control of your environment you need to know you need to know what's happening now or if you're looking into the future you need to know what's going to happen and if you look into the future\nAnd you've got important questions on your mind and all you see as a swirling vortex of uncertainty that's deeply disturbing you have to our race that uncertain and one way that we erased uncertainty is by turning to experts in saying please tell me what's going to happen next\nWhen the experts that I think of when it comes to productions that get it pretty right at least in the not too distant future weather forecasters yeah I have an app that tells me in ten minutes it's going to start raining exactly where you are right now um but you know where are we good at it and where would that it it\nWell it's interesting that you highlight weather forecasters because of course people tend to make jokes about weather forecasts as they always get things wrong yeah ... exactly the opposite in fact weather forecasting is the gold standard of forecasting\nNow the big difference between the weather forecasters in one of the reasons why they're so good and so many other domains\nIs it the weather forecasters know how good they are and they know when they cannot do so many other demeans that's not true people use vague language like something's probably going to happen or that's pretty certain or there's a good chance that\nA and nobody keeps track they don't keep score and so if you look at the big famous pundits who tend to dominate the news whether it's politics or economics or anything else [noise]\nUm they don't actually have proven track record scientifically scored track records we don't know how accurate the are in the same way that we know how good a baseball player is by looking at his batting average\nIn is the goal of a forecast to change the future to be able to make a decision once you know what's gonna happen or once you think you know what's gonna happen that will change the outcome\nThis is an absolutely essential point very often when you talked about forecasting people talk about well how do you make an accurate forecast blood very very often when forecasts are made\nIt's not actually accuracy the people are interested in there all sorts of other reasons why people make forecasts so you know a pundit on television might be making a forecast because it's ideologically congenial for the audience that very often happens\nOr they might be making a forecast because it's shocking and it's interesting it entertaining [noise]\nUm there's all sorts of these other competing interests\nIn one of those is to cause change so for example if I warned that some terrible thing is about to happen it's not necessarily that I Believe that is in fact the case it may be that I'm trying to spur others to action in order to prevent this suppose a catastrophe [noise]\nUm so we have to be careful when we're looking at a forecast we have to ask ourselves is this person just trying to give me the straight goods to be as accurate as possible or do they have other interests at stake\nWhat are some big flops some production failures that stand out in your memory\nWell I always liked the state of the Nineteen seventies or the golden era of failed predictions um it started really in Nineteen sixty eight with population bomb by Paul Ehrlich was a huge bestseller basically said that there will be mass global starvation within a couple of decades [noise]\nWrong or and then the Nineteen seventies were absolutely stuffed with the most amazing forecasts and and happily for humanity most of those forecasts which were wrong we're all dismal they all said we're going to run out of oil [noise] um well it reminds\nMe of Y. two K. right that we all thought the general is going to end with two thousand came along and nothing happened\nThat's that's exactly right Y. two K. was another one there is a very long litany of these things but you know a one of the unfortunate aspects about forecasting is this if I go back to old forecast and say hey do you remember what that guy said ten years ago well let's take a look at what happened and it turns out it's wrong [noise]\nI can tell you from experience that people kinda yawn [laughter] because it's an old forecast who cares about old forecasts old forecasts are old news ... but if time passes in somebody's forecast happens to be right then they will be introduced as uh\nListen to this person because there and tell us what's gonna happen next and as a result the rule with expert predictions so often it's heads I win tails you forget we had a bad\nRight well you think about that every time somebody who figured out that President Trump was going to win when much of the media thought that he would not when a when he did win you know there are a few journalists out there like I said at look at my tweet from you know I said it was going to happen\n[laughter] yup and you know look it's a there's an old saying bug me a mutual funds you know you start five hundred mutual funds and you to bet on all sorts of different stocks and ... by sheer happenstance one or two of them will hit big\nAnd then you hold up your one or two that hit big and you say look at this what a brilliant invest right and well forecasts very often function like that you can't judge the quality of a forecaster by a single forecast\nThat Dan gardener who is author of the book future babble and coauthor of super forecasting the art and science of production Dan thank you so much for joining us thank you and let us know what you think of forecast political and otherwise at here now dot org\nNow to the environmental fallout from one of the most destructive fires in California history in late July the Carr Fire swept through parts of the city of reading and the surrounding area\nToday residents are faced with burning hillsides burned hillsides and more

switch from Fahrenheit disintegrate and it can take very high temperatures and not taken out of my bag a well they're called adopt part of the echo families and in my household we have a a big echo in the living room and a little dots here and there throughout the house\nLet's be honest I uh I I don't like your wife to hear this that you do refer to this as your new\nGirl than it is yes he go is definitely my new girlfriend the fact of the matter is that she wakes me up in the morning she sings me to sleep at night ... sounds like a girl friend to me like what\nWhat is life like there's so many more devices when you see them but I'm just wondering what life is like in your house with the ... it just is a revolution for you but I'm also thinking that there's just got to be voices going all the time you're talking to\nAnd asking her to turn a light on or off and you know the radio on or off or you know testing your blood or it just it feels like there's a Greek chorus fire you know there's\nA lot of chatter that goes on in the house no doubt I'm very lucky that I Know braille so I'm a portion of my access to information comes packed the least so nobody gets to what's going on\nBut one of the absolute phenomenon in my household is I get out of bed first had to the bathroom I turn on the shower the sink flush the toilet and step on to my talking scale 'cause I don't want the rest of the household here with the bad news or the morning is from that talking scale\nSo we learned the mascot we control volume and with the new eco family only the one closest to you responds and so you don't have this problem has seen something down the hallway only have it change something in the living room yeah that kind of thing that\nI mentioned frail a moment ago no braille\nHasn't been around that long a just a couple of hundred years and it's still under development we recently adopted an international standard for English Braille because they're the Brits wrote braille differently than the Americans than the Australians [noise]\nBut the big change in braille is what's called refreshed will break I'm going to turn on this orbit reader mhm\nIt looks like a hand held

decrease it changed the polarity of things might see things that are white and black than black on white defined I can switch that you can also take a picture with it\nA at a distance bring it closer to my face and be able to control that magnification as well and if you do have a large TV in your living room and you can attach this tobacco and use it screen\nBut the device that's on your camera this on your device and really large an image so grandparents ... with low vision can see pictures of their grandkids I'm so this makes it very portable for them to do that like I feel like\nWe know you have to catch the bus that's an application that it can help you find I stopped learn a rival departure time is blind square that's a GPS application just like foursquare but I Want to see the device it helps you know the color of your clothing\n[laughter] so the color identifier that are brought to show you last time costs three ...\nOf these six wow and this is maybe a temp for science so that one yeah it's like a car key fob exactly I'm going to hold it against my time\nYou know like orange that's right yeah\nDark red stripe [noise] me [noise]\n\nNow um when did it at my pants and they say [noise] very dark brown that lying I'm wearing a looking on black paying a brain and [noise]\nYeah that tells me guess what the batteries dying [laughter] when is it that\nFar off wow so I'm now manage my own parents with shirts with ties in my household something that\nI always had to rely on somebody else to do in the past I Want to see the classes that get help with so\nMany of my regular designers shades hear them and to put on a pair of glasses but they have a camera mounted just above the no no way\nSo I'm now going to take a phone it's specifically a over rice on the phone that has only one purpose and that's to do what I'm about to do with it for Brian I ready for service and now if I double tap on the home button on this phone calling in Iran agent\nAnd connecting to the aging cutting this just go out\nHey Cody Brian here I'm I'm doing a demonstration of Iraq for public radio Hi Cody and across the wage here is my interview were and can you do me a favor described the pretty lady\nChurch here she is across the table and you know I can see\nHow it ... me out [laughter]\nIs waning colonel English her right hand and I have a huge classes [noise] yes [noise] white ... like a jacket with a caller she's wearing glasses and as a kind of had that on as well\nHow do you do ... do you did pretty well you're going ... can I just have\nTo question what kinds of situations ski you usually deal with like just to give it a couple of examples I'm sure people get in real trouble and need your help\nIn the forecast mostly cloudy today scattered showers highs and the lower sixties more rain tonight with Lowes in the mid forties to Mars partly the mostly sunny ties in the mid fifties right now sixty degrees is often at one for\nFunding for here and now comes

models homeowners could read reviews of local pros and book appointments online\nAt home advisor dot com and Geico\nOffering motorcycle an RV insurance more information available on motorcycle an RV insurance\nAt ... dot com or one eight hundred\nNine four seven auto\nIt's here now back to President Trump's comments last night on sixty minutes continuing to question the importance of addressing climate change\nLook I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nOthers are pushing forward in fact there fighting now saying that fighting climate change can be job producing and we're running out of time according to last week's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change that's just about a decade left\nTo take unprecedented action to reduce to reduce the gene impacts of climate change\nTheir report recommends reducing current and missions being released into the atmosphere but also capturing the carbon dioxide that's already up there what's known as negative and missions so let's take a look with Gregory netted a professor of public affairs and environmental studies\nThe ... school of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin Madison professor technologies will be needed to do this but one of the easiest way the carbon dioxide out of the areas plans right because they just suck it out\nYeah so growing things so using photos synthesis to take C. O. two out of the atmosphere and then store it into would in a tree or in plants that has the potential to remove\nBillions of tons of fuel to from the atmosphere so that's really appealing it all of these uh schemes to remove ... to have negative have some concerns about them and the biggest one\nWith planting more trees is that if you're planting trees um that's land that potentially could have been done something else with if it's if that's something else as growing food\nUm that's a real concern because that's one of the biggest impacts of climate change is worrying about crop yields in the future and if we're going to have food prices go up because we're using land for food\nAnd using it to ... to a that's a negative a negative effects and things like growing trees that we think are pretty benign um have negative impacts because it's still has to be\nSo large and then also we know that dead trees only store carbon for so much for so long and it may not be long enough\n[noise] yeah there's a permanent issue with\nI'm In trees that I'm is not such an issue for storing it underground for example\nSo let's move on to some of the other ideas carbon capture storage what are some of the ideas there\nSo the idea of carbon capture traditionally has been you take a power plant that's using fossil fuels and instead of venting the CEO to into the atmosphere which is what we do now\nYou find a way to collect it in the flu gas and compress it put it in the pipeline and stored underground but that's a way to avoid see what's going into the atmosphere\nWith negative emissions or the way you can actually\nRemove CEO to the atmosphere using that scheme\nBy again planting crops and instead of using the crops for food you would use them for energy it takes you to that's in the atmosphere\nPhotosynthesis will store that CEO to into the crops than you burn the crops in the power plant and instead of putting that seems to back into the atmosphere you're going to do the same thing compress it and stored underground and\nThat has the potential to remove a billions of tons of ... too and in this case stored underground word tends to be more stable and will stay there as long as we needed to do with it has a similar negative side effect that we had with planting trees in that\nYou need to use a farm land for growing those crops so for using that land for crops that we're going to use to store CEO to and put it underground we're not using that for food and again that could\nUh creating food security issues which is something we want to avoid what not\nAnd by the way I just said feeding thinkers chicken provocative new book and lightened it now and you know he talks about the fact that a lot of this is going to be on our technologies that we are you know we don't even have yet that we're going to come along but we're not just sucking it right out of the air\nYeah I mean that's an appealing one to do as well so this is using chemical prophecies and you know we've already been doing this and things like submarines or spacecraft where you need to remove the CEO to the humans are generating just by breathing\nAnd so the idea is could we do that at an industrial scale and capture ... lives in the air capture that's due to compress it and then store it underground that is appealing one of the most appealing aspects of that is it doesn't have this large land impact\nThat almost every other one of the schemes has the biggest downside so far has been it's been dismissed as a prohibitively expensive so something like three or four times as expensive as these other schemes\nClaim or actually a Swiss started up and they say the conflict between six hundred and eight hundred for metric kind of see how to capture I'm getting another company in Canada and protect closer to two hundred and fifty per metric kind right it's catching thinks\nThat's expensive and just to put that into comparison if you look to kind of the average price of CEO to over the whole world now I think the number of about five dollars is about right there is other places it's high like in Sweden and then you you've got prices in twenty to thirty dollars but overall it's about five so that's that's way higher like by a factor of a hundred\nBut I think what's interesting about those technology is is the concepts come down so as you say climb works did this first the world's first demonstration plant a about a year ago and that was six hundred dollars per ton of CEO to their next plant plants they're saying they can do for between a hundred and hundred and fifty dollars per ton of CEO to\nThere's another company called carbon engineering and Kennedy has things that can do it for about a hundred to two hundred there is a U.S company called the global thermostat that uh is doing its first demonstration in Alabama this year\nAnd they think that'll be about a hundred and fifty dollars per ton and they have plans to get it down to a hundred after that so\nThis idea that the costs of technology makes it impossible and we should just um dismiss it it seems to be I'm falling away as we look at some of these real plans being built without severe problems and with costs it seemed to be starting to come down so there is a potential\nTo really get the costs down to make it affordable and not have the land use impacts one of the biggest concerns that I Would have is to do this in a real way\nWe need to be removing billions of tons of C. O. two by mid century um\nAnd so we need to be doing this on a large scale pretty soon\nRight now so there's three companies we've mentioned\nThat's it for the whole world and in terms of commercial director or capture and I I think that adds up to about four hundred people in the world employed by these companies but that really doesn't fit with the scale the challenger facing so that's that's the real challenge for direct heir capture it's how you scale up\nFrom three companies doing on the order of five or six plants to something like six hundred thousand plants is which is what we're going to need and the next five or ten years\n[laughter] ... well are you getting the investors excited about that and maybe the future but look again Steven Pinker writes sat him last year and a nice kind\nRight it takes up CEO tuition weather's too at alkaline clouds of the oceans to dissolve more C. O. two in the water\nFertilize the ocean with iron should celebrate photosynthesis plankton\nAnd again ... the atmosphere in different ways what do you say though to however tag on a fellow of the things at MIT who says in effect that there's a danger that this might lead to complacency in reducing it feel to emissions if\nPeople start thinking well we're just going to scrub it out of the atmosphere\nYeah yeah there is this concern and it's um it's sometimes called uh the jogging term for it as moral hazard this idea that if you have this technology available it's kind of like an insurance policy and then you'll engage in risky behavior and in this case it means you won't reduce the missions uh enough\nI I actually think we're not we don't really have the the luxury of dismissing this negative emotions technology is something\nThat I'm able to take away our incentives I mean it's kind of like you know an insurance policy for a house insurance or fire insurance or something like that where yeah maybe there is a sense in which if you have the insurance will be less careful about fires in your house but on the other hand\nMost people still want to have a insurance because it's it's worth it to them and it's worth it to society and I think that's kind of the way we have to have to look at it I I think the other thing is you know we're we're not reducing emissions enough already even without talking about negative emissions so I think\nTo say that the reason we're not reducing emissions us because we've got this a breakthrough technology that we can use in the future I don't think that's um that's really what's what's limiting us and I don't think it'll be enough just to have the negative in Michigan so we really need both for me to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "15"}
