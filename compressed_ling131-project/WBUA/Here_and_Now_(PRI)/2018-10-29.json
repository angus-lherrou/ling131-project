hate crimes across the country jak rose in his presidency the American Jewish Congress jak words fail you know we're so sorry about this ruined his community\nBut has this been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nBy first thought was this is a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tax not only in the Jews but Americans in our values and the shock of it all was\nJews have been living in America of comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country see changed since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities and here we are again one more time\nOr the ugliness not only pop to the surface that does periodically\nBut it seems to grip a good number of people in America\n[laughter] well uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred Jews make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the countries where they just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents in twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous year have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we've seen more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols on the lawn Jewish cemeteries are schools\nThe SAT on Saturday is quite a shock to the community and to America it seems to\nAnd you know we all have these are the gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out I Hope you're feeling that\nSupport from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing except you're saying that you are also aware of a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know it's a small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize so political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe are those that that had been spewing out some of this viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that'll send a message in shock the system\nYou know the answer to this or a political leaders they have the microphones most important political leaders of president as a bully pulpit now is the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about\nAmericans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to you know our\nRepresentatives in Washington are governors and mayors and you know it's a local issue if we can mobilize yeah with a loud voice to make sure that they understand that\nThis is not the American way than Americans won't accept it and they'll go to to the polls that necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin as\nWell uh actually some would say we're hearing the opposite from the president have been\nFor a while we know that the government in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by those marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August of twenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that Jews are pulling the strings somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches it's hard to hear that led to listen to these marshes again in Charlottesville\n\nSounds on the documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter was allegedly shouting in the synagogue that had to be telling\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston\nAnd other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of\nThe wrong song being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having a big responsibility in this because of his views and his political rhetoric we should all be hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make\nIt was just happened to watching Clinton sharpening show no TV yesterday how shocked when I see yeah\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that show's been showing you wrong tone has been\nWhat am I can uh you speaking of Louis Farrakhan leader of the nation of Islam\nYou're a just a few weeks ago the Jews are writes why don't you speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and\nRepublican but our political leaders should also be speaking out against hatred coming from all sides from all parties we can maybe hold president a little more responsible\nYou know he has to suits he has the biggest microphone she's going to have to live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties wall leaders don't just get a pass\n... President Trump said that there were find people on both sides in Charlottesville and permission from I ... I don't think\nThat you you can talk about Nazis [laughter] to me All right and Americans I just don't think the comparison makes\nAny sense either of us Americans\nCan't grow in President as American

for fiction but secret Nunez is excluded novel the friend is about suicide and tell us about the writing world with the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a highly queen great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend ...\nAnd they mourn together to good news spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing [noise]\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flurry O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments in literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the areas apartment his tail is lower like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve\n[noise] we do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him and she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll\nNow I remember I had to put a little dog sleep once and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this ah so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nI Am sides made yeah cats you can't say for sure that that what happened\nWell when the when the shot started an injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and peaked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating ... and then he did more afterwards or\nAs I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs hands because we we kept and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have thought about at this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean this whole chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yellow you presume okay embracing here is there's a book with a dog somebody's going to happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life when you thinking there\nShe has a life outside the dog even though during this period of mourning [noise] she doesn't do much besides to take care of that is that do I mean he's he's her whole emotional lives during this period\nSomebody asks where the party are near the woman who's in love with the dog\nWith a giggle mammoth but also if you are a writer and this narrator is a big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person\nWho in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google this I should Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they've seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think I'm needs a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen\nAnd to the child is having reading difficulties the dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't\nChildren yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throats because of something powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times\nTo our narrator we're not gonna give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend is\nAll along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nBoy could be boats or maybe it's a friend is the narrator\nYeah and what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my ... my married are really does this is something I definitely share with my married her she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal ... and you don't dominate cats you dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that tore a cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that ah her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend\nYeah dogs can be unbearably poignant she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying and the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head\nAs they do you have her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's [laughter] that's very moving well and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and took it I didn't have to ask you it is about writers in writing in the community and the teaching of it um [noise] can you give us one tip for\nThose who want to wrestle the story to the ground\nThe piece of advice that I really like is the simple don't\nFlinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft\nBecause they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it and that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be\nWell I Would say if anybody wants to see how you can write a book about a dog that for the longest time in the book isn't really about a dog and then suddenly it all about a dog in you know with such a\nPunch pick up the friend um and how much of this is you you've told interviewers this isn't my writing class [laughter] you know I'm not that frustrated with student writers but is the suicide maybe someone you know because we read the germ of this was people who you knew who are contemplating suicide\nOne of the reasons why I did want to to write this book was because there were several friends that I had let me know the suicide was something that was on their mind it's not like they were planning it next week or even next year but it was something that he started had started thinking about and thinking that that it eventually would happen\nFunding for here and now comes from that where the readers of not lie to simulate somewhere accelerating the pace

years Glenn tell us why\nWe wanted it to be basically a basic understanding about mental health signs and symptoms and then to know you have support from the community\nWell so what are some of the the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans are best curriculums to put forward\nHow would that be different for a national audience you know the Bronx is very urban upstate New York very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural area suburban area in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of the idea of therapy and mental health being on the table\nAnd I'm not going to pick out let me know that a small town in upstate New York or may not be as widely used correct\nYeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health corrupt comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they're already teaching but what we did do in response is we were able to create a resource center a school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the state department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so\nPeople can go to our website and look in and see that there are lesson plans out there are dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools\nYou got that teacher training there and other tools so willing people it here in our data word but it must be an example like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what like a specific part of the curriculum and then what might Wendy in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on kindergarten first grade second grade it's just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially to very early age\nAt this idea of talking about feelings developing an emotional awareness so that when trouble comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's ah got the tools to deal with it\nAnd exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now for an individual to have that\nThat emotional intelligence to have a basic understanding so when they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness nominee\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people\nLive with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment so this is my also funnel people to wield treatment as opposed to education and did you notice opposition there are teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects with kids\nTeachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response that look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about here is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want\nTeachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma talk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues and we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and\nPeople were realizing gee educators families that\nYou know this is just a normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people that will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's going to let him and he's a CEO of a nonprofit mental health association of New York state what are the groups that advocate it for the new law that it's just gone into effect acquiring all public schools to have some form of mental health education Glenn thanks so much\nSure I really appreciate Robin\nA profile now of an artist you may have never heard of her name is Mary course from Southern California her body of work goes back to the Nineteen sixties\nDespite a steady career she hasn't gained much recognition outside the art world there's never been a comprehensive museums survey of her work until now the beacon north of New York city and
