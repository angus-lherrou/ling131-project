B. U. art out of\nWork and it really does make a difference that we rely on the community for Ninety five plus percent of our funding it not only keeps us independent but it also maintains that perception\nOf independence remember you've probably heard if you follow the news\nPeople attack other news outlets for their ties to corporate owners and those attacks may be untrue sometimes but it's enough to plant a seed of doubt on some folks mind and for you when you're listening to W. B. or an NPR you can do with total certainty\nThat we are independent of those kinds of influences and when you're having those conversations with your friends who may be even more skeptical of the news\nThan yourself you can point to what you hear on WB you are as air and know that they also see that reputation for credibility whereas they may have questions about others and that is part of what you're giving to protect its credibility that reputation for independence at W. B. Y. dot org or one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven\nI remember very early in my journalism career I had a an older journalist telling me he said the most important thing you have to do is avoid even the appearance of impropriety and all of your dealings everything that you do and I I think for the vast majority I Can't speak for every one I can speak for myself you know\nBut I think you're a WB you are I think everyone subscribes to that idea and I think that's what makes WB you are\nAnd public radio in general a really special place to work in a really special source for news because we don't have\nAny kind of a you know outside influence on what we report to you it's I mean are outside influences you the public that's I mean it's right there in our name where public radio were by the public\nMeans we're also for the public but it also means that every now and then we have to come to you and ask you to do your part to help keep a strong independent and vibrant thirty nine hundred dollars now to raise my two o'clock we can definitely get their call one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or go on line at W.\nB.

B. U. R. dot org [noise]\nWVU our supporters include the cabin in Beverly friday ten time Grammy winners and vocal hall of famers the Manhattan Transfer standards and their new release the junction tickets at the Cabot dot org [noise]\n[noise] it was a part about the last game they got me my male friend\nThe Ford said in her testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee that the worst part of her alleged assault was the laughter from her to alleged attackers they were having a good time she said at my expense my friends said when he heard that\nThat was with through them back over half a century ago he was seven I'd gone to visit a cousin who moved to another state there were three other boys they're who immediately made the new kid their target\nWe're going to catch treat you they said and started chasing him he wasn't even sure what that meant but he ran they tackled him pin him down he said just like lassie Ford said she was held down a horrible feeling\nBut then his tour mentors pulled off his pants and with their fingernails began to try to carry out their threat while they left and my friends now well over sixty pretty strong he cried at that memory\nA lot of people have had memories triggered by the national debate in the past couple of weeks Brett Kavanaugh strongly denies that he assaulted lousy Ford and many of his supporters are saying well they don't think he did it they believe someone else might have attacked for they believe that\nAnd others do as well as you've no doubt heard hotlines are ringing off the hook with people identifying\nThe national sexual assault hotline reported busiest day in history last friday the day after the Judiciary Committee hearings with more than three thousand calls seven hundred and thirty eight percent increase\nOn a micro level at Chicago's rape crisis hotline calls tripled\nAnd ... heads the clinical program at the YWCA of metropolitan Chicago they run the city's hotline and all three of the city's rape crisis centers she joined us from Chicago and welcome thank you Robin and what has it been like try to describe what the phones there have been like\nIt's been very busy so the day of the hearing we received about thirty calls which is a nearly doubled from the weeks prior and five times as many calls as two weeks ago for say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase calling him right what are people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to a doctor for it they're experiencing a return it as a nation we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to a doctor for its testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions of the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody at a flash back you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that\nYeah absolutely little flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey are right back in that moment today if they feel their heart pounding or they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's not expected and survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this sort of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pinned down and I had another friend telling me just imagine you regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with all his weight leaning on her putting his hand over her face more than likely covered both her mouth and nose\nAnd this friend had me do that and I'm I ask anyone you know who can now do this and you can't breathe luxury Ford said she thought she was going to accidently be killed you know in other words this isn't about sex did did people do people when they come for help it when they call for help do they talk about that aspect of it\nAbsolutely they're talking about all the details of of their trauma they're talking about\nYou know the feeling of being choked of being\nOf being and mobilized of being frozen\nWe know that really experienced trauma our brain is going to react typically in one of three ways we're going to fight we're going experience fried or we're going to fleet and what part of the Ford is reporting a in her testimony is that there was an aspect of being frozen as well less intense feeling of fear and we're hearing about it as well from the survivors that we work with when you\nSay people have a flashback she's also explain to us that people called to say that they thought they were seeing Dr Ford you know a college professor read I didn't sing too and she was Fifteen and they did the same thing what does that mean\nThat means that their their body and brain their neurobiology literally takes them back to that moment and we know as we talk to survivors about their trauma narrative as\nThey are able to define frequently what the worst part of that experience wives and so it might be the worst part related to the the disclosure it might be the worst part related to their response of the alleged offender but we know that sort of\nThat trauma is stored in the brain to literally ... presents themselves and re experience that trauma an incredibly intense way\nWell some of us thought that she actually sounded Fifteen at times and I didn't know if that's what you meant that she was actually going back to that moment\nThat was certainly my a sense of her when she was testifying I wouldn't be able to speak to a what that was exactly like for her but yes yes yeah look\nThe majority leader of the New Jersey state house an eighty year old the Retta Weinberg after watching the hearings revealed that she'd been grouped in forcibly kissed by man when she was Thirteen Shireen Ghorbani a Utah congressional candidate went public with her sexual attack when she was eight years old\nBette Davis President Reagan's daughter revealed that she'd been raped by music executive Chris Wallace of Fox News anchor went on the air to talk about how his two daughters confronted him to tell him that there were things happening in their high school that he didn't know\n... you know what's happening to his daughters maybe not the full attacks that we've been hearing about but something very troubling to him so this has started this national conversation\nBut on the other hand Brett Kavanaugh as strongly denying that this happened Christine Blasey Ford is not believe a lot of people including it seems President Trump who initially said he found a credible but last night as you well know in a in a rally mocked her lips was new then\nHow did you get home I
