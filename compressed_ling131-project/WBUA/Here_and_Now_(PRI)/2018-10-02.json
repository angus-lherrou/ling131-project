Smith who a Ford says was there\nA it includes drinking is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which\nAh his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which are that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which\nAn incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\nWhich is something that a cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin ... country\n... view I don't know if it's ... are being asked how do you pronounce that first of flatulence we were sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same for the same thing as your book page back do you have the same meaning it was actually\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence ... age sixteen hundred year book page on I'm getting\nA bump that's not what it means well it's sort of\nUnclear what moved means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty widely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious a reference to drinking that was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily\nYou know he he said that the beach week Ralph club which is pretty obviously right in reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is ... however it relates to drinking the fact is that the euro country makes very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nWell and just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says it moved reversed anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kavanaugh about another term and is your book devil's triangle here is devil's triangle\nDrinking game has that played three glasses and a triangle\nAnd\nYour plate quarters you know okay so ... what\nAbout that one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are just devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups or engine to try and go the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so uh this is again this this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of uh of suggestions about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search a books that they have indexed I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports\nYou're listening to the point nine W.

sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nIt's here and now and we've spoken here over the years about early retirement\nA couple who sold their home traveling in staying in other people's homes to save money\nMillennials who work day and night to earn a million dollars and live off investment income well there's now a name for this it's called fire financial independence retire early and fire it on fire inspired in part by looks like your money or your life\nAnd stoked on blogs pod cast and read it message boards sharing ideas like how's hacking you buy a home rent down all the rooms you crash on the couch\nOr work in a place with free food Scott ... and his wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then\nLet's let's got tell that he joined us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome\nI thanks for having me well nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast with one of the gurus of this movement Mr money moustache this is Pete adding the what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a lot see change your lives you move you\nStarted saving you would uh tournaments had to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on the podcast\nThat was very interesting to me at that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalked about those stresses you are creative director at a creative agency and I'm imagining the homes got nicer and the cars got nicer and the clubs you belong to that nice or is that was was there that kind of escalation going on\nThat's exactly right it was unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town\nAnd our our costs were much lower then and you know as we got older and we had a baby or you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves up moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but that's where it a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know beyond the\nFinancial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so to hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as well so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell the other thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator\nSo uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning\nFrom now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement calculator kind of understand our situation and when I first plugged the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in our eighties and uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it that's what put her over the edge\nOkay so this sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you've gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really like my job in it for me it's not about work for me it was about a ring myself from this idea of mandatory labor\nYou know there's passion that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple of things first of all and you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around that what'd you and your wife did just to keep the story going is it's a major part of this fire move and it's called arbitrage\nYou move you had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now\nBut I just kind of call out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot of you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're writing a book about your FIRE movement haven't you just replaced your creative director job with film director author [laughter]", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city":
