B. U. R. I'm ...\nI'm Peter O'Dowd this is here and now one person has been arrested today in South Florida in connection with suspicious packages sent this week to prominent Democrats CNN and people critical of President Trump we will be watching as that story develops throughout the day\nThis morning to more packages were intercepted one addressed to New Jersey senator Cory Booker the other to James Clapper the former director of national intelligence and it brings the number of potential mail bombs to twelve\nAnd now just eleven days from the mid term elections many Americans are talking about the need to lower the temperature in national politics\nJoining us now is Dominican mounted narrow NPR's lead politics editor heightened medical care so obviously we're going to be keeping close track of the story and learning more about who the suspect is who has been arrested what we know for sure though is just how devices these crimes have become in American politics and I wonder if you can tell us why [noise] well\nI you know I mean how polarization it hasn't been at an all time high for quite some time uh you know you look back at a couple of different arrows in American history maybe the Nineteen sixties and the civil war I come closest or worse than than today but there's not much in between\nUh and you know President Trump let's be Frank has been somebody who has\nCreated the sense that the press is the enemy of the people he continues to say fake news at his rallies and a point the finger at the pen that we're all kept in at the rallies or behind the riser is I was at a rally in Houston people were very nice to me going in\nA happy to take my questions a lovely people to chat with and talked to by the end and through the middle of it was a crescendo of just anti a media stuff so that is what comes to be seen and President Trump has been somebody who has been a take no prisoners\nYou know I'm kind of politician for anybody who disagrees with that but to medical the\nPresident's started this week by calling for unity and then he's come to this place that you're describing now and want to hear from a White House press secretary Sarah Sanders who was speaking on Thursday\nOr if the price of that I could not have been more presidential yesterday when he spoke directly to the American people hit condemned the violence let's not get lost in who is responsible for this heinous act\nIt is the person who made and set the suspicious packages let's not forget that that is ultimately the person that is responsible and will be held responsible by this administration now clearly\nThe president thinks he's being unfairly linked to the person who did this but why hasn't he been able to stick to that message of unity that he started this with\nI mean it's pretty typical pattern of President Trump's I mean this is somebody who anytime he has criticized or become the sort of a focus of criticism\nThen he doubled down he tripled down he digs that uh you know that trench and just going to fight for every inch\nAnd you know in some respects with our standards that is true ah the people the person who committed this act um is going to be held responsible a it's a Justice Department that the president overseas and that person is largely responsible\nAre forecast mostly sunny today with a high and you're fifty clouding up tonight rain lows

three of the world series in elites nights and you can bet that wide I kids are going to be watching and dreaming of their own careers in the majors many of those kids leaving the country that sends the most foreign born players to major league baseball the Dominican Republic\nBaseball greats from one Marshalls too big Papi David Ortiz to Pedro Martinez Twenty years ago when Pedro Martinez was pitching for the red Sox he founded a charity to help young people in the Dominican Republic\nOne of those it helped go to college in Boston was an athlete named Carol Lena\nEventually she met Martinez and they got married\nNow ... runs the Pedro Martinez foundation the charity provides health care and nutrition for kids and the DR and it is building a charter school to teach young ballplayers job skills in case they never make it to the majors\nShe says only three percent of kids recruited by the majors ever play on a team and that's a blow on many fronts\nA lot of our baseball players a lot of a young prospects do not finish high school and then when they're released from any team and they want to go back into life they don't know what to\nDo so they can be signed by a team I mean the lucky ones will be signed ... you're saying they never actually may make it to the team exactly and they're probably incredibly talented too\nOf course it happens when my brothers they were top prospects one was for the New York Mets and the other one for the Seattle Mariners\nAnd we should say you come from a baseball family either you're both your parents were players your mom and your dad and they started a little league and the ... that it's gone on for thirty seven years now still operating correct okay so your brothers had high hopes\nYes they receive a really good signing bonuses both of them did\nBut they were among those Ninety seven percent that didn't make it one he was really prone to injuries and the other one he ... in the majors but did not continue there was a cut and no other factors\nSo both of them were sign at sixteen and they couldn't finish high school\nSo it has been painful sometimes to see them not being able to to find themselves in terms of life and okay so I was relief and I'm I'm I'm twenty seven on twenty six I'm not going to go sit\nIn a classroom with high school kids I'm I'm always exposed to this type of situations because of what my parents do and because of who ... and\nIt just became more clear to both of us that we needed to help players that have been released\nAnd they don't know how to go back to society to their lives\nWhat could you do for somebody who's older like that like the age of your brothers or are you just trying to do a stopgap measure by helping out young\nPeople who may hopes you go on to major league baseball but probably don't have that much of a chance\n[noise] so what we're developing as curriculum that would have them be calm technicians in any than it has to do with sports and the marketplace that means nutritionist\nProfessional trainers massage therapist\nPositions that are related to the sports industry and they can go back and get a job either with another team and Emma Lee or maybe an amateur level but it's a way that they can go back into the sports world and make a living for them without being baseball\nPlayers but is it realistic given the amount of jobs that are on offer there that that would be the answer for for so many of the kids could be realistic\nAnd as American all thirty teams of ... will be have academies where they signed the players so there is a high demand all the time for work\nSo the world series is going on right now and one would think for young people in the DR that there are so many sing desk going to be me one day [laughter]\nDo you and Pedro when you go there and you go there are a lot find yourself having to say to young people you know I really hope so but probably not so have a plan B\nWe do it in a way that it doesn't kill the dream\nBut grounds them what do you do when you say just exactly what you said that baseball is not everything\nThat there are other options in life but then they see Pedro yes but then they see Ninety seven percent of others that did not make it\nAnd it's becoming more of a cautious conversation topic and the Dominican Republic about the difficulty\nOf becoming a baseball player and how it's not only enough for you to have your raw talent there's so many other factors that go beyond your control even the fact if you find a coach and triple layers awfully that doesn't like you\nIf he doesn't like you he's not gonna give you play time period\nYou started out wanting to be a sports broadcaster you married to a sports star you are now in charge of this foundation that is clearly changing lives in the Dominican Republic something I imagine you couldn't have anticipated\nSynthesize the reward you get out of doing\nSo I see it as a domino effect I was helped at some point my institution\nNow I have a commitment to the kids and my country to do the same so I'm One but I ... percent five hundred kids or maybe a thousand or maybe two thousand\nAnd that other kid then I'm going to be helping or that two or three or four they represent five hundred or one thousand or two thousand\nThat's what it means to me I can help and other ... I can help another page or do they can become professionals either through sports or arts and they can eventually also do the same that we are joined\nThank you currently not Martinez thanks thank you\nCarol Lena Martinez runs the Pedro Martinez foundation if you're looking for a good film to see this weekend and you wanted to try something completely different how about the house in the middle\nTo houses on total loss was a well kept in the middle spills\nOnce you leave your house\nIt's a black and white film made by the federal government in Nineteen fifty four the atomic age and it cautions Americans to keep a clean and tidy house because it will be better able to survive and atomic bomb\nThe film is just one of three hundred that the library of Congress is making available on line that collection is called the national screening room and it includes digitized historical films commercials newsreels all sorts of moving images that cover more than a century of cinema dating back to Eighteen Ninety\nThe curator for this collection is Michael ... who leads the library is moving image section Hi Mike\nHi very nice to join you today tell us about that film a first house in the middle of\nThis one is particularly interesting because it's actually the second version of the film not a lot of people know that the sequel the first version of the film which was going to be on the screening aren't very soon our promises a pretty straightforward civil defense film\nWhich talks about the you know what would happen to a dwelling in a nuclear blast what could you do to help protect your house\nBut the second one the one that you're talking about is a lot more prescriptive and it argues with some fervor that your house in a better chance of surviving a nuclear Holocaust if you paint\nAnd the version of the film that we have on the screening room now is sponsored by the national cleanup pain up fix up bureau which turns out to be of folks here a name for the national pay lack or in ... associate here I don't know I maybe maybe there's a connection there\nSome of the the really interesting ones as well or home movies you have Judy Garland taking lies I'm In LA to a birthday party um you have a garden party with Iran and George Gershwin and uh who happens to be there as well but ah Fred Astaire and this is all candid film it's pretty amazing a lot of them are silence unfortunately but they're\nReally incredible and um and then some of the more serious items that you have come from New Israel's\nAll Americans are equal in the United states coast guard and its training school in Michigan [noise]\nTraining and the coast guard isn't all the armed services begins with a manual of Minnesota's with these young men who some day with a man or a rescue and watch our shores for any spies to attempt landings on American soil\nTell us about a one of the newsreels especially intended for African American audiences in the U.S\n[noise] you know this is the all American news was produced in Chicago and we have about thirty three issues are on the screening room and they all come from the world war two era of and so as a consequence for quite celebratory the African American contributions to the war effort\nI'm like oh what's your favorite of of the entire collection\nThey're actually a couple of films made by a woman named Louis ... send the first as a was shot on July Fourth Nineteen sixty eight at the reminder day picket in Philadelphia in front of independence hall which is a gathering of gays and lesbians who were just seeking fundamentally quality\nAnd then two years later she makes a film of the Christopher Street liberation day parade in Nineteen Seventy that film was called gay and proud and it's also and the national screening room and of course what happened between those two events were the stonewall riots in June of Nineteen sixty nine [noise]\nLoans and the low forties rain when tomorrow much of the day in the forties to around fifty right now forty three in Boston [noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from carbon I offering secure data protections illusions for growing businesses including automatic back up for services in computers higher availability and disaster recovery solutions\nAn automated data migration learn more at carbon I dot com and from Sen gauge working to make higher education more affordable with a sin gauge unlimited subscription students can access over twenty two thousand each text books online homework access codes and study guides\nSin gauge unlimited C.

just a a\nA a political manifesto written on the side of his white van and stickers or where he has a lot of references to vice president uh parents and of course President Trump\nA and also against

plastic bubble wrap that there could be fingerprints as well as possibly DNA I'm so authorities were were moving very quickly on this and we're focusing on Florida\nAnd we can assume that they tracked

reaction\nWell it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane a lock I knew it headed north from us but it never occurred to me that it might be a\nHead into French forget shoals and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunning\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures of hearing now dot org but to tell us about it and why it was important to you\n[noise] well it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of a undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant for the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system\nAs small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis was low so it's easy for them to haul out of there is a sort of upper region to the island where the turtles could I'm bigger Nestle lay their eggs safely\nAnd they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being the the style in which was the largest\nFor those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nests there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island you can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above\nThe waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hold out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise] um and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands\nThat can be problematic because much of the viewing area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses can they turn to the north to some of the other ... ah there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low lying it was Sandy loose and did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane did this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those\nI figured that this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century\nUm it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence I didn't expect with a location this far north that it's due to vary a strong chance of being intercepted by hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes to that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actual is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or the other problems that you foresee happening because of that\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think ah earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in northern Mary Alice island uh at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour\nAnd um you know this is an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category ... says last year hurricane season and twenty Seventeen scientists are now picking a with the growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speeds stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that is diamond could come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand um was a moved by the hurricane to the north and north east the\nTrade when waves may push that sand back\nTowards a word originally was and we might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a falling sea level around two thousand years ago\nWe are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reform in this island or don't exist\nThat ship Fletcher a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us yes thank you\nAnd on the conversation now with connections to climate this one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven asked into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAnd chasing chowder easy executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he says if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work he says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because of focus on growth causes us to prioritize\nThe wrong things\nAre lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made in extra activism than there is in and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searching the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policy that's shipped about the way the imagine politics delayed imagine economic\nIs not so much do we want growth do we want less wrote it what do we actually want from Britain usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates what they mean something like\nOh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity um but I actually know I can do nice fair comparison right um they are very high growth rates in China we have very high growth states in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly\nA lot of what we associate with growth um can be achieved through other means distribution on means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talk about\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really [laughter] happen\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty no in fact there's like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change\nGets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet\nRight like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible today right have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice what\nKind of movement I mean like one give give me one thing okay so I could sort of not going to eat red meat any more but you're not stead of that you become part of movement that would do what\nAnyone who is emphasizing any movement that is trying to move the needle to give more power to popular sovereignty and less to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money\nIs going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying but it is necessary thought how movement give us an example you can think of to sort of a tendencies one is to sort of rise of the other sort of reinvigorated left or whether you associate that with\nA democratic socialist America or other movements um that is a very important part of the conversation\nAnother would be very local organizations but with a sort of very grand division or this is the group's cooperation Jackson, Mississippi who are really trying to build a sort of ego um sustainable society from the ground up meaning ... meaning that they are working you know both to set up a sort of\nA system of greater democratic government they are trying to and they are succeeding in some ways to build a sort of ego sustainable city from the ground up including agriculture including manufacturing\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

composer and guitarist bill for his al is a singular talent is all about collaboration is weekend is playing with Ron Miles circuit writer trio on the west coast\nBill for zealous worked with the LA philharmonic Elvis Costello Paul Simon and many others that on his latest album called music is built Brazil does it alone he played every instrument the album's a blend of earlier works in New competitions one of the new pieces change in the air Mm\n\n\nMm\nUsing riff on the phrase music is good model for the album hit the top of the charts early this year we spoke with Bill for example about the album this spring he's appeared on more than two hundred albums more than forty as a bandleader so why go solar this time around\nThat's been a challenge for me to play a loan from the first moment are picked up a guitar\nThere's the social aspect with you know I've always been a shy person an awkward but with the guitar you it was like this magic wand that she's bringing every one together and so\nAll along but guitar has been about interacting with other people it's never been I Know there's\nYou know there's just the tradition or whatever with especially with with the singer songwriter the lone tree the door was first you know [laughter] but it's something that sort of\nHanging out there in front of me that I Try to I'm just trying to get it together to be able to do that you know like when I was in school I had to take a speech clip that like talk about a nightmare situation\nIf you could only of hadn't interact with you\nYeah yeah me to do the charging as long as I've got that in my hands and everything's cool\nSo then why another solo album I mean what you're trying to kind of force yourself into your well\nNot at all you I don't want to make it sound like that either it's because over the years it's become just another aspect of what I Do I mean I the first time I tried to do a solo concert was it was in the early eighties\nAlone and it was really just so uncomfortable and\nIt was a drag and I swore I'd never do it again but then I thought no I got to get this together so a year later I tried it again and then I kept getting better and after a certain point it was like wow I can actually do this and it started to feel like like music [noise]\nWell it seems like the right time to talk about uh thankful\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComing this time like this what comes to note or [laughter] it sounds backwards the inspiration\nFor the ticket you say it's it's a tribute to the musician the platelets in your life and your doctor usually it's just a\nA melody just a very simple United saying I'm\nWriting it but then like one thing that happened on this album there's this song that begins and ends because\nPretty stars and they may decide that they and that was something I quote unquote rose all\nThese things that book and the album ... and then made to shrink the when I wrote it I recognize that it was a very very common court when prior to the recording of this album I was\nPlaying at this club called the stone in New York and I was playing the music that I Would record it so I played that song in ... a guy at the club one night he said oh I Love that was really great version of\nJessie J what what do you talk about some of the\nPlague you this recording and that was like oh my God\nThat's Hussein ... almost the same mentality and then I checked it out and it\nWas like you know it's just an old traditional songs like I'd probably hurt the keys to treat you play it when I was five years old or something like a mock isn't making yeah I'm I'm I could be in trouble now but I think it's a you know it's like a public domain kind of\nThing and then there's so much music float around I don't know where it comes from whether I'm writing it or it might have remembering it or what is it\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nI Love it if you talk about track for which is what do you want to listen to\n... ... ... ...\nWhat you're hearing right now is just one court that I played on the guitar that was\nCaptured frozen and sustained and then I\nWent to the other process so they're sort of a drone\nOne now\nThat was originally from the guitar and then that's going to like a five Prado\nPedal becomes really kind of that shit\nBut then I'm using that as the backdrop for\nJust the one story all over the parks and a\n\n\n...\n\n\nYou know I was trying to stay in the state of not being sure what was going to happen you mean as you can you know yeah well the composing is you know happy now these are\nPieces [noise] they've never feel like they're finished anyway but what I did to prepare for the\nAlbum was actually played six night at the dawn in New York every night I brought in a pile of music and I tried to play things that I wasn't familiar with\nEither old compositions of mind or new ones and I tried to keep myself just off balance\nAnd that's what I wanted to continue on into the studio I didn't want to have it all figured out like mapped out what was going to happen I didn't know what instrument I was going to play didn't really know anything when I went in there\nYou know for somebody who it sounds like you would in your younger days hide behind your instrument that takes a lot of confidence to now go in and not know where you're going to end up and put yourself in the stranger unusual or difficult uncomfortable place intentional well\nBut that's when the the really happens I mean that's the thing about music it's like when you're dreaming you\nJump off a cliff and you you\nJust start flying ... that's the best feeling was music for me is when\nYou can take these chances but jumping off a cliff but like what's gonna happen if you\nPlay the wrong note you know you get older it's real but you don't get banged up too much [laughter] what a song with did like us to go out on here\nIs that one Monica journey which I wrote for my daughter\n[noise] first time I recorded the song was just about\nA month after she was born it was my first trip being away from her\nTo Oslo to record with home\nFor motion and jumped sermon had this song no title we played the song and Paul motions it sounds like a daughter
