her eyes on the sky once again today she is launching a new initiative called look up for one day today Jason wants people to upload photos of this guy and record their reactions to what they see\nMe jealous and joins us now to talk about a welcome to hear now thank you\nThis app sky fee and upload photos tax videos audio recordings of themselves experiencing a the night sky what are you hoping that will do\nWell we're asking them to share what happens when they look up at the sky daytime are nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside looking up will help us to understand maybe a little bit more about each other just so just a tiny bit more connected around the planet so\nYou know some people will look up the sky and they will feel love they'll fill whole fill fill some people may feel afraid they may still wonder are expensive and how they express that\nIs what we want to capture and we want to have a shared with people in real time so it's not just you're going to take these photos and you've got to put them up we're going to display them\nTo the world in real time on a digital globe that people can spin and they can look at it they can expand they could go to different folks around the world so I can no in Houston, Texas what someone is thinking in New Zealand\n[laughter] so I I have to say I love looking up at the night sky and in fact in the last couple of martyrs die period yeah for the night sky right in the night sky well but but in the sky period and and in the last couple of months we've been able to see for planets or every single night to Mars Saturn Jupiter and I'm Venus\nAnd I've I've taken great pride and telling people about that but the other feeling that I often have when I look up because I live in cities disappointment that I can see more because of there's the light pollution\nBut I I guess the thing is what do you see and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were say what people are we're even seeing our impact of on this planet\nAnd so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people said we're always talking about SARS right\nBut it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this ... layer of light that ... is our atmosphere is this planet that warns us in cools us and enveloped us with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected\nTo the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet and we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nSo it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change [noise] well\nI Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we have these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge\nBut we don't use them at least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster\nWe really care about each other but that carried only happens when we're come face to face that\nI can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to this guy something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you now as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have [noise]\nI actually have a view of earth that I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up\nAnd imagine that some child on the other side of the earth was looking at the same thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way we were calling the ads that\nA ... right in the sky selfie and that's sort of like our connection between the sky you know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here now dot org and learn more about what what you want them to do in terms of this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions why we have you because you if you were in space you're the principle of the one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nDo you think that we're going to need to leave the earth and the next hundred years\nSo let's I went on to your starship is about making sure the capabilities for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of uh the governor has in terms of\nYou know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it\nBut here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet we can forget about anything else and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we gotta send right right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet well then counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is really changed fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form in what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship\nAnd the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out as a crew how to live together that means that we don't foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happens is that the people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference\nThere are now are a number a small number but a number of African American women who have gone into space but you'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you\nSo it it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up in space\nAnd it's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything [laughter] because I would've thought that we would have had\nLots and lots of other people going up but being that\nBeing the first one was covering the world is going to say what I realized that my responsibility is including other people\nBoth in yes being space explorers whether it's being the the rocket scientist to suit technicians you know are being a crew members to involve them in space exploration\nYet even as a port in is making sure that we understand that individuals on this planet have a right to be involved with space exploration that they understand the impact of this technology and how profound it can be to help us build a better world\nFunding for here and now comes from

now secretary of state Mike Pompeo said this morning that he wants to give the Saudis more time to finish investigating the disappearance of Saudi journalist or Markus showed gee before the United states decides how to respond\nI think it's important for us all to remember to wherever he wants\nStrategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia that continue to be important counterterrorism partner [noise] they have custody of the two holy sites are there and important strategic alliance of the United states so we need to be mindful of that as well\nThe United states also has important economic ties to Saudi Arabia and joining us out of talking about that as Robin fires that host of the punk house full disclosure Robin let's start with oil how much oil does the U.S import from Saudi Arabia\nLook that's about Thirteen million dollars of imported Saudi oil and that's a you know about four percent of the dollar amount consumed it's actually not that much when you consider all of the developments in the U.S shale patch this game has completely changed over ten years\nAnd what about us government bonds we've been hearing in recent days that the Saudis own a lot there one of the biggest foreign buyers of us treasuries\nYeah look it was last clocked at a hundred and sixty five billion dollars of US government debt this summer which sounds like a lot but then you look at the likes of China and Japan which have more than a trillion dollars each\nThese are the two biggest foreign holders of U.S government's securities they could if they wanted kind of hold us hostage on that but it cuts both ways the Saudis they really can't do it a oil shipments our dollar denominated for the most part they need a stable dollar\nThey are very threatened by too strong a dollar so it's a situation where you really have to put it in perspective\nAnother important part of the relationship that has come up is arms or the president of the United states has mentioned that the Saudis by billions of dollars of arms from the U.S he says a hundred and ten billion that number is disputed but then we heard this\nFrom a a fan of President Trump's evangelist Pat Robertson who spoke earlier this week on the seven hundred club\nWe've got an arm of steel of everybody all the pain of is like one of the hunter lining their dollars and change and they don't learn a lot of jobs I don't think a lot of money coming to our coffers and uh it's not something that you want to blow up willy nilly\nSo Pat Robertson they're telling President Trump maybe not to go too tough on the Saudis if it is found that they have something to do with a ... death\nSaudi Arabia still counts for less than one percent of United States international trade through the summer and when you look at arm's you see that hundred billion dollar figure bandied about it's actually three point two billion dollars of defense exports I think the president and the secretary of state to kind of want to secure this great relationship and that\nTrump winter Riyadh he posted the Saudi prince here and he had these enormous sales and that stuff that he could sell to defense contractors in a in a

high cat three low cat for which is somewhat unusual for inland hurricanes but this is becoming the norm although a lot of places and people will realize that they stole it does affect people that deep it ...\nIt when you got stole all of this magnitude living as fast as it did it held together a lot better yeah and that's why we got such an impact\nWell and the impact included you stand your home was hit\nYes it was it was a heavily damaged and pretty much it it it is destroyed the the structure stood the hell's basically over pressurized and blue boredom all evolve we're hoping to get some some adjusted today\nYou know well I'm Sorry to hear about that but we know you're you're in good company they're just give us a thumbnail of what Mariana looks and feels like\nIt does look like I have a Twenty one years in the military and it it's the damage is it just off the scales that village Dale almost every tree has been affected shipped off halfway up in it it's a landscape I've never seen people coming back that it used to live here and come back so that we should do\nWell the county appraiser Carla peacock till the Tampa Bay Tribune that she's guessing that Ninety percent Ninety percent of the homes and businesses in the whole county Jackson County were damaged she's using ... an aerial pictures is is that your sense\n... that we ... we had a clue to go out and take a look and they gave us estimation that approximately five hundred and eighty two structures\nSeverely damaged four hundred plush or completely destroys you're looking at a thousand structures have been just damaged or destroyed\nWill someone with Gulf our spokesperson said this isn't to restore that had it's a rebuild of the entire electrical grid and we understand is a patchwork of city and a cooperative utilities\nAnd then after big storms in two thousand and five and six utilities were told to do much each inning improve the power lines me you know maybe I'm put some of them underground to prepare for these storms do you think there was a failure to do that or do you think anything could have been done\nRight I can say personally and professionally that the power companies did everything they could do\nI can tell you a liquid ethically but they do an unbelievably also difficult job\nAnd they have had very aggressive programs to trim back those trees to upgrade the grid and I see people putting Paulos underground and yes that is a good idea but it also causes his own unique issue when you do that but no the power companies have been I mean I can tell you\nHave done absolutely awesome job upgrading\nWhat are some of the issues because I I think we heard in one report that the rise in his out in one area but it's because they're underground cables were affected\nAnd that's happened because people don't realize fiber ... between titles and our biggest problem with that was that the towers stood the cables stood is just they were so much debris now they could not get back to ensure the propane types refill for the generator so the generators stopped so they were not transmitted\nLook you've got the personal here but also the professional what do you think\nShould happen a measure to improve communications among the utility companies and another to fund a study on storm response failed in the state legislature and twenty Seventeen do you think the state needs to get back to you know some form of high level um emergency convening on what to do going forward\nWe're looking at an infrastructure in this country that is fifty some of it's a hundred years old we need to take a very hard and fast look at all are critical infrastructure issue we've got to do to fix it\nLike I ask you run and just briefly um does they're all have to be more of an acknowledgement that that something is happening because of climate change\nOut all over his shoulders climate change is it is is just a natural process that occurs over the years\nYou don't think this is I mean you're looking at an hour inland from the coast right a town wiped out and you know every scientist worth their mental saying that uh this is a direct result of warming waters\nAnd and I'm I'm sure there might be some issues with that but I'll be honest with me at my level is not a question of climate change is a question of changing the climate of people getting ready for these things and I can almost guarantee that this will change the climate of my community and the attitude of those in this area\nWell uh Rodney ... and they're in Jackson County in Mariana Florida we wish you the best case thank you very much\nWell parts of the country are lucky enough to be in Paris season who want to take a closer look with here now residents chef Kathy ... who's in the studio Hi Hi Robyn you don't have to say I'm One of those people I Love pears I think they are an art form I have to pay our cookbooks pictures of pairs and all I Do is use them and salads we blue\nCheese said well your whole pair world this is about to get blown out of the park\nAnd I say so about ...\nWell the most common one that we see in grocery stores is that on Jew or mans you um there is a red and you and then there's also a bright green line which is kind of an egg shape\nThey tend to be soft juicy they're great Rob they hold up the poaching and baking as well and you're going to find as I describe these that\nIt's an incredibly versatile fruit most or all of them can be cocked as well as the raw and they are\nSome white if not completely interchangeable how dark brown ones that seem to have a tougher skinned okay so that's called an Asian pair and I caught one up for you right there they are very crunchy very tart\nSweet also these are best eaten raw Timmy and Asian pair tastes like\nA pair and meeting with a water chestnut and it's got that wonderful crunch and a little bit of juicy nests and\nWonderful and salads wonderful graded also Bartlett another very common for a ride him very sweet red and green as well they are ... they are wonderful texture for poaching what I Love about them is they retain their shape when you cook them\nThere's also boss pairs same deal very or see flavor and boss parents have any long gated Mac which is really fun because when you poach them it has this elegant long to talk about the poached because we have ... we did it seems so hard I'm really glad you said that\nAbsolutely show you how wrong you are okay All right here's what I did reading I peeled to pair but I kept the stem on yeah okay I peeled it okay with me naked naked and I took a couple of sugar ... and a couple of white wine and two cups of water and I boil them\nI could add a cinnamon stick I could add some fresh ginger to that\nI let it cook down that's called the simple syrup mhm\nI place my naked as you call them tears into the syrup and I let them cook for about twenty five to thirty minutes and what happens is the pair releases its juice into the syrup\nAnd the pair than cooks in this week delicious ginger syrup it can be made well ahead of time it keeps in the syrup you can do that for breakfast\nAnd you could eat that as part of a salad but you certainly could serve that for dessert you don't need whipped cream it's healthy it's light and I think it's so refreshing\nRight right yeah but the thing about Paris is that they swing both ways they're savory and they're also clearly sweet so I made a savory salad that's a little bit different than a normal\nPear salad I took 'em in this case I Believe I use a Bartlett pair might peel did I put a tiny bit of olive oil salt and pepper on it and I roasted it in little wedges and\nThen I have fresh spinach and fall greens and\nI put my roasted pear around it then I took some French bread or baguette toasted it into thin slices and spread blue cheese on top\nAnd I ... in a little bit of maple syrup see you have crunchy green tart\nPungent from the blue cheese and sweet and voluptuous from the pears in the phone oh and there's also sun dried cranberries seasonal specialty in the vein of grad okay we have this what is this this is an upside down\n... that you probably heard of upside down pineapple cake and it's very similar I used a variety I use comments I use a um\nFor a rally pair which are smallish that means trout in German and it's got a wonderful from ... flavor and then I also used a ... pair so I melted some butter and brown sugar and let that cook and then I laid the parents down and that\nTonight down to the upper twenties in some spots

Corrine maybe not a household name but some think it should be and that's where we turn for this week's DJ session a ba Corrine edition [noise]\n... is host of plastic mornings W. I. L. out in Urbana, Illinois Dick welcome back\nJeremy it's great to be\nBack thank you thank you wanted us to start with the menu at from the string quintet in eat major this is played by the Smithsonian Chamber Players [noise]\nVery familiar to know this was actually made famous by the Nineteen fifty five movie the lady killer is about a group of these that rent an apartment from a widow in London and then they say they're a string quartet that just want to use the room to practice or this is a song that they play I've heard this in a lot of movies since then tell us about it [noise]\nIf anybody has ever said they haven't heard anything of Luigi book because we have in the day for his peace and in our time it became famous in the Nineteen fifties in that film but I understand that in the late nineteenth century\n... the ... that were made this piece went viral and it's time you could say there were range means for\nA Mandel lesions for piano for saxophone for ... choir with Latin text added so this piece has been popular\nI have the fun thing about the lady killers and to use in the film this was a word that's written for a string quartet to violins viola\nCello was an additional cello\nNo there's a joke about the film it's either an error in the film or it's an additional joking that these crooks pose as a string quintet with an additional viola and not with a cello so somebody should've been onto this that these guys are walking around without a second cellist\nYou know the other film that it's in one of my favorites is ... this is what they play when they go into the fancy restaurant in Chicago and try to get in [laughter] whether or not supposed to be\nBut it's it's been in a lot or I Want to listen to actually to another version of the same piece this is the saint Paul chamber orchestra with Bobby McFerrin conducting an on vocals [noise]\nYou know\nWho\nYou know when I step Bobby McFerrin on vocals I was waiting to find out what that meant exactly but there you have it that he's not singing necessarily but he is a humming along to the to the tin\nBobby McFerrin as being Bobby ... and I think it's a fascinating ah arrangement of it for our time if you like this piece you should know that Luigi ... wrote over a hundred string quintet this is one simple minuet from one queen ... there's a lot more there to explore\nHe was writing these for the younger brother of the Spanish king\nDome release and a while he was doing and he was writing string quartets for royalty and playing the additional cello himself so he was doing this so that he could play along with them and then he would\nAlso right stream queen tests for depression king who was a cellist so he had a lot of opportunities to write to string queen tests and string quartets in addition to other cheaper music\nWhat do we know about what influenced Corrine who influenced him\nWhen he was a cellist early on he learned the cello he also learn singing his father was a double bass player\nHe and his father were playing in orchestras and you realize that he couldn't make a living just by being a cello virtuoso that you had to compose music so he began to compose music\nAnd he ends up getting very wealthy patrons who demand a certain kind of music and that seemed to influence his writing chamber music rather than say a president at the time\nWell let's get to another uh for ... and this is the cello concerto in gene major performed by the Canadian ... orchestra\nAnd on her bills ... on the chosen dusted by Jean\nBy ... you know ... or something you have to admire\nThis it's it's a lot of playing and then they can sure does there's a lot of ... as well and I think those two things sort of defined ... in many ways he was a virtuoso and wrote\nParts for a cellist in his country does and he's also known for having been gifted in writing melodies like I Wonder if he if he would've ever written more than a couple of operas that he wrote late in his life whether he would have been going on for a\nBut here we get both sides of them in a in the ...\nOkay now to one of his symphonies this is the symphony number three in gene major played by the London Mozart players [noise]\nOne of the things that I hear there is a this was obviously recorded in a big hall or which I loved that you can tell that by listening there but what do you hear that tells you something is a book or in a peace [noise]\nYou can hear again this gift for ... and he's writing this in a symphony heightened was writing symphony is at the time it's been suggested that book read was sued detail oriented that maybe he didn't have\nAn ear for the architecture of a full symphony or if it's funny there's a contemporary book greedy violinist composer ... ... and his famous wind\nThat if the almighty wish to speak through music it would be that of heightened if the almighty wish to listen to music we'd be data book read and book really have that gift for melody in had the gift for the detail and you can hear that just in this a portion of the symphony number three by ...\nWhy do you think then that he is not as well known as Mozart Beethoven Chopin ... and others it could\nBe that most of his music is cheaper music and I would say that the appeal of cheaper music is not as great as see the appeal\nFor orchestral music and it's not that he did he writes orchestral music and I think it's becoming a little bit better known but I think compared to those other composers ah there isn't as much of it I think that's one of the reasons why it's not as
