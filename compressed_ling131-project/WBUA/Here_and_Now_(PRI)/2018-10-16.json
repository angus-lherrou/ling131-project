Bedminster because you want to play golf ... and ... to just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me\nSo that was sort of just a you know something and she may look look I guess\nWhat's the one that you're most proud of that you like I Can't believe I thought of that\n[noise] ah the the [laughter] I after I correct\nMyself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess you know a Trump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points in all caps ah in regards to the\nFBI and investigation um [laughter] and I and I found a a picture of a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party and I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which\nI I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nAnother one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that the more people out of an operation and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox News ... every other networking you Instagram forty\nAddress on television just saying yeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up [laughter]\nUh and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama as it was a two thousand ten state of the union was the largest in in history\n[noise] seems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happens when you show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter] ... you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked that a correct myself up over was\nWhen he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and calling him little rocket man and rocket man and\nYou know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff [laughter] and I posted a picture of President Obama with a lot of them have gotten right and I said there's only one rocket man [laughter]\nWhat is President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in a coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input\nI just saw him a week or so ago and now that the book is actually printed um I told them that I was doing this book and you just you know he he didn't say that much about it\n[laughter] or at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nUh no I mean he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nThe U.S ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post among the surround\nNo these are all a pictures that were previously made public honoring the administration so they are considered public domain so anybody can use and there was another guy that has a has a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine ... and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama or do you would you want to do something else\n[noise] no I Want to do something else that sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure\nHow come [noise] um\nBecause I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic a a person to a photograph every day\nUm someone that I had you know admired someone who gave me incredible access and I think I Would just be frustrated I'm trying to photograph politics when I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could and and and I've never\nYou know I I sort of ended up as a political photographer it was never\nSomething that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened um because I took a right turn in ... instead of a left turn 'em and so I Want to sort of explore some other aspects of photography that I that I just don't get to do that much now\nPizza to have one more question for you um you know everybody now takes pictures with their phone you can tell when you look at a Pete Souza photograph that it's really great photograph compared to what most of us are able to do although some people are great amateur photographers what is your one piece of advice that you give\nTo people about how to take a better picture\nOh boy I'm\nOne piece of advice can I give to yeah sure [laughter] um you know for a ... the lighting lighting is so important to people forget about that so if you're going to do [noise]\nFunding for here and now

grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents are the minority students objected captain is director of the little red schoolhouse first what was your thinking and trying is\nA we know that there are ways in which being a student at\nWas the challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help with their academic achievement ... well\nYou said that are part of this was based on you know research this was an attempt to isolate these minority students it was an attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special in his foot um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and if for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school um that felt supportive of their academic experience\nWell you refer to this in the schools handbook which says research points to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and or cultural identities ... what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that um those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions\nBeing made about them based on their identity and that as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing that being part of a larger group having colleagues as supportive of the development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or something like\nThat that they could go to so we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students to have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or\nSome other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for middle school age kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students was one of the few African American students in his or her class\nTo feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experience there having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural exchange and let's say the teachers away and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experiences and that affects a minority students negatively it at home with a place where it's it's much uh you know there's much lighter exchange between the teacher and the student is not a place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both those ads even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nYou know this isn't unheard of in twenty love in a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school had its junior classified itself for several minutes everyday along racial gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you were giving for people to feel a sense of not being other you know being with\nBut you know any time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated home that you had you know what do you worry about the wisdom that we\nDo and I have to do things about that one if you're you know as people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice is what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmates in a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color having a parallel experience to the other home room\nThe the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from you know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school but look what happened parents objected to have you dropped the policy or decided not to stand at what's going on\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what it what a lot of independent schools do which is to have race be one of the components of the students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nNeeds of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full Hillary I experience I'm going forward\n[noise] by the way el R. E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan [noise] uh where you had to end is this idea of grouping minorities together in a home room when the kids say\n[noise] um [noise] some kids remain somewhat confused by the need um other kids feel super supported so a lots of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd it's still a casting director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan so thanks so much it's been a pleasure and tomorrow we'll speak with an African American educator who says there are times two kids of color together you just have to get it right [noise]\nOkay wanna smile go now to hear now dot org and see the finalists in the annual comedy wildlife photography awards target for Tom sell them as a judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom these are just the final is how will you choose\nWhat isn't very good question I she ... the picture that makes me laugh out loud and I didn't have to think about why I just know how I Do my original ...\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe it as best we can offer have last year's winters up because those were hilarious\nBut this year it with a picture of his hands are held out his mouth is wide open as if he's saying he's called cutting the act but from photographer Mary ... a gallon I mean that's a laugh out loud\nIs allowed in that one of my favorite I think it's very simple we'll just see the animal and the ...

past six months journalists around the world have been working to finish the investigations Daphne started\nThanks to the nonprofit forbidden story which continues the work of murdered journalist and last week five members of the European Parliament called for the European Commission to back an investigation into college his murder citing revelations from the forbidden stories work including\nThat the multi government sale of Maltese passports to wealthy Russians for one million euros was enabling those Russians to enter a European Union countries and carry out money laundering and other crimes\nLauren ... is founder and executive director of forbidden stories low rent a you and other reporters picked up quite a few of the threads that Daphne Carolina ... was pulling on tell us more\nWhere we were thanks to the work of a forty five reporters for the past six months we were able to reveal some um information regarding the high level of corruption inside the minorities high learned and we were reading some concerning Fox about some potential links between the economy minister\nAnd some of the people who have been arrested because they were triggering to build that were really pushing the button pushing the button yeah they were using the cell phone that was connected to the bone\nEnd of the calls for ... look at it sounded a or she is she has been killed at least they're suspected of doing that and they were arrested\nAnd so during the investigation with the world cup that's a collaborative\nTeam we were able to meet some people who told us that they seem they couldn't even used to with\nThose two ... before the murder and to the roof of the ... project was not only about to identify who might be the key does put us up to complete the stories of Daphne\nCompletes a very critical work because her stories was bolt sensitive issues like corruption organized crime so that's why we decided to complete the stuff they have the name of the political debate project\nAgain you know the multi government she was ...\nMatters of the economy and here you have you found the economic minister connecting with some of the suspects in her death that's quite something look I I just want to back up and and talk about how this started because it's in a compelling story you worked in a news agency across the hall\nFrom the Charlie Hebdo office tell us tell us about your experience there\nWell an investigative reporter for the past Twenty years and uh I used to travel a lot to do some reporting in some countries where there was no freedom of press but to another think convinced me personally a personal events in my in my life convinced me to talk for begins to reason this up and\nActually in twenty Fifteen when two ... of our K dot in your man arrive in the streets were the offices of the company where I was working for the world in Paris and they inside the building and they killed ... newsroom were sharing the same\nFlaw that were the right to the door right next to her and these day address arrived to the two minutes after the terrorist is kept the building\nAnd I ... into the newsroom and then I\nI was uh the first to discover my friends and colleagues have shut the door just dying or just totally dead and we'd all best to help the people who were survivors and so it was literally changed my life because\nThis was happening in Paris this was not happening on ... and he was such an Iraq was in the middle of pirates who was in my personal environment\nEach was votes clicks I knew and we're doing exactly the same work as me the same job there were ... they were killed forced to read they were able to publish and so\nIt was really traumatic experience in two weeks a lot of time to recover of calls for that\nAnd trying to forget some very difficult futures but on that day I decided\nWhat I can do as a journalist to continue the words of murder the reporters to keep stories alive and usually when a journalist is dying for wants to raise that probably means that the story is very relevant to the public opinion it's very important to continue to keep these stories of life\nAnd he said something so compelling they're usually when that journalists gets killed there on to something and so for you it's about\nFiguring out what that was an as you say sending a message out to the murderers you can kill the messenger but you will kill the message the story look at this has been going on for a while a when Arizona reporter John ... was killed in Nineteen Seventy six\nA new organization sprung up it was called the investigative reporters and editors and they set out to finish his work but there have been over sixty journalists killed this year many of their debts connected to their work\nWe also here in the United states in Annapolis a newspaper a was attacked in so many killed threats were made against the Boston Globe by California man he threatened to kill all of them do you use do you just there I mean it doesn't feel as if you know the message is getting out\nYeah well um we are really facing real threats not only\nIn South America not only in Mexico in Europe too in a in old continents and I think that the the only response which is very efficient it's a global an collaborative response collaboration brings protection if you are working to get the\nIf the Cuba will see that there was a group of children is ready to complete investigation and to expose the crimes then that will probably think twice the next time they would think about killing one report or\nYou were talking about the ... project that's great and very inspiring project\nAnd I do think that we have to react this way\nWe have to send this pool full signal to the enemies of the press to kill the messenger you would never kill the message because we are\nHere to make sure people to get access to the very important stories so yes there was a lot of work we need some support there a lot of it is to have been killed a lot of many forbidden\nStories beyond what that we need to publish it's quite children to do that and a journalist who is dying is just it is not just to a number we're talking about ... ... important information that some people wanted to hide some people wanted to silence\nWell and there are other groups I met I mentioned investigative reporters and editors there's also the group organized crime corruption reporting project that pursuit another investigation twenty Fifteen when a of an investigative journalist was locked up and I said by John as there is a Brazilian nonprofit organization\nI think it's a ... a B R AJ eyes they continue the work of another reporter so\nThis has been going on this and he said collaborative so that it's the investigative work is spread out among men\nTo the Saudi journalist who wrote for among other papers the Washington Post democracy muggy um us and Turkish officials believe that he was murdered inside the Saudi conflict in Turkey have you been already eyeing his work\nWell of course I'm this is the kind of case that we we should be interested in what this terribly use he was ... he was working on we need to\nTo know mobile the Saudi regime and we need to to expose that so that so I Hope we would get more information to build the disappearance of a of the ... and I hope that we built to get some information soldier rug is very difficult country to rock and\nSo he was a kind of voice very rare very unique\nSo we we we ... we need that kind of ... and so we need to to work to get those went to look at what kind of stories he was publishing those pastures\nAnd when I say I'm Wondering you said when you came upon your colleagues largely a cartoon is a satirical cartoonist from Charlie ... who's in murder or dying you said that you you said you could not get those images out of your head\nHas the work that you're doing now has that he's that at all\nAnd that's a very good question I'm I'm not doing that for being able to forget those kinds of different kinds of pictures um [noise] but uh it's really helpful because I think that's I wanted to do some saying as a journalist and so by doing that", "year":
