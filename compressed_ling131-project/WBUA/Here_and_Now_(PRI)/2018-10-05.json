pictures of toppled homes in buckled roads and smashed cars in body bags um but you know what how do you take that and\nYou know you you take it in with personal stories of people you take it in with the man who sits and describes to you and he's had with a far off looking as I\nUm this complete conflict that he has inside his himself that he ... that that he survived but\nAt what cost he kept saying things like\nIt you you may think we were selfish when we just ran um because their loved ones were left behind in in in his case he left the father behind he said he was he was praying and his house he said we had ... seconds to\nTo get out and they were luckily on the street he looked up terms or saw wall of water coming at them\nAnd just ran its you know in some ways it's it's so

the United states is not the only country dealing with political polarization Sunday's election in Brazil is expected to be the country's most polarized vote in decades\nThere's widespread distrust among the electric because a record number of lawmakers have been caught up in a massive corruption scandal polls show that's driving voters too far left and far right candidate joining us now from Rio de Janeiro is Tim francs or the BBC ten\nOr what's at stake in this election in Brazil\nFor a lot of people do say that democracy is at stake and the reason they will say that\nParticularly opponents of the man who is leading the presidential campaign including the opinion polls that they said because the shy you both scenario he's All right congressman who's\nSort of sprung from ... ah he's a threat to the Democratic norms are in Brazil and this is just says he is remember from when there was a middle treat dictatorship here so will vote democracy is vibrancy in this country\nThat people don't take it for granted equally supporters of Mr Wilson already said that they are the ones who are going to rescue Brazil from the club she's all the people who have been responsible for a surge in crime a surgeon corruption and the worst recession\nThat the country has ever experience so they say that you know Brazil is on the mortal threat\nIf the left gas and hence Europe's the rights to about ... but also the language people use about what is at stake in this election could not be morph rules\nAnd we should also remember that two of the last few presidents out one of them is in jail right now the other was forced out of office\nYeah and that is what I'm depends a lot of the opposition to the main challenges to this fall right presidential candidates because the work is policy the P. T. to give it it's a Portuguese accident\nThey would impact she has been to two thousand and six team\nAnd I only watch the largest corruption scandal\nThat Brazil is that a theme and in fact his ... much of Latin America took courage\nAnd ... presidents of messier Lula da Silva who was a two term president in Brazil or the P.

fervent supporters uh of senators who were trying to convince to ... against the cabinet nominations are\nThere people they're supporting Kevin\nThere are some I Would say a handful of\nOn one hand they not if you saw that were in support of Kavanaugh for one\nPerson who actually describe yourself as an independent I talked to him in front of the Supreme Court he said he was there to to push back on this circus late atmosphere those are his words a that surrounded the nomination of of ... he's saying that the Democrats have brought it on themselves\nAnd that they they made a spectacle out of the nomination process there was another gentleman I Am a says he was a member of the n._r._a. and was really there\nAre to show support for in our area but he said that he's leaving to West

happen tomorrow as well\nRight That's NPR's Brakkton Booker outside the capital back and thank you thank you well it's we continue to follow everything\nWith Brett Kavanaugh at the U.S Capitol today a number of Senate races\nAre in the balance with four weeks or so to go until election day let's get to our Senate tracker series this week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon host and senior producer at Nevada public radio Hi Joe\nHey how ya doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen or a relative newcomer to politics compared to tell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else do we know about her\nOh just a quick got ... sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist\nShe lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college she was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise\nWhen former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she wanted twenty sixteen meeting Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid represented the state of Nevada let's listen to one of the ads from Jackie resident that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller\nCalling senators mindless because Dean Heller beds with the political when first promising to vote against the plan to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt Nevada Dean Heller is no\nObject you right now I cannot support legislation to ensure that we should do most Americans but but\nThen Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders\nFrom President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about you weren't there but you're going to be held her book\nThis promise and voted for repeal deciding vote to strip Alice\nHow big of an issue is that flip by Dean Heller\nIt's a pretty big issue in those ads have seemed to be making a quite a mark\nAbout a year ago maybe a little bit more Heller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change that Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you changed your mind you probably ought to tell people why\nIt just for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or any other issue\nOr what about Dean Heller um here's one of his ads\nI don't have time for politicians talk but don't deliver stop telling me what\nYou're going to you and just still\nHeller and get things done forty pieces of legislation to have a veteran party\nDelivered to the actual name Heller is our voice our\nInteresting to note that all the people speaking in that had\nAre women yeah that really really stand out look I I don't trust falls but by the late a CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen by fourteen points over Heller fifty two to thirty eight percent\nThat's a huge drop from the summer when Heller was at about fifty percent with women [noise] what else do we\nKnow about ... other than the fact that he sort of straddling between supporting his party and you know voting against his party occasionally\nYeah now that's really the kind of become a central issue although he until this race he was a modest not quite a centrist but just sort of you know he would always vote unreliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um\nThis is the nuclear waste site in Nevada\nYeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste a for the country\nOr the health care issue he seemed to reliably sort of in the middle it's sort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire a got involved she's been called a peacemaker by the New York times he he called Halloran in and said you know uh don't opposed Trump on this\nUm that's what the hell are seemed to change his vote and um they adolescence in turn have given to his campaign war chest\nIs adults in a huge player still in Nevada politics\nHuge huge player he's worth tens of billions of dollars maybe the most maybe the richest man in the world um yeah he's front and center you need him on your side in order to hold office there [noise] you know this this will be the ... election to see if that is the is the case\nOr any sense of how the cabinet or a nomination fight is playing with voters in Nevada\nWell when Heller said that sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh was a checkup it did explode across the social media landscape here um\nAnd and of course that CNN poll I just talked about showed a huge drop with women supporters for Heller but I haven't seen a poll asking direct question of how women feel about Heller in the aftermath of the Capitol hearing what\nWould you say is the biggest issue for voters in Nevada this November\nThis election is I think it's not the heart and soul of Nevada I Do think President Trump will be on the minds of voters Democrats or Republicans everything when they go to the polls because through his words his tweets his actions he has made

Jimmy Kimmel and\nAh Trevor Noah that it doesn't really feel like Murphy Brown is saying anything new um when when the show was originally doing this kind of commentary uh it's still different because there weren't a lot of shows that we're talking this way and there weren't a lot of sitcoms that were caught talking very directly about things that were happening in the world\nNow all of that has changed and I think is left Murphy Brown feeling a little out of step with the times\nWell what about the idea also that this is yet another TV network show that is going for the ... factor and bring back something that was there before\nYeah um I mean in a way this could feel like a like a step too far or some some of the other ... boots I'm from the way the viewers responded to them you had a sense that there was sort of a a pent up demand amongst fans when Roseanne came back\nWhatever you think of stars and bars politics um there's the audience responded by paying attention to the show and you had a sense that\nUh fans had kind of missed it and and with will and grace and NBC that revival the same thing now CBS is a little different CBS has done a lot of revivals of shows that are sort of thinly veiled a revival is you know they have a magnum PI they have swat they have mcgyver\nAnd all of these are just kind of an excuse to take really predictable and run of the mill a procedural adventure stories and and and slap living near the show a over it so\nI'm you know those have been under the radar in a way to get decent ratings but they're not the kind of phenomenon ths at will and grace\nAnd um and and Roseanne where I think CBS was trying to do that kind of phenomenon with Murphy Brown but the show hadn't been in syndication for a long time so uh I you know I don't think a lot of younger people we're all familiar with the show and because the the the revised version of it\nUm it's still a little awkward and kind of old school I I think it's going to have a hard time finding new fans\nNPR TV critic Eric Deggans\nYou thank you any gang cat story today the Senate advancing vet Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination to a final vote tomorrow\nBut the allegations of drinking and sexual misconduct lied I cannot have prompted soul searching at the kinds of elite prep school he attended ... decades ago colleges have been taking a hard look at how they may have committed a culture of drinking and sexual misconduct most have changed\nAs NPR's Tovia Smith reports some say there's still a ways to go to many alumni of elite prep schools the picture Christine Blasey Ford painted the drunken debauchery she encountered as a student is painfully familiar\nI was deeply shaken and I just posted as anybody else having these really bad memories come up\nAlexandra less God's graduated from the national cathedral school in Nineteen eighty eight with many memories she wishes she could forget\nThere was a drunk girl in a room um and there was a boy in there with her and there were other boys lined up outside the door and my friend recalls hearing I'm next time next\nIt was such a toxic culture of power and privilege she says many guys didn't even try to hide it in schools knew how bad it was in Nineteen Ninety the Washington Post reported that seven of them including Georgetown Prep where Kavanaugh went\nCentered joint warning to parents about the excessive drinking and sex ed unsupervised parties\nThey called it a recipe for disaster Georgetown Prep the current president declined to comment but in a recent letter to parents see bad to reevaluate school culture and to quote work with the guys and respect for women John Paul free is headed school at Philips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts\nThis has been a call to every educator I think and I think any school that isn't from gauge to him so searching who's\nMaking a mistake schools have already changed dramatically since the eighties toll free says driven by evolving attitudes and society at large stand by a student body that's no longer so exclusively the privileged and powerful and he says students are now schools on what he calls a culture of consent and respect\nIt is changing but it's still a problem on campuses and I certainly can't say that we are out of the woods yet\nThen did just three years ago saying all been school in D.C had to ... college yearbooks after discovering seniors at the elite all boys school had included crude insects slurs\nThat's way too recent this is very disturbing\nAttorney Eric Nick leash represents victims of sexual assault and it's also a sane all been alone\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

that's according to the Labor Department which also reported today that us employers added a hundred and thirty four thousand jobs last month\nMichael Reagan a senior editor at Bloomberg News he joins us now Mike Hi Germany will start with a number of jobs added a hundred and thirty four thousand that was actually below expectations but continues a long long long streak of job growth tell us more about what we learned in the report today\nWell rate as you mentioned it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so yeah this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very tough months\nShe'd get right because of Hurricane Florence um ... you know a lot of companies\nThat might have been fighting to hire would postpone it and a lot of companies were just you know more or less laying people off temporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people a away from work to to the bad weather\nSo it's you know most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather\nUm and it just assuming that the same trends we've seen of of pretty healthy job growth a is still intact\nAnd what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine\n[noise] absolutely yeah and uh you know Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further I mean it just goes to a show as you said this economic recovery is still ongoing um since two thousand and ten or ... the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight\nUm and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers for the holidays because the unemployment rate is so low people are able to get\nJobs I this is totally anecdotal but I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where the issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs\nI you know to to give you an addict out of my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting because the employment prospects for them or are good so what\nThat the employment market is very strong now uh it's still not doing what a lot of people were afraid it would do is which is over the economy and cause wages to accelerate aggressively um that's not quite the case yet um but it's by all accounts of very very strong job market\nWhat did we learn today about wages\nSo they continued to increase the year every year a gain in average hourly hourly earnings was about two point eight percent I'm so a nice game but again not so strong that it makes you worry about in overheating of the economy that would start to\nA turn things the other way cause corporate profit margins to to shrink and not sort of thing it's still sort of steady as she goes uh considering what trends we saw a first for many years now we're back to back through the uh beginning of the recovery from the recession\nWas going to be interesting to see how the Federal Reserve takes this news and we're already up to a to into court two to two and a quarter percent interest rate on the federal funds rate will see migrants at a Bloomberg News thank you Dexter\nPresident Trump is touting those new jobs numbers on Twitter and the strong economy also came up in his rally yesterday in Rochester, Minnesota where he threw his weight into one of the most highly contested congressional races in the country it's for an open seat in Minnesota's first\nIs supposed to be a Democrat said I\nVery very big surprise ...\nHousing that surprises at\nThe Republican Jim ... wins he's facing the Democrat dance in both are vying to fill a seat left open by democratic representative Tim Walz who's running for governor\nSo that district is where we turn for this week's district profile cats and Richard is senior reporter for Minnesota Public radio she joined us from Rochester and Catherine Minnesota went for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen\nBut the first district went for President Trump's so tell us more about the district itself\nWell it's kind of a funny district if you look at it in the long picture um it's been traditionally conservative and Republican it's very rural so there's a lot of you know smaller agricultural communities and the district outside of Rochester in Maine Kato which are started the city hubs\nThat being said during the Obama administration Tim Walz won his reelection pretty handily up until twenty six team and he was almost defeated by Republican Jim Hackett darn and of course the district went handily for president Donald Trump at the time\nRight well let's take a look at the two candidates the Democrat than the and worked in the Obama administration he's an Iraq War vet a member of the Democratic farmer labor party which is aligned the Democrats and industries an ad he built himself as an independent voice\nIn the army you can put any differences aside and come together accomplishment everything and that's exactly what the Congress that I I'm not taking over ... Lebanese I own nothing leader corporation\nCatherine Richard tell us more about seeing [noise] well I think the first thing that people should know is that he's a political newcomer you know he's never served in public office before um he hasn't lived in Minnesota since he was a teenager actually and his opponents are frequently point that out so he's moved back to the districts are run\n'em I think what you're hearing there is his willingness to work across the aisle which is really important in this district which you know in the case for Democrats as a moderate district and you know so you hear him running a pretty moderate campaign and it's really an echo two of the types of campaigns that Tim Walz ran here\nWill not at the Republican Jim had adorned in his reason add he talks about growing up on a farm in Minnesota doing a lot of reading which of course he brings to his thoughts on Washington\nWashington waves of government are so certain Rosen a Trump kept polling fast enough\nFor Congress to health and rip out the regulations for Obamacare and voted to serve road\nCatherine we hear him aligning himself with President Trump what's the thought on that\nWell he has been aligning himself with Trump's views before Trump was really even on the scene remember he's run for three times for the seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than Trump has been you know campaigning\nUm and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district and it's playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favor Donald Trump in the last election\nI think that things to know about ... joined that are interesting or that his dad actually held the seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager\nAnd lived there for a long time and actually worked there for a long time so just like his opponent dance fan he has lived outside of the district for quite awhile worked in various administrations worked on Capitol Hill and has more recently come back to the districts to run again these last three times\nSo those are the two candidates cats and I'm going to ask you about another thing that President Trump said last night that jumped out he really dissed former Minnesota set in\nWe're in the president's ah words kind of quitting after Franken was accused of inappropriate behavior be that many felt was kind of minor compared to some of the the accusations we've been hearing about in the me too movement but Franken pulled himself out of politics and the president seemed to be saying he was kind of a a\nCoward for that yeah it was it was an interesting point that he made I'm Still sort of sorting through what he was getting out because on one hand he said you know Franken was kind of a wet rag he he took responsibility for what he was doing and he left office of course under great pressure from his own party let's not forget that\nAnd this is it's being set against the backdrop of what's happening in Washington today which is this you know big discussion about whether judge Brett Kavanaugh will be confirmed to the Supreme Court and whether I'm is taking responsibility for his actions\nBut of course keep in mind that when Frank and laughed we you know the governor here appointed a Democrat to take his place who's now running for reelection and it's effectively opened up a potential seat for Republicans so on one hand he's criticizing it seemed Franken for weeding so quickly but on the other hand it's presented in opportunity for his party\nMost fascinating but how is the whole Kavanaugh debate impacting if it is this race or is it just falling along party lines\n[noise] you know I think generally it's falling along party lines when I spoke to people who are waiting to get into the rally yesterday this is something I asked them about all of them said you know we want him to talk about judge Kavanaugh we support judge Kavanaugh\nBut it was sort of weird was that people said you know we believe that something bad happens to you Dr Christine Blasey Ford so many years ago we just don't think it was him because he doesn't seem like the type of person who would do that uh they called it a witch hunt they said that you know that she she may be missed remembering", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "05"}
