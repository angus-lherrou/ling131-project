I Would say you have I Know rents thousands of government documents about this what did you learn from them\nAbout how the citizenship question came up out in the first place [noise]\nAll these documents were part release in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and I really key document is an internal memo written by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who as commerce secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty cents is\nAnd it it he says that he initially thought about adding a citizenship question to the twenty twenty cents is as soon as shortly after he became ... the Senate confirmed him as the commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen\nAnd then a over those months he worked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks is this person a citizen of the United states\nIt's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's now known as American Community Survey\nWhat reasons then does the administration gave for why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least once a thing about its reasons [noise]\nWell the Justice Department's a which is representing a commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump Administration these lawsuits their attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that have been released as part of the law suits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intent is mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to better understand exactly why commerce secretary Wilbur Ross wants to add this question because the Trump Administration has said\nThey wanted to add to because of the voting rights act and he wanted\nResponses from a citizenship question to better and for section to the voting rights act which has protections\nAgainst discrimination of racial and let language minorities\nAre essentially took her to make sure that those groups have the right to vote 'em that the ... the federal government has relied on other another kind of citizenship data from the American Community Survey of 'em and uh the ... says that data is not enough is not accurate enough\nUm and it needs it on the descending on the twenty twenty cents as plaintiffs are very skeptical of that and they're concerned that there are other other motives here involved or one of the internal memos or one of the emails released as part of the lawsuits include\nA communication between a Kris Kobach the currents are Republican gubernatorial candidate as well as a former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct\nCommission on voter fraud he wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross addict citizenship question and his concern was that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted in census numbers used to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census\nOr all of this comes at a really pivotal time for the Census Bureau itself or the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency\nOr the Twenty one twenty census is going to be the first to be conducted in part on line so with all of that going on how prepared is the Census Bureau for what is a massive undertaking\nWell they are the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross added will it stay or will it go and we probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline that the Census Bureau spacing of what exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census but paper will play an important part for live households and may not be comfortable or don't have access to Internet and so they will need paper and so this is a really big question right now that hopefully the lawsuits will resolve\nA from the Census Bureau perspective and other big questionable they the sense of being able to hire enough workers to collect them ah information from households around the country\nOkay thank you NPR national correspondent ... long thanks a lot You're welcome\nThe anonymous British graffiti artist Banksy made headlines over

humorous way nowadays it's humid slightly less and you take the most serious pain in his walk and I just say he's never been on mosque that there are\nHundreds of theories as to who he could be um and we still they may cause a big theory that he was in the written out when the painting the shredded\nWow so let's talk about some of the theories then what do you know 'cause there are people who who think they've seen him at work do we wouldn't have been installations on a wall somewhere or enlarged but you know we don't know who you're so um what are some of the theories about about who this ... this mysterious or this must be\nThey have ranged from him being a painter and decorate T another graffiti artist named king ... and people say he's Damian Hess people even say that\nYou know banks he may well be a woman and there's another theory that he's and not just one person he is a collection of artists [laughter] it's just because he's such a a an icon of mystery the the theories range from what could potentially be the trees to something very outrageous and I think there was a bond\nThat they said he was the ... mind if the burns and because every time that bond performed in his late ... the pop the guy had to come out and saying it's definitely not me I have a creative bone in my ... [noise]\nWhat what do you think he was trying to say by ... painting\nIn my opinion and I think he's trying to say that his wife is not for sale it's not the fast time his what has gone up for sale and and it's something that has been done without his consent\nThis time I had to see I I this is just my past and opinion on the opinion that certain people I ... the painting and the shredding if the painting was away at him saying my ... for one pass in it for everybody and because this painting it shut it off to the humble wetlands\nIt was a way of him saying the swat doesn't belong to anybody he never paints they never does his graffiti odds in a place that\nCan belong to one pass and he does in public space that he does than in places where it would be very difficult for me than anybody to claim that that all black and I think that's what he did he wants his message and he wants his\nWhat to be for everybody rather than ... take a ... at other theories I've had a he wants his wife to have a great says Ali\nOther times I've had that he wants his wife to be priceless that could be it could be a number of things and and my personal opinion is that he just doesn't want anyone to in his message\nNow one of the questions people are asking is how do you hide a shredder inside a picture frame without anybody [laughter] the auction house was in on this\n... and because he has pace defeat the eighties Instagram Shea how he went about building the framed himself and installing a shredder inside um I think as he was the end you pass it in on that um\nDownpours possible with a higher on Seventy right now is Seventy seven in Boston [noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

all based on something that happened in your high school\nIs not directly based on something that happened in my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well and she passed away and everyone in the school community after his death really began to sort of claim that they were closer with him than they actually were a myself included\nAnd I was sort of struck by this and when I met Justin in college we\nOn on like a our generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have um and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular\nFeels the need to kind of publicly mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case evidence in a he's a kid that just gets it every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um Simon and therapy has been to write a letter to themself beer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling himself that how it's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor\nAlso a troubled classmate but he presents his kind of a bully he finds one of the letters takes at home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your editor Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for ... and kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and\nAlso kind of changes him Stevenson this idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling yeah\nWell I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also that the people around him are shields by the story as well I um he feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this ... you know best friend of their son who of course isn't any did just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear evidence mother are struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't gave him a lot of the\n\nSure how you were able to put those feelings they never saw what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nYou know it's true or make something that we talked about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how do you take the would become a sort of temple moments in the musical\nHow do you take that in translated into a book yeah it is an interesting process of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as as a novel because\nThe book allows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way that a song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't slaves ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow any a sweaty palms this is very special to people all these characters and especially Evan Hansen really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel [laughter] yes lots of sweaty and still sweaty ends in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue and the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say Evan also had sweaty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty but by even thinking about them being sweaty\nThey're becoming more sweaty and then through the rabbit hole before I felt like I knew how to do this or emotion knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people had attached themselves to heaven and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you add the I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFor sure um suicide is something um that are you have experience with let's just say I know on the other guys\nHave stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact but we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and the and the mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just a small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's the him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced\nOh I'm darkness we don't want to give anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out just a crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nYou know this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter do you want to imagine more about Connor and\nI think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it is that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that ... that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or counter does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for our times of what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media and ... and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what\nCan happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench panic and I just didn't paw I understand that well you did they did what to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical your fans we're already doing it than fiction they were they were writing about heaven and Conor what might happen\nYeah this is Justin you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing a novel adaptation was seeing that there were a fence around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they listen to the cast album or read watched a clip on line or something and\nThey were beginning to create their own stories with these characters and interactions that might have been between evident Connor and\nAnd I'm a particular curiosity about Connor which is you know partially what inspired us people wanting to engage with these characters and that's what gave us the confidence to do this and the first place\nIt is a conversation starter for families you know moms can see elements of their kids that their kids won't talk about you know out loud and and and kids will see elements of their parents said that humanize them and ultimately it's really about how we relate to our family members how we hide ugly trees about\nAt one thirty nine and you're listening to Ninety point nine W.

continues with an eighty four thousand men women and children mostly from Syria Iraq into Africa\nHave arrived in Spain Italy and Greece this year every day more than one hundred people arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos\nThe first places they see are those of humanitarian aid workers to help them reach the shore clothing and food and healthcare and temporary shelter\nAid workers the trauma up close nearly every day for months and that takes a toll they have high levels of depression exhaustion and even pi TST that can last for years\nNow the George Washington university global mental health program as drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath to address the problem the ancient originated in Greece it calls for new physicians do swear to abide by ethical standards Philip can deal is is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits if you've been conferences but continue to this day\n... is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen aid agencies told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we would you go that people take care of their teams to care of themselves recognizing group is a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay with them there are areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at the George Washington tells the story of when she was working in Africa\nAs a psychiatrist she was asked to do a severe infection I'm a ... so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult and desperate\nSo you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to save my cat\nProject of exactly what should the farming limits of one's expertise\nResources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work\nDo you think this is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point the our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of the two groups that were going back to work with a mixed month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\n[noise] one of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores of Greece a pretty homogenous quite community\nHow has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that\nWe've been impressed with the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more Western European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa I'm a Middle East\nSo we learned that many of them\nHave grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange of populations in the Nineteen twenties\nAnd the ah ... they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seemed to have an immigrant story they married someone from outside Greece these workers you're talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a shared humanitarian motivation\nJust one more question um I have no need for quite some time and I know you're as you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for I mean personally what is it like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states and take it back to the origins of you know my family's migration\nIn the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two and to be able to go back\nAnd offer what our cat we were just there in September talking to folks in so long ago and asked them about the work that we do and a recruiting help from the Greek psychiatric community so being able to collaborate in this way it's been both professionally I'm personally fulfilling\nPhilippine jealous thank you thank you lose some\nThat's Dr Phil ... who is part of the George Washington global mental health program that's drawn up the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian aid workers back to the U.S now and a story from the American west\nWalk through forests of that region and you're
