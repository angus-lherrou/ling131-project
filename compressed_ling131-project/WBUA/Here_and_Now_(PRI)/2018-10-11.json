hurricane Michael\nIs becoming more clear today the storm has killed at least two people a man and Florida and an eleven year old girl in Georgia and for some the danger is not over years FEMA administrator block Brock Long\nRight now the focus is truly on life safety and making sure that uh we're helping people who may be trapped and a push you through and doing damage assessments to make sure that we fully understand where we need to coordinate our response efforts\nJoining us now is Jeff Hoffman chief meteorologist with the Florida public radio emergency network Jeff whereas Michael today\nOh Jeremy Michael's moving into the uh North Carolina region it has quickly moved to South Carolina this morning and over the next few hours from the heaviest rain from this will be near the Raleigh Durham area Fayetteville Greenville North Carolina the center that storm passing near Charlotte still a tropical storm and likely will stay officially a tropical storm all the way to the coast there at the mid Atlantic states\nWith wins in the forty to fifty miles per hour range and some heavy rain\nWell and as Michael passes over the Carolinas this is the area that was already hit by Hurricane Florence what are the concerns there\nWell the heaviest rain from that thankfully is a a little more located further inland into the mid state of upstate region still very heavy rain flash flooding concern big time in the hill country\nBut it is moving quickly uh so Jeremy that is going to mitigate the flood risk they're still going to be some runoff rivers that were of course are at their ... a week or so ago from Florence\nHave come back down they may come back up a bit but we're avoiding an extreme event in the Carolinas because it's moving quickly\nAnd what about further up in the northeast\nWell we have to watch out for tornadoes there was a tornado watch in effect for eastern portions of North Carolina south eastern portions of Virginia 'til nine o'clock tonight I Believe\nAnd uh that risk will continue up into uh uh the Delmarva area this will become a nor'easter so there's going to be some coastal impact in New England or the center of this do should stay just offshore but I certainly of this will be a far reaching storm all the way up into the coastal regions of New York in Massachusetts and up in the main even\nA Michael at its strongest point was a category for hurricane with a hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds very close to a category five this is the same a wind speed that we saw with Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the U.S mainland how did that happen\nVery warm water on the Gulf of Mexico very light winds aloft a this has been a season where conditions in the central Atlantic have not been particularly favorable for tropical development but it's just a goes to show it doesn't really matter where a storm forms as long as the conditions near an over it at the time\nOr can allow it to develop a it will develop very quickly um and yeah it is the intensity and the pressure was lower than Andrew when it came ashore\nUm and it's one of these circumstances Jeremy that it was still kind of been a strengthening phase ended approach land and we've had several hurricanes and the last decade that have weekend as they approached land a ... it's a reminder that that can happen but the other the opposite can happen as well they could be strengthening as they approach and that's what that's what Michael did\nLow seventies today low near sixty tonight and gradually becoming sunny tomorrow temps in the low sixties right now sixty three degrees in Boston you're listening to Ninety point nine W.

hundred nine four seven auto\nThis is Sharon now\nElection road trip it's a part of the country that is on the front lines of the debate over immigration many California cities have taking matters into their own hands either by declaring themselves sanctuaries from immigration enforcement\nIf if you quote unquote broke the law by coming to this country to work where there was a work of plenty that's not something that I see that uh the city should be looking to arrest somebody four\nOr five voicing their support for immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice this is really about rule of law and about to local control\nThis year a new state law took effect in California limiting how much local police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities the law sb fifty four is called the California values act it's also known as the sanctuary lock and has drawn lawsuits from the Trump Administration and several cities in California\nBut the legal battle kicked off in the small town of Los Alameda which voted to opt out of the law in March and it's now being sued by the American civil liberties union was telling me to city manager ... ... says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal\nFrom our perspective we wanted to go and take an option to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going and challenging us on that issue [noise]\nHow do you respond to some of the opponents of the who say that by not having a sanctuary city or a sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nI you know what I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around a list I Want me to stay in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal thankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically\nBy us not abiding by these sanctuary laws what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they're very thankful I think a lot of this is it's the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on in the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and Xena phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think that has anything to do with racism um I probably the best example and the real life example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown she's a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait in turn to get into the United states that so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I actually am with my wife has an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with low selling meet us in defying the state law\nMarket Ito is an assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or each side he said the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be it should be a nonpartisan issue in the public safety issue it just ... is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nThan if they took a minute's actually learned what we did I think they would be where we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of these immigrants that come across illegally or abused I'd met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or they were talking about criminal organizations that are doing this\nDetails says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country's broken immigration system\nBut other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary law divvied Bennett V. days is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of sent on a ... about eighty percent\nLatino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in other countries so are the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city ensures that we send a message to all of our best\nA with dignity and at the stadiums here to serve them well we we spoke earlier with the city manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that's not about racism why um why I'm doing this\n[noise] um [noise] I don't hold back my uh laughter there if if it is a\nFrankly a pretty shallow a response there was no need for the city will selling me to take the position that they did\nOther than to send a political message they're wanting them and other cities like them or wind to send a message that California's is not a welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope\nAnd we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city and that's what it means to be a century city [noise] and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor the criminals you say what\nThat he\nIs a liar and has no idea uh about the laws and and the law of the land he oftentimes talks about a violent criminals and\nI Do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city of San than I Believe that any violent criminal should be ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time\nHowever if you're only crime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to uh survive being able to provide for your family\nThat's not something that I see that uh the city should be looking to arrest somebody for\nSo what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is that it's not certainly will we do here that's not what my mandate is tomorrow officers um we responded ... where's wander criminal behaviors irrespective of your status so when\nRepresentatives from ice state makes their job more difficult what do you say to them so\nFederal authorities um are you know that they have the mandate to um to enforce federal law\nOr we do not and so we're just like lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law in there and they do that so um the other pieces has to do with community trust and others\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to call us for help if they're not calling the police who are they calling right\nSo um the ideas um to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in in what the residency status we're going to respond and it's just the folks that call for help\nSo that the chief of police in Santa Ana this is done Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail system in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administration Bush Obama and now Trump\nWhen there's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates in our custody for local crimes not for ice issues are here undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants to about one percent of those individuals those are the ones that place at the Tehran\nSo it isn't everybody in our custody it's just a small population of been made through ice has that they want that we can no longer communicate if we can't communicate we're releasing them back in the community\nSo you think S. B. fifty four is making this community less safe\nI Know it is making the community last day first a lot of the individuals who we do who are arrested or being returns of communities in which they originally preyed upon so we know that's happened we know of as of since January first we've had seven hundred and Seventy two through September this year\nIndividuals' criminals in our care who ice a place to detain are on that we could not return dies they released back in the community one hundred and forty of those have already been re arrested for new cries for for attempted murder\nReading a Boston lie from public today at three on WB you are\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Center for politics\nI found that your support is actually highest among the thirty seven percent of likely California voters to approve of President Trump or so I mean do you want do you want that support do you want to be the the darling of the right as well as you know being a Democrat look it's a it's\nA bit of an oddity that's for sure and my values in my values and my values of the youngest child of a single immigrant mother with a third grade education\nMy mother had the courage or convictions to come to this country to seek a better life so I'm as the author of ... states uh for California I'm as a leader in negotiations for raising the minimum wage the eyes of the country Fifteen dollars an hour and\nAlso the author one hundred percent clean energy for the largest economy in the world that has legally committed itself\nTo the carbonation agreed um my values have always been for working families in California and that's why I Am I'm my goal is to be a new voice for a California's in Washington DC and\nNow it's a it's an interesting auditing that's for sure but I'm campaigning with with a two all voters up and down the state of California doesn't make a difference if you're in northern California Southern California central coast or Central Valley [noise]\nWhether you voted for Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton or Trump supporter or I Believe that all Californians deserve a real voice is going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about do you think that you'll have a good relationship with President Trump if he becomes a senator from California\nWell I can tell you this ah from day one I've always taken a a an opposition position with him because identified from day one that this was a man that you couldn't trust and this was a man that was a clear and present danger\nTo our economic prosperity toward values and to our people now that's dramatically different had Jeb Bush won the presidency or John Kades tickets they even someone like Chris Christie or even Marco Rubio\nI'm either Democrat I'd be disappointed but I'd get over in a couple of weeks and tried to figure out what we can find common ground to move this country a forward together um\nWithin the spirit of normalcy within the spirit of the American body politic\nBut this is something that I didn't fight from day one is being dramatically different and I think that's why we can't allow one electoral aberration reverse of generations of progress at the height of our historic diversity our scientific advancement our economic output in a sense of global responsibility\nYou criticize Senator Feinstein over her handling of the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh you've accused her of\nGross misconduct and said she had a ... she showed a failure of leadership by not bringing the allegations forward sooner a Republican Senator Tom cotton and others have called for Feinstein to be investigated do you support that\nWell I don't because I think that's a politics I don't support the investigation of Senator Dianne Feinstein but I I Would have taken a different approach to Brent Kavanaugh on two separate counts or I Would never have open the door to confirmation to the third circuit court of appeals basically the farm team for the Supreme Court\nSenator Feinstein volunteered her vote in two thousand six to allow this man a known partisan political operative\nTo hit the Senate floor for confirmation\nAnd I would not vote to confirm sixty percent of Trump's judicial nominees now these are as we know lifetime appointments and these are men who\nAre most surely will and do a woman's right to choose workers' rights civil rights a voting rights yeah our environmental laws so uh this is something that I Would have done dramatically different than the current senior senator from California\nWhat would you have done in those hearings or what would you have done in those hearings what would you have asked\n... what can tell you this I Would never apologized to rent cabin uh for the women who were exercising their First Amendment right of the constitution to protest a lawfully and have their voices heard because of the fear and panic things id they have\nTo um you witness um junior centers such as ... Harris I'm Cory Booker I'm a centers Richard Blumenthal 'em and um\nI'll be very sort of a and actually make motions immediately four and a German obviously a delay tactic and\nUh I Would have followed suit as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee I Would have programmed with my colleagues and and they didn't seem to be any programming it was very disjointed and they I think a demonstrated a lack of leadership on on behalf of the senior center from California\nSo you've alluded to this but let me ask you about it directly she is eighty five Senate or find say eighty five years old you're fifty one as a member of a younger generation what do you think that you can bring to the Senate did she cannot well\nLet me say this I don't think it's about age or ages them I I think it's about values and having the right representation to represent the most diverse and who are largest economy in the United states of America I think it's time that we have someone on the front lines and not on the site lights and I think what California wants\nIs representation a representative who's going to fight for them on the issues that they care deeply about fight for them to elevate the minimum wage to Fifteen dollars an hour or to fight for the central threat that as before it's climate change to fight for immigration reform and make sure\nThat we stopped betraying the American born children are and allow their parents to normalize their legal status California's homes the largest number of immigrants in the country\nYet we don't have that leadership or from California in Washington D. C. especially when you are the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S Senate seniority has not been working for California and I think that's what they want in today's day and age when we have a president who occupies a White House who is\nUm a a threat or like I said a few moments ago to our economic prosperity to our values and more importantly to our people to eat I think she is fighting for California [noise]\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated\nAnd no longer apply to a to California into the rest of the country um I think that comedy um and this bipartisanship I'm which I'm fine with bipartisanship I've always worked in a bipartisan manner is the leader of the president of the California state Senate\nBut this is very different ball game or in Washington with this president who speaks to undermine a workers' rights women's rights are voting in civil rights as well as our environmental laws [noise]\nUh I think it takes a different type of representation in California wants a real fighter that will fight for the values and who they are and what they represent today not yesterday\nYou think the Democrats should try to impeach President Trump's if the Democrats take back the house in the ...\nWell I've always said from day one that I think there's enough evidence of for a in a ... of uh the current president's um [noise]\nI have not uh been ... just waited for the position of taken it is not a partisan position of taking that are the Democrats or Republicans should play around with the idea of parts of the ... for political purposes or this is based on a legalities\nAnd being the commander chief the chief executive officer of the most powerful position in the world I think there's sufficient evidence or for the members of Congress are regardless of who controls are either chamber the to move forward with impeachment know obviously\nIt's clear that the Republicans don't have the courage to move forward and do the right thing but if the uh the house has taken over by Democrats or I Believe strongly that they should move forward with a impeachment\nB.

another dumb Britain will come as a military so I Know we can do it on\nLet's bring in Jill rep logo who is a reporter who's been covering homelessness for Cape BCC here in Pasadena Hi Joe Hi Jeremy and when you're listening there to Michael and Elizabeth uh you hear people who are educated you can't see it but they're well dressed but their homes\nYeah to me what their story really illustrates is you know what experts say is it it's so important to get people how quickly you know I'm demand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness and when people go on how it's for a long time that just gets worse and worse than a lot of the things that people complain\nAbout street homelessness you know they associate things like alcoholism that comes from the trauma of being on the streets for a long time how bad is the problem in California right now\nWe're getting example I ... up until a few months ago there were about two hundred people sleeping in tents in a plaza\nRight next to the main courthouse in orange county next to city hall in Santa Ana I thought you know people saw this every day when they walked past it on ... has since been clear that you'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't encounter people pretty much on a daily basis sleeping in parks are asking for money on sidewalks and is it getting worse and if so why\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nAnd the lack of housing Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for everyone let alone does he salaries can't keep up with those market rate rent\nAnd and the second big factor is that local governments haven't gotten really serious about addressing homelessness until pretty recently\nA there is historically been a lot of pushback against shelters and housing for homeless people and that continued today\nAnd there's a lawsuit in orange county uh currently before a federal judge in California tell us briefly about that\nIn this case came about in orange county officials talk to clear out a very large homeless encampment I'm up to possibly Fifteen hundred people that had been growing for many years along a flood control channel kind of right smack in the middle of the county\nAnd advocates sued based on a federal legal precedent which says law enforcement can't take it people for sleeping outside in public places if there is no realistic alternative for them\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of WVU are Boston and from your NPR station\nFrom college

we're broadcasting from Southern California one of the places Democrats are hoping to flip some house seats that they'll need to take control of Congress in orange county alone there are four house races ranked as competitive by the cook Political Report\nAll of them are currently held by Republicans in just traditionally conservative county but President Trump's approval rating is low you're creating an opening for Democrats into thirty ninth district ed Royce is retiring after twenty five years in office the Republican running to replace him is young Kim one of his staffers\nAnd what ended that shaped throughout the entire thirty ninth congressional district as a congressional staff that did the community I Know these are the people that I'm running to represent that just personal to me\nThe thirty ninth district is two thirds non white Kim would be the first Korean American woman ever elected to Congress but Democrats guilt narrows a Latino and first time political candidate who bankrolled whose campaign was lottery winnings hopes to turn the district blue she\nWants to be done I Want to protect the border that's one of the reasons I served in the military was defending our nation although we don't need to do that by building a thirty billion dollar wall is probably going to end up one of those darn tossing fifty billion dollars\nA prominent Republican is also leaving an open seat in California's forty ninth district which includes parts of southern Orange County in northern San Diego county\nAfter narrowly winning his last re election Darryl Ayesha is leaving to join the Trump Administration as the head of the U.S trade and development agency he endorsed Republican Diane Harkey to replace him\nWell I'm running for Congress ... replacement that function and Washington DC thing I've worked in the legislature I've also worked on the board of equalization and very very minority conditions 'cause I'm a Republican and very very Democrats date\nHer opponent is Democrat and first time candidate Mike LeBron\nWhat's happening with the Republican Party in what Trump is that consistent undermining of the Affordable CARE Act and I see it all uh you know my travels throughout this district I speak with so many people who are one medical emergency away for not being able to pay the rent\nIn the other two races incumbent Republicans are facing tough re elections in California's forty eighth district Dana Rohrabacher is fighting off Democrats were labeled him ... favorite congressman\nBe galvanize to have a few not as much\nA recent poll by Berkley I. G. S. shows Orange County Democrats tied with or beating the Republican opponent sometimes by wide margins although in orange county a quarter of all voters have no party preference here's Richard master\nOn not voting party line vote as leverage to represent the people most of the politicians law policy not control lower taxes and you want to earn money we're for money you want to keep our money\nThere are also people like Greg diamond food doesn't know who represents him in Congress\nOr after we got about it [noise] [noise]\nPolitical scientist Jody Ball must as many voters may not know the candidates names\nYeah I think there's a lot of party affiliation that are going to go on\nDo you think that part of that though is that things are pretty good in California right now and you pay more attention to who you're voting for when things are not good then when things are fine when you're ... where you gotta you gotta job you you know in New York ...\nYes no I absolutely think that I think that you know part of low voter turnout is satisfaction that people are not a you know roaming the streets with pitchforks and I'm trying to get big changes\nBowman says there is one area where many Orange County residents are not satisfied and that's on the issue of gas prices which are hovering around four dollars a gallon there's a question on the ballot next month across the state the black voters if they want to repeal the state's new gas tax and vehicle fees\nBowman says that could awake in orange county anti tax Republican voters and make the road to a house takeover more difficult for Democrats [noise]", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "11"}
