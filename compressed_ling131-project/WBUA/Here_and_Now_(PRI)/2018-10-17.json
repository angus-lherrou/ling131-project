seven auto\nThis this year now\nElections many are wondering if the polls are correct and Democrats will make big gains in the house or if like in twenty sixteen there's a lot more Republican enthusiasm than it's being reported\nFrom Boston Globe reporter and editor Ben Bradlee junior just spent some time in a key county in Pennsylvania which President Trump won he profiles twelve Trump voters in his new book just out the forgotten how the people of one Pennsylvania county elected Donald Trump and changed America\nAnd Bradley junior welcome to here and now that you will first tell us about this county in Pennsylvania\nThis is a county ... county in northeast Pennsylvania county seat is Wilkes Barre ah it's not very prosperous fraying at the edges and has been hurting for a long time\nAnd combing through a vote in the three critical swing states Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin I discovered was er and county which is a traditionally democratic county hadn't voted Republican since Nineteen eighty eight for Bush senior\nPresident Obama want it to time President Obama\nWon it twice but its surged in the other direction for Trump and he wanted by twenty points building up such a margin in this one county that it was sixty percent of his victory margin for the state of Pennsylvania so without this one county here he wouldn't have wanted to state or perhaps the presidency\nAnd you profiled twelve people in this book how did you find them well I went\nDown initially poking around and you do what the journalists do you go to community leaders and a newspaper editors talk show host\nAnd learn who the Trump voters were and start talking to them when one person a region to another\nAnd ended up interviewing a over the months a about a hundred in depth but it's settled on\nTwelve or who stories I decided to tell and I think that this is a window\nOr a deep dive if you will into the Trump vote and that at least more than half the country remains shocked at a candidate as unusual as Trump got elected and there's a hunger to know more about how it happened\nAnd you talk to a number of people who all kind of had different reasons for supporting Trump you you you dipped into many different views of him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud\nTold you that Trump's simple related will speak like huge big league or big league may have turned out voters in other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Missouri and county when I think people base\nMost of their vote for president on the extent to which\nThey can relate to them on a human level a likeable they are I think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and I think the people that I settle on a generally like Trump on most issues\nBut really liked his style that just like to see a his moxie his feisty in is how we get up every morning and um [noise] has a tweet storm and a six to the elites\nAnd they did not feel that he was being condescending toward them that he was talking down to them\nNo on the contrary they felt heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable ...\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying was not what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him\nUm and and you talk to people here in ... county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would here is we're not actually going to build the wall but he's going to he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah the interesting they talked about the importance of deep coding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering or what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the process job candidate\nSays something in the press is supposed to report it\nAnd they said no no you really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of\nApologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable\n[noise] what about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view President Trump still\nCatholic not majority so there's a rising evangelical population Trump's\nOff the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote so I I talked to I'm a woman for whom from was literally sent by God she believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does he's\nAppointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical\nThey're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing in fact that he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion and his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices\nWhat about just the overall sense of the place ah right now in twenty Eighteen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area the opioid\nCrisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county\nEven if you don't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a more widespread and ah I'd read the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and thinks that it's an enormous problem and is trying to raise public awareness about it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving as a brain brain there's not a lot of opportunity beyond\nMaintenance and I'm working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump maybe at the margins\nThe unemployment rate has gone down and the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign he hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nWill the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really uh sabotaging Obamacare and there is no I'm neither Trump for the Republican Party have come up with an alternative plan he said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nSo I got an up the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so you know Republican Party doesn't seem to care about\nWhat about these voters do they care about those things they don't haven't been able to do they don't\nSeem to really care and the final analysis because they just like Trump I think it's it's a personality over or anything else\nDo you think that the Democrats are connecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did\nUm there's been a lot of criticism that Democrats are ignoring these people that you've been talking to in in places like lives there and county well they certainly did and\nThe twenty sixteen and I think they would do well to listen more to Democrats a lot of the people that I talked to were Democrats but felt that the party had left them rather than they leaving the party\nAny thoughts on what might happen in the midterms well\nIf I had to guess I Would think the um this so called blue wave I don't know how big it will be but I think probably big enough for the Democrats do we take the house but I'm not the Senate\nThem fairly junior ... one of the things I really liked about this book is that you gave us a glimpse into the minds of many people who voted for Trump but did so with respect for their views and I feel like a lot of the\nFunding

schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school in Manhattan which began to groups the few minority students in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other he is director Philippe ...\nStudents of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day\nIn the hour predominantly white school a vessel supportive of our academic experience\nBut the parents of some of the minority students headed smelled of segregation and they worry that gave their kids the feeling of being left out so the school end of the policy our question is it the right thing to a group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of stolen college in historically black college for women\nDr ... the director of the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts\nUm I think it was well intentioned and certainly there's a lot of\nEvidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful [noise] talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book and the chapter called why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria [noise]\nIt seems are different in grade school kids are playing in the sand box with kids that look different from them and then something happens in high school was happening one of the things that's happening is the changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty\nThey start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular are more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls are experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior explain that sure well\nIf I Am a young African American student and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know that black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated\nBecause their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like\nThan you are likely to think doing well in school being in that honest track is so called acting why it's such a vicious cycle because\nVery often the kids are in those lower trapped maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a\nHigher tractors a lower expectation but what ends up happening is this sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in\nAnd in fact tracking often does result in re segregation would end racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared\nAnd maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids\nWho test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed in those upper attracts you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book\nTo read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores that still not be placed so what can we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations\nThis brings us to the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counseling for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of\nBussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city out to the suburbs very good schools but all white schools\nIt was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston\nAnd to the suburban schools or black or Latino and often there's a sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents\nAt the performance of the black kids in particular they often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing there's also may not ... but you had another anecdote about a young girl who was in a school\nA majority white and a teacher saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to see how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we live in the city but she doesn't say that and to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which\nAdds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly yeah like when you have things like that going onto\nUnintentional yes unintentional I mean that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected to stereotype and it made the students feel\nEven more like she didn't really belong to that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved and uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had wait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his own room [laughter]\nIt sounds like that there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it for a year and then they evaluated how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience\nImproved academically and also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more support it\nThey had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them so if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus you could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and then the more focused in class\nBut anyway the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asks why why kids in the cafeteria\nTheir bonding in in many ways\nAbsolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together in the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students were more likely to be racially isolated it is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves\nJust such an odd thing in any high school or just about every college the entire culture is black whether it's the music comedians that they're following or the sports figures it must be very odd for young black to see that well it's\nTrue I mean certainly the cultural references that you talked about so you know those black artist to the music becomes mainstream you know those athletes who are admired by white teens as well as kids of color um those are physical symbols\nThat many people recognize and appreciate but at the same time you can be a young African American sitting and Starbucks and have somebody called the police on you or something that's Beverly Daniel\nTatum former president of Spelman College

was decided as one of the twenty century the most powerful story there's low rouse the more abstract will the tiny country down here to his family as late Russia's going choreographer and cofounder of the New York city ballet who hired\nThirty one year old Bob and is in Nineteen forty nine to be that companies associate artistic director\nAuthor Wendy lesser says she's made it her vow her sworn duty to overturn the prevailing miss about Robbins her new book Jerome Robbins a life in dance and she joins us now when the lesser welcome thank you for having me rather than just you know thinking of the west Side Story scenes that we that are now in our minds\nYou might attended I hadn't heard that in the film version these sharks and jets snapping their fingers I like a bunch of us were beneath them somehow and that's because your own Robbins had trenches dug\nRight and if you go back and see the movie and I have to say\nAlthough I Love the ballets and I am championing nuts them in this book I Am not saying anything bad about west side story is a master piece it's a great work and so was Peter Pan you know he really was a genius in that field it's just that uh because he was so good in that field for the reasons you said his best\nShort or not enough attention right anyway about the west Side Story family yes he had trenches dug into the street and you can actually go and see the movie again and see that you are lower than the dancer and I think it will be\nFabulous well so how will start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the win hundreds centennial of Joe Robin birth\nCertainly knew about his work says we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nHad that you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it the Germans Nineteen Seventy one valley Goldberg Variations for the New York city ballet set to of course music from box let's just listen to a little\n\nCase so we will have all of the of videos that we talk about here at here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you know the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story sweet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldman variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece Eighteen minutes long with a live in a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nFriendly for them all it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers in all and it had the feeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say\nThat had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week [noise] and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as the west Side Story man that Peter Pan manned fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being lower than Balanchine who was the king the saint of ballet and I knew that a lot of people thought because he was a Broadway guy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and\nDeborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that are encroaching had panned it ... that she was the most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes\nUh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also culture Robbins affects all angry man that was later but\nYou became as you write like a court appointed lawyer you were going up from Robbins words as a belly choreographer and so let's take a listen to some of it again the pieces and we will have as much as well as we can hear now dot org\nAfternoon of a fun Nineteen fifty three to the music of DC I'm willing to the Nineteen

of\nThe afternoon of a fun [noise]\nWell I I just love the stats and\nIt's only about ten minutes twelve minutes long you can watch over and over and it just feels wonderful every time it's not just\nA reimagining of the music better reimagining ... version that he did in the very beginning of the twentieth century the fun is the main character and he has a priest was dancing randomness stuff but he's practically\nWhereas Robbins imagined this as a ... [noise]\nWonderful to ... I think we're at simultaneously\nThe ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nAbout a fond and his dream girl who\nComes and visit him and with those two dancers tend to kill the ... was it was a knockout and what are they they're like they're watching themselves in a practice mirror that is what it feels like\nWe are the mirror there looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking in the mirror as dancers sometimes do in the studio\nWe're spying on them in a way\nAnd bouncing himself never took the superior attitude toward things that had a ... he was balancing loved dancers at a gathering which Robbins made and down and said it\nWas so great you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said like you could eat it the whole thing endlessly popcorn\nAnd that's probably drove others you know off the cliff but let me ask you a little dances at a\nGathering is ah the dance Robin creates a Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine\nHe had been away from the New York city ballet doing ...\nBroadway but this stance is at a gathering with an instant hit\n\n\n\nAnd what do we see in this day\nDancing the gathering starts with\nA young man alone on stage and sort of ends up with him [noise]\nTouching the stage\nMany many minutes at a you know it's quite a long ballet of all the dancers coming in and joining him and they all get to strut their stuff and they combine in many different ways\nBut the idea is they are dancers hanging out together and so one of the things Jerome Robbins did this happen stand at the side\nWatching each other as others are dancing\nIt's again like afternoon of us on\nA combination of\nWork that meant for us in that it's meant to have\nA real worldly reality and the work that talks about itself being on the stage\n[noise] uh you talked about his childhood which was difficult ... relationship with his mother um and he became difficult there's a famous and encircle story about him backing up on stage during rehearsal he has his back to the audience\nThe companies in front of him he's backing up backing up and no one tells him that he's coming at the edge and he falls in the ... and no one comes to help them\nNones he you know could be cruel\nYes and ... and a lot of people talk about his cruelty and there are many many stories about how difficult he was not just the dancers

high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more at college find dot com\nAnd NPR and MORNING EDITION on this station tomorrow morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis year and now every president since Jimmy Carter has voluntarily released his tax returns to the public but Donald Trump has not he was Trump on sixty minutes after he was elected in November twenty sixteen\nThe appropriate time I will release them but right now under routine and nobody cares still accuses you know you and a few people that essay question obviously the public didn't care because they won the election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns release Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI fall under German and ways and means just stopped delaying it get Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November you mean they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law\nAnd former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now high Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of anyone at three tax committees in Congress\nTo request the tax return information of any person or any business and directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a upon receipt the committee must examine the information in our confidential manner\nUm but it can important agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nUh the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee or it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request\nAnd to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is ... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and the Senate that's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees can act unilaterally and so if\nThe Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate\nThe house committee could proceed on its own a symbol le defend it could\nA choice you know if the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation just submit any of the information that it came to the full house or the full Senate\nAnd presumably it would be by some kind of committee vote that committee would would resolve to do this\nYou know again the law doesn't specify but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with this this is a tax committee and so it certainly could be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function\nOr the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there was a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories of the New York times had\nA story about some of the tax filing prior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story yes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee and the house to decide what exactly\nIt's doing and why it's searching it but I\nI think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action what\nIs the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law and the circumstances when it came about we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances\nOf the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress and the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety of reasons to principle one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal\nInvolving some high level executive branch officials of the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because of the law they had to actually go to the president and request permission from the president to get the tax material even though they were investigating\nYou know I'm executives under the president and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nAh there was a similar concern about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon\nWho um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or place in a blind trust\nHis business interests but simply or retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nAh the the the ... from that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing and then just ration pushed through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues that are well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses you know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have\nThe authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what are we really going to learn from them\nThat's a tough question because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be set aside without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think as a policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest and their tax filing because that goes to the ...\nMake sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut if President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more is in terms of character simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be fairly obvious to me would be the possibility of conflicts of interest we know that\nThe president has a lot of authority to undertake various relationships on behalf of the country and the question is\nWhat are the these decisions and is there some personal or business\nInterest on the part of some of the decision making going on I Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of a number of people in the public and if they wanted to know that all that would be something that might come out from an examination return\nAnd I would add one more thing which is whether he actually made as much money as he said he he did what we would find that out in terms of his yearly income\nYeah although I think that you know you need to be a little cautious about that because of tax return typically doesn't really show the amount of income the way you and I might or the ... member of the public might think of\nThat is you know how rich you are and and how much and so forth because a lot of that income of that sort doesn't actually translate into taxable income", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)",
