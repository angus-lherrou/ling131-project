constantly spraying the ... summit for this processing plant opens out onto the day we can see buckle broken docks and idle or Easter bugs\nHurricane Michael landed a punch year but this was an

takes too much leading less of the fresh water to lower the salt level in the bay and keep that day the salt loving creatures that prey on oysters then there are oil spills over harvesting climate

wind and rain Florida waster population Ninety percent of it was coming from the Appalachian coal ... percent of it nationwide and and that's changed dramatically over the past couple of years the oysters and indicator species right at the Keystone feces\nIf you have a healthy oyster population and the scientists will tell you guess while you're going to find out you've got healthy fishy about healthy crowds you got healthy shrimp and so when you see this challenge with the oysters guess what you're going to probably find out you've got challenges going on with your other parts of your

was the only person in love with\nThis river and really get why it is incumbent upon us to protect and take care of it this is the one of a kind of place I could rattle off all the special

called off the bat whether Dr Felicia Coleman director of Florida state's coast and we love\nHer colleague Dr ... brook and write ogles recently retired from the state's department of environmental protection join us I start by asking Dr column and that question we started with why do we care about this\nI'd say the most spectacular fishery collapses have occurred worldwide on rivers that have had tremendous re diversion of water\nBecause that that water bringing all his nutrient is not coming down into the salad needed water and not coming down anymore such a really important component I think that's overlooked well\nAnd talk more about that Dr brook because it's not just that it's encouraging the fish gross it's discouraging the growth of the creatures that might pray on things like always just like the conch which like the saltier water\nYes when the balance of salt and fresh changes then different things happen the problem with soldiers that encourages these marine predators such an oyster drills and ground caulk\nWithout these oyster journals that sounds like a horror film duct duct tell us more they latch onto the oysters and they like that come out\nThey sit down on an oyster and then all of a sudden they always to his this great scrape scrape and eventually they'll scrape through the shelves and tickets for buses in and basically consume the always to from within and there's not a whole lot you can do about it it is rather horrific\nCan check it out on you too [laughter]\nIt's like a bad movie what else can be done I mean some people wonder why the bail us in just shut down so that it could replenish let's start with the day and a\nEcosystem because if we don't address the problems with the ecosystem if we're constantly reacting one of the things that happened in the wake of that\nTo go out and ... all the oysters to fear was that the spill would come in and kill the ... a couple of years later and there was no birds stock left there to re populated I think about the function the set oysters surface is beyond\nThe economics and they clean water but they also offer refuge for a number of juvenile species that live inside the crevices\nThey help protect it from storm surge you can't have this industry without that resource you can't have good sea grass beds without that ... race are she can't have high water quality you've got to restore all those things\nBut you have to do it in a deliberate fashion one of the problems with the day over the last few decades has been\nReaction reaction to the oil spill reaction to a

deliberate what doesn't have to be\nFair particular types of research that can be done that could\nRelatively quickly in the next couple of years to make some very good decisions about how we restore the bay the fisherman really understand what native but they want their livelihood restored\nSo there is a tendency to go for whatever looks like the quickest facts closing that that is probably not a terrible idea and I think you would find fishermen that fully support that full\nDr ... research and really a committed effort instead of throwing short term solution what about in desalination plant I think they're up more\nProblems and the bags on just filling up the you know they had the drought back in two thousand seven nine and since then we've had decent rainfall but they always just haven't come back\nUsually want a system crashes it's not just one thing but there are also other factors in play you know the the reefs they're not as high as they used to be we don't know where the lobby\nOf coming from or what does the topography of the bay looked like you know how much that the coach sits where it is it's all these questions that will help us figure out a way of making a comeback\nYeah this is so interesting because after Sandy we did a lot of reporting on people who wanted to bring the oyster beds back to New York harbor it used to be filled with ... as a barrier

like I don't want to go like I Want to talk to my children is it any more now\nSo he must have play her I'm sure they many and she has been approved for FEMA rental assistance we forget about I mean she was in low income housing but there are all these renters who don't have any because she got a FEMA rental assistant\nAnd his waiting on a check 'em but but then what I mean where is she supposed ... she can find housing but we're supposed to find housing\nThat's that's the difficult thing is that there\nHousing and FEMA has made some hotels available on their their vouchers that you can use the city's hotels but many of them are outside of the hardest hit areas so people have to have transportation to get there really there's about twenty that are accepting of vouchers\nAnd did you say you know trailers are on the way people think about those FEMA trailers\nBut there seems to be a you know some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local governments they can't just come in there and say here\nWe come we're putting these trailers here the local governments need to ask for it and of course those local governments are are still putting themselves back together and so I think that's why we're seen sort of this slow response and they're also shelter is of course yeah well\nIt will er and by the way we see FEMA people all over the place in their boots teachers they're working very hard you spoke with Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter in a local high school and just going to listen to how\nWe say even charged I mean it was just like all the windows busted out back and [noise] all the trees come down and landed right beside the church though yeah [noise] um I have an Animal House was destroyed a brother in law just houses destroyed ... Waltzer home\nWell so first of all clarify for us because driving around this has driven home or in the panhandle people might be picturing in Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes are beach homes and not\nRight this is a part of Florida where we have a lot more\nRural people a lot more low income people and so these these are even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their home stay our\nHomes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have that insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have that way chipped to begin rebuilding their homes\nWell and rebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Nikki Gilmore a Walmart manager in Mariana who said people showing up for work even though they have really trying circumstances let's hear\nWe're getting some Terminator goes one that gives them the ability of lives lost we've got here\nAnd so I've got like Robin assistant manager we call him James he lost his whole house\nAfter two days he's here\nOur through smiling and Grayson just describe ... just ready has a job that he can recover from in the water so that gives more calls\nWhen he says we got air he means is he conditioning air conditioned right how are people getting by they have no income\nI think that it's tough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about at Gilmore had opened his door and it wasn't open to the public but he was allowing his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process or that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck\nThere is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state but again that's difficult for is a fisherman who maybe don't have a good way of tracking what their income has been and so they don't have a good way of applying for that assistance\nYeah but running water mostly back in some places it's not drink a bull communications as we have discovered are still pretty spotty um it's just really I have to say it's just\nRemarkable to see the trees uprooted everywhere even hear it you know inland Tallahassee roofs off high school fifty miles inland it's really a quite humbling a deficit fs WFSU senior news producer of Reagan McCarthy thanks so much for sharing your reporting that I think you would have been talking about housing\nEven those able to return to homes and it's unbelievable again will have pictures that here now dot org are having trouble here knows ... went to the coast and brought back to smoke\n[noise] much of\nThe area between Mexico beach in Port saint Joe looks like a hurricane went through yesterday not two weeks ago\nCars boats are turned on their sides strewn across the street from on homes are split wide open there's debris everywhere\nBut for those people to return to their home this part of the Florida Panhandle as one big construction sites\nTroy Bryant's watches as workers to the shingles off his room\nThere were all she had the most liberal what\nBryan and his wife ... bought this beachfront property and moved here from Georgia earlier this year they stayed in a hotel in Mariana Florida during the storm returned two days later to find their new home intact but severely damaged\nWithout first drove us older you'll the garage doors with money but also what's so bad [noise]\nOutside of the ... here [noise]\nI had a white picket fence was built all around the world health or ... or ... [noise] that house\nLike there used to be right there Brian says that house was forty feet\nFrom where you're [noise] Janice and Allen Cronin with a few blocks from the beach they were on vacation and Tennessee when the storm hit and when they came back they found\nThey also saw whole houses lifted off their foundations and swept into the streets by the storm surge high when\nHis second locked most album have some sort of damage for slate\nTheirs was pushed up for it gotten kind of total you know\nAnd as a house in the street to the rest of your house isn't\nAs it was a\nPetty corner that long and so when the storm surge came up and started flooding of course and it just ... around\nAnd of course you'd say our neighbors car way on that in her mouth [noise]\nThe Cronin are spending their new retirements repairing their house by hand living out of camp or in their backyard they're determined to say but Allen Cronin says this area will never be the same\nBase a large percentage of these homes that were owned\nBy grandma grandpa\nGrandma and grandpa was not revealed and\nGrandma and grandpa was settling\nNo keep in mind that a third to half the houses here we're actually built you before Nineteen Seventy they were literally not built to any hurricane ... they were built for\nAnd people have lived in them for years now they're not going to live on them for him in five years this will be the same plus it was\nLifelong residents Clark downs and his daughter Kimberly downs Norton rode out the storm and carts house\nI was confident on a category one into but then after I realized it was gonna be a three or four it was too late\nAnd and luckily we serve as\nToday they're helping their neighbors clear down trees from this yard a clerk said Michael was a historic storm\nThere is a history here or a lawyer even when I started school here in an elementary school there's a book called the great ... where the city was destroyed three towns one so far\nUh west by yellow fever and wants to buy a tidal wave which was really a hurricane or a cat and this is number four combat what he said that I just know the people are in combat or sorry to come into your already building\nWell yeah I've got coming I've got two people come in to straighten some of the messages out so yeah oh yeah what do you think it really\nHad anything to change or or will it ... I don't think it'll change and I was thinking of more beautiful we can say more at the stars at night now you know we had Seventy trays of four and they are and we can say this is that many stars that now we can look out and see all the stars but it seems like a lot of work to get get it back together but we're ready Gulf\nSaturday watch for wind and rain I still in the upper forties right now forty seven degrees in Boston this is definitely the you are\nTo\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

I've seen many knows that this looks like it's framed and and you're brushing that financially for\nFun flakes of a little pieces of stone or when they're making a projectile point one is ...\nI Need to be trying to I'm a different or and sharpening on heroin for a project to a point and make these little tiny ...\nFor their pay someone down there or larger one it's a half a quarter of an inch long for you know this one\nI didn't know that's what they were\nDoing with the losers may have what's called primitive arts festivals where people are making arrowhead today and this is a double Tosh is what's on the floor after you're making a ... point is that this was probably ten thousand years old [noise]\nI just touch something ten thousand you know ... school [noise] you know\nFlood not mean that was my head that Dr heading who just wiped out a few hundred years of history was one for the summer and it was ... [laughter]\nIt's funny but the reason he slipped may not be artifacts are most beneficial to archaeologist they reveal their stories best when they're found where they were left and storms like recent hurricane Michael can disturbed that\nIf you stand in a place long enough you can feel the same ... you know a little bit and it's because you know into problems and education's\nYou think that's the rain as you are you shake your fist at the elements to just now\nIt importantly [laughter]\nUm but these things are thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if the employees are not currently accurate and that's really why we were so very concern is that we have an open exploration pit almost a meter deep with soils that have not seen the letter day for the better part of nine thousand years\nWe've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered this with tarps sandbag the whole thing and we we are awful awful lot\n[noise] and so they continue the work that was started by him as a devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes was laid\nThe original work was done by the state archaeologist Kelvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the law in Nineteen Ninety four and that's what some of the most important earliest ones were made\nCalvin Jones isn't he the one who got a real barrel of loans delivered to his home and\nHe's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he yeah the Jackson has and he's the one who said wait a second this dirt is more than dirt is part of this ancient burial site yeah here\nThey had a delivery of dirt and within the ... there were artifacts\nThat is archaeologist Barbara clause of the Florida public archaeology network\nAnd we've traveled to the place where Calvin Jones got his loan and realized it held treasures it's now the lake Jackson Mountains archeology state park in Tallahassee a beautiful carpet of long meeting to grass covered hills rise like the facts of green elephants one bigger than the others\nOkay we walked across that vast lawn and there it is I mean oh how how high near would you say this ...\nThis is the tallest up to seven mountains it is thirty six feet tall\nThese mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt and let's just backup\nWhat exactly is the mound this site is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture known by many as the mound builders\nOver time they would build these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain a hot when that person past they would then be hurt or buried in the mountains\nAnd their home would be burns and then they would cap it off with more soil and then the next leader with live on top of it so over time it became holler and taller and you can actually see those different layers of soil if you were to kind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burn holes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplit us climbed the mountain and that feels kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral pie or is that\nIt's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today to definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\nI feel that but we are going to climate stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would've done hundreds of years ago so here we go [noise]\nAre there are\nNative peoples who are direct descendants of the people who live here the\nDescendants of the people who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that\nWe are not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up the mound um which is covered\nI Know there's concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking since the year one thousand ADD these mounds and we're right on top now these now have whether women a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains wouldn't be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part in do now and then you had the open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains\nHere we are ready on top of this now and we have all this growth so the leader of a community we'd get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living\nThis was strategically placed over here to our east we have Lake Jackson I always tell people when you're looking for archaeological sites you look for your basic needs food water and shelter there are other states similar to that throughout the south east all the way up through the Mississippi Valley up into Ohio even when they were excavating here at Jackson\nThey were finding copper breast plates or ... ... we don't have proper in Florida\nSo it was evidence of trade with those other places\nWhen Justin and this mound when it was excavated there would be a family there was a dog at one point\nThey found women they found one child I Believe he was about eleven years old and yes there was a thug burial\nWhy is it so important is again a thousand to Fifteen hundred a community that lived here before the soda came through ... which what does it
