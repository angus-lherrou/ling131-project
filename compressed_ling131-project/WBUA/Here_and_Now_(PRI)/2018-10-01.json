colleague on winning a Nobel Prize\nThis is fantastic news of course for Jim for empty arson but most importantly for cancer patients around the world\nWill tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immune therapy to attack cancer well Dr Alison is really dedicated\nHis entire life and his uh research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works\nIn cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and his main insight was to understand how to block a protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand\nLevel [laughter] well in our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal cells in our body or cause autoimmune diseases\nAnd part of that break process also impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Alison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for cancer treatment in general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery chemotherapy and radiation\nIn creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments or sometimes used in isolation alone [noise]\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nAbsolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to an sites and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of tree mad and allow us to reduce the side effects associate with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer what\nKind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular results\nIncluding patients who are surviving for decades as a result\nOf these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gyms team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nI genes Allison started his career at Indiana or send in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nThe Andy Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving a good results\nWell there's a mid shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will die of cancer this year how are you about the future of cancer treatment right now\nRight now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combinations of targeted therapy immunotherapy and the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer a fact\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that are heralded in today's

rural and suburban areas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty ... twenty Seventeen\nAnd Steve was the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years across the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening at a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming\nWell it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo schools districts in ... county Washington one of the district trying to figure all this out currently welcome yeah thank you for having me those numbers are shocking what are you seeing there appears county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled just this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students [noise] um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year did you have any idea why\n[noise] yeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families they see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but I I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom\nWe never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened um there's many different factors that are leaving these families just on the edge of becoming homeless and\nReally it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nNow you are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country or you've seen a an issue where people are getting priced out of a of a place like Seattle and then they're coming your way and they still can't afford housing is that what you're noticing\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community is what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or as cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and\nLike I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath them\nAnd it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical\nLike it's very challenging and first off\nThat aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car their children will be taken away from them um it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognized\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nAnd you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nYeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter] because they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it\nI go out in my community and I do drive by is to go to the address if they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lot of times I just go out to the house and cold and knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment that they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers are experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage, Alaska", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "01"}
