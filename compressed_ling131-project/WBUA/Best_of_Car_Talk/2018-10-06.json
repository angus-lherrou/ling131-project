K. fuck you like\nHey R. I. S. T. E. and\nI like that [laughter] yeah well that's the neo Norwegians [laughter]\nWhat's up Christine um are you a student or professor or anything like that I'm a grad student grad student in what department um hotel restaurant management for oh yeah what\nSo anyway what what's the nature of your call\nUm well I have an eighty seven sixty six turn around and whenever I turn the heat it's now it's like ... ... ...\nShe's I've ever heard it described as maple syrup oh yeah oh yeah it is it is rather maple syrup ... you know there's going to Rome young\nYeah on good days it's not like a therapy on\nThat little sweet and maple syrup as a smell I Would I Would have said then I got a bigger nose and you know [laughter] that I'm sure you know what's happening is a anti freeze\nAntifreeze which smells like maple syrup is getting out of its cage see we we have to keep antifreeze caged okay we keep it in a place that they can escape from except that sometimes as a scapegoat because little holes occur and in your case it's occurring in the heater\n... that's bad that's real bad it is yeah well it's how long has it been happening at least a couple of years [laughter] I Hope you're right on top of things [laughter] she's a student yeah\nAnd you have an ... replenishing the anti freeze obviously yeah did you realize that that's what's leaking out and you know even before you're called us that the sweet smell was probably the anti freezing human losing all these years\nWithout giving me a little my credit for\nThem yeah oh you do have you thought things were unrelated well it's good that you've been replacing it because I was gonna say that in two years you got to be out of antifreeze by now but you've been replacing it so that's good that's and if you don't mind the smell and you don't mind keeping up with the filling up all the anti freeze forget it\nI hate the rain on my brother's parade yeah but I think the anti freeze is poisonous and I don't I don't think I Know it's poisonous and I don't think it's a good idea to be or it may make you have your grades been dropping [laughter]\nIt may make your immune to it now that\nUsed to take a little bit of the boys in a little bit of arsenic every day so that when they when this subject I gave him a lethal dose\nThat say I didn't weren't so it may be that you're building up some kind of an immunity to this poison but it's unlikely okay but it's more likely that you are born with being poisoned little by little and losing maybe hundreds of millions of brain cells a day as a result of this yeah oh\nYeah so what are you going to be an artist [laughter]\nAh yes [laughter]\nRight have you considered paleontology [laughter]\nWell anyway I I I I Would know this is not good you can try to stop ... compound and my guess is you're going to need a new heat of core which is going to be a few hundred bucks\nOkay I Need to have that replaced and I would probably do it he lands on otherwise yeah it's not good to have that leaking in right in your in your brain and you won't have much of a career in hotel motel management if you have the drawl\n[laughter] that's what happens when you [laughter] you know I mean would you cause Hyman you mean Christine [laughter]\nOh you'll meet to do with the nightmare [laughter]\nThat doesn't work [laughter] I Do get sick\nOr you're not getting the rules [laughter] thank you [laughter] one eight eight eight ... eight eight eight to two seven eight to five five below you're on TALK\nHi ah my name's Clinton from Vancouver, Washington\nQuestion how ... that's the name huh\nThat family name I was named after my godfather was named after Teddy Roosevelt fifth child so\n[laughter] well wasn't everybody\nThe reason I'm calling is because my grandfather God rest his soul we passed away in Nineteen eighty six in Nineteen eighty five he drove is Seventy to dodge dart stronger into the garage and who he never did anything to it\nHis hat is sitting on the seat where he left it in the garage in Portland, Oregon\nBut ah no fluids were drained out of it and it's mind if I Want it\nAll I got to be you got to do it man why you know it's just kind of thing when you're walking home my wife is and and I live with her dark\nSwing you got the chance to start anew I have to say I mean I\nAs you may know I mean I Am a lover of old\nCars yeah but I have to also say that the Seventy two dart was maybe one of the worst cars ever made all NO PLAN and ... and ... the ... if not the worst the ugliest\nBut that's the car that I went fishing with them\nNo no I said yes and and it and it obviously has certain certain value to be on its its actual monetary value show and I'll say that just preceded the dark years at Chrysler by a couple of years\n[laughter] doubts that getting bad for those guys are Christ with two Seventy four five six seven eight nine eighty eighty one I mean those are the real bad years what Seventy two they were on the cusp of the bad years have a three akin was getting dark when it wasn't real [laughter] black yeah\nI I think it's got schools in mice under the hood phone probably would have gotten out there I mean I've been told that obviously all the seals they're gonna have to be replaced no\nLaws into the bologna no that's not true\nI mean that's that's some kind of old wives' tale that if you let the ... all the soon as you turn the key all the seals break and an oil starts squirting out from everything\nHe does you should put it right back into the garage that back to the [laughter] yeah no that's probably not going to happen\nYeah we're probably is going to happen is that you'll have to do something to the break or you may have to change belts and whatever uh you'll obviously want to change your because they they do tell you change it every three thousand miles or Eighteen years with\n... and ...\nOther than that there's probably not a heck of a lot you have to do to it and they're ... you should do to what except to make sure it's safe to drive don't forget you're willing to just walk away from this car right now so what is it worth very much to you\nIn our fall fundraiser from all of us the w._b. you

repair and of course the answer to last week's very ... ... ... you know you can't have hard ones all the time because people get discouraged I don't even remember what it was all you'll remember in a minute this was sent to my fellow named ed cache of any rights\nJoins in World War two used to get microfilm for all of this one\n[laughter]\nOne of the way the allied agencies in World War two used to get microphones or example pass German guards was hiding in hollow coke buttons not the kind that you have on a shirt with a with a thread goes through but the big ones with the loop on the back\nLike you'd have in the winter coat you know yeah and the top of the button screwed on and off like a ... well anyway this worked for a while but somehow the Germans became aware of this trick and started giving a twist to the buttons on the code of anyone who looked suspicious\nTo see if any of the buttons on screw anyway\nWhen the allies phones do the trick had been discovered the people in charge of preparing the clothing for undercover agents had to make a change under clothing for cover agents when did you think that's\nAnother clothing coverage they had to make a change they did make a change and none of those hall of buttons was ever discovered again what was the change yeah they switched over to the person\n[laughter] need buttons are still [laughter]\nThey switched over to ... and that you might expect they couldn't discovered that ... that's not true what they did I mean there are a lot of things they could have done they could've applied some he's of making the difficult to turn\nOr they could have newest thing I ... in the first plane would have shot that in the first place but what they thought I was even better yeah they made the ... yeah so when the Germans twisted the buttons they in fact didn't come off like tighter\nAnd after they failed and a few attempts they gave up on it because they just figured out they're not using that drink anymore right they must have swallowed the microfilm so they taught them all\n[laughter] but anyway they haven't found the microwave [laughter] so who's our winter\nThe weather is Gregory ... from hazel in Pennsylvania and for having your answer like the random from all the right answers that we got\nYou're going to get a twenty five dollar gift certificates shameless commerce division which is a cop talked dot com and with that gift certificate you can get a copy of one of our CDs either the disrespectful ... collection good choice all the collection of classic calls called the back\nOf Notre

eight to five five a lawyer on Car Talk\nHow the moon from Tucson\nHi moon how ya doing wonderful wonderful excellent\nAnd this maybe isn't a question but it I I knew the answer I Need some help gentleman\nWe're ready okay I didn't say willing and able but we're ready [laughter] I was\nTaking a family to the Grand Canyon earlier this year ... and I was writing in our Ninety three bronco and as we're where he left early in the morning as we're going along\nAre finally my wife says hey why don't you go ahead and roll up the windows and put on the air conditioning and I said no no no we can't do that because we're going to get better gas mileage if we leave the windows down\nOh and you know wife said closed frail moon face that real similar to that [laughter] she said well remembered those guys you listen to and when we upped our pledge [laughter] you may\nRead that book witness it yeah yeah and she says well in there it said that the new vehicles now or are more aerodynamic and definitely you can leave the windows up and the air on on your gas mileage is better and I said yeah but\nThis is a truck and they're different she said no no no that's not what it said it's it's new and leave 'em up so I Need you to settle this force what rights\nIs there anything in it for us [laughter] I made the answer to the to the for that Fifteen minutes\n[laughter] well\nActually this is an answer this is one of the few [laughter] what are the few answers or comments that we have made which is actually based on scientific evidence\nOh yeah right [laughter] [laughter] if you look\nIn the in the uh index of the technical papers of the society of automotive engineers you will find several papers in which studies were done of various kinds of vehicles driving at\nVarious speeds both with the windows down in the air conditioner off in the windows up in the air conditioner on in all cases\nThis gas mileage is better with the air conditioner on in the windows up\nNow it's not a ... says all cases that I have read on at least trucks to well it's a real goal yeah it's a truck yeah [noise] ah I mean\nAs my brother says the difference is north tremendous difference is not enough to make you want to have the windows up or down\nThe difference does become dramatic as this\nGood will think about what happens I think about the air flow around the car with the windows open mhm all kinds of weird things are happening\nWind is coming in windows going out and then we're the windows are up it's at least a somewhat smooth lemon are kind of flow that's going on which makes the car slide right through the air as opposed to being buffet around by the\nWay that the only word that you remember from fluid\nDynamics lemon ... yeah yeah it is I Me too [laughter] I didn't know Eddie

on TALK\nOh says we on from Honolulu\nLeo Leo on what's going on Leon\nWell I got an eighty four Toyota pick up and ah she's giving me some problems fire or I'll be driving along and everything will be going fine then all of a sudden all experienced is a loss of power in the Carl start jerking I'm done and and so that sounds like the rpm Z or going but there's nothing come busting\nWhen you are wrong wrong wrong you mean it's it's surging\nYeah in ... and the cars also losing power ...\nYeah ... and then what happened did you say once in a while it does this\nWell it started off doing it once in a while now it's almost to the point where it's kind of losing power most of the time and then once in a while going run run run and getting power\nReally really\n... and a stick shift\nYes stick shift feeling jak how many miles a hundred and fifty thousand fuel injected mhm sure yes well I don't have any answer [laughter]\n\nLet me give me a minute can we change the fuel injections corporation I had a I had a good answer would you like it to be car Britain [laughter]\nIt might make my life easier uh\nYou know what's happening and I don't know exactly what component just feeling but you're not getting spark proper sparked in someone was and that explains the surging\nYou went right to spark huh I did I did I did go right to spark what'd you do that well I I got kind of got a shot down on the field things\nLike that [laughter] I don't know\nI did go right to farm and it could easily be a bad fuel pump sure I mean there's all kinds of things that could be even a dirty ... you know the filter isn't this thing Leon\nYeah I actually change the filter last week\nAnd get out how many hours that take you a about two hours that's not bad that's not\nBad again the circumstances under which this happens and how often and all that stuff to do that again\nIt happens the most when I'm giving it a lot of gas and going up hill\nA I\nLiked daddy answer no good yeah\nYeah well it still could be the fuel I mean you know I like that answer because I thought that supported the fuel you'd think well it's yeah is that what sport that doesn't help us at all is that [laughter]\nThat doesn't help [laughter] when I was watching the you're you're right if\nYou let them keep talking because there might be more just like that he gave us an answer that didn't help us\n[laughter] okay [laughter] you might you might be loaded related to what you've got ugly [laughter] I got another another\nClue what I'm going downhill it never happens\nYeah we do that yeah we know that yeah okay [laughter] I Know\nThat it's it's others you could shut the engine off another [laughter] down [laughter] man\nFor power the doing it too yeah yeah and when you when you demands power from the engine there were two things that you need well there were three things that you need you need air to support the combustion so you could have something as simple as a dirty air field but we know you've checked that yes are you\nOh oh oh oh [laughter]\nYeah this vehicle\nHas if I'm not mistaken an air flow censor right at the air filled the housing is that true\nAh I'm not sure she's if it does what could an laid it wasn't that explains his whole in the bellows between the Airflow sensor and the throttle a and that would explain 'cause that's when you demand for power is the greatest you step on the gas\nThat hole in the bellows is allowing air to get into the engine but it it's not going through the air flow sensor\nAnd when that happens the\nKnow that you've got a lot of air and therefore need a lot of fuel\nAnd it sends in an amount of fuel\nFor the amount of air that she's going through the air flow meter\nUh-huh and therefore you have fuel starvation which would make you think that number one you had a bad fuel pump or clogged fuel filter\nSo I Would look at that first is in fact you have that bellows between the between the throttle in the air cleaner housing checked to see if that isn't crack because considering that the vehicles a hundred and five years old it could be correct\n[laughter] if that isn't it then it could be any number of things which are going to require that you go to a repair shop because someone's going to have to test the fuel time pressure and someone is going to have to test the coil and if all of those two things are okay the next thing I suspected the nighter\n[noise] Mm yeah I mean the good part of the holy on is that if the car breaks down what would you care 'cause you're in Honolulu\nI can still walk to the beach you can always walk to the ... what do you do it just like you surf boards in the back and stuff like that that's right you don't actually worked or you know I Pretend to go to school where\nA University of Illinois and what do you what are you studying there are um protecting study geography oh that's a good ... Hawaii is a good place to sort of geography [laughter]\nIt's a great excuse to you know go study the islands you know I've got to go here and study the geography here and go there\nYeah yeah and it on the way there's a beach I mean that's a joke we pretty much been exhausted\nI mean [laughter] I mean [laughter] you look at a map now you're hardly ever see terra incognito [laughter] right [laughter] yeah yeah\nSo you're like beating a dead horse here you're you're studying something that's pretty much been done before but that's good because there aren't many days to make I mean\nA lot of what people were in school is ... ... when we all of what they learn as what other are the people have figured out already\nThat's the whole idea is that you know just to bring you up to speed and just as you get up to speed you die\nSo when when the next generation [laughter] right isn't it [laughter] I\nDo get this elusive degree in geography what are you going to do with it you get to each other people geography right\nYeah I Hope not [laughter] what to do with it I mean what what who\nCould well you know it's good when you're on a trip with people that you can identify things landscape like there's a Mesa there's a Butte\nDoes a [laughter]\nThat isn't there was an all or nothing hill that's in a royal [laughter]\nWell we on\nKeep on trucking as they say it and hopefully that bellows All right and if you're in deep doo doo I lost the fellows\nBecause it solves both of our problems yeah we're both wrong\n[laughter] you later there was a good weather by by banks\nOne eight eight eight Car Talk that eight eight eight to two seven eight to five five lawyer on Car Talk\nHi this is Diane calling from San Diego\nHi Diane from San Diego Diego what's up", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Best of Car Talk", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "06"}
