[laughter] okay come up with a hundred ways to say oh well the show would be a lot easier if we weren't on the spot to answer questions as we know it or not awful [laughter] I don't know [laughter] and if you'd like to talk to us our number is\nEight eight eight Car Talk that's one eight eight eight to two seven eight to five five hello you're on ...\nHi this is Colleen I'm calling from Lombard, Illinois\nColleen Lombard, Illinois lilac capital of the world are really no kidding well maybe not at the world for two weeks and we laid eggs are they actually yeah that's ... great but they're kind of short lived by me two weeks come on [laughter]\nUnfortunately almost every year we have a lilac festival and we have a parade and everything and I'm like the last few years have died before\nThe [laughter] I I Know that we have them in our yard and usually you have to get them out of the snow to see them because it's it's the snow on the ground\nThat's bad they are well anyway calling what what can we will hear that I don't know what you can do I I'm not really sure if the question is about my dad's car my dad oh [laughter]\nSo here's the deal all the other day in and say listen you guys want to go to the show he's eighty my mom Seventy five and he said yeah that's fine but I have to drive and I said well why is it and he says well 'cause I just got a new pair of break and I said well what does that have to do with anything and he said well for the first five hundred miles I'm the only person that can drive the car number one\nHe tells me that I said well who told you that all my mechanic told me that I said well what's the other reason he said well you have to very your speed for the first five hundred miles from between thirty five miles an hour fifty forty five whatever\nAnd I said to my candidate [laughter] said did where are you driving like this he says I'm fifty nine [laughter]\nOutside of his house [laughter] miles an hour there and so he's going thirty five fifty forty thirty [laughter] did one of two things is going to happen\nYeah or someone's going to tell you that shouldn't be at the very least you're going to Philly honk awful lot of people plus I don't believe that that's true who's his mechanic [laughter] you know I I think maybe he was just trying to get him to leave the shop\nSo that you know my dad's trying to talk them into it so basically I should drive the car only right and the guy going yeah yeah\nExactly I Know and we don't we frequently do that with my brother so are the issues are a a\nIf you get new brakes should one person only drive the\n... yeah and it's a Ninety eight Chevy lumina in case you care you know we know that okay me\nOr do you have to very the speed that you drive at if you get new breaks a and see\n[laughter] how are we going to break down [laughter] well I mean [laughter] to be fair to dad and his mechanic\nA modern break do require a break in break in period okay that usually accomplished by the guy who put the brakes and [laughter] and frequently we will we will put new brakes on a car\nAnd we'll take it out and the first few stops are not very good and the bridge do require a wearing in period because the new fangled\nMetallic break do require that they see into the just wrote is especially if the rovers have been machine a they have to kind of find a home and the breaking of effect of Mrs improve as the bridge where in\nBut that's when it happens very fast and first of all to describe it in terms of miles doesn't make any sense because what if you get into his car and drove five hundred miles without stopping\nIndigenous breaking period is is accomplished ... well we take a car out by the time we've test driven if ten or Fifteen minutes the brakes are sufficiently broken and and if they have it then there's something wrong you know so the idea that five hundred miles in one driver has two daughters and saying I think calling [laughter]\nHe doesn't like the way you drive [laughter]\nYou know and he told me it would be fine after the five hundred my I don't\nThink so you'll be another excuse me don't forget you could have driven over there and taking them in your car\nYou know I have I have a I have a pickup so and if they can make out but it will only fit to people come\nOn they're the ones who suggested the picking [laughter] because that would preclude your driving wouldn't it [laughter]\n... yeah I I think that it goes I don't think I think that made the whole thing I think it goes deeper than the idea of those real and then you drive think golf [laughter] and they want to keep you away from the car when they're in it All right well thank you guys All right thanks for Dr [laughter] one\nEight eight have got to be her driving yeah oh yeah I'm going to be a wacko yeah Michael ... we'll see uh whenever we someone has to go someplace where there was all drive on them [laughter]\nWell that's all right even though she's got the only ... carries a lot of people yeah we went out and bought a little box so she wouldn't say well number one will fit in my car was out on a ... will be much more comfortable in the school bus [laughter]\nOne eight eight eight car since let's drive to school [laughter] they need to to seven eight to five five [laughter] hello you're on cards or\nEither the speed it from Boston Boston was the mascot actually Dorchester George what plan of George I'm getting oh Dorchester fields corner of your classic than others [laughter] I'm a little lower middle or lower middle is not\nFar away [laughter] that's good yeah so it's\nNot a well I'm I'm calling because I have a a force for that is doing or to some pretty crazy stuff\nThat is ... ... or anything uh you know [laughter]\nBlue smoke is kind of puffing out of my car when I started I've been putting transmission flew to because it it seemed like it was slipping a little bit and I couldn't see any ... or anything but just strange thing is that I noticed that my oil\nWas getting higher and higher and higher and I know it sounds totally crazy but when I changed my oil it completely overflowed ... you know like there was ten ... yeah\nBecause you're adding the transmission fluids of the oil to the engine oil\nIt it seems like it but somebody told me that was totally impossible\nWill also have the latest on the caravan of would be migrants from Central America that next time on all things considered from NPR News today at five or Ninety point nine W. B. ... Boston is NPR News station\nSupport for God talking NPR comes from the used electrical honest as we fall off as rainbow colored hair extensions from NPR NPR member stations and\nJane and Gerald catcher supporting the children's moving to Florida dedicated to helping all children into school with the social emotional and intellectual skills needed to succeed\nMore information is available at children's movement Florida dot org and the women floor you looked foundation committed to supporting ID as an institution that advanced the wellbeing of women and improve lives livelihoods in developing countries more information is available at ... dot org\nI we're back you're listening to talk with a click and clack the ... brothers and we talk about cars car repair\nIn da ... to last week's puzzle or\nJust the one about the guy on the bicycle on shore cold and that was\nGreat wasn't me ma'am [laughter] no this is this is an automotive\nSpecies I think I don't remember too well anyway it was submitted by Jeff Matthews who's in the army somewhere I don't know where he is [laughter] anyway he wrote some years ago my wife complained that air Honda Accord would occasionally start fucking snorting and choking when she came to a stop\nIt would keep that up for a couple of minutes and the problem would go away sometimes not returned from weeks I looked at the usual things but since I was never there when it happened and it wasn't my car anyway I didn't really care\n[laughter] oh did he say that [laughter] no I wouldn't call them directly if if he didn't know you can do is get a guy into trouble I've ... I've taken some license and just so yeah I mean we're in enough trouble with our wives as it is [laughter]\nIncluding Jeff then one fall he says I was getting a car ready for the state safety inspections so I'd jacked up juggle the wheels in that all the things you usually do and when I let it down off the jak stands a nearly empty can break floored rolled out from under the front seat I said Mm [noise]\nMm\nThat's interesting I went into the house and ask my wife one question yeah it was not what the neighbors break for doing it [laughter] I asked her one question when she gave me the answer I knew what was wrong with her car yeah ... was the question and the question was\nHow often do you replace you ... yeah\nAnd the reason he asked that question was this somewhere along the line he surmise is gone she went to the gas station in her break like was on because the fluid level was down she buys a can of fluids from the attendant and watches him fill up the reservoir\nThinking this is part of the regular maintenance of the car whenever the light goes on she talked so I've never bothering to ask where's the brakes lord going it's like well you'll add oil from time to time sure don't unusual to add break food from time to time and as such you had this Canada She may have been one of many Kansas ...\nHe was constantly adding break fluid to a leaking master cylinder\nAnd the master cylinder was leaking into the boost the power break butcher in every once in a while when she came to a stop especially in abrupt one or if the level of fluid in there where it's not where there's not supposed to be any was high enough\nThat food would get sucked into the engine and make them think product combustible break food which causes the stumbling choke and maybe even stall and then once it worked its way through a company by this Belcher smoke out the tailpipe relative drink everything would be right and the subsequent stops\nWouldn't be a problem because she'd have to wait until enough fluid accumulated in the booster to cause the problem again man\nSo whole question of how would you add break flew into the car yeah so who's our winter\nNathaniel Myers from Berkeley, California probably some aging hippie sitting there on the streets of Berkley selling beads\nAnd now yeah do you wish that will you [laughter] so and I do [laughter] and and now he's going to win\nA twenty five dollar gift certificate for the store at ... dot com with which he can get a cut talks disappearing hairline cover up kitt also known as the embroidered cuts are made [laughter]\nAnyway we'll have an interesting little puzzle coming up in the third happen to show you know I didn't say no because it is not going to be tackling no that's all right but stick around you might like it or right now if you have a question about your car or anything else our number is eight eight eight Car Talk that's Eighteen eighty eight twenty two Seventy eight to fifty five\nO your [laughter] how many impossible ways are that it saved us lots [laughter] hello\nDavid street from Portland, Oregon Portland, Oregon yeah way over here you know I look at the same during that little tighter something interesting about Portland, Oregon bullets that\nYou know that it's almost was named Boston Oregon we don't know this little bit of history I didn't want to join a little bit on the other tell you about it Portland, Oregon with\n[laughter] [laughter] I Want to say that all ready [laughter] anything\nJust out of all I'll let him continue\nSounded bogus [laughter] but it's but it's good to watch this now go ahead\nPortland, Oregon as you may know read founded by two men from New England ... one of the man\nWas from Portland Maine and the other one was from Boston, Massachusetts\nAnd they flip the coin to decide which then to use for the new city they will founding in Oregon and Portland one word simply for those flip the coin you could be calling from Boston Oregon right now\n[laughter]\nIt sounds it's just bad enough to\nBe through the maybe like my puzzlers sure that there's some Historical Society there in in Portland Ore Boston if you want to call it that ten and I'll bet you they'll corroborate the stories all looking and you have to have you on stumps have jumped [laughter] anyway I mean what's what's shaking man\nI've got a transmission problem with an eighty nine out of one hundred and the problem is like Ninety five percent of the time the cars to warm up for two or three minutes before the transmission it's going to shift millions out skier in any of the year\nAnd it's just it's been doing it for like five months\nAnd you've checked the Florida cause I checked the flu it have you ever changed the floor\nAnd that's what I thought about having transmission food flushed but then some of the shops I talked to said you know if you do that you have a thirty percent chance that you can wash out at the mission some brand that might be\nKeeping it might be making it work on the debris right now [laughter] the read very [laughter]\nThat is it's a it's a classic theory\nYou know shop wants to be responsible for your not being able to drive out yeah ah we have run into this a few times and we always\nMake people sign document that says considering the\nGang of sound mind in somebody writing and ...\nThe the the serious nature of the problem with your transmission it's entirely possible that having driven and you may have to be towed out yeah you know so so I I Would say that that a is a very good chance that you should save your money on the transmission flushing\nAnd devote all of it to the transmission rebuilds [laughter]\nYou must have a hundred and forty five K. on this thing right\nThat's two hundred two hundred yeah\nIt's been my dad's car and he's taken it to the Audi shot regularly so he takes care\nOf and you had it for what six months\nSix months not breaking a month after you got it right you ruined it basically was laughing [laughter] that gives you the car and drove it into the ground [laughter] it'll month yeah typical son do you\nThink then it's not that there could be a potential for debris or whatever\nAnd I don't know that is such a bogus\nWhy not give the transmission flush right\nNow why not ... as long as you're prepared and have the financial resources to get it rebuilt if it doesn't work that they are way more so that means that you are buying into this brief series by into what Iraq\n[laughter]\nYou know this isn't worried theory is completely bogus no\n... you know it's it's like the theory you know they say never never put a battery on the floor when you're hired sucked up in the Congress luck though was right out of the light out\nOf it there's no scientific evidence to support that there is no and there wasn't any scientific evidence to support the debris theory either however it all has to do with bad karma has to do with him ... evidence done and it may be that those few cases where we see transmissions fail they were going to feel anyway\nIn flushing the mold had no bearing whatsoever on the future of that transmission however it's hard to dispute observation\nEnds up in the midst does exist I mean the missus there and it's very difficult to get rid of\nIt and you'll be supporting the news and you could be eligible for a tax deduction go to W. B. U. R. dot org slash cars that you [noise]\nDo\nSupport for talking to NPR comes on new line of garage formal way a few drinks transmission fluid resistance tuxedo bibs pleaded rubber slots and the all

new puzzlers but it really isn't a new puzzle up puzzle I use ages in ages ago but since we've lost so many listeners over the years and you know presumably gains replacements ... opportunity\nWhen you haven't been married ... maybe a couple of\nSneak you know but the ones where you have retained have lost their memory [laughter] well I've got a good part I didn't\nRemember fight it actually uses from before but I'm going to use it because it said was beautifully and said next week's puzzle there oh I think so I think it's appropriate that I use it because otherwise interest reasons no excuse for trying to sneak it [laughter] I mean I I think is a very creative rental oh here it is\nA girl and her mother are out shopping\nA store and they over here a conversation between a customer in a sales person\nIn the next ... ... and the customers asks how much does one cost and the answer is\nNinety nine cents mhm okay how about twelve oh that'll be a dollar Ninety eight mhm okay in that case to pick a hundred and twenty eight\n[noise]\nTwo Ninety seven and the question is kind of store they and what is this person fine\nNow if you think you know the answer right it on the back of a postcard or choose what into what pair of black diamond cobra ice axes carbon fibre shaft stainless steel ... ads and triples sewn adjustable had written loop [laughter] whoa [laughter] and send them to\n... our hearts are plaza box thirty five hundred Harvard Square Cambridge our fair city Matt zero two to three by the way\nIf anyone out there has any puzzles feel free to send them by any means available [laughter] yeah you know that already you know I'm just thinking of the future like\nNext [laughter] you really only been back from vacation for like four weeks and you're already strapped\nNo no no no I'm just planning ahead okay okay anyway if you want to uh email your answer to us you can do so from cart sock dot com and you can also send the puzzlers that way too if you'd like to ask a question about your car or anything else you can give us a call at eight eight eight Car Talk that eight eight eight to two seven eight to five five lawyer on Car Talk\nGuys this is Dave Chappelle I'm calling from Denver, Colorado\nHi Dave Dave from Denver what's up the from Denver\nA got a question for you the car in question is in Ninety six Nissan Maxima and it's my girlfriend's car and I'm shopping around for snow tires for this thing every place that I went to said they've refused to sell me to\nWrite only sold me for right\nThere's something to this or is this just a ploy to get me to buy four tires when I really only need to\nI Wish I knew the answer to that [laughter]\nWhen I I think the rationale behind the four or is that they don't want to compromise the handling of the car by someone you two tires that are designed for snow only write and leave the other two tires on the car they're going to compromise the handling they want to compromise a full all full wields equally\nAnd and where would you put the two\nThe two gold medals rights on the front right and what they're saying is because of the abs it wouldn't make it showed the front would grab a lot more than the back in the back and which swing around\nYeah I mean it's not just because of the aim yes I mean no\nI don't like the ... yes it's supposed to prevent that that's what I thought\nYeah but what happens is if the front wheels have much better traction than the real ones than the back end is gonna come around if you if you go into a skit ... is all it is I think it's legitimate okay\nI mean if you go around a curve and the front wheels have great traction and they go right around that curve back wheels have a lot worse traction and so they go where sideways sideways and all of a sudden the back into the cars in front of you how does that happen\n[laughter] really scared [laughter] yeah\nSo for is the only reasonable answer OK okay well I don't think they're trying to send your tires that you don't need a ... as you do need or one or not our kitty corner\n[laughter] [laughter] you're like then that really caught my run out of all the miners higher learning [laughter] how'd that work we do know that that might be interesting to try that [laughter] oh come on they have you got [laughter]\nThat could be interesting to have stumbled upon again and again some [laughter] and you might as well by four wheels to\nSomebody did tell me that get easy just to kind of pop mom and pop 'em off\nMore exactly and while while you're there [laughter] I really ever ever thought about fishing [laughter] haven't we saw the trailer it's going to go fishing and they might have the benefit of America and you'll get a boat\nRide just discard hasn't really leave the city very much ... no I don't\nWell you need one [laughter] hopefully somebody else needs one [laughter]\nYeah we do a good luck and thank you very much but by now [laughter]\nUh what eight eight eight where are you know you don't like the diagonal idea of course I Love it ... ... ... at first blush at first blush it sounds stupid but you know what was your other women [laughter] something stupid [laughter]\nOne eight eight eight ... eight eight eight to two seven eight to five five hello you're on Car Talk\nKnow I ... and I knew that too because I heard of Deerfield\nAnd that's like way out west like new taxes\n[laughter] not quite that at all\nKnows how to see [laughter] near a new what why would you do in your field academy 'cause it was it Neal Williamstown\nNowhere that an hour east of ... other side of the mountains\nThere are mountains walking [laughter] rock yeah a lot of the continental divide so you're near Denver\n[laughter] one week in the [laughter]\nOh God you know\nWho who above the geography of this country you know it doesn't really matter as long as there's triple A. and trip to\nThey will told me that I Want her Lincoln would ever take I mean you'll get out of their whatever it takes so why is that I spent so many years in grammar school learning where the states were and what the capitals where I don't care\nWhat you know why because you never know when you're going to be called upon to be in jeopardy [laughter]\nYou're going to happen just like that could happen you could be one of the challenge searches and next thing you know they wouldn't have been embarrassments\nWhat would be to think that Lincoln, Nebraska next to the field Massachusetts would be that would be anyway it's been a real pleasure\n[laughter]\nWhat's up I'm well\nI'm I'm calling with a question about a piece of information that I was given and I'm a little embarrassed because the person who gave me the face of information is actually standing outside of the door of the room that I'm thinking right now\nI haven't told them that I'm calling so maybe that's what I learned not tell them will make it quick\nOkay well here's the thing um I I'm In an outer leadership program um and one of our days in school we were talking about gear and about stove and about different kinds of ... you can use for stuff and I have a\nCamp stove and um that uses white guess yes and I've had this stove and some gas for for many years like\nI don't know for years or something and I can no longer use it and stuff because it's too old one of my instructors told me that standing out that that are ... told me that I could I didn't want to throw the fuel and he said well you can just pour it into your gas tank and ... have your car\nIf it's not good enough or you're crummy stole you want to put it on your twenty thousand dollars are well you get the idea though\n[laughter] yeah I get the idea that that was that was what he told me now I have to tell you I talked to my father about this and he told me to make sure to tell you that ... he said that I could go ahead and put into the tank of the car as long as I had a lotta marshmallows handy\nWhen the Catholic [laughter] lot Rick\nAnd I don't know if I I mean I don't want to ruin my car\nWhy why is this ... this fuel which is not gasoline really it's it's camp stove fuel well", "year": "2018", "show_name":
