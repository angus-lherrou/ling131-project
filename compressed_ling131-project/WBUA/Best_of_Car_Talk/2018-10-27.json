time well start yeah okay is it coming from the front of the ... on the back on the\nFront end but find kind of hard to tell but if you can tell when you kinda go over a ... or older things like that 'cause that's when it happens to\nHappen anytime the shock absorber movie 'cause what it is ... is a shock absorber is binding\nWiping off the yeah\nI took it to the dealer you know and they put her up on them and they said you know they can see\nWell they didn't want to see anything below sea anything because I mean first of all if it is in fact the shock you've taken all the weight off the shock when you put up on the west\nWell more than that however they can't see anything that have to have X ray vision to see what's going on because it's going on and on the inside and it doesn't do it any more is that right\nThat's done it again this is a matter of fact almost as soon as I got out of there and also it seems like if you have the wheel turned during will turn\nDo you have to be turned all the way over\nWell that seems to do it when you do that or if you go forward and stop the folks that right\nI think it was just at the last instance before the thing does it's complete nosing when you come to a stop you'll notice that the bumper\nJust with the last ... and does this thing called a little nosedive is just gets a little bit closer to the pavement that's when you hear the funk isn't it yeah kind of like that yes good that's good and you'll hear it often times when you take off from a dead stop just the first instant you move you get the ...\nDo you should be they should be able to reproduce the sound not by putting it on the list but my leaving in on the ground and pushing down as hard as they can on the bumper like you're going to three hundred pound mother in law\nI don't know two hundred and fifty pound mothers ...\nI Believe that you know pushed up and\nDo your three hundred and [laughter] we only they're going to be alone\nI pray bouncing up and down

dangerous at all or no it just doesn't make\nNoise only games because you'll be thinking about it so much you're going to drive off the road worry a lot I Know I can tell that those people wouldn't even here this you're my brother's car you'd say off [laughter] haven't replaced at that one shark in the nose will go away okay and then do the other one would measure\nYeah just keep things in

I'm a\nI'm actually living in a little town in Colorado right now I'm called pressed him when I I'm uh from Woods Hole Massachusetts though actually what's on Cape Cod no\nKidding yeah then what brought you to crush them well I I'm his whale research on a\nParent if a construction I admit building an alternative house like a passive solar and it's made out of strap else have you guys ever heard of\nThat has been a straw bale yes [laughter] well sort of the house was like an eighty one Chevy [laughter] outside usually live there [laughter] that's what I'll turn and septic tank [laughter]\nLimits resting hay bales I mean they ... this is like a retro how are you going back like a couple of hundred years [laughter] his restaurant trying to live like a pioneer in Colorado so are you finished with you construction or you just be done it\nI'm actually just about to wrap it up good for you man yeah I\nDon't smoke [laughter] my only cook [laughter] no open romantic candlelight dinner not [laughter] funny way why did you thought what did you call it what's the\nProblem because of the car actually um I Do have a car from I have a Nineteen eighty four wheel drive to brew wagon yeah and um my friend ex girlfriend was moving out of Aspen, Colorado and she had this car and she didn't want it anymore so she gave me this thing\nSo I drove back and it seemed fine\nI and my girlfriend drove out to California with it and we drove to San Francisco\nThat finished what life just to to fix the country's not breaking it in with\nThe way [laughter] um but we have to San Francisco and we realized on the way out there that when the when the car heated up the crunch would start slipping but if we let it cool overnight or cough or a little while the clutch would catch fire to be absolutely like brand new\nAnd you made it back from San Francisco to crush stone Colorado\nEnough to push it that much\nBut it's the crush the clutch pedal feel any differently when it's beginning to slip aside from the fact that I'm working on that too [noise] well I\nI haven't noticed a difference to tell you the truth there might be but I haven't noticed any difference\n[laughter] well we're we're both independently working on hydraulics own I really don't ... I Believe have able collect oh\nOkay well just because the\nCable climate in which case I I can now say since I knew that I have no idea what's causing\nThat we have no idea what [laughter] he not\nOnly do I I Believe in eighty Subaru has a clutch cable well if that's true I suppose how about this go ahead I'm open to anything because I have one\nYou know look how the cable\n... is old fried and chewed up and it's ready to break any minutes of bogus they drove it to California\nUnderstand hanging on by several red but it's not\nBroken yet however as we know as things heat up what they expand so the cable gets longer all this\nBad [laughter] real [laughter] then we'll get this is an end and then it stops to sneak into the passenger compartment and rough itself around [laughter] well I think we have to attack I don't know why we have to protect\nThe original premise which is that the clutch is slipping how do you know it's slipping\nWell because I mean when I when it first go as you know I put in first year that starts rolling in it's fine and it goes and then [noise] Fifteen twenty minutes later I put it into gear that goes on in the car to go anywhere\nWell one of the things that ... one of the things that can keep a clip from slipping during the first few minutes of operation moisture on the clutch okay because it will actually act as a as a [noise] just like your brakes grab one yeah yeah yeah just can happen to the little moisture\nOn that flight she'll have you noticed any difference on what days there is no different\nThan I Do things [laughter] and the only other thing that comes to mind that the release bearing is binding on the caller\nThis sounds better it does and always throw word that they call it doesn't it's not and then you get them to the other hand the color\nSo that the that the ... when it heats up long he's not really and it's a handsome amount of your writing the clutch okay which will be the same as the cable right but there are stretching it would be the same okay non cable [laughter]\nBut I think what you need the solution here is to put a new collection and it just put it in a crutch and the new ... okay I mean if you could verify this because when it starts to slip if you could get\nSomeone to look at the released bearing which might be visible well you might be able to just yank up on the pedal and get it to not slip ooh\nLast divisions and the rule they play in American politics this week on hidden brain from NPR tonight at nine and Ninety point nine W.

Talk\nThat eight eight eight double to Seventy eight to fifty five below you're on TALK\nHi this is David in Los Angeles I gave it to proceed expense to forty which I bought new and have looked every what\nDid you answer a puzzle a contest when the question was why would anyone in his right mind by a Mercedes diesel\n[laughter] do you remember that one [laughter]\nI I I Know\nEvery all my friends say this to my wife hates it because it doesn't go fast but I'm like the car [laughter] you know it runs will it gives me a little trouble and it doesn't use much field\n[laughter] anyway David what's not tell us to tell us why you called and\nI travel back and forth from California to the Mexico\nAnd the one doing that I put the car and cruise control set it up to about sixty five miles an hour just leave it there in tech my feet under under the seat ... a lot more comfortable you meditate when you're not just kind of ... you know\nWhat I've noticed I mean I've noticed this effect for years but it never quite figured out what it was until this last trip back from New Mexico noticed is\nThat every once in awhile the throttle rest I take my shoes off and I guess my barefoot on the silver medal in the rest of\nYou Dr naked [laughter]\n\nSounds that sounds pretty good do they serve meals I don't want\n[laughter] to little power I don't run here today [laughter] sorry [laughter]\nEvery once in a while there's a there's a definite sudden change and turn the throttle er they they celebrate a pedal position yeah uh and so I took it into Mercedes service and said listen there's a problem every once in a while this pedal jumps and um would you take a look at it and they want\nWhile you're in cruise control while in cruise control it isn't noticeable on this but there was a change and speeding you can't even feel the the the car change because it happens very quickly but there's\nDefinite move out of the throttle linkage you know so they said oh sure well we'll fix that no problem with seven hundred and fifty dollars will just replace the survival mechanism\nIn the control you know they didn't they didn't ask any questions and they they didn't tell you that you were crazy said you noticed it then that's good enough for us and who knows we never heard of anything is wacko is this replace everything\nWell that's their style you know I liked that approach [laughter] seven hundred and fifty bucks later it still does the same thing or not\nNo I did spend seven and fifty bucks there for three dollars worth of grease on but it still doesn't [laughter] what I what I noticed is this changing the electrical load\nCaused this to happen for example turning on the headlights would cause a momentary deceleration momentary even in the headlights back off again what would you know as a momentary act which\nI mean I was going to ask you if I presume that even though you didn't mention it that it was not related to the level of road was\nNo it wasn't any of these links\nBecause obviously user as you change the world like if you have to climb a hill the pedal has to go down further obviously\nOkay but here's the dogs don't have to turn the lights on and off that often where it's bothersome changing lanes is a problem because that requires operating the turn into care right and when you think that what seems like ... oscillation actually\nThe lab flowed as it flushes on our wars bird it this is great coincident with the slashing of the directional pedal on global boom boom boom when I [laughter] I mean this\nReally bothers you David\nI'd like some insight into how to get around this without spending seven hundred and fifty bucks replace those things which might finally not fiction anyway\nRemember the original question of why would anybody who's right [laughter]\nI don't know what is your rejected permanently I Can't\nWhat are you you're down there on the wall looking at the position of the gas pedal it was in his foot on a show of force would probably not be sensitive ... problem you get your shoes off\nYour well now that I'm aware of the ... I mean I can sense that I could be wearing boots and\nYellow because you've been sensitized open you realized you legal to drive with your shoes off\nYou know something I Do that I keep the shoes of hands so yes if he got pulled over on quickly lately and you could drive without your pants\n[laughter] your shoes [laughter] your name and I don't think we have the answer [laughter] uh I have\nOne theory yeah this is my theory my theory is that the reason that this is all happening is that your all your charging system is putting an unnecessary load an undue load an exceptional load on the engine why wouldn't do that because there's something wrong with the ultimatum\nDo when the when the ultimate is called on to produce more power yeah right okay it puts an a bigger load on the engine because the bearings are\nShowing your brain is shot why why is it got very I don't like\nThis David the regional happened because the thing is controlled electrically in and not my vacuum and the reason is talking troll by vacuum or the diesel don't have enough vacuum generally to run stuff like this right\nAnd and that's probably a flaw in the system and it may be that you could spend seven hundred and fifty bucks for a new survey on a controller and all that and it might do the same thing right you need some kind of circuitry to stabilize the voltage going to this to this a servo yeah that's what you need and that's beyond us\nNo but I'm sure that we will get circuits drawing for us we will every electronics engineer in the country\nAnd we and we held them all to have your phone numbers we get the stuff will find a way you live in the mail it'll all your for your heart out\nI'd appreciate it All right thanks for your call thanks very much tied by by by\nOne eight eight eight Car Talk or one eight to two seven eight to five five below you're on Car Talk\nHi this is Jill from Missoula, Montana\nHi Joan Missoula yeah so Joe what's up well\nFirst of all I didn't know if this was to tasteless a tactic to bring\n... says if you went so and I only thought of you to to ask [laughter]", "show_name": "Best of Car Talk", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "27"}
