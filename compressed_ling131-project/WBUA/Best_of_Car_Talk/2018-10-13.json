hello you're on ...\nHi it's Mike calling from Charlottesville, Virginia what's going on my\nWell I've got a a Nineteen Ninety four Toyota pick up that uh each ... oh really yeah the the ...\nAnd then to squeal for a couple of thousand miles and then eventually it snaps in a car over heats\nUp [laughter] I got to replace senator in repeats the whole thing every couple of thousand miles\nWell we just you know what to expect [laughter] what does that just has a flat belt ready to it's a slap groove belt [noise] your air conditioning\nI Do it sometimes it's ... or more with the air conditioning is on so if I'm if I'm stopped at a stoplight and squealing and people are staring at me I usually first thing I Do is just whip off the air conditioning and sometimes it stops ah but then when I accelerate as I go through gears and accelerate it starts squealing again as well\nEven without the the air conditioner on right yeah yeah because\nWell I'm going to ... or is it something that's more likely to occur in the summer months more was greater frequency in the summer months\nI mean all kinds of might we want we want you to think carefully before you answer how how many belts have you reflect a I'm On my fourth one now okay how many of those happened in the months where are you from Charlottesville Charlottesville, Virginia yeah\nThey're focusing April May June July August September middle the middle of six months of the how many of them have failed during that time\nYou know I think this happened throughout the year\nThat's yeah that's OK yeah we didn't really care what they're after a while [laughter] well\n[laughter] yeah you got to tell them which one it is [laughter]\nI mean here's what I was leaning toward a lead toward it being I mean it's certainly not a defective belt we know that uh the and this is the kind of a system where it is that there's not a belt and\nBy the guy who installed it so one of two things is happening either the belt is getting chewed up by a bad pulley or a bad uh accessory for example if your air conditioner compressor we're going bad\nIt could put so much of an extra load on the belt it makes the belt slipped and once that happens the belt result real quick Neal the possible they could be anything but what what what's your goal for this truck Mike I mean you you see another five years or another eight months\nYeah no another five years I'd like to drive it into the ground I use it for all your stuff and ah you know so I'm not it's a little banged up and I'm not too concerned about it but uh yeah it's you know it's bother someone to go ... yeah well how does the belt is on there no uh about six months when it started to squeal again it\nIs yeah the well tighten it you know what to do that you know\nTake a lesson [laughter] not really ... as the fellow who's been changing them for you to show you how ... and you might have to buy a couple of tools every ... millimeter wrench in twelve millimeter rich will do it and and then you can tighten the belt yourself okay and and maybe you can prolong the okay it's a breakthrough in it but I'm I'm guessing ... the a C\nOkay good luck Wyatt thanks so much you hear about high by taking one eight eight eight carts arc that eight eight eight\nDoubled to slavery do we really help him I don't I mean he's a compressor I think he does too but that would mean you are going to use the air conditioning from now until about ... once\nYou that's why suggest that team that he tighten the belt yeah because we tighten the belt now and it is an already destroyed it will last fall when\nThere were less than all winter exactly and if it does bless them all winter I'm with you a hundred percent on ... so the least little thing goes wrong and then you go to ...

I wasn't the case because you how long was coffee you didn't have coffee for six or seven hours you\nKnow you wouldn't think so [laughter]\nBut number two it more likely is you had a bad connection uh-huh and then the third reason is the most jumper cables are junk [laughter] and and and the gauge of the wire\nIs is so small that in fact there is a high number gauges go in reverse of the of the sickness of the wire that they can't send enough current from the good batteries of the dead battery if you'll wait long enough you don't get it through it'll get through it if you look it up for two minutes and you say oh it didn't start you didn't wait long enough\nHigh jumper cables would start to think immediately okay she jumper cables you got to you've got to go for another couple of coffee [laughter]\nOr you have to go in like an old Volkswagen that you can push it down a hill and then\nYeah like a good old days yeah yeah well I think Martha if you're going to live in Minnesota you ought to get yourself a world class at a jumper cable I think you're gonna need um those winter starts any day now and\nI think tomorrow actually did a lot [laughter] thanks for your time already ...

and asked my wife one question\nWhen she gave me the answer I knew what was wrong with her car ... the question is what was the question now do you think one of those is what was the question\nI I liked that part of it all alone right that's good enough in the case to the statement of the puzzlers more important than anything is is much better than the answer that I think you know the

your sibs registered to different countries yeah like a ship thing oh so you register your car in New Jersey and and in some other state where it's cheaper\n[laughter] I'm just not savvy enough to ah yeah well everyone in New Hampshire [laughter] life outside the wire die [laughter] you know what's going on like\nI have a Nineteen eighty seven Nissan fans and it's got well over a hundred and twenty thousand miles on it and the brightest great except for one went off right and that is when I first start the car up I can barely\nStand for the first about ... minutes that the cars started a it's like the power steering isn't fan I bought off in a couple of things going on in my driveway after about a after about a minute for ah the steering seems to sort of come back and it's a lot more control of I bet you have any idea what that or\nIs it worse when the weather's cold\nAh yeah yeah and you know yesterday I only had a problem in the winter now in the summer when I started up I oh wait all this winter comes yeah a man\nThing a lot of like half an hour before I get\nWell in fact to me it might be cheaper if you if you figure the cost of a new racking pinion which is going to be I don't know many hundreds of dollars five or more money seven yeah it might be cheaper feed it just leave the car running all winter [laughter]\nAll right [laughter] I mean make sense to me it is gas costs\nIt is dangerous though but I think it would be especially dangerous to someone else would driving a car at least you know no that amended before you actually try to steer it\nThat's right but it's a it is bad yeah\nYeah and it's almost it's almost a certainty that it's the racket opinion although I Will confess that I haven't seen any other stanzas with this problem and if it costs it could be the power steering pumps you should have your shop put a gauge them the pump and see if it's putting on enough pressure really if it is you're done for\nYeah it would be nice if it wasn't because that's a heck of a lot cheaper than the rack and saying you\nKnow in our area if the price of power steering pop right\nYeah oh yeah but that won't fix it if that's not the problem right when you look for when they never stopped us [laughter] content\nAnd not one of ... I mean what does that mean what's going on down there\nWell it means that the that the the thing is worn out and that until it heats up and expand that to it can't hold the the the pressure from the pomp I see so that's why you don't get any power steering ...\nAh you know after ... threatening okay is that still dangerous\nNot real it's only dangerous those first few minutes okay because once it warms up it will continue to work as long as it's warm\nBut I suspect when the cold weather comes right that it's not going to be a few minutes this year it maybe a half an hour this year yeah yeah or maybe not at all you might not be able to drive a peering under the gates and we weren't the Gulf yeah\nHere's what I Would do check the pressure on the on the pump and if it's bad you replace the company of troubles are over ... otherwise you might be able to get Iraq at a junk yard but [noise]\nGoing to do it put a rebuilt went in there I don't know many hundreds yeah many hundreds of cars weren't going to cost\nBetween five hundred a thousand it's certainly more than the car's worth but as we've pointed out many times that should never be your criterion because if it were I Would never be able to put gas in my doctor's\nWaiting a long list of Mike\nOkay Ron good luck I\nWon eight eight eight Car Talk all one eight eight to two seven eight to five five below you're on TALK\nHi this is Brenda from Ashland, Oregon Hi Linda Ashland no ... it's L.
