at last the crown prince has big plans for his society yeah\nThat's really the hit with this narrative is the fact that it's constantly on the brink of being that kind of enlightened reformed progressive society you know regardless of which came which monarch happens to be in power at the time they're always just aspiring towards something but just never quite seemed to get there\n[noise]\nMakes it less today mid sixties and cloudy losing the forty\n\n[noise] this is on the media I'm Brooke Gladstone over the past decade Elizabeth Warren has become a progressive ...\nRuns the most powerful like the voice among the progressive right now I looked a little bit more than me and my friends I Love her to be anything I'm going to be a female those Boston\nBut the senator has struggled with the personal issues since she first ran for office in two thousand twelve\nThis war and I want to start with questions about your Native American heritage or even knowledge that you listen to yourself as a minority in a faculty or directory in Nineteen eighty six you continue to lift yourself or in those directory so Nineteen Ninety five\nYou consider yourself a minority and if\nNot I have to answer this question many many times and it starts with the fact that from the day I was born up until the day my mother died she told me about who I Am who we are from my brothers are my family\nJust ticking of a box personal family lore small set of data points and get ones on which warns opponents most notably President Trump pounds and\nShe said because their votes where I was in India that she was Native American in July he escalated I won't give you a million dollars for your favorite charity paid for by trouble if you take the test of the shows you earn it here\nThis week Warren responded by way of a five and a half minutes pre campaign video and she speaks with Carlos Bustamante Stamford genetics professor who examined her DNA\nAnd the hunger genome we did five five segments from Native American ancestry with very high confidence that is what we have a Native American ancestry and you're better\nThe response was probably not what Warren had anticipated\nShe came out and thought she scored at first yes and so to the media and it sort of the men and Donald Trump pay off the million dollar bet and then all of a sudden now she is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that are you sort of DNA test is inappropriate and quote undermining tribal interests\nBoth the right and left appropriate accusations that she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological essential ism\nTrap before the midterms that she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity bond sides\nA political miscalculations but also a stunning into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere is a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee prints vests and their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim tall there is a professor of NATO studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us as a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer is I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual lands and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe know in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA and ever since ... blood is lineage and fate\nHave given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest at the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage\nSo talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk\nPlays out in native culture\nI caution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you weren't looking at the tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum these are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors\nThe dog allotment acts at the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of lands are heads of households and of course only men in settler ideas a family at the time to be has household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in there Ken these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment as governor and what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the bass world you're talking about families that were listed at the end of the Eighteen hundreds\nYeah when you see on the back of my traveling rolling card that I'm One thirty second this one's sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and Rob a whole blood quote unquote\nIs my grandfather Randy tall there it's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examined\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were\nFor us it's who's your mom who's your grandma who's your great grandfather who are your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum\nRules so in my tribe the system ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base wrong but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote ... blood I have shining a rabbit hole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think so my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly thirteenth thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father's non native now if my tribe decides to move to a one eighth total Indian blood rule instead of one\nYou can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down to want it\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards ... fat rules to try to make our roads more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonize we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women and this is something much she got some set in the New York or you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his times you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren ... if I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma in the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this mess of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nBut you're saying it's really relevant even if they did\nRight but but for for non native people who have a subtler colonial idea of kinship ancestry and family finding that genetic proof is important to them\nWhy do you think they do it\nI think they're very much influenced by that one drop rule that is so prominent in racial discourse in the United states\nAlondra thank you very much it's a pleasure to speak with uber Alondra Nelson is president of the social science Research Council professor of

Dr Nancy ... the director of the twin studies center at California State University at full attend the unreal these study would likely inconclusive and definitely cruel\nWell I I think this was a very unethical study keep in mind that even though in those times the practice was that you don't encourage contact\nBut nevertheless these children were never told they were twins and most of these adoptive parents who are hungry for children would have gladly taken too\nSo to not tell people this very important aspect of their background I think is just horrendous it's really beyond my comprehension and I wanted\nBecause being a twin is a very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart\nJust how happy they are to have met and how regretful they are they lost all those years together\nTwin studies often capture the public imagination but none quite like NASA's twin study which tracked the genetic profiles of two astronaut brothers one who spent a year in space wildly swing lived on earth ... had a few things with their Scott\nKelly and Mark Kelly are the only identical twin astronauts in history but following DNA altering space mission they may not be identical anymore or you are in favor of already made got two inches taller than his brother\n... seven percent of Scott's James did not return to normal after he returns on two years ago\nSo they're no longer identical twins that space travel altered genetic expression it did not old enough DNA physically itself\nWhen he returned to earth the vast majority of his genetic material to return to the way it was initially see this is a fascinating finding because white identical twins differ in the expression of some traits that we need to find out I think it'll fascinate your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes you'd expected the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's closer to forty fifty percent\nSomething has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other and identical twins were depart or identical twins who different some white and help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and manage disease\n[noise] you've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life histories of two sets of identical male twins\nWere born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city and the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of those little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital\nSo his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as the other twins were born and somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange with one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later so they were essentially raised as ...\nWere unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other\nI went to a Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys and there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical life histories are amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city who was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary\n[noise] so what does this tell you about nature versus nurture it was too small a sample I Know\nBut yes but it's a very dramatic case and so we're told me a couple of things in terms of the abilities one could certainly see that not having access to education left an indelible stamp on those twins but I Will say that one of the twins who was raised in the small town who should have been raised in Bogota\nWent and got himself a GED a high school diploma and is now finishing law school so we always have the drive he didn't have the opportunity but I have also become very appreciative of extreme environments and how they influence behavior I think that this is a very telling case in so many ways", "show_name": "On the Media", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "20"}
