chart and not worry\nThe very first things that we see that we could call money like really are sets of transactional records that emerge in the ancient Near East in Mesopotamia\nBill ... is a cultural anthropologist and socio legal scholar at the University of California Irvine\nAll of a sudden we have this kind of new thing people a lot of people living in a place altogether needing some kind of system of coordination so that they can all continue to live together in a sort of settled community with a population size it's getting to the point where I Can't keep track of who everyone is anymore\nAnd we start to see centralized systems to help people keep track of what they owe to whom wait what he's\nDescribing ledgers a system of recording obligations and their payment that's not what they taught us in school we all learned that money was simply an advancement on the earlier barter system chicken for grain for X. blades and so on everybody knows that\nIn primitive day's living with simple and each family produced whatever they need it the first kind of business was offered a good stone cutter for instance might make a few extra tools and simply trade them for ... other things he was it was easy there was no need for money\nMore from that delicious Nineteen forty seven educational film we heard earlier\nLife today is too complex people are too dependent upon each other jobs are too highly specialized wants to do business by butter and that's why we depend on money as a quick and easy\nSays now we're no matter what we learned in school the anthropological record offers no evidence of simple barter anywhere in history\nYeah so the barter story is a an origin story for money that you know has a very long history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be\nAnd in the nineteenth century as economics was becoming professionalized economists picked up this murder origin story for money and kind of set it forced into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you attack a plated string decorated with calories and other precious objects which was used by the Danny people in New guinea to determine and to pay for the exact price of a pig\nThat's barter but but what you're really seeing as part of a much more complex series of relationships that people are engaged in that generally you have to do with\nSome pretty serious social concerns concerns over birth over marriage over death over the continuation of lineage or a tribe where the pig in this case isn't just any old pig being exchanged and I always think of you know Charlotte's Web in this context\nSome\n\nSome pig it's some tickets a special pick that indicates a relationship between families it's not just a commodity that's value can be set by the price mechanism the way that the barter story assumed\nSo how did this border mythology or become some nearly universal why is this news to me\nVery often origin stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today and that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThan something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of wants which is what economists call that problem when you know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your Apple's\nSo it's great to justify current conditions but when you start kind of\nCracking it open and starts at appealing back the layers and realizing that that's not really how it happened in that\nHow it happened was you know actually a lot more interesting and a lot more complicated and involved things like record keeping accounting systems of measure uh states and early state control and shaping of markets and so forth well then you're in a whole other realm\nThe real story is told in Mesopotamia tablets and other artifacts record keeping dating from the rise of agriculture and settled communities in the ancient Near East phenomena that demanded the invention of book keeping\nWe're dealing now with people who aren't just hunting and gathering but are growing rain\nAnd are taking care of animals like sheep and goats these commodities have seasonal cycles right I plant the grain and it takes a while to turn into stuff that I can read and turned into you know do and bread and sheep and goats only have during certain parts of the year\nYou know if I'm planting grain and I'm going to give some to you after a period of time and you're raising goats and you're going to give some to me after a period of time we both have the built in season ... of those plants and animals to deal with\nAnd what we start to see in those situations is the emergence of central authorities\nCentral clearing houses which had some properties of temples observe spiritual authority and some of thanks\nSo this is going to kind of over simplify it but we basically right little contracts to each other that say things like okay look you're giving me this go today thank you after a certain period of time after six months I Will\nRepay that debt that I now over\nWith certain number of bushels of [noise] okay that is it from the fertile crescent three millennia ago it's from a different tack\nTo Chicago Board of trade soybean trading floor from two thousand and six [noise] would you get the idea and in both cases every promise was recorded\nWe have described in these temples keep track of these contracts and that's where we start to see something like money\nIt's kind of a time deferred contract for the settlement of adapt recorded on that clay I liked to joke that you know in the beginning was not the coin in the beginning was the receipt and that's essentially what you've got in those clay tablets\nAnd others slightly less portable media\nAs the New York times retro report did to the tiny must British an island of ... yeah loads of money the size of semi trucks\nThey're actually an ancient form of current [noise] who's value resides partly in scarcity the stones had to be imported in canoes from neighboring islands partly in the effort invested to quarry and mail them but mainly in the communal memory of who owns them and the consensus of their worth\nMIT nay hung the ruler from her Ted Talk\nNow they don't actually movies\nRice towns around her exchange that rice things can get pretty pretty massive the largest is about four times and twelve feet across\nYou can't feed the meter with them or melt them down or wire them abroad you can only remember with them\nSo they just kinda keep track of who owns what part of what stone\nConley hold that thought to now in time the recording of obligations did give way to the shorthand coin and currency and further to banking transactions and credit instruments and so on to the ... as we shall soon discuss of digital currency\nDusted money emerge not from the barter system but from the need to keep track of an unwieldy number of transactions suddenly\nIt seems so hobbyists [noise]\nMoney is demonic defines a proxy for history a memories there\nOr not remember this was an endless perplexed we're talking about it and if money is merely a record of obligations why does its value fluctuate sometimes even jai rate based on factors that have zero to do with who knows what to whom\nWe all understand that inflation steadily erodes the face value of a dollar a car that costs seven thousand dollars in Nineteen Seventy cost thirty thousand dollars today and all that but what else is at play in determining the value of a dollar\nFor that\nFirst lady there are two kinds of money you know base money meaning all the world's currencies in circulation and the cash reserves and the global banking system and credit money which is all the money promised to be paid eventually\nMonday it has a cast of millions banks credit card companies marketers and taxing authorities police even private eyes\nWe uncover the data you need the truth without wasting time and money just the more people are up to contact us today know the truth tomorrow\nAs we've just seen the economy is the ultimate exercise in collaboration collaborators you don't necessarily choose such as Mother Nature Enron traders and governments can impoverished you with the stroke of a man who was involved with the dollar is virtually worthless and because of the nation has skyrocketed

in [noise] and then\nThere are the rest of us ... all of us and constant peril of being drawn reluctantly into the story we're promise privacy and many aspects of our lives but in our financial transactions as in an anxiety dream we can find ourselves standing naked before the around\nThe state of Massachusetts is doing and if I'm a recent cyber attack and the credit reporting agency ... personal information one hundred and forty three million people only there were\nCurrency was private secure stable convenient and not subject to the political or predatory manipulation of outsiders\n[noise] as coin virtual currency that doesn't abide by rules are the Bangor never met\nIn the\nSouth [noise] I'd rather than later\nBitcoin is the first of now a multitude of so called crypto currency is built not on gold reserves or limestone emphasis put on software code\nThe infrastructure is called the block train a digital version of an old fashioned ledger book\nJust as those listed entry upon entry sequence really numbered in indelible ink the block Shane is an unreasonable ledger of every private transaction but instead of being held by some governing central authority it is distributed peer to peer when countless computers across the world\nSo people know bitcoin as a digital currency but it's really more like a digital yeah peace stone representing the communities collective memory\nAnd in another throw back the currency bitcoins case\nConsist of a finite number of virtual tokens digitally mind by e prospectors thousands of computers churning in such places as Iceland and China solving puzzles for which successful miners are rewarded with small purses up digital coins\nEvery ten minutes the give somebody twenty five bitcoin\nCurrency pioneer have been a

the ones who was the fastest computer ... book gets the twenty five ... on the job\nOver time Twenty one million bitcoins will be mind and no more New York times financial reporter Nathaniel popper author of digital gold bitcoin in the Inside Story of the misfits and millionaire's trying to reinvent money\nSays it's part of a utopian vision to protect the value of the money from incompetent corrupt or simply desperate governments\nThis idea really harkens back to the idea of the gold standard which took a lot of power away from governments to issue as much currency as they want it back coin provided this alternative of an asset that you could hold digitally without having to have it under your mattress\nAnd that at least seemed to hold the promise that it would keep its value better than the peso or whatever local currency or was that was doing to bring in a way\nIt's an ingenious way to limit the money supply but only one approach to digital money\nAt the moment there were well over two thousand crypto currencies from number two a theory on the two Goldblum zipper and hello tinker bell picks the coin each representing a different user need or economic ideology\nBitcoin constitutes about half the world's crypto value but there were more than ... eighty billion dollars worth of rival denominations Fifteen of which are worth at least a billion dollars Nate Honda Roula\nSo holders of bitcoin often feel like they're buying into this vision of money that is controlled by government they can't be inflated away where no one can stop you for making payments and no one can take your wealth away from you there's ... currency for pretty much any field or topic you could think of theirs tend to coin\nA cut your currency for granted there's Jesus Klein there's an art project that came from someone who is a former student at MIT ... which is about sort of cleaning your sentence you purchase of currency in order to absolve yourself with your sentence basically we're seeing all these different ways for people to buy into the future that they believe in\nBy becoming a holder of the coin\nEvery one of these terms uses differentiated bites philosophy of money\nMaterial has been a group to who previously coordinated the launch of a theory and\nIt takes a philosophy of money to implement is code and then they ship it to the world and if you like it they buy it and if they don't ignore\nSo which belief system choice is correct I don't know which religion is correct yes the technology is mind boggling across the board but once again like Mesopotamia and temples or tinker bell\nIt comes down to face or even ... like the one that split the Catholic an orthodox churches in the world a bitcoin they're called forks like when one part of
