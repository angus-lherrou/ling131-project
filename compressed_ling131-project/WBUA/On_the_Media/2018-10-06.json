that writer lily Luther\nLast November she explained several of the logical fallacies used by the culture to excuse or ignore bad behavior we\nCalled on her again to identify the new fallacies she's seen lately like the anti bandwagon fallacy\nTo anti bandwagon fallacy it's something that kind of made up to explain a tendency that I've noticed where a news items trees content actually diminishes for people as more accusations emerge we saw for instance with Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nI've never seen so many were pressed memory safest and my\nYeah so the question is if there was something ... going on was or hypnosis a conspiracy\nYeah when more emerged a lot of people I think on the right interpreted that to be a bandwagon that invalidated the initial accusation something else that I

excelled at finding a way to screen every accusation against him into an occasion for his victimization and by extension the victimization of those who associate themselves with him\nWe certainly see Brett Kavanaugh doing something similar we find male anger I think very disorienting because men are told to repress and so when we see somebody in a very high stakes situation and loading powerfully that tends to us just scan as an index of authenticity\nIn front of the nation we saw his righteous indignation to joke about\nHis tears and if you're not a doctor for rather of this on for confirmation process which frankly is an embarrassed\nAnd I saw in the aftermath of the hearing a surprising number of pundits describing both his testimony in her as as equally credible which I found

differently\nSome people thought if they did the dancers and the right way and for the red shirts and did all the right things that they would be among the chosen and the saved and everyone else would be wiped away in a in a massive flood or some kind of catastrophe meaning all the white\nPeople meaning the white people and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes dance was a religion that was growing around the Pine Ridge agency and there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the native folk at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seventh cavalry stopped spotted outspent suit as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them\nThe next day they moved to disarm them\nIt's not really known what caused the shooting in the first place but almost immediately the government open fire with ... cannons on largely an armed men women and children [noise]\nThe descriptions of the massacre are horrifying you quoted a reporter from the Deadwood South Dakota times who wrote why should we stay or even a semblance of an Indian\nAnd then you have an

up with one more wrong and wipe these on hand and I came up all creatures from the face of the earth\nBy virtue of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceeding four hundred years of interactions between calling us an indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything had come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the massacre they learn from that\nHBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yeah deep rounds Nineteen Seventy classic very my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre when Disney where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty in the hopelessness and the squalor I felt by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced in done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee Dudley dismaying you put it is because your reservation the leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas went to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal sufferers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just\nDifferent facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the point of despair I thought that deep brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate missed the point\nWhen did me was a low point we had withstood constant assaults and our sovereignty or cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realized and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you have to write it and that's exactly what I tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns book came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared at Indian lands and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and having this this land nearby off of the following three real purchase a health rather island for twenty four dollars in glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar out and about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of do from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for defense for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\nThis is we got down there the whole the whole court was covered with the FBI agents arrived they all had rifles and shotguns and and it's and they search\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nIn Seventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a power than to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock\nMy own personal view is that the takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which ensued was in many ways skewed by the kinds of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who was one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWasn't really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\n[laughter] yes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey want to the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing timber in mineral leases among other things the government still hadn't talked to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nThese sort of dark agents of government like Frank ... one of Nixon's guys aback man even then agreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took\nNone of at sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to joined that care of and\n[noise] and then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indians suffering and injustice that's right\nIn Seventy three there was the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the time that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise] I don't want to see him that he killed the\nTimes come violence who might have to be committed [noise]\nThere'd been a number of very high profile murder of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around Pine Ridge and in other places in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm\nAnd people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who\nWere murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nMisdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd so for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded knee was under siege\nWon't call them [noise] [noise] are\nYou say you have very complicated feelings about it\nI did aim activists showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people the troubled government of Pine Ridge was very against the stick Wilson the German of Pine Ridge was interested in mostly in staying in power\nAnd he was working closely with the federal and state government to sort of bringing more and more law enforcement so there's again another military buildup everything kind of boiled over and aim activists took over there weren't any trading posts and subsequently took over the entire village of wounded knee at first holding village residents some of whom we are not native hostage\nPlenty of injustice but plenty of passion inability to to write those wrongs plenty of poverty but also plenty of creativity and hustle in order to sort of overcome it plenty of crime but also plenty of laws plenty of of exclusions and traumas\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability an intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so\nIn my mind it's the story of surplus [noise] that's the story I Want to tell David thank you so much thank you so much I'm really peeking out to be on the show\nDavid Dreier is a chip away from the leech lake reservation in Minnesota he's a professor of literature at
