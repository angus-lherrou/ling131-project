the person who oversees the government of Massachusetts\nIncoming governor Charlie Baker met his challenger Jay Gonzales for a first debate this week a channel for were bigger push back against the charge and he's a status quo leader\nIf I was the status quo governor that still be thousands of homeless families living in hotels in motels in Massachusetts there aren't if I was a status quo governor we wouldn't have a huge offshore wind and hydro program going on to replace a third of our fossil fuels with clean renewable energy\nAnd Gonzales kept repeating his response that's just not enough it's not\nNearly enough that's not an ambitious agenda there's so much more we need to do to make a difference for working families in the state and our transportation system is the thing I hear the most about everywhere I go I Will provide the bold leadership we need to fix it\nJoining us this week to talk about the contest and lots of other things Massachusetts is share center political editor at the Boston Globe and someone who has in the past saved me from making embarrassing errors in my own\nI don't think so much for having me on the show it's great to see where it's great to be sitting here with you\nAlso with us is Michael Jordan is executive editor of commonwealth magazine Michael great have you too good to be here hope you don't feel outnumbered by the globe ease at the table no no I'm\nSorry to be here on every one okay so the short version is at least of the debate Baker presents himself as ineffective administrator someone who's improve the tea improved programs for the homeless how's land taxes 'cause all his push for big programs big spending and attacked the governor for thinking\nYou take away from the debate well the takeaway for me and you know the ten other people who watched it during the red Sox game\nUm I thought it was a really civil and engaging debate is actually a nice reminder of what may be democracy should look like\nOften when incumbents are twenty points ahead maybe more in the polls are lonely debate there and put it in one sense\nI'm certainly not saying that's a good thing that's a strategy some incumbents uh employee and in this case Charlie Baker I signed up for three debates and the debate he the most recent one with him and Jake on zealous was a nice to just course it was like oh oh nice to meet with politics is sort of supposed to be like a normal normal times\nIf only the Sox weren't playing and people knew about that Michael ... yeah I mean I agree I thought uh I mean one of the interesting wrinkles child on CSPAN and I was thinking uh you know not to be all sort of\nA Pollyanna for gossiping about Massachusetts but I thought it really showed as you're saying it it it showed the state well to the country in the sense that it was very substantive I mean I think\nIf there's been talk obviously about this eleven billion dollar seawall in the harbor\nA and eventually they decided that was not an on that they've come to terms that it's probably not the best idea that they want to look at these sort of smaller projects\nBut we're going to feel it sooner rather than later and in many ways this could be one part of Marty Walsh his legacy as mayor of Boston the next couple of years right is how he sets up the city during this pivotal time to be resilient against the forces of climate change and most notably flooding last January that's a preview member of the storms in the flooding in the harbor\nThat the previous things to come it's quite it's\nScary you know uh I'm not on the environment Baker said last night that he's failed to meet his own pledge of one percent spending on environmental issues he says only been about half a percent of total but you're spending um hype but\nLBJ eyes from delivering on my problem is I'm the only caviar cut out for a moment we're going to go there apologize for not delivering on my commitments um I don't like the delivery of commitment to make\nThat was at the museum of science forum last night where he just acknowledge she hasn't delivered on the commitment you sorry about that kind of solace has made a similar pledge\nBy knocks later than the end of my first term we we'll dedicate one percent of the state budget to environmental agencies and we will make meaningful progress each year until we get there that is a commitment of mind you can count on\nSo I guess I'm circling back to the governor's race here but that's what we don't mind is this something that is at stake in the governor's race Massachusetts is preparation for climate change Syria\nI think it's an issue that ah Democrats and liberal ... like to talk about I think you are in Massachusetts compared to a whole lot of other states you find a lot of environmentally focus to voters\nUm is the question or will it may will it be the decision maker for uh the fifty five percent or so of independent voters out there\nUh I I don't know I don't necessarily see that in these times but it's still a major thing it's going to just continue to be I think a growing issue\n... how's this for a segue from grade me\nFrom the destruction of the planet to the destruction of state records oh that's very good All right let's talk about ongoing scandals at the Massachusetts state police twenty Eighteen has been a year of state police scandals from fake overtime claims to charges of political favoritism\nTwo former state police commanders were in court today denying the charges of overtime abuse yesterday and other trooper pleaded guilty to embezzlement in federal court\nAnd W. R. broke the story this week that the agency sought permission to destroy documents some dating back decades that could be essential to future investigations\nMichael what did what'd you make of the most recent twist in this story ah I mean when I made of it was that was a horrible\nLook for the state police and and I mean there's just no other way to look at it uh [noise]\nYou know there was I guess technically that request to destroy records\nYou know complied with the you know the all all the regulations Ron How old they have to be and so forth but I mean you'd have to be crazy to to to not realize there is a broader context at the moment with with these investigations and\nUh you know the governor came out and said this shouldn't be done there shouldn't be seeking these but I think there's still a lot of question about you know they were three different request submitted by three different people I mean what prompted those request was there any one higher up\nIn you know on the food chain that had to approve them or that may be initiated\nThe the the request and is is there any accountability now for for how that happened I mean we need to kind of a the construction of of how this came about it's not enough that we just know that this records board denied the request inside of the ongoing investigations I think there is still the you know ... it doesn't smell good\nWell you mentioned the governor's comments on let's listen to that what they did was completely\nConsistent with standard operating procedure they shouldn't be destroyed payroll records they shouldn't be operating under standard operating procedure at this point in time given everything else is going on with respect for those who is a fair\nAnd since I Can't get away from the governor's race let's also listen to Jake and also the response which was sharper\nThe colonel should be fired the secretary of public safety should be fired the governors should appoint someone to lead the his state bully who's going to root out corruption someone from the outside who's got credit\nIs this the governor's fault or should we think more broadly about what's going on behind this lack of oversight cultural problems at state police how do you see responsibility\nI think in terms of voters if there's one major issue where the candidates are split on in terms of recent news it's this one right\nBecause Charlie Baker has clearly stood by colonel carry Gilpin throughout this chickens also said she and many others need to go right this is certainly a difference there is a very concrete distinction absolutely between the two candidates and I think it's an issue and an opportunity for ... to get a lot of traction a\nCharlie Baker has decided and several of his response is about the ongoing in this incident that I it's happened prior to his time it was established before his time and our editorial board notice a new to this morning that that's they don't think that's good enough anymore or he's been in office for three and a half years\nHere we have a quote actually I have in front of me from the globe editorial makers of off now which means the buck stops with him under this governor the state police clearly thought they could get away with blatantly inappropriate behavior how extremely disappointed you go on I just\nKnow I I I mean that's obviously or editorial board which is separate from our news department but I Believe that Governor certainly has uh an issue with but this year and it's a political issue as much as it is it a state issue\nMichael you have a sense from where this should start if the problem is going to get fixed ah\nI mean you know I it's hard to know whether ... you know in Gonzales says you know the three of\nYou know since Rob from down even though she's newly appointed\nHe thinks there needs to be a change in leadership and someone brought in from the outside so I'm not sure about that I mean the other thing that I Would just note is that uh you know when there are problems that come up anywhere in government that's that's that's not good but there is a particularly corrosive effect of corruption within law enforcement and that's something that\nUh you know I think you can't emphasize enough there's been a lot of talk about corrosive in what way\nI mean just in terms of a of a public confidence in government I mean these are the people who who you know enforce norms of behavior on all of us and yet if this is what's going on\nWithin the department I mean it's just undermines I I Want to sound too dramatic it undermines the whole premise of the rule of law but at some at some point it does\nI agree these are the people who give you speeding tickets right these are the people who are a lot of citizens have the most interaction with writer hopefully not have the most interaction with I should say but it is one\nAspect where you touch upon government in your daily life they're following you on the highway for speeding things like that right you\nSee cops intersections you see it all so I think it really has a pervasive effect in the way other\nIssues don't and do you think it is improving you think the charges brought are making a difference or do you think no in fact we're just at the beginning of fixings Michael\nI mean I don't know I don't know how much more there is to be a to be discovered I mean it it's you know I mean I think we're in that phase where it doesn't look good but it's kind of the the cleansing process that you have to go through to get to a a better place on the other end of it also you know hopefully you know things are are getting better\nBy by the sort of sunlight being a\nYou know flashing on on what's going on there and and the kind of cases and investigations running their course\nAll right well maybe let's end with some later news than the corruption that corrosive Lee undermines faith in government um how about everybody loves the hubbub the brief stories are events that didn't get a lot of general attention to what caught your attention this week Sheera what jumped out at you\nWell that's got some attention but I thought it was such a such a fun idea that I wanted to bring it up a British developer scape has plans to build a hunt a one billion dollars in privately run dorms five buildings up to three thousand beds for\nEssentially college students and they wouldn't be exclusive to a single school they'd be these towers where a student's mostly upper class and they say gravitate towards these would be housed in one building\nIt sounded like a fun community ah ah that they could um that could be here in the city and uh alleviate not only problems for college students who I tend to who unfortunately because of budget constraints end up living in conditions that are not always a up to par\nAnd also for the city which is having a housing crunch right it opens up a lot of\nLot it opens has the potential to open up some housing for ah for the workforce instead of the student force I my my thought is a story noted that this company looked for Eighteen months for a spot in America to open up there for a storm and like it took you Eighteen months defined Boston what we're here to many college students\nNo but they're not the only one struggling to get permission to build buildings in Maryland system Michael you're hubbub\nSo mine is something that has actually been building for a while but actually will will kind of come with a bang tomorrow so we had a little bit of mad as\nTomorrow a artist for humanity which is a small was founded as a small nonprofit back in Nineteen Ninety One will celebrate the opening of a new addition to it's at the center which has its main building in South Boston\nHundred the number of Boston teams that it serves\nThrough what is a really cool model of paid mentoring a of young people in art and design field um and so uh it's an amazing program it's great that they're they're going to be able to search so many more kids are as their name says arts artist remained anymore are more humanity or you know what could be what could be wrong with ...\nWhat we had to do was first ah build the technology so that the robots can recognize landmarks so as the robots moving around and say okay I knew what that is what that is\nA okay corner of a chair I Know what that is okay I Know where I Am and then a bill from landmarks and the ability to figure out sort of X Y Z on a map where you are I'm a move around and create\nA map of where the spaces and then from the map of the space okay how do I divided up that space into rooms and then the next time I turn on to go do the job of keeping track of where on that map I Am so I Know which room I'm In at any\nTime ... concept a kitchen is you might know where it's kitchen is but it could eventually be extrapolated to understand what if you take it into a different home oh this is the kitchen because there's a stove and the fridge and that sort of thing\nI mean I think that's where things will go down the run down the road right now um but we do is we show you your floor plan we guess where it's likely rooms are\nAnd then you can go at it that map little push a wall here or a divider here and and then named the rooms because ah kitchens might be recognizable but if you call the play room the den uh it's gonna be a long time before we had a I can\nFigure that out say Critz mind if I Do you mind if I couldn't ask questions I had him\nEconomy so it isn't it it seems to me like the futuristic stuff on offer isn't isn't always the stuff people most want or need like like moving furniture around that sounds that sounds very cool\nBut but what I'm looking for is a robot that will fold my laundry and and do dishes I mean like ... ... was a major innovation like you haven't been major innovations in ending drudgery and I wonder if we're close to another of those\nRight so you know the the industry is progressing are and we started off with things that we thought we could do at a price point that was lower than the value that the service was ... and that's a good business you can sell\nYou know we sold over twenty million robots and\nLast year the Roomba vacuum and it was actually the number one selling vacuum cleaner in the United states which is like we got one are\nNow you asked about folding laundry or things that are required arms and this idea that understanding the home is critical for the advancement of robotics uh I think that that's a great example because what's the point of having arms\nOn a robot if you don't know where anything is so that you know the all important go to the kitchen and get me a beer\nIs irrelevant or an impossible request if I don't know where the kitchen is and don't know where the refrigerator is but\nA an so that this idea of ... technology has gotten to the point where we can understand where room is so that's like a big deal that's like the beginning of understanding\nEnough about the home to go\nUnderstand local\nLaw so I like the idea of the the importance of understanding is building ON Technology it it does make me wonder how much we have to give up about ourselves and our privacy to make it work that is how much do the robots really have to know about our homes and our lives before they can be useful and and are you concerned that we're giving up so much about our private space is\n... [noise] you know I think that if you want the robot to clean the kitchen it needs to know what the kitchen is to some ... meaning the bounds and so for this need a picture of the kitchen it doesn't\nNeed a ton of detail\nWe can do that and again this is something that says the consumer if you want this I think you need to know two things I'm One what am I going to get for it okay robot is going to be able to clean the kitchen when without giving this information it can\nAnd second is the company that you're giving that information to going to treat that information or in a respectful way using best practice to try to ensure that that information is is\nIs held a secure and so you know I robot is investing\nA continuously aggressively and\nAnd we tell you what you're going to get for sharing the data and if you don't want to do that\nWell then the ... when you get to know just the whole house and maybe that's okay but this partnership between benefit\nConfidence or is a trade off we have to continue looking\nThat's called angle cofounder and CEO of I robot gone through so much for being here my pleasure back to you in the\nStudio haven't thanks so much Chris

to radio Boston I'm Evan Horowitz the very young very energetic mayor Fall River is now very much under indictment\nIt's not exactly a tale of political corruption because it's not about mayor ... time in office instead it's about a company he used to run where he allegedly took hundreds of thousands of dollars from investors to finance his own quote lavish lifestyle and quote here's Hank shah the FBI special agent in charge\nMere Korea has brought a undeserved shame and embarrassment upon the city of Fall River you betray that trust to investors in the end of betray that trust and his constituents\nFor now Korea remains defiant he's back at work today having pled not guilty on all charges\nI've done nothing wrong if you look at my track record as mayor all you see as positive results\nHere for a a with us for reaction in Fall River is will Richmond he's the city editor at the Herald news I well I I mean how are you\nI'm All right you're at the epicenter of this I mean people around the state or just kind of waking up to the story but you guys have had an inkling that something was up for some time yes\nYes we've been following this uh this issue for quite a while now since shortly after the mayor initially took office three years ago\nOr so it's something that uh you know we we've been looking for this data com and ah you know certainly been waiting to see if this indictment would eventually come down which certainly happened yesterday\nSo crazy charged with fraud and filing false tax returns and it it has to do with a company of his called snow al you tell us what what's in a while is and what the scheme was all about\nSure the snow was an ap being developed by ... by ... it\nWas the intent of it was to match businesses to people as they came into an area so essentially if you've visited new new city you could plug this happened and connect with restaurants or other businesses ah\nThat would be nearby to you\nAnd what what was he doing that drew the attention of a law enforcement\nIf there were a number of investors like seven in total who at um put a over three hundred thousand dollars into the company but it turned out to as they're alleging the mayor had used me\nMost of that money about sixty four percent to find what they termed his lavish lifestyle are spending this money on a Mercedes Benz a luxury hotels\nAirfare travel and even adult entertainment um\nYou know during this time you're told his investors he did not intend to take a salary at during the development of the uh um but in the end none of the investors or any return on their investment and it seems the mayor was using that money to further his personal life style and even his political campaign\nDid that stand out I mean the Mercedes the lavish lifestyle in fall Fall River right Fall River the city the poverty rate is over twenty percent of the household income is about half the state wide average did the mayor's yeah did did people recognize that there was something out of character about the mayor's lifestyle", "show_name": "Radio Boston", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "13"}
