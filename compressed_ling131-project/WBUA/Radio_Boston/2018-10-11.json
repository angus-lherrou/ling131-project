W. J. F. dot O. R. G. O.\nWay\n\nThis is radio bombed and I'm Evan Horowitz and once again public attention turns to the trials of the state police\nFor the better part of a year now the organization has been beset by turmoil payroll scandals fake overtime claims charges of corruption\nAnd now reporting from W. B. U. R. has revealed that the agency sought permission to destroy documents some dating back decades that could be essential to future investigations joining me now is Wu our digital producer ... producer Alex ... ... it's a pleasure to cross from you thanks\nSo tell me story what was in these records that the state police wanted to destroy\nShirt so the first class with me back in March of this year by the state police and they wanted to get strike time and attendance records for twenty ... twenty eleven plus billing records bank records in twelve years worth of accounting records\nSo it's a lot of stuff that might sounds like a lot of it might be of interest to any investigator auditors looking into the state police practices which is happening right now and so that was the first request and then a month later in April\nThe please also petition to throw recruitment in hiring records personnel and payroll records in calendar spending Twenty years and then there was a third similar request in September\nSo the police and other agencies are allowed to destroy records like this it seems\nThat they are in the state has this several hundred page document it's very wonky it's called the records retention schedule and it says how long all sorts of different government records needs to be kept so in some cases it's just a year like say for something like a meeting notice or job applications but in other ...\nKept forever so yeah the the please could legally ask for these records to be thrown out\nBut I never tried yes but something gotten the way what stopped the process\nYeah so there's a slice of government that I had never heard of it the records conservation board made up of appointees from various state agencies in chaired by a lawyer from the attorney general's office\nAnd the board told the state police no you cannot destroy these records the the police were under ... are under investigation and they table any decision pending the ongoing audit\nAnd were they happy about it I mean what was the state police said well first of all of us anything about why the made these requests during a time when they're under investigation yeah so the spokesman\nFor the state police said that they were just following the rules they were allowed to ask for these documents to be destroyed and he said none of these documents were actually the subject of any outside investigation or audit but at the same time they're going to keep past he won't records until further notice\nAnd he doesn't mean that in a vague way when he says they know me I Know them he was a bench manager with the Astros last year does that give them an advantage you know so the worst or does it give the asteroid inventions they know what's going on in his head\nA it's an interesting question and we'll kind of have to see how it plays out I don't know I I think ... has shown that as a manager he's willing to do whatever it takes to win regardless of what it might mean for the future see decreased Elmo from last night it's interesting you bring sailing in the eighth inning\nUh last year the Astros manager AJ Hinch actually get almost the same exact thing would their ... just in Berlin and core criticize it at the time he said what are you doing if we lose this game we don't have them for game five\nSeems to have reversed is thinking about that maybe being in the hot seat made a difference when I saw that it worked\nYeah I'm a fair enough in it's a risk reward thing I think [laughter]\nSo this game against the ashes of the series against the ashes rematch chance vindication last year in the division series\nThe ashes beat the socks and then went on to win at all so let's do like a pre post mortem here like let's say we're talking in ten days or something and the Sox have lost why do you think they will have lost that if things go wrong what do you expect it is that we'll go wrong\nPitching a hundred percent pitching uh you've got ... who looked pretty good in game one he'll go but after that\nWhere do you go ... it is and then also the bullpen has a problem so I think it's pitching up and down the roster will will have to speak and how they match up against ... and that's just pitching is phenomenal yes I mean the Astros are a great team I they are peaking at the right time I Am very words for the red Sox in a series I I think if I were a betting man I I Would have to pick the Astros and I hope I'm wrong I Hope I'm wrong\nI think for the folks in Vegas agree with you write the lines favors the Astros at the moment I mean ... so let's see what the other way tennis and I were talking and the red Sox have pulled it out what went right what did you write how they ...\nI think the key is going to be offensive they're able to score and potentially score first in a lot of these games I think that will really make the difference or according to ESPN playoff teams who are scored first are fourteen into this year in the play offs it's always great to get those runs on the board early also look forward to Saturday seeds they can put up some runs early Saturday and Sunday is going to be an interesting weekend\nThat's

radio Boston I'm Evan Horowitz ready to delve deeper into the combustible trial that starts next week the one that charges Harvard University with discriminating against Asian American applicants\nYou have people that are being admitted because of the color of their skin as such a significant factor better overwhelms the other considerations are this is just a show at any given level qualification it's much harder to get in if your Asian American applicants that white van with you know that that black\nThat's Ilya Shapiro the kill Institute we spoke to him yesterday he's backing students for fair admissions there the anti affirmative action group behind the lawsuit but Harvard vigorously denies these claims insisting that apple\nNot the admissions process use are consistent with their well established legal right to admit a diverse student body so today we get some more insight into that argument from Nicole oh gee supervising attorney for Asian Americans advancing justice Los Angeles where a\nNonprofit we believed and civil rights organization representing a group of Harvard students who decided to back their school and defend affirmative action she joins us from not surprisingly Los Angeles political\nHigh who just heard some was the first but from what your Shapiro was arguing yesterday that admitting people because of their skin color is harming Asian Americans did did you have a response\n[noise] yes I think that that statement is completely factually inaccurate [noise] for several reasons [laughter] I'm not giving the return\nOkay so I'm so first of all\nThere is no evidence\nThat anyone is getting in only because of their race in fact the evidence and the Harvard case shows that race has less of an impact\nOn admissions decisions than class than geographical location and majors et cetera and also number two\nThere is a conflation of two issues that are happening in this case and I believe in the media as well which are reflected\nIn your other guest's comments now there is a difference between discrimination against Asian Americans visa V. white applicants and whether an affirmative action or race conscious admissions policy is unduly burdening\nAsian Americans and it's really important to take apart those two things because getting rid of race as a positive consideration in the admissions process will do nothing to address whether or not Asian Americans are discriminated against in favor of what\nIs interesting because I mean the arguments are making it seems to be just an argument about fairness on some level in Asian American applicants to Harvard have the highest academic credentials on average but the lowest overall acceptance rate how was that not a burden on Asian American applicants\n[noise] still there a couple of reasons why that question I guess that isn't that question it there are some this understandings about the admissions process\nSo I think first and foremost it's important to understand that traditional academic um indicators of qualifications like SAT scores and grade\nDo not matter that much an elite school admission\nInto so many of the people who apply have extremely high traditional academic credentials\n[noise] that's right you know they couldn't even admit as many people\nUm as apply who have perfect SAT scores and GPA's right and so of course it's going to depend on other factors I think another\nThing that needs to be another myth I guess it needs to be dispelled about the admissions process is that these traditional academic indicators actually tell us\nAnything really about and applicants potential for success as a student and as a person later in life now doesn't give some baseline understanding of um qualifications yes but\nIt tells very little beyond that\nThere's for example a student that gets a Thirteen hundred on the SAT and a student gets a fourteen hundred on the SAC SAT all that really tells us is both of those students even though one got a hundred points higher [noise]\nUm [noise] are likely to get somewhere between an a minus and a C plus average GPA as a freshman at all that's all it ever tells us that doesn't tell us anything about graduation rates about later success and in fact it tells us a lot more about a person's race or class than anything else\nSo I mean do you acknowledge vote that I mean Harvard's own history shows that race can be used as a factor in a discriminatory way in the twenties as a response to an increasing number of Jews students being accepted the school instituted a character based component to admissions\nAnd that essentially allowed the school to discriminate against Jewish applicants with a defect do quota is is this just in that such a thing is impossible or just that it isn't what's happening now\n[noise] no definitely I don't think it's impossible that Harvard I'm discriminated against Jewish applicants and the path nor that Asian Americans experienced discrimination in many aspects of life today what I Do dispute is that\nIntentional use of race to ameliorate ... past and current discrimination to make its campuses more diverse and inclusive and to provide opportunities to identify the most promising candidates that may be obscured\nOn north pleasant street is goes shed by artist Tom Friedman number seven on an audio tour you can use\nThe idea for this piece of ...

I use is called for Muriel route Kaiser where she says essentially the universe is not made of Adam's it's made up stories right and so we often look at a descent and difference as a matter of clash of civilizations flashing values storyteller\nSo I look at them as a as a clash of stories and so one of the things I'm looking at is the story of the African American experience here in the United states and the ways in which it has been distorted\nAnd and twist it and the ways in which we can combat that\nAnd the the lying framework it's important to you because of the probably the way your father taught about lying and the way that resonated with your experience of this twisted nature of\nYeah yeah I talk about that in the book I imagine started go from the personal to two largest stories but in our house so my father sort of police vocabulary there were certain words\nActually there was a pretty long list of words that we weren't allowed to say or to say to each other I'm One of a six children and one thing we could do is call each other liars my father's reaction to that where it was was uh something to watch it really upset him the idea that we could accuse each other\nOr something is treacherous is false it's\n[laughter] and now everyone is accusing everyone every other person a false of all the time um there's a lot also in the story so between the person on the national debt is local ended up Boston's legacy of racism like to tell us for instance about the slave wall you stumbled across and oh ...\nOh yeah I'm In for it it uh when I was just going by and a car and it said slave law but we'll just said later and we know who built the wall we know his name his name is pump a we know when he built it up so I thought wouldn't it be just so much more simpler and clearer to say it's ... ...\nHow do we know who built the wall and\nWhen did you come out there is a very good Historical Society in Medford and they have a wonderful a website and they've they're people who've done this work so Simpsons work has been done I'm saying you know why not bring it out into the\nLight yeah and even the names are interesting but as you point out in the piece that the name pomp or it's connected to a whole bunch of sort of a exaggerated highfalutin kinds of names\nThat yes yeah yeah well a slave holders or I don't know if it was you know their own a limited\nA view of of heroism or or maybe some worked um idea of irony I don't know but they often gave a the lowly as members of society the people whom they claim to own this property these really lofty names they named him after generals and philosophers and an orchards and it's just it's like a sick\nJoke as it is hard to get into the mind\nRight we might want when I'm hesitant to speculate but one does wonder yeah\nAnd and there's a lot more forgotten racism in greater Boston I mean do you feel it when you're walking around everything from you know the fights over you all the way and find you a hall [noise]\nW.

for Harvard to discriminate um and not necessarily support students of color\nAnd use it gives them when they're they're sort of using Asian American students as part of a broader strategy to undermine\nHer ... more generally\nI mean I I Do think it's a little more complicated than that obviously the Asian Americans involved in the case to have some say in that but at the same time\nAnd were blonde the conservative activists who who's behind the group behind the group and this isn't his first case it's just so hot\nIsn't just affecting you know the the kinds of learning environments and that diversity just within the college itself what is it due to the high school student who's applying to college and needs to represent themselves on this application\nI think that race blind admissions is maybe implicitly but maybe even explicitly\nSaying that race is not important right that race is not\nImportant part of your identity because it has\nNot affected your material circumstances but perhaps like living in a quote unquote post racial society um as these people claim that it also does not affect your identity at all and your identity right it's such an important\nPart of your application process to college\nAnd for me when I was applying to Harvard and into college more broadly race was such a large factor of my application race informed\nA lot of the activities that I did on campus um so I started a group for Asian American students at my high school and then formed what kinds of groups I was searching for and what communities I wanted to contribute to and be a part of once I joined to college and\nI made that very clear on my application and race and formed a lot of the research interest that I had in high school um race informed or the supplement essay that I sent and the kind of identity that I've formed in high school that would then inform what kind of student I\nWould be and what kinds of experiences I Would add to my college community\nAnd I think that if I came in to this application process with the idea that those factors all of them didn't matter I don't know what I Would have been left with how I Would have represented myself to the fullest withdrawal starts Monday\n... if you got\nTwo minutes and chambers with the judge you know a ... or something you particularly want to say\nI think I Would say that it's the ultimate goal is to you know whether it be supporting students of color addressing historical inequalities by racism making education\nAccess more equitable ... I think that as I say is trying to say that if you have these ideals than you would take away race conscious admissions because it is in fact hurting Asian Americans and I would tell the judge thought actually\nThere are many Asian Americans who do not believe that at all and that if you're going to get rid of affirmative action don't say you're doing it for the Asian American community because that's a statement that\nMany of us rejects so don't use that as an excuse find another reason that you're not doing this in our name\nThat's Harvard students ... culture of the parent Asian council in previous president of Harvard ... Asian American women's association Jewish like so much for being with us now thinking earlier today we spoke with ... actually James\nSign up at ... dot edu wash Mitt flushing for and some books older a certified the corporation offering full service solar system design and installation learn with the sun can do for you at some bugs older dot com [noise] Mm\n[noise]\nI saw them young joined my WVU our colleagues and me at the free bus in book festival this Saturday in coffee [noise] I'll just speaking with Steven Pinker his book is enlightened and now the case for reasons science and humanism and progress Bill Gates called his new favorite book of WVU\nAre is proud presenting partner the festival\nDetails W.
