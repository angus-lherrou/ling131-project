Boston a special broadcast radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker and I'm Stephanie ever Boston Globe reporter\nThis never Massachusetts voters will decide on three state ballot questions one of that question three asks whether voters approve of the state law banning discrimination based on gender identity in public accommodations\nA yes vote keeps the current law in place a no vote would repeal it\nToday advocates on both sides of question three join us for a debate brought to you by WBAI McCormack graduate school at UMass Boston and the Boston Globe and first we're going to introduce this debate about ballot question number three with this report from the ...\nThe law at issue here makes it illegal to deny service to transgender people in hotels stores restaurants or other public places it was overwhelmingly passed by the legislature and signed by governor Baker and has been in effect for a little over two years\nWhen that law went into effect in two thousand six seen it changed my life\nKelly Jenkins says she knows what it is like to be discriminated against because of her gender identity\nI've been refuse service in a restaurant simply for being transgender I've been asked to leave a place asked is a polite word I've been told to leave a place for using the women's restroom and those things have a lasting impact on me that I still have with me when I moved up here to Massachusetts\nCame here from eastern Tennessee back in two thousand fourteen two years before the transgender public accommodation laws passed she's been working as a teaching assist\nAnd you expect to have her own classroom next year the Martin powers chickens to be what she calls her authentic so\nI'm Still nervous that I'm going to be to swim and made it again but I Know I have this law in this state that it takes me and it gives me the ability to do my job and feel fairly safe so that I can go out there in the world and make a difference and teach these children drink and says she knew she\nMade the right decision to come to Massachusetts when she arrived for her job interview spotted a giant rainbow fly inside the school her co workers including Eileen shark said Jenkins is an asset to the school\nShe's a great teacher she's phenomenal collie she's ... she's willing to share parts of herself and her story with on our staff\nHand with students in a classroom that studying gender identity expression\nSays that generally low density may be shown by providing evidence including but not limited to and that's where they see consistent uniform assertion [noise]\nBut I can also be shown by any other evidence that the gender religion is sincerely out so it's just not a requirement that it's consistent that as one would have demonstrated but it's not required it boils down to having you sincerely held identity that's impossible to police\nAnd your response to that case the what would you say well the law itself\nIs is very clear that there's a different kinds of evidence that people can proper but I think the important thing for voters to know if they think about what to do on this question is they are going to hear a number of anecdotes throughout the afternoon\nThat do not involve transgender people that do not involve people asserting this law and saying that they got the protection of this law for the the crimes they're engaging in\nThe law does not allow people to do anything illegal they can be stopped and held accountable and they are\nAnd what voters really needs to be aware of is at the end of the day this is about people like me\nJust trying to go about our daily lives people like Nicole how that she's a Seventeen year old transferred our girl she's like any other teenage girl she wants to shop it's the for us she wants to be a professional singer someday but she can't be a professional singer in a theater that won't let Iran because she happens to be transgender [laughter] enough of this law is all about\nThe kind of want to make sure we get some callers in here uh serve on is calling from Newberry port serve on your on the air\nHi thank you and just didn't know my son is transgender and he's not an animal freak or any other strange be\nOn any of it like intention is not to hurt on the other person on the planet and I do the wording of the law states that if equality for all even outside of that\nMeeting going into a restaurant a store or anywhere else I don't understand how anyone would like that on any basis\nThat all people should be created\nEqual are treated equally on and I think that's the among the ring of what transgender who transgender people are is really a noxious and nasty they've obviously never met anyone that is transgender because more transgendered people get killed side street people than people that are are transgender hurting\nOthers and I just it's just a shame and sharing and that this law should they add it not in food into the future and that's basically all ...\nThanks so much of on ... Bek was how how would you address you ...\nTwo points first of all I'm this campaign is really not about the transgender issue this is about privacy in safety and bathrooms locker rooms and intimate places like that\nAnd the reason why we call this law the bathroom bill is because functionally that is the only place where the law has changed since this bill was passed in two thousand sixteen the Massachusetts commission against discrimination or submitted a letter to the legislature October of two thousand Fifteen making it clear that they have the Ford and they have the authority already at that time\nTo a process gender identity discrimination claims in public combinations so if this law were to be repealed nobody's rights would be any different when it comes to restaurants movie theaters hospitals places like that the only area that it'd be different would be the bathrooms in the locker rooms and that's the concern\nCasey and what you do have a minute to respond to that before we take some more calls\nAbsolutely I you know I think we can all agree uh enter and they are both lawyers that are in the visor opinion from a state agency is not the same and just does not offer the same or clarity and uniformity as a statewide law that's why large and small businesses support this law\nUm and you know changing or people you know what human beings we have to use the restroom sometimes we use a you know we are just as not us when we're in those places as anybody else um [noise]\nAnd you know at the end of the day what this is really about is a respect and dignity for everybody and safety for all and it's very clear that this law does not impact anybody's safety but it does make sure that transgender people are able to go about our daily lives okay\nWe're going to get to some of the evidence about safety in a moment but I Want to go to Zach who is calling from Boston that you're on the air\nOf hydrogen for taking my call I just have a question um\nCentral implications of you know I'm I'm open heart\nSurgery but I'm concerned about the war\nBy treating biological stock of human ... Iraq or trigger not on the emotion I'm a I'm\nRichard because people feel a certain way about humans are traditionally taught or were born and figure of scientific outdoor morality of normality has ... or ... or ... or\nWhat I'm Sorry I Do biology as biology is that what you're saying Zak yeah\nOkay uh let's let Casey a answer that briefly\n[noise] you know I think if you've never had the opportunity to meet a transgender person it can be a really challenging to understand what it means to be transgender you know my family is very supportive of me but um they had ... when I first came to them in and explain to them what was going on with me\nYou know I think the most important thing to keep in mind is you know we're all human beings we're all neighbors were family members or friends or co workers\nAnd at the end of the day we don't have to understand everything about each other to be able to treat each other decency and with dignity and respect\nAnd that's that's what you have some three is all about um that's why there's so much support for it and it doesn't put anybody in risk in the process which is why law enforcement and sexual assault prevention experts resoundingly support from three\nAnd I'm Wondering just briefly Andrew Do you think back as a boy\n... I mean we have men's rooms and women's rooms because a male ... female bodies are different and that's really all we're trying to maintain a recognition of is that women should not be forced to be in intimate places with Melbourne age and I think most of them and\nIt doesn't matter to them how the person who has that nobody identified stupid as a male intact anatomically male bonding with male genitalia and a longer Michelle next to them and make them uncomfortable and what this with the yes on three campaign feel to do is to respect that concern at all\nOf a ... we're going to have to go to a break right now but I Want to tell our listeners to stay with us we're continuing this debate on ballot question three in Massachusetts that seeks to repeal the two year old state law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity\nA yes vote would keep the current law and a no vote would repeal and we've got both sides in Studio with us to talk about this and you can call us at eight hundred for two three eight to five five to get in on the conversation\nI'm Deborah Becker I'm here with Stephanie ... from the Boston Globe and this is radio Boston\nFrom Boston University this should not be point nine WVU are Boston's NPR News station with the latest news analysis or W.

radio Boston broadcast a debate on ballot question three in Massachusetts I'm Deborah Becker\nAnd I'm Stephanie ... with the Boston Globe in three weeks voters will decide whether to keep the current law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity in public spaces we have both sides in the studio to talk about this endless\nReminder we want to hear from you this hour do you support the twenty sixteen state law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity or do you think it should be repealed you can call us at eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk you can also tweet us at radio Boston\n[noise] a a study released last month by researchers at the Williams Institute at the UCLA school of law examined restroom crime reports Massachusetts cities such as Medford Melrose Newton where local anti discrimination ordinances were in place before the law was enacted statewide\nA they found no link between transgender bathroom accessing crimes that occur in bathrooms and no difference between the cities that did and did not have policies\nAnd in fact they found very few bathroom incidents at all um this law has now been in place state wide for two years I went opposed to Andrew why aren't we seeing the public safety risks that you are predicting\nWell first of all to dress the Williams Institute studied I mean the ...\nSome bars including one of its authors of that study Jody Herman is on record saying we shouldn't even have\nMen's rooms and women's rooms at all\nUm but I Want to read listeners attention to study put up by more efficient called woman means something and they looked at the targets on target stores nationally and found that sexual incidents in particular voyeurism related offense\nTransgender individual either that from but people who wouldn't otherwise have access so particularly men who wouldn't otherwise have access to a bathroom my daughter may be and\nI'm ... now what I've always told my daughter don't get into elevators alone with men don't go into a room alone with a man whether it be somebody's office or any other situation like that I Will no longer be able to tell her that and that's my biggest concern\nRight Courtney a thanks so much for the call Bruce is also with us Bruce is calling from west Monroe Bruce you're on the air\nOn I think taking my call hey there's been a lot of talk in a debate about you know women being on the bathroom and I want to point out there's another side of the coin here\nI've worked with a transgender woman she was a brilliant professional I enjoyed working with their eyes and everyone around you regard as email because that was your outward appearance if I walked into the newsroom and they'll call are married she was in there my first reaction is Mary what the hell are you doing here\nI think I Would be pretty darned uncomfortable and I think she would be too so uh does this make any sense to have people who you know how we really looked like you know females to be in the men's or it's just makes no sense\nSo I'm going to ask Casey to respond to both of the things we've got some some safety issues here from a a woman and says that she's concerned about her daughter and what might happen here and also a a folks who may feel uncomfortable what do you do with those uncomfortable feelings Casey how do you address people who are just uncomfortable\n[noise] yeah you know I I understand if you've never met a translator person and you're not familiar with people like us um it can be uncomfortable\nTo sort of a figure out what it means and I've I've had people in my life as I have a canal to them and have a lot of questions and and take their time are becoming more comfortable but you know Courtney I'm when I think about this issue I think about or something like e and you know he's a teenager transgender\nUm his parents worry that he will face discrimination just going out with friends and your movie theater\nUm she has a sister and his parents support a yes vote on three and they support these protections and they certainly wouldn't support these protections for Ian at the expense of his sister ... you don't have to take my word for it or that this law works and that and everybody is kept safe including transgender people but not just transgender people\nYou know you can look to the law enforcement supporters you can look to the sexual assault prevention supporters um who all come out and said resoundingly that we are all safer when each of us is treated with dignity and respect\nA Andrew where\nUm since Massachusetts is the first state to legalize same sex marriage tendency mostly blue liberal state [noise] how do you convince the majority of people here to do away with rights that are already in place for transgender people\nWere going to be clear we're not doing away with it erodes the orders exist under Massachusetts law because the Massachusetts and Massachusetts where she goes to discrimination interpret sex discrimination to include gender identity as the Obama administration is done\nOn blue blue Massachusetts does something like that to change anytime soon but I wanted to circle back to the sponsors because\nUh the the culture for the yes on free Champaign Casey your coach or a ... dynasty attorney who helped filed a complaint in in the complaint this anatomical mail is demanding does he get his journals waxed by the female technician of his choice\nAnd that is the type of thing that I could even predicted this law would do but it's one of the unintended consequences and I would ask your case you do you believe that female small workers should have to touch\nAn atomic all men other journals and if they're uncomfortable doing that\nYou know what Andrew we are are on a tight clock here because we are also being broadcast in the western part of the state right now and and so we're going to ... we only have thirty seconds so I'm going to have case the answer that\nAfter a break I Want to remind you that you're listening to a live debate on ballot question three in Massachusetts that ask voters whether to repeal the state law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity\nI'm Deborah Becker and this is WB liars radio Boston\n[noise]\n[noise]\nFrom Boston University this was not only nine WVU are Boston's NPR

radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker\nAnd I'm Stephanie ... with the Boston Globe you're listening to special broadcast of radio Boston a debate on ballot question three and ask voters whether to keep the Massachusetts law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity joining us is Casey separate any an attorney and co chair of the yes on three campaign\nAlso Andrew back with President of the Massachusetts family Institute part of the campaign that is looking to repeal this state law unless there's a lot to remind you that we welcome your questions and comments this hour call us at eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred\nFor two three talk you can also tweet us at radio Boston and you know uh we we ended this with a kid with an Jew asking Casey to respond to this case about a Brazilian\nA waxing incident in Massachusetts I'm so it's okay to I'm going to let you respond and if we need to clarify will do that along the way\n[noise] of course this law does not require people to touch other people if they don't want to you that is just patently false\nOr to even suggest that and you don't have to take my word for it large and small businesses there are hundreds across the state of indoors this this law would not have done so if it does\nBut it's important for voters to think about what message we send if we repeal this law if we repeal this law we take a pro active stance is a state thing that we are comfortable and we can tolerate discrimination against transgender people I think that most voters would agree with me that that's wrong\nAnd would you have anything else to add to that Andrew\n... are you and your legal analysis must be different from your coach years because the way this law a bridge that man because you're doing a far as as a woman is entitled under this law to the present bikini wax and the fact that the small worker refuse to give it runs for violation of this law that you support\nI I I guess I Wonder here that a lot of what we're hearing are are are really sort of emotional arguments about safety and about men and women in in ... the comforter ability and all of this and and these are issues that are being debated nationally but I guess\nWhat message do you think might come from this case nationally I'd like to ask both of you that question Casey\nFirst well certainly if Massachusetts chooses to repeal this law or they will send a message to people all over the country that uh Massachusetts is not a safe or welcoming place\nFor transgender people and I think about people like\nYou know chastity and Kelly and other folks who actually moved here and they fled other places where there was discrimination against transgender people to come somewhere where they wouldn't be discrimination or if and hopefully when Massachusetts votes to uphold the law\nI think they will send a message to the nation much like the one they sent when they passed a law in the first place in twenty sixteen with ... with the support of\nA broad coalition of businesses and law enforcement officers in progressive and conservative said you know this is not about policy or politics this is actually just about people you know we're human beings and we want to be able to go about our daily lives were not doing anything wrong and we want to be left alone\nAndrew is their national message here and you know someone said that a message from a blue state like Massachusetts may send a nationwide signal that that this is open for changes across the country you're thought\nWell sure I think that's true and I think we've been seeing especially recently a a national discussion about the importance of listening to women\nWhen they speak out and one of the most disappointing aspects of this law's passage was completely dismissive many state officials were of concerns expressed by women we had a victim of sexual assault who spoke at the state house about having to share a locker room or shower with a male body against your will would read traumatized her\nAnd the four o Senate presidents don't Rosenberg so there's nothing to worry about Congress Mr because someone would ... as a woman is a woman\nBut again biology is biology not amusing that'd be into that sexual assault them those traumatic experience that uh we shouldn't be shortly dismissing and then more ... the chief law enforcement officers in favor of this law which is also on record saying that people who aren't comfortable with the transgender bathroom usage or mental illness locker room should just hold it\nW.

a opportunities down there as well as we do that park over a and along with the full point channel part\nThat will preserve a sea level rise and the four point channel will protect areas like sub arson and in in Dorchester and the ... and then in other parts of our city that would be flooded if if if if\nFlooding from incremental sea level rise\nAs the water just go higher because of the tides go higher and doesn't solve that problem to solve that problem you'd have to close the whole harbor off and not just like really really doesn't work\n[laughter] so uh you know harbor barrier that's out but what about other concerns were their concerns thanks\nA lot you know as the mayor explain this is really hearing dishes project it's a far reaching strategy rights and there's lots of moving pieces this poll them those pieces altogether uneasy said Boston is an island there are cities and counties up and down the coast that need to get involved and\nThat raises some very very basic questions I talked to eve tore she's the director of sustainability programs at better city it's a membership organization of I think something like a hundred and thirty large Boston businesses and they came together over the big dig\nThings that I\nSan hottest say\n...\nAnd what about the money\nThere's no clear price tag on that has been married just told us Bruce than\nUh you know he is going to look to the business community for some money here people are on board with\nThe way that this will be financed\nWell there are a lot of pieces as you say it's over long periods of time and it's going to cause inflation to count for and the cost of money to account for\nSo he's he's probably right not to put a price tag on it because there's so many moving piece um pursuits incremental he's going to dedicate as you said this is the capital phones or his ten percent of the year it's about Fifteen to twenty million dollars a year just got the two hundred and thirty two in the bag already\nBut yeah people have to keep them as can be philanthropies go to private companies nonprofits after chicken\nIt's going to take and then the state and the feds and the fence are going to be very reluctant but as a as a mayor said you know you're painting our pay me later it's the cost of doing nothing against climate change that's unacceptable ... how much is going to cost to bail out and say you know to drain the the big dig into tunnels that they'd flood\nOr what happens next year ...\n[noise] well the the the mayor's in sales mode you know he's got to sell his vision that he's generated bugs differently or as I said I think they were his speech was very well received but ... you know he's got to figure out how to keep the Sistine them the momentum\nWB are Bruce Gillum and

...\n... ... on\nA new episode every Friday on video [noise]\nWelcome back to the radio about that and I'm Deborah Becker\nThe Boston Asian American film festival marks its tenth anniversary this year a milestone during what some say is a new era for Asian Americans stories on the screen the festival kicks off tomorrow with screening of they now twenty five year old film the joy luck club\nOrganizer says intense and says this one will be helped pave the way for the current wave of popular Asian American films\nWe are not where we are now because of just what we've done in the past few years but rather that this is part of the legacy of creative that has had an impact that we are now feeling\nRosalyn child one of the stars of the joy luck club is in town for the festival and she joins us in Studio welcome radio Boston thank you so the joy luck club was a major felt let your mind focused on the twenty fifth anniversary was a major fell about their relationships\nBetween four young Chinese American women who grew up here and their mothers who were first generation immigrants and and we have a bit of a clip from a scene that I'm going to play here where uh one of the young women is talking about the mothers to bonded over over regular games of a\nOf a regular games let's listen\nTo start at the joy luck club having that all these women in church\nThirty Years' these went and did forgot past wrongs laughed in late last in one told the story [noise]\nEach week they hope the lucky [noise]\nHope with their own children [noise] with\nEach other have more to do is hope [noise]\nRoslyn tower remind us of of what that film meant and how big a hit it was twenty five years ago\nIt was huge because it was the first time is that Asian Americans saw themselves on screen in a major motion picture so I can remember a friend of mine saying it and he said\nThe second joy luck club came on he heard the music it's it is very meaningful\nLength of time so so ... for you and your professional world what kind of rules where you're playing until that remind us of what it was like for for someone trying to get into into Hollywood that\nWill just prior to that I had done a film called thousand pieces of gold where I played the first Chinese American pioneer woman I'm and she did not speak English and this was a welcome change I think that's where\nWing first Sunday was in that film so here we got to be ourselves essentially although I'm not\nLike rose exactly I'm much last year why [laughter] but um we did get to reflect the Asian American experience which we never had seen on the screen\nNow so many folks said oh the joy luck club uh shows and movements coming and this is a whole new time for a Asian American actors in films\nWasn't it didn't turn out to be a ... we were very hopeful I'm but I I Do think social media has a change that and I also think that the Asian American community has learned how to get behind\nUm our projects and and to be supportive of each other and I really think\nJohn Chu helped to lead that charging in huge but why didn't work do you think why didn't that work for the joy luck club I I Do believe that it was one of the first films\nSo ... ... ... we really didn't Asian Americans didn't know how to get behind our own works and we're more concerned with what we didn't see in joy luck club than what was there and such as I said well there were just\nI think everybody had a different opinion about what they had hoped to see in the film and expectations were very high\nAlthough you know overall we were supported is there just wasn't enough of a push we weren't um you know the publicity wasn't huge ... the marketing and it all just didn't come together the way it has with crazy Rich Asians and this perfect\nStorm of well let's talk about crazy Rich Asians are one of the themes we also have a clip from one of the scenes that movie and that's where the character neck young asked his girlfriend the character Rachel Chu to come to Singapore and made his family let's listen to see where I\nSee my family [noise] while ma\nMiddle regard strange courtroom and shake\nLens she has been begging me to come visit her you know\nThe universe was frozen ones roses [noise]\n\nAt the same from the movie crazy Rich Asians and I'm Wondering is this the turning point for Asian American actors and so\nI'm very optimistic because we have a lot more I'm seeing a lot more interesting Asian American filmmakers out there we have um there's interest um it's it's very exciting\nBut you know it seems like it's almost similar here with crazy Rich Asians very high expectations in some criticism their butts Singapore and the portrayal of of Asian Americans in Singapore I mean\nYou know it seems like maybe film Asian American films are still trying to find their footing here when it comes to Hollywood right right but where do you know as long as we're\nAcross industries with business executives with entrepreneurs that reminded me when disruption happens change follow snow we've never seen a more disruptive force in Washington and this president and his administration but I think what gives me a lot of optimism is that these terms are the change that follow and\nUh and I do think that there's an opportunity to break the gridlock to to change business as usual I mean when you have this many people across the country who have never run before I never thought of running before frankly\nAll going to Washington at the same time I I think that that new breed of leader ah the freshness will help you know stir things up and and maybe change uh those that partisan politics that we're seeing right now\nThey're you know you've you've I Believe then describe maybe described yourself ah bend described oh for sure as a pragmatic progressive what does that mean to you\n[noise] I really want to be effective uh I really want to get things done a I have um\nYou know I embrace of bold vision of where our country needs to go um but I also uh I think that there's an opportunity after these ... turns to really hear the um\nCountry and the plight of working class families and roll up our sleeves and get things done so uh you know while protecting I I was just yesterday in Lawrence with leader Pelosi and congresswoman Clark and congresswoman Tsongas and we're talking about the importance of protecting\nA people who have pre existing conditions and their security and having insurance coverage I mean we that's under attack and ah the pragmatic side of me is\nYou know we have to have a bold vision for transferring\nIn the meantime I mean we have to we have to really safeguard those principles and that and the dignity that the CIA gave so many people are people like my dad who have a ... who has multiple sclerosis and I really did live in fear that his insurance would be taken away\nAnd we have to build on that and we have to improve I mean the reality is premiums are too high prescription drug\nCosts are too high and then what do you tell the people in your district to blame the icy for that [noise] well you know I don't think that the uh\nThe high cost of prescription drugs um it was it was something that I think the CIA was going to come back and and address a and it didn't write because right after its passage we were you know defending and protecting it and it was slowly getting dismantled\nAh by the Republicans in Congress and so the opportunity to get back to the table and figure out how we are transparency to prescription drug pricing how we enforce price gouging how we make it more affordable um for those you know medicines that people need a is an important next step\n[noise] now you mentioned Nancy Pelosi who was here a earlier this week you hosted a fundraiser with Nancy Pelosi ah I I Wonder if you were elected would you support her as as a leader and the\nYou know I Do get this question quite a bit uh and so I first have to say because I'm I've admired her career she you know the first woman speaker of the house or what she's done for women and for working class families is a is really a model I think a lot of uh a lot of us could emulate\nUm but right now I Am one hundred percent focused on getting elected you know someone reminded me the other day that you know the primary was was long and hard fought a you know I was the last named democratic nominee and the country [laughter] so [noise]\nYou know these weeks have been really spent like getting ready for the November six election but I'll I I look forward to having the making a decision and having those conversations about the leadership of the party after I get\nA sense I haven't made that decision right white yeah okay well let's talk about policy a little bit ah we spoke with Iowa Republican challenger red green on the show earlier this week and we we asked him to outline his views on some issues he told us he is opposed to sanctuary cities and he supports greater border security\nAnd he said this about a background checks and gone legit gun legislation let's listen\nI'm a supporter of the the bill of rights which includes the tenth amendment which is you know states rights one size fits all coming out to D.C to me is usually the wrong answer Massachusetts has our laws and the people of Massachusetts are very happy with them at the same time we wouldn't want to live under the laws of say Wyoming or Texas\nBut also to understand that the people of Wyoming in Texas may not want to live under our laws\nOkay so I Wonder Lori Drew hand what about you on background checks on gun legislation\n[noise] yep this is a this is a point ah\nThat we just disagree on uh I Do believe in universal background checks I mean I think that's the place where we could actually come together as a country ah Republicans and Democrats uh to solve a problem that is you know facing our country they sing our our our kids\nUh you know there is no reason why we shouldn't be making doing the due diligence to make sure we're not selling a gun to somebody who could hurt themselves or hurt someone else and frankly you know\nThere's people who who aren't clear to fly airplanes should not be able to own a gun or you know I think he's um [noise] uh\nI don't think that this is a state issue I think this is uh something that we have to take up on the federal level and that and I think it's important\nAnother issue in the district sanctuary cities where do you stand on those ... opposed to sex or is it is\nYou know I think this is a decision a for\nUm for ... for a community center vigil communities I've known mayor Dan Rivera a for a long time or a very large mayor ah who I used to work with and uh you know the other night we had a debate and uh my opponent came down really hard on the city of Lawrence and reference to\nAthens and all of us that happened in the city uh this notion that NATO Rivera is not cooperating\nAh when those um when those buses happen it's just it's wrong I mean he says uh in invested in bringing you know violent criminals to justice as anyone and so I think that um you know this\nFear mongering around a um [noise] you know central trafficking targeting communities of color [noise] this is this is where him and I don't see eye to eye\nThe role of Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform that is our job it's our laws are outdated this is an area where senators Kennedy and Senator McCain actually found a way to work together and pass a bill that not only strengthened our borders\nSome of the problems with uh with our immigration system are acceptance criteria evaluating you know how we seek us how we evaluate asylum seekers are updating our visa program so takes into account or skills gap in our American workers that is the role of Congress and that's the kind of productive conversation we should be having\nSo you would support asserting that would be a sanctuary city would you say that you would support a city's uh ability to declare itself as ... you\nKnow I I Believe right now that what uh\nI'm Lawrence may over there is doing is protecting non violent undocumented immigrants who are\nGoing to the RMC and without notice getting picked up and separated from their family for really you know no reason when he's not doing is uh is you know allowing violent criminals to to live in a city so you know I uh\nUh what's right for Lawrence might not be right for low and I respect that that decision should be kept with local law enforcement local officials\nThe opioid epidemic which has been an issue everywhere now there was a bill or actually there was bipartisan agreement in a restaurant in ... very recently what\nOther things do you think that federal lawmakers need to do to address the opioid epidemic or what would you like to try to work on regarding that issue that I have a specific plan at this point or not yeah\nNo absolutely I mean you can't travel a far in this district and not be confronted with a heartbreaking story a and the reality is cities like lower Lawrence and have are are disproportionately impacted by this epidemic and\nYou know certainly I think we need more funding we need more federal resources I mean the bill that was passed that um you know funded a medically assisted treatment more comprehensive centers and it's a start but\nWe have to make more and more available I mean we have to keep people alive uh we we do have to put more funding behind medically assisted trick treatment if there's anything I've learned this is not something you beach with willpower alone\nOr the recovery is long I'm so not only do we have to have a long term approach a but we have to give people the skills that they need to get back on their feet reunited with their families into a good paying job so that we decreased Sally relapse rate [noise]\nUh the third district includes ah some of the communities affected by the Columbia explosion and that over pressure of Asian or if you were elected what do you think Congress what would you want Congress or try to get Congress to do for the affected communities\nThere yes offer you first and foremost I think we have to uh we have to see what the investigation surfaces or you know there are too many questions right now around how this happened how we maintain our our pipelines how we prevent this from ever happening again", "show_name": "Radio Boston", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "17"}
