that you listen for so we hope that you will put a dollar value on it and hold one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to age seven and make a pledge during this very important ... thank you so much

Emerson dot org\nAnd Avi FX advanced audio video and lighting services for meetings that matter events that inspired and exhibits that engage the CSI effect dot com our passion shows [noise]\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker or their secret courts are operating in Massachusetts the Boston Globe says there are in the form of closed door hearings before a single court official where thousands of criminal charges can and do disappear\nThe paper analyzed data from what are known as show cause hearings which are held before court clerks and the paper says its analysis shows an arbitrary part of our state's criminal justice system\nGlobe spotlight reporter Nicole Duncan joins us to talk about this Nicole welcome to radio Boston Hi thanks for having me I'll sit on the line is Joe Simon's a criminal defense attorney in Boston Thanks for being here Joe\nHi thanks for having me during our conversation also we're going to hear from a member of the governor's council parents Kennedy and we'll talk with him as well but first\nNicole I Want to start with you why are you calling these secret court\nYeah so in Massachusetts and around the country generally criminal proceedings for adults are always public suffer the minute a person is arranged arraigned on a charge in the courtroom you or I can go into the courtroom and we can look up the case\nBut in Massachusetts if you're accused of crime and haven't been arrested you generally have a right to this hearing that data that's completely hidden from the public\nUm I Can't go into the hearing and it's a very different from every aspect of the open court that you know we see in court houses across the country but just on three arrests pre arraignment free arrest sorry not pre arrest it's usually for people who haven't been arrested much pre arraignment\nOkay [noise] ah so give us an example of of what you found here in terms of the criminal charges that are heard in these show cause hearings\nI let a standardized level of training for a clerk magistrate\nWell that's what it is it's it's a state level training the old uh various um training throughout the year for\nTheir educational environment yeah yeah and and the coolest thing it better than I Am fewer educational or a few educational requirements for clerk magistrate is deciding matters of law ... aside from that though I'm just wondering what\nAbout ... ... if you're talking about lawyer versus non lawyer I'll be glad to address that um I think that I've been like Joe I've been a criminal defense lawyer for many years I've been a criminal defense lawyer for thirty five years um and I have dealt with\nMany many court magistrates that were attorneys and many that we're not ... and some of the best court magistrates\nThough I've dealt with ... what do we do want to make sure that the system is more uniform I guess is the is the thrust of this question here\nWhat respect I mean I used it in with respect to recording hearings\nUm that's something that could be discussed and certainly wouldn't be a a a bad idea I've attended many quite magistrates hearings where they are recorded I don't I don't see that as an issue and by the way the statute allows for any party to either bringing a recording device\nOr a ... a which I've done I brought in demographers into ... hearing before when they were somewhat serious ...\nNot as a as a result of this report do you think the governor's council would consider making any changes or anything\nWell the governor's council doesn't have any jurisdiction over making changes with the way to him a system works within the court we approve a record magistrates themselves when governor nominates one and we have to make sure that they're qualified in it when you look at who's going to be a chord magistrate it's not\nA legal background because I think that can be made up with a great deal of experience to church samples governors just ignored magistrates work or just them\nFor many years they might be qualified but a big part of their job goes beyond that they have to be good managers managing the courts offers some of them have a you know fifty sixty Seventy employees are much smaller but uh it [noise]\nYou have to be what managers while and I think that's an important part of the jaw\nNicole wondering what's what's the reaction been to the story\nI think we've heard from a lot of people who were surprised that this even existed um I mean I actually [noise] hold all fifty states to see if there was anything even remotely similar\nUm and many of the prosecutors and says court officials that I talked to said no I never heard of anything like that it's really surprising um on our and we've heard from other people who've gone through some of these hearings and we're glad that we were shedding light on it and [noise]\nAnd so in terms of any action that might be taken or any changes still too early to tell\nYeah I mean that is something that I think legislators can look into\nI mean this is in fact something that the trial court itself could actually um make some action or make some changes on 'em because this isn't actually codified directly into law the idea of these um at these hearings secret\nUm came from an ass Jaycee a Supreme a Supreme Court decision a so it's not actually something that is codified into law than\nWe did we should say we did get a statement from a trial court chief justice ... saying that the role of these hearings and click magistrates is consistent\nWith criminal justice reform efforts recently in Massachusetts load doesn't look like there would be a change anytime soon I'm Sorry that we are out of time because I Know we could continue this conversation but I Want to say\nThank you to Nicole dumped on the Boston Globe spotlight reporter Joe Simon's a criminal defense attorney\nAnd Terry Kennedy attorney and member of the governor's
