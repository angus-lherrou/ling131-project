is radio Boston I'm Evan heroin or after all the divisiveness and turmoil Brett Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court justice haven't been approved by the Senate and sworn into office over the weekend\nWelcome to the cabinet era of the Supreme Court were five conservative justices are poised out vote therefore and more liberal colleagues in a way that threatens to turn a venerable American institution into yet another arena for partisan brawling\nOr at least that's the fear Justice Kagan spoke on friday at Princeton University in reflected on this new Supreme Court one without the truth center\nThere has been a person hill found the center where people couldn't predict in that sort of way and that's the name of the court to look as though and what's not owned by one side or another and uh and watch him did impartial and neutral and fair\nKagan says the court has to be cognizant of how it will now be perceived\nNeed to be aware of that every single one of us\nAnd to realize how Russia\nOr the courts a legitimacy is the only thing we don't have an army and we don't have any money and the only way we get people to do what we say that they should do is because people respect us and respect our fairness\nSo can this court stand above the political fray and maintain its legitimacy or will it fall prey to the partisanship that splintering this country joining me now is Rosanna ... she's a professor of law at Suffolk University and there was an afternoon\nAlso with us from Washington DC is Garrett Epps he's a professor of constitutional law at the University of Baltimore school of law hello Garrett\nAm and how are you I'm doing great girls or start with you because you wrote a piece over the weekend or were you talked about how your sense of the court legitimacy was shaped by your experience growing up in the segregated south and and watching the Supreme Court force communities to accept integration\nWhy start there why did you you your sense of the legitimacy start there\nWell I you know I started there because I started there that is why I as as a very young boy I think it was an unusual time to grow up I became aware of the Supreme Court I became aware that\nAh the people around me were very critical of the court they they they thought that the justices were wrong you know I I remember as a boy seeing the\nBillboards that said impeach Earl Warren and so forth\nAnd yet I also knew growing up in a relatively small southern town I knew the federal judges who were enforcing are trying to enforce brown versus board of education and the other desegregation opinions\nSo I think we we have footage from that so let's play a clip of Kavanaugh at the confirmation hearings\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political\nFuel without parents' tent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left wing opposition groups\nWho speaks to what you were saying was on it which is is she raises the political stakes in South by invoking political differences\nThat's right explicitly literally just if you pull a few phrases that revenge of the Clintons you know left wing groups justice is try to avoid terms like that at all costs and he's a sitting judge even while he's saying that suffer litigants to think that they're going to go in and get a fair hearing I think that yeah the ... there's good reason for them to be\nA skeptical about that and when you call that out it that's when you start to really erode the fundamental legitimacy of the institution\nAnd apparently not everyone agrees with let's go to\nDavid how you doing\nGreat thank you very much for taking my call um I just wanted to comment on a really legitimately burn\n'em I personally don't believe that there should be any legitimately burn the debris report\nAnd the reason I feel that way because\nJudge cabinet and the judge at a very high level in government or\nA very long time and they're never been any concern about his impartiality on 'em and just a comment about the statement that a judge Kavanaugh I made a during the confirmation hearing I I Believe that it very difficult\nUpgrade a personal and professional I'm feeling and I think with somebody attacked them personally and Douglas ... family I think he's going to be on one way I\nI truly hope and believe that you'll respond very differently when you get that in a jungle\nThank you David and David raises a good point which is when the nomination was announced a legal scholars from really across the spectrum came out to say he's a he's a respected Scott ... legal field he's qualified he's competent that as\nSoon as the ... the politics was hidden behind a this these claims about confidence that had been for a long time so I think there is now this argument that maybe it's actually a good thing that Kavanaugh has come out and indirectly political it strips the veil away from a court\nThat had long been political and got all ask for your sense is is there a sense where actually this is just exposing the politics has always been there and maybe that's not such a bad thing\nYou know I'm I'm trying I'm sitting here trying to be a good sport and to find the silver lining in this and I ain't got\nA electron tries\nYes no I appreciate it but you know I think what ah what Kavanaugh did or in that speech he crossed the line that Clarence Thomas never crossed a he he pulled back\nA mask if that's a mask if that's the way all the justices are than the Supreme Court has no\nLegitimacy and I think you know to to show the the degree of to which he crossed the line you just have to consider that that Justice John Paul Stevens Ninety eight years old man who has seen\nYou know maybe almost a quarter of the Supreme Court's history or said you know shortly before the vote that that he did not believe that anyone who is capable of making that statement\nOught to be on the Supreme Court I was stunned when I saw that and there's one thing for me to say that he shouldn't have done it John Paul Stevens a lifelong Republican\nUh to say that that a specific nominee did not belong in the court we are in uncharted waters a and you know justice Kevin ... is no longer the well respected judge he was before that speech he is now the person who said those things\nAnd he uh is going to have to deal with that legacy\nWas that you see a silver\nLining here I'm not seeing the silver lining either trying really hard time selling us but nobody's buying you know one of the things that we've learned since you know high school civics is that we have two branches that are explicitly political we vote for them we we ... campaign\nBut then we have this third branch that's different special\nUh and if we get to a place as we really are right now or where the law is what five justices said and it's and it just depends which five justices those are then I think we're in a very dangerous place in terms of our perception of and the reality of the rule of law that there is this\nBy in of of of of our citizenry that there really are principles out there that are just ... untrue and not just a headcount each time that the issue\nComes up so what is to be done then Gary uh packing the court um term limited appointments endless investigations what what should people be thinking about\nYou know I I think that it's a little early to start about packing the court if I uh you know I live right down the street from Congress last time I saw there was a bunch of Republicans there and not enough Democrats\nUnit a pack a phone booth or it it's probably early to think about that but I Do think that the dialogue that is now taking place ... which began at a low level after Bush versus Gore but has now picking up speed about\nYou know what is the role we want to a court to play in our democracy or how did this happen you know that it's not at all clear that\nThe framers of the constitution anticipated that uh the Supreme Court would\nWould be this kind of arbiter of constitutionality\nUm maybe we want to consider the a a jurisdiction of the court maybe want to consider not you know that the justices should be active justices for Eighteen years and then remain justices but no longer sit on cases are after that in order to ensure the turnover on the court that's a good discussion\nIn a part as in terms of when you know you watch when we get a majority we're going to investigate the living daylights out of you that I don't like to hear a and I don't think it ensures anybody well\nIt may it may not or anybody well it may happen anyway that is if the Democrats take the house they will have the power to continue investigating Kavanaugh's pass in fact let's go to a caller a Mike from Framingham has something to say on the subject Mike how you doing\nI'm doing just great through here other than my workers load after this nominate [laughter] with the\nUm ... it's just a minute incredible injustice or any other candidate would have been gone\nAfter ... you're just as behavior alone never mind why should it first court judge just to live so it's just the\nWay it's just odd I might but there was one part of it but I Believe that Democrats dropped the ball and Mr White house Senator Whitehouse and assume doubles triangle in cabin on how to do than sit\nDrinking and he moved right on now with the White House would have to explain how you win doubles trying on how you lose devil's triangle how do you when you lose that was all games there is a winner and loser the Drake you you know you can look at a drawing up\nYeah drink or do not get all my ... is very good sense and I I mean I'm going to ask them about this what happened and how they pushed hard or are they going to continue pushing ... do you see\nI mean this is a comment that so many people make that the Democrats you know come to a knife fight with the dill pickle you know in that they don't really know how to fight back in the trenches in that way and there were certainly opportunities to get a more rigorous cross examination there and reveal\nPlainly to the listening public the degree of deception that that the justice\nNow justice was engaging in a but they just didn't have the stomach for it and in addition I think that format of the five minute quickie questions was never going to really give anyone the kind of attraction that your caller would have liked to see\nA going forward you know the question is if the Democrats just wait it out and get their turn and when they get their turn they pack on their justice is\nUh I I think that there's definitely an appetite for something a little bit more ah a brutal and at that as you suggested a reopening of these investigations if and when the Democrats have the house or a continuing exploration of whether there are other accusations or of the testimony of the justice himself\nOn the other hand no one wants to see that no one wants to see someone saying sitting justice is going to be interrogated about perjury so it's a no win\nThat's Rosanna ... she's a professor of law Suffolk University thanks where was I don't think he is also with us from Washington DC is Garrett Epps he is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Baltimore school of law thanks so much Garret\nEnjoyed it [noise] stay with us there's more ahead I'm Evan Horowitz this is radio Boston\n[noise]\nI'm Lisa Mullins stand with the fact listen to all things considered today for four to six thirty ... W. B. you are the largest radio newsroom in Boston\nOne of the stories you'll hear on all things considered the fight over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and how it might have affected the battle for control of the house and Senate\nAnd I think that shows that people are getting the wage increases and the new jobs being created is really helping our economy and giving us a chance to be more competitive not just in Massachusetts but also with other states and internationally\nLet me ask about one more issue and then we'll wrap up but I Want to ask you about immigration and family separation at the border I Know you're for border security that you support the president's approach on this that the Trump Administration go too far here\nThat was actually policy in place under the Obama administration that thankfully when it was brought to the attention of the Trump Administration they seized that kept kept families together in my opinion is that a solution like what Ted Cruz did which was say let's get more judges to the border so we can process people more quickly and keep these families together I think that was a great solution but\nIn my opinion a secure border ... eliminates the temptation for families to potentially take this risky an effort to come into our country illegally\nBut we all saw images of families being torn apart kids in cages I mean do you have any issues with the way the White House is going about this\nAnd look I I've talked to border patrol agents I've talked to immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents they all feel that the president's efforts to try to actually address secure border or is the right way to go I mean there has been fence authorization in the past with Republicans and Democrats are both supporting that there was miles and miles of fence\nBuilt in Texas and in in California and Arizona\nThe fact of the matter is it's just not a complete border and fully secure border I think all he's trying to do is make sure that we\nTake immigration laws seriously as possible if anybody wants to become a citizen of the United states let's bring them in the let's have it done legally Jeff\nWe're hearing in this current political moment the president said on more than one occasion that the media is the enemy of the people who agree with that [laughter] [noise]\nI Would not say the media is the enemy I unfortunately feel like the media's become almost as divided in some ways uh on one side of the other I think that is a problem I really hate the fact that people go on social media Twitter Facebook and feel that they can attack even their neighbors right now and and unfortunately we feel like it to more divided country than it's ever been in I\nI I certainly want to do what I came down in Washington to reduce those tensions\nAre focused on the state of Massachusetts what's good about it what can be great about it\nFor the future but in an important to speak out and called the president out when he make statements like that I mean because that comes from the style in this world the media is the enemy of the people I've been at those Trump rallies where he's gotten the whole audience to turn around and sort of a junior at us\nI'm not saying feel sorry for me I'm just saying it's a scary thing when the leader of the free world does that\nMean first of all we have free speech in of course that allows for the media\nBut at the same time I think free speech also means you can question the media and for a long time it felt like\nCertain aspects of the media focused on attacking one party and I'm I'm not trying to say it's about party but unfortunately it does seem like that can be the case sometimes and I think what the president was doing was actually just letting people know hey there was a problem and I feel like the media's part of it or well Geoff\nDiehl Massachusetts state representative for the seventh Plymouth district and he says the Republican nominee for the U.S Senate Jeff thanks thanks so much for coming in every shift ... thank you\nStay with us there's more ahead I never Horowitz this is radio Boston [noise]\n\nThis\nIs Ninety point nine W.

tradition today's the day we argue about whether to celebrate Columbus Day\nOr follow cities like Somerville in Cambridge who've ... indigenous people's day but we can also use it as an occasion to better understand the rich complex world that Columbus stumbled upon and fourteen Ninety two\nAnd sometimes serendipitous sometimes devastating chain of events that followed this clash of civilizations joining me now is a writer who looked carefully at both sides of this world changing event with two books aptly named fourteen Ninety One\nNew revelations of the Americas before Columbus and fourteen Ninety three uncovering the new world Columbus created\nCharles see men welcome to radio Boston\nThe pleasure to be with you it was a pleasure to have you I mean you wrote this book the first one fourteen Ninety One this phenomenon of a book later a mini series about the sophistication of the pre Columbus encounter world just start by giving us a sense of what the Americas look like in fourteen Ninety One\nSay that you were somehow in an airplane flying over the Americas at a time you might start here and you'd see the sort of coalitions of of villages I'm\nJust sort of gathering together into sort of tiny empires all over New England and then if you went further south you see the remains of Mississippi and villages and city centered around these large\n... pyramids for itself and that you'd have the as tick um empires its called Detroit asking these sort of much more larger centralized states I'm going to all the way to the west coast of South America where you have the ... empire to wanting to use is called by them which was the ...\nTime the largest road system Norma ... thing that stretched equivalent from Stockholm to Cairo and then in the Amazon you has written just now finding out you have these kind of ring cities the sort of coalitions of cities that we don't know very much about we're learning a lot more now\nSo it was a thriving bustling place full of millions of people doing interesting things\nTo get us to to key questions I guess about this the civil these civilizations won the size the other how advanced they were and we'll start with the latter one I mean how advanced were these are cultures of the Americas what kinds of technologies what kinds of\nAh norms of you know I don't know city management [laughter]\nUm well they're very different from the European counterparts and so when you talk about how Vance their depends what the yardstick is um for instance the no question that Europeans were much better at you know certain machinery like a pumps and ah that that that sort of thing and the use of steel\nI'm On the other hand I think you could make a pretty strong argument that many of the native societies of the Americas had much more sophisticated agriculture than Europe ... there's no evidence of the kinds of frequent recurring famines that were sort of the European stock in trade in the in the in the fifteenth century\nAnd so that kind of a land management or they're much more sophisticated they also have sophisticated metallurgy I'm particularly in a mess of America and uh and the and the Incas but it was to use metals ways were completely different\nUm you have these uh they valued them for their ... for the um bend ability rather than their strength and so you had these very elaborate a middle or trickle techniques to make metal shiny and that sort of thing which are justice scientific and justice technological for completely different purposes and I think that would be the way to understand them societies that thought about\nDifferent kinds of technology and different kinds of ways\nAnd so then the next question how big how many people I mean [noise]\nYou know this is one of those historical debates right and um the the the the real answers nobody really knows the typical estimates are between forty and sixty million in the Americas at the time of Columbus\nPhoney and Siri ... million yeah which is very roughly equivalent to the population of of Europe at that at that time I should note that these estimates of native population keep rising\nUm and as a personal guess I wouldn't be surprised if it shook out around eighty million in the Americas at the time of Columbus\nI Know some scholars have pushed back against against your book suggesting the number you know you you kind of reach for some of the higher it's like if you were to conservative number like what's the lower bound in your mind of how few it could be\nWell as I said the typical scholarly estimates are on the order of forty to sixty million so perhaps forties or is it is a kind of a lower abound sixty being up around and that is I'm just noting that the historical pattern that you know if you've gone Twenty years ago you would have had a different range of been lowered so the numbers keep you know creeping up", "show_name": "Radio Boston", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "08"}
