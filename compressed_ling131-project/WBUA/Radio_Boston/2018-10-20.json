ancestry and gifts for President Trump's criticism of her family lore\nNow president like call my mom a liar and what is the fact that we have a Native American ancestry and you're better\nThat the test has provoked some strong criticism from both Republicans and Democrats even from the tried that Warren says is part of our heritage the Cherokee Nation secretary of state called warns DNA test inappropriate and wrong and President Trump is now calling on Warren do apologize\nI Want to urge the country as well as you\nWere in did express regret for not clearly making that distinction that only Native American tribes and not DNA tests determine tribal citizenship and this is the first issue that we're going to take off with our weekend review panel is ... is a senior fellow at the pioneer Institute\nAnd head of ... strategies hello and thanks for coming in Palo thanks for having me also with us Arlene Isaac than political consultant and co chair of the Massachusetts gay and lesbian political caucus high there Arlene Hi Deborah\nSelf uh obviously strong backlash over this DNA test probably not what Senator Warren ... dead Arlene was this a miscalculation by her campaign well\nYou know the truth is I think this whole issue of people attacking her about her heritage is really appalling I think it it it's an ad hominem attack when you can't attack someone and when on the issues themselves you go after the person\nIt's a it's a distraction from the main event and the main event is if you disagree with their policies that's fine that's fair I can respect that but to focus so much on whether or not ... ... what the particular nature for DNA makeup is I find offensive but like take the bait\nWell she has no choice because Trump's been putting it out there in in in the Trump era distraction is the rule the game\nYou know I mean the reality is that we all have family lore about who we are and where we came from and we were all raised with stories and that may or may not be true\nAnd if you ever saw that television commercials for ancestry dot com or a guy stands there and lead a hose and it says I was raised to think we were German and now I found out what Scottish changes were killed [laughter] you know you can't be blamed for what your family told you my menu of every reason and rights are respected and believe it\nI don't have totally severe what do you think of this you think that uh that she did this because she had to dispute with the president was saying\nUm and he needs to focus on the middle [noise] independence and the moderates and that's what he's done on a signature at\nYour bird do think that um he is concerned whether he needs to be or not we'll see but I think he is concerned and a lot of those folks won't show up at five and\nAlso other unless they have a reason to the un so that gives them a reason okay well what might make people show up at the polls and these ballot questions right I mean we certainly got some some a very interesting controversial ballot questions here on radio Boston we hosted two debates on the questions this week the first was on\nQuestion three which asks whether voters approve of the state law that bans discrimination based on gender identity in public a combination snow a yes vote\nWould keep the current law a no vote repeal that and on the show we add Casey suffer Deanie who's with freedom for all Massachusetts and he said a yes vote protects people's rights you\nKnow we're all human beings we're all neighbors were family members or friends or co workers and at the end of the day we don't have to understand everything about each other to be able to treat each other decency and with dignity and respect\nAnd then we also spoke with Andrew back with President of the Massachusetts family Institute urging a no vote he said this has nothing to do with chance a transgender rights about public safety\nOr concerns really have nothing to do was individuals or do far as transgender it's the abuse of potential abuse of this long by people who are predators\nNow the campaign uh for question three has has to use them very um [noise] a very controversial ads ah regarding this question and I'm On a play part of a digital video ad that's urging a no vote on question three in in this add a man enters a woman's locker room and hides when a woman comes and\nAs the woman starts to get undressed uh she realizes the man is in there ah let's listen to part of that\nOne does Massachusetts question three mean\nWho says he is a woman can enter a woman's locker room\nEven convicted sex offenders\nAnd if you see something suspicious and say something to authorities you didn't want to\nThe anti so Arlene just wondering what do you think of the the the ad and and the debate on this question which I think is public safety and human rights\n[noise] well I I have a a arguably unique perspective on this I've been working on this issue for ten twelve years so I feel very passionately about voting yes to 'em and I think was fair amount of people will vote yes to protect trans folks\nUp with the premise is simple that the trans neighbors should be treated equally under the law at the same respect and dignity that anyone else our community would deserve and walk [noise]\nYou know but it parallels what happened with the gay and lesbian community in Nineteen eighty nine we pass to the exact same bill that you can't discriminate and I'm based on sexual orientation employment housing credit public accommodations [noise] Twenty years now are opponents use the bathroom argument against us back then [noise]\nTwenty years later the trends equal protection bill passes and the exact same argument comes up except this time it's about\nYou can't discriminate based on gender identity in employment housing credit public accommodations what are the legislature do they bifurcated the bill they pass just the employment peace in the education piece in the housing peas and they said well wait on public accommodations and a few years later a year or so ago they pass the bill saying you can't discriminate and two years ago was twenty seven sixteen [noise]\nThat you can't discriminate against trans people based on gender identity in public accommodations which means hospitals and grocery stores and on public buses and in a theater\nSo the argument about safety is bogus because the people who were screaming about safety now they actually opposed it poses protections when it had to do with employment denying people jobs and they use the same argument against us the gay and lesbian community\nSo why not go after the safety argument then instead of just focusing on the human rights argument would that be a better way to do is we'll\nWe actually did and they and the campaign is doing that still we made a point when lobbying the bill to show that the police supported the legislation that women's groups supported delicious legislation and that\nUh entities like Jane Doe that dedicate themselves to protecting women also supported the bill and now they support us they want to vote yes on question three as well so we have the facts but our opponents are using fear mongering\nTells you have your your thoughts\nThe other side obviously on this you know they it's their right to bring it to the ballot and and and go through this but you know in a perfect world this has no place on the ballot you know this has been debated through thoroughly and it has a ... you know in in the legislature has acted\nOn it bill was signed into law a you know since that happened I haven't seen any sort of horrible things that have happened and I just to bring it to a very personal level\nI spend a lot of time worrying about my Fifteen year old daughter but this does not make me worried\n[laughter] you know I I just I I I just don't really see an issue here huh\n[noise] ah okay well I now have to end with our hubs here and he said the brief stories are events that have caught our attention this week uh that's all we have time for unfortunately so let's do the suburbs I'm Arlene your how 'bout\nOh well my mother is about Halloween that it's just it's not just for kids anymore\nThe beacon ... times recently lifted I'm reminded people of the street closures that'll take place on Halloween so that trick or treaters can walk in the street without cars and traffic\nAnd in fact many neighborhoods are now finding that the adults are getting into Halloween whether they have kids or not\nWhether they they just hang out on their porches and their Jackson their city stoop says they give out handy and dress in costumes and Halloween has become a great opportunity to get to meet and to know your neighbors you know sometimes people know each other because they share kids in common or they know each other because they ... they all have dogs and they bring the dog park together\nUm but even with the people that you may disagree with politically you can enjoy and appreciate each other as neighbors at least for a few hours I'm On Halloween we can all benefited\nWearing a mask [laughter] that's because you're living your life to everyone will join each other and you're doing a holiday it's it it you know we all benefit because it creates a common ground with neighbors and so I actually believe Halloween can help make the world a better place even if it's just for one day a year\nRight on right very nice to have a finally went through about you're going to this rather you know something about how they said my parents to get together and somehow avoid if that happens [laughter]\nWell for those have you been wondering what goes on at US embassies around the world um here's a report from our embassy in Australia there an unknown number of people mistakenly received an email invite to a cat pajama party last week\nThe invitation featured a cat lying back on a couch in an electric blue cookie monster caution\nWith a plate of cookies on its ... fuzzy belly turns out it was a training error made by a new staff member testing out the embassies email newsletter platform and the embassy will be introducing quote strong new management control to ensure that there is no repeat of this high high level diplomatic gaff\nBut it appears that party has taken on a life of its own a New Zealand embassies among the ground we said no no no but I think it's actually the\nNew Zealand ah embassy to Australia and\nI thought oh okay oh helping there was there and go ... and I'm like okay so who's to say Scott Brown ... is the only the embassy\nIs among those who will tend to virtual on line celebration of the pajama a cat's part\n[laughter] All right very nice well for my ... I'm going to start with a question to both of you did you buy a mega millions ticket\nOne billion dollar jackpot I just wanted to point out and I'm told that tickets today are selling at a rate of three thousand dollars a minute or so in Monterey though you guys did you miss this decision making millions ticket\nI keep losing would lottery tickets but the biggest problem is that I forget to\nBuy them definitely lose that way\nI have a strange perspective on this I Want like a two million dollar lottery when so that I'm sort of below the radar I don't have all these hassles that come along with the world going after and try to scan your eye cycling I'd already kind of scares me a\n... yeah ... like the New Hampshire letter writing suit first and ask for anonymity for uh she would accept the jackpot well\nFor this I I actually the gas from my hubbub and I'm allowed to do that right so I have a shutdown math ... rights to help us understand the odds here because we're talking about three thousand tickets a minute being filled which we we found incredible so we asked George directly director the math resource center at ...\nTo come on the show and just to just for about a minute or so hello professor welcome to radio Boston\nI thank you very much so these mega millions a odds here are one in three hundred million or so that doesn't sound very good just briefly tell us what is the math behind those numbers suggest\nIt basically the math is a series of all the different combinations of the way you could draw the numbers and so you know there are probably some of the kids out there trying to put together groups and groups of people to try and capture every number on the hope of winning ...\nThink about how long it'll take to do\nRight sounds like an awful awful lot of work in a lot of money and they also actually\nI go to make it even harder for you for people to win a so the jackpot would get bigger so from a math perspective I'm Wondering like with those kinds of uh what's your advice here\nWell devices simple you're not likely to win\nAnd secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld led a commission to explore space space weapons and they recommended that the air force take a step to create a space culture rather than treated as secondary to air mission\nUm and I should note that right now the military's a space operations currently fall under the air force but of course this idea of its base for us would bring that entirely into its own separate branch so is this something that might really happen\nWell it's real and it's really happening at at least in some ways the Trump Administration is taking steps as I mentioned to get space force going\nI'm of course it's up to Congress to approve a new branch of military diminished rations hoping that happens by twenty twenty but really it it could take much longer for an official military branch called space for us to be created\nRight WB were busing them is reporters and enter into a mecca a link to her story is available at our website radio Boston dot org and injure thanks so much for coming in sure thing to [noise]\nIn case you missed it last night the Boston Red Sox won the American

thousands of spectators are expected to stand along the shore to cheer them on WB worth ... introduces us to the volunteers working behind the scenes [noise]\nRollers up and down the Charles are preparing for the race\nThey launched their boats before the sun is up without lights casting red and green on the bridges they pass in the dark\nHorse skim just above the surface before prying

head race meaning um each vote goes off one at a time\nCorny Wilson is one of two race directors for this year's forgot unlike Boston's other major race the Boston Marathon there is no purse or prize money for first place and the championship events for every race the prize is bragging rights and metal\nIt's such an iconic amazing event you know the rowing is is wonderful it's it's just it's beautiful\nIt's roller Christmas every Christmas Story needs a Santa Claus and at the head of the Charles that role is filled by volunteers nearly two thousand of them they're only five paid full time staff members\nSo the volunteers do most of the work managing almost every aspect of the race volunteer Karen lie organizes backup timing at the finish line\nDo you have what you need to be the clippings that we need to have you know computers tables chairs new stop all of a stop watches and he seemed to have their batteries been changed\nThe volunteer positions are coveted by both growers and ... and that makes that competitive to get a spot\nUnfortunately you know we do have to turn people away but it's it's it's so popular that\nRace officials estimate about forty percent of all applicants are turned away\nSome of the crunch is due to a need for specialized skills there are restrictions about who is eligible to run the starting line and volunteer umpires have to know the race rules but some of the demand is because of repeat volunteers John born has been volunteering for the majority of the races existence\nFor thirty eight\n... ...\nBorn is working on the dock team this year\nHe's helping her out of the groups of college students who built the extra docks needed to support the influx of folks on the river [noise]\nThe students drag heavy sections of doc sound the

jackets for caring lie he's been volunteering for ten years despite only wrong for one coming back to the point of pride it's hard to put\nWords but it's just one of those things that it's so Boston
