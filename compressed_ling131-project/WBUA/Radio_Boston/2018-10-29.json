hour condemning the attack\nThis atrocity was a chilling active mass murder was an act of hatred and above all it was an act of evil anti Semitism is a plagues of humanity and it is responsible for

difficult moment this is your community um he live only three blocks from tree of life can you give us a sense of how un people around you are are wrestling with this violence today\nWell people are here we are in the kind of a situation you're\nIn after a shocking to them that you're pushing through with lots of things to do in our case we perform our morning or during our service for work and so many others\nI never thought this could happen in my synagogue ever I just never thought it had reached this level that someone would begin to their own hands and make a decision that they needed to to murder Jewish ... [noise]\nWhat you make of the rights of white supremacy and neo Nazi is emerging in the country says [noise]\nThis is terribly frightening it's a terribly frightening time for all Jews but I think it's frightening time for all people\nWho know that when the election took place of President Trump people said now you know what it's like to live as a black person in the United states how it is to live with this with fear and with the kind of rhetoric that is so ugly frightening rhetoric [noise]\nSo [noise] yes when this happened of course what was on my mind was Charleston and the murder there and the black church and all the many black churches that have been burned down an arson attacks throughout this country\nI thought also bishop Romero murdered know solve the door the idea of killing people at worship is specially horrifying because we have a sense that we all want to live lives of dignity\nOne moment one moment when we're excused from anger from hatred and one moment when we can be vulnerable when we are at prayer\nPrayer is that place of refuge and which we have our full humanity so the attack as an attack on what it is to be a human being\n... I Want to go back to this idea that you were talking about earlier about\nThe difference in impact versus um intentions right and that it doesn't matter you say what the president intends to tape up what matters is the impact and we just heard at the top of this hour a strong statement from the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders condemning this act\nThe president also spoke out strongly against anti Semitism earlier I we we should remember his daughter is married to a Jewish man do you feel that the White House has responded appropriately\nTo issue a statement is a very easy thing to do it's like sending a birthday card to a an acquaintance or a friend\nThe issue is the friendship all year long not just the birthday card so fine the White House issued a statement condemning ... good for that\nThat's not the point the point is assuming responsibility and not just a hundred percent responsibility but even going beyond the minimum requirement and stopping this kind of language and we've heard it over and over again the vulgarity issued from this man this president\nNow let me also if I may make another point which is\nThere is no quid pro quo when it comes to anti Semitism we don't excuse one statement because we have something else under the table this hand it to us\nIn other words I heard in fact uh on on the radio this morning a man calling in and saying well President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel therefore he can't the anti Semitic and his daughter converted to Judaism and married a Jewish grandchildren Jewish so forth\nThat's not an excuse for anything there is no quid pro quo that is I don't care if you move the embassy to Jerusalem or didn't move and what I care about is a Jew shouldn't be murdered\n... ... [noise] you know you teach Jewish studies at Dartmouth College how will this change the way you teach how does this change the narrative of being Jewish in America\nThis changes the narrative entirely I must tell you that when I teach modern Jewish history and I talk about the drivers of fair in France and the pogroms in Russia and I talk about the rise of ... and the Holocaust\nAnd then I come to the United states and it's a different story the United states the place of refused I just says we are nothing like this could happen the difference the American difference although I've also tried an article by my colleague Tony Michaels in which he argues that in fact it's an ounce of different\nBut I have to say he's right it's not so different I Can't talk about it is different any longer\nAnswer Semitism isn't she kept from our shores we are not protected because we have oceans around us in the United states that's what's frightening and that will change and we have to understand that anti Semitism is not a product of a given country or a particular political movement\nIt can be taken up by any political movement left wing right wing it doesn't matter and used with such gruesome brutality that's what's shocking how veil of all it is so easily available\nMhm [noise] professor of Holocaust history at Emory University Deborah Lipstadt likened anti Semitism to a herpes infection that lights dormant and then re emerges that time the stress does that resonate for you\nYes it does I've thought about it is term I said you live in a house you don't even know you have termites and then you lift the [laughter] you open the door you lift a piece of wood and your base that and they're they are yes it's a kind of infection that can undermine the foundation of a society and that's what's important\nTo Santa Herschel thank you so much for joining us we appreciate your time thank you thank you [noise]\nAlso today us attorney general Jeff Sessions was in Boston talking about the future of religious liberty an event sponsored by the lawyers chapter of the federalist society WVU our senior political reporter Anthony Brooks was there an Anthony\nI gather the attorney general address the shooting at the tree of life synagogue over the weekend tell us what he said\nYes he did so sessions was here to talk about efforts by the Trump Administration to bring in when court cases and supportive religious freedom has very sorry and he said given what happened over the weekend just couldn't come at a more important time here's a bit of what he's we're still reeling\nToday from the murderers rampage in Pittsburgh to live I'll be loving congregants targeted because of their face worse you bring faithfully in their own senator this will not\nShe face it wasn't an attack on all people of faith sessions call this an attack on America's values and set it cannot and will not be tolerated so he more or less reiterated what the president said on Saturday when a President Trump called the attack pure evil\nSo Anthony session appearance was scheduled before the attack to talk about the future of religious freedom a and I understand she was confronted by some religious leaders here in Boston\nYeah and it was pretty dramatic I'm so just as sessions was beginning his remarks we'll green a Methodist minister from Andover who is in the audience stood up and confronted him reciting and then referring to verses from the Bible here's a bit of that confrontation\nWith a stranger and you know well I thank\nYou for your comments in a\nVenue does not fit for others yet as a fellow United Methodist\nCare for\nWell thank you for those remarks and attack but I Would just tell you we do our best every day I was going to fulfill my responsibility during force the laws of the United states\nNow is police escort administer green out of the room another minister a Baptist minister Darryl Hamilton stood up and continue to continue to protest you could hear people in the audience they're yelling to him go home he too was escorted out by the police so\nIt was an event for morning for Mr sessions in Boston but after that a disruption he was able to deliver his remarks\nSo give us a sense of what he had to say so sessions\nWas here to talk about what's really become a conservative rallying cry and or the way the Trump Administration phrases this is a commitment\nTo religious freedom he talked about the department of justice is religious freedom task force which sessions are established as part of an effort by the Trump Administration ... Dennis ... instances where religious freedom is under assault in their view and here's a bit of what sessions said\nWe've witnessed the ordeal still ongoing faced by uh the Colorado Baker who simply doesn't want the government to force him to create art that offense his religious beliefs why don't they just\nLeave him alone so this is a key example of what sessions talked about today in that case the Colorado civil rights commission had rules against the Baker saying he had discriminated against the gay couple but the Baker argue that it violated his religious rights to be forced to create\nThat cake for the gay couple and the case with all the way the Supreme Court which sided with the bakers and a session says this is the kind of case that his department of justice is committed to successfully prosecuted\nNow the alliance defending freedom was also a big part of this and then give us some context you is this\nRight so sessions was introduced by Jordan Lorence of the alliance defending freedom now this is a conservative Christian non profit group with the stated goal of advocating training and funding on the issues of religious freedom\nSanctity of life in marriage and family it's committed to the idea of religious liberty pro Trump in a big way but it's user also controversial the Southern Poverty Law Center for example has designated it as a hate group because among other things or it has supported efforts to re criminalize homosexuality\nThat said sessions made the point that this cause conservative defense of religious freedom is gaining traction\nYou know the best of modern baseball which is used analytics and all of the advanced metrics that we have to measure players skills and abilities with like the real old school baseball intuition that I think finding that\nHappy medium as something that Alex court does really well you know time and again\nThe players expressed how much they enjoyed playing for him\nAnd that's not just because he informs them with you know when you face this picture he's probably going to throw you a fastball first time out it's because he trust them to get the job done and he explains the decisions with you know with with metrics but also with with the right amount of um\nYou know sort of one on one attention that I think inspires confidence\nYeah his his agents ... called the correlate acts which is the term I one of the thing I think that matters the players is accountability and he's clearly a manager that believes and accountability\nUh after game for he was taking some criticism for not pulling the starter and water Rodriguez in the sixth inning Rodriguez ends up giving up a three run Homer put the Sox down four to nothing it it looks troublesome at that point a ... but he stepped up and said no that's my fault\nWe felt that my daughter was good for us but you know that might tell you it's good for us when Eddie is fresh and uh you know he's able to get past Marcy ready and uh I was I was a actually kicking myself for for a few minutes before the combat\nSo I I think that goes a long way he could have said we didn't execute on the pitch and steady says that's on me\nAnd I say you know and the um arts and culture editor here at the last I have to ask a question this way sell our critic at large at sea gulls that if he stayed that says if Shakespeare's the merchant of Venice celebrates the question of mercy Minnick orange red socks\nBasically you're saying really stood out to to talk radio ... to everyday fans who basically questioned his methods\nWhat do you think about that [laughter] yeah [laughter] we're talking about it you know I think\nThat for the first season he showed he has a real ability to both look at maps of look at the numbers which is such a big part of baseball in this modern era but also to know his players to know how to communicate to them and how to put them in the best buy succeed\nSo on the other side Dave Roberts the Dodgers manager has been taking a lot of heat for some of his decisions in this series do you blame\nFor the Dodgers last I I Can't criticize the two thousand for the steel ... just one [laughter]\n[noise] yeah I I uh I'm reluctant to criticize they've ah as well just because I think that in the end you know managers can inspire a certain amount of confidence and present analytics and whatnot but\nIn the end of the players were up at the plate with the bad and the players were out in the fields throwing the ball and catching the ball so\nYou know I think that there was you know the Dodgers were just over ... by a superior team of um you know players who who hit well players you fielded with a almost near impact ability will will leave JD Martinez out of that for now but um\nBut I just think that the that the Dodgers really a failed to perform uh granted they ran up against an excellent excellent baseball team that features the highest payroll in major league baseball\nBut uh but you know so so to put it all and the manager I think is is a unfair\nAll right well that's not happened sports editor for the Boston Globe Matt thanks for joining us thanks for having me and radio Boston's at Christmas Iraq
