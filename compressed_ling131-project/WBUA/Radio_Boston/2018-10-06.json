continued my studies that\nIt really dawned on me that what I was witnessing was child labor\n[noise] that's\nBenjamin Smith senior officers the child labor as the eye and the international Labour organization that prompted the un it's the driving force behind the international final child labor which it defines as [noise]\nWork that jeopardizes children's development in future\nAnd there are two parts to this one which spans what's known as the worst forms of child labor\nSlavery use of children in prostitution pornography these have children in illicit activities like drug trafficking and then hazardous work that jeopardizes the health and safety her morals of children\nThat's the unconscious ... the ban in almost two hundred countries have signed up to it wants to ... is the age at which children should be allowed to do what it isn't considered hazardous nice government typically to set the minimum age Fifteen or fourteen to some developing countries\nWhen the family needed

Fifteen hundred people and they're all looking at your story is mine bottling it was crazy that I was bringing awareness is something that I didn't even know was a problem\nAnd then that's when I realized that it was a problem in that way I was living was not the way everyone loved\nThat was the first time she had the tongue child labor and she realized it describes a that was seven years ago now she's made it to university where she's an activist on child labor campaigning in support of the ban\nI definitely feel like children shouldn't be able to work until the ages at least sixteen I think this is dangerous for the safety of these children in their education and I know there's a lot of people like me out there\nAre some people say well surely is rice if you'll if someone goes to school in just a couple of hours in the evenings or perhaps a couple of hours that we can to help get them income would not be All right [noise]\nUh [noise] it's different every debatable I Know these families want their children and worked to bring some income in but they're just hindering their education and I think that these families also need to find a different way to get around their situation\nDo you think you would have been able to go to school if you and your siblings hadn't worked\nOh absolutely my two younger sisters still live at home\nThey've never felt like they have to go out in the field to work and that's because you know my family moved on to a different type of job that provided more for us\nSo it sounds like you're saying it's almost as though you need to protect these children from bad choices they might make for the best reasons\nRight I feel like these children shouldn't feel obligated does that make sense [noise]\nWhen Philando was little she felt she have to work she felt responsible even at the age of seven\nShe says most should be done to lift that responsibility of the shoulder the children like huh\nAnd onto the parents to find another way

charity that says the ban on child labor isn't working\nThere is a lot of pressure in countries like mine to insist that easily Charlie but any more and more sick to such a leading export that is the idea is to say that these products of clean then not touched the hands of child labor\nBecause if that scene is connected with child labor they wouldn't get any money for them they wouldn't be able to sell them\nExactly we don't even acknowledge their presence\nSo when the authorities come across child labor as she says that instead of helping them they will live to dissipate in\nAnd you're just using the phone working the state's response is come in white ran put them in and take them will be to China's gate homes within locked up but you know one of the way from their families and the state cause the family\nBe seen like this again and when they're at least most of the children go back to work because of problems that drove them to work in the first place I haven't been solved\nAnd this is what could be threatened is organization comes in they meet child labor as an advantage is enough then that parents where they want\nSome talks about the whole meal they got factory some said they didn't get the support they need it at school others said they had to look out for the younger siblings so fetch water one of them had different reasons but they had one thing in common\nThey will not willing to transfer their burden on to the family for instance if they ... they would not give it to seeing that your mother fish water and you'd be in school because they were seeing my mother has a lot to do I really\nHave to find solutions that wouldn't put more pressure on that parents and so it could be threatened us charity tend to what's known as the chance India is local councils\nAnd a lot of the work of my organization has been to walk with these local governments which she lives in sitting with them and the solutions in one case can be as qualified for the child who has no money\nIt could be more funding for ... Ken so children don't have to the cost of the younger siblings\nAnd then other kids of each year for another child in other kids it can be getting electricity for house once we don't have it and that is how\nWe were able to create chai labels free communities in a country like India\nAnd by labor free and she doesn't mean these are communities where no children was what she means is that the work that doing no longer interferes with school like\nTwo boys and she says somewhat can be a good thing gets children useful skills and money for textbooks or school uniform about making sure they can choose the right kind of work to do that they create children's councils\nI give you an example is the religious we work with we talked to children and actually come onto the document called the work we can and cannot do for instance\nMilking the cows most of us might think it's OK harmless et cetera but these kids said if you're making what are called ... which are very temperamental and which are very happy kicking they said nobody should be doing it because it's hard for work it's dangerous\nInstead of lists drawn up by international organizations or central governments\nThey find out what the children want some like be exhausted by hours of household chores and besides to spend two hours working for a local shop others might choose factory work as a milking a temperamental Jersey cow it's down to them and it gives them a little control over their own lives\nBut can you really expect children to meet the right decision for themselves\nI'm yet to find a child who really wants to be exploited\nBut a child to perhaps continues to walk because they feel the pressure to help that family\nWe have to give that child that choice in fact this kind of walk actually increases our responsibility when they're working with\nChildren directly you don't let them take that one decision and then forgive them you're still in touch with them you're part of their life [noise]\nThan our children's council throughout find a little it's time consuming and expensive\nBut it's having results so is it time to rethink the ban on child labor [noise] the Iowa and the organization behind the global ban says no children under a certain age should never what\nWe heard about the unintended consequences children pushed into more dangerous was called looked up by the authorities it's debatable continue [noise]\nBut when you take a step back it's paid the deal like human isn't just about policy [noise]\nIt's about something real fundamental summer to key in the\nWest the child under a certain age who works is by definition being exploited others say a child should have the right to work\nAnd that's what makes it so hard to know what's right [noise]\nDancer doesn't lie in our definition of child labor it's about how we view childhood\n\n\n\nInquiry was presented by me having to marry him and and produced by best take offense and and if you want to listen to more episodes download our podcast such the b._b._c. the inquiry\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
