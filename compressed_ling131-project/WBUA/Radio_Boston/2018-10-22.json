thirteenth\n\nFrom Ninety nine WB you are this is a special broadcast of radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker ... Dale McCluskey from the Boston Globe it's now just about two weeks away from election day when Massachusetts voters will among other things decide three statewide ballot questions\nToday we brought you live our long debates on each of them today is our final debate and that is on question one\nA yes vote would establish nursed a patient ratios in Massachusetts limiting how many patients could be assigned to each registered nurse at hospitals and certain other health care facilities a no vote would mean no changes on both sides of this\nDebate there's a lot of money those in favor have raised about nine million dollars those opposed about twelve million today on radio Boston we hear from both sides on question one our debate is brought you buy WB you are the McCormack graduate school at UMass Boston\nAnd the Boston Globe we're also airing today a New England public radio and you can watch a Facebook Live video of this debate at our website radio Boston dot org or Boston Globe dot com before we hear from our gas and take your calls we want to introduce some of the issues in the debate over question want\nSome hospital units already staff act or better than the nurse to patient ratio spelled out in the ballot question\nWB or as Americans even visited what visited one of those hospitals to see what that looks like how things might change if question on passes\nAnd whether more nurses make a difference\nThere are twenty seven ... in a unit called white seven at Massachusetts General hospital\nOur main focus is a surgical patients abdominal surgery it's mostly and any type of trauma that comes through\nWhen Britain opinion only a staff nurse arrives around seven am on a typical day she gets her patient assignment finds a spare computer and logs in [noise]\nAnd I have to classify each patient according to how many times I take the vital signs drains they have if they have emotional needs and each time I click one of those buttons my patient gets classified according to a certain number of the higher the number of them are too fast\nAnd the more time than he was a nurse not all hospitals in Massachusetts use a program like this to assess patients but they would all be required to if question one passes at Mass General nurses click more buttons if a patient needs to be watched constantly or on click buttons as they improve\nAnd as their patients' needs change to recent capital dilute ... the nursing director Ron White seven adjust the nurses assignments\nSo we do that type of a exchange every single day every ... minutes pretty much minute to minute anytime\nPatient outcomes let's get into the specifics of this why and what exactly it would mandate\nFor the typical medical or surgical patients the law sets a limit of for patients to a nurse in emergency rooms the limit would be a max of five patients to er nurse the limit for psychiatric units would also be five patients to a nurse so Donna how are these limits sucked into the question and why [noise] so the\nThe limit for actually using the professional standards of the organizations um one that you didn't mention was actually a a one standards which govern the staffing guidelines for labor and delivery and maternity care\nAnd that's exactly where we got those limits from we looked at all of the research that showed ... including Dr Linda akin study who when she studied the medical surgical patients the reason that it is one of four\nAh with the flexibility what the acuity tool to actually for medical surgical enough to take less patience\nIs because when you go above that limit when and medical surgical patients uh five is a science\nThe beginning of the medical medical problems seven percent of an increase of medication errors medical complications happened with the fifth patient and every subsequent patients after that\nCompounds the increased risk to that patients so we've done our homework on this and looking at California what they did we look to the most recent research and actually modified hours to be more consistent with the fact that patients are sick or in the hospital now than they've ever been\nNancy or any of these numbers written into the ballot question or any of those numbers palatable to your side\nSo I Would say that the biggest issue with a valid question is the rigidity of these numbers um they're the research that Donald was quoting is all based on average is in every single case people do not look at the ratio of nurse to patients and the reason is because that ratio when it is that fixed and when it is that rigid has\nHas limitations for that and there's to be able to use her professional judgment to be able to work with the physicians to decide to take another patient and her assignments and\nI think when we look across the board at the emergency department for example your sample of one to five the emergency department requirements and the law are one to one first for the most critical patients want to if the patient needs care between Fifteen minutes and an hour one two three for one to two it's\nIt's it's so rigid and it would mean an emergency department that a nurse even if she was ready to take another patient from the waiting area she wouldn't be able to do it because this this law would keep her from using her judgment\nSo I'd like to follow up on something Nancy just said you you mentioned averages about ... on this question is written for at all times so why was it written that way why not use an average why why do you need the same number of nurses at night is you do during the\nDay so I I think that's a great question but having been a nightmare so my entire career I can tell you that nighttime is a critical time for patience because even though we would like patients to be able to get adequate rest at nighttime that's even more critical time for nurses to be able to assess\nThe patients stability and that clinical status at that time because what will you have to do that while they're sleeping to make sure that you are covering all of the assessments that you need to do to make sure that your patient is the safest\nAnd I don't think there's any secret that patients are in the hospital and out of the hospital as quickly as they possibly can be so patients that would have had that extra day perhaps to be assessed in a different way\nYou've already home so we have a very short period of time to do all the work that's required to ensure successful recovery and when\nWe hear about you know almost a billion dollars a year I'm just wondering uh Nancy your\nResponse first in ... do you know would that would that not be passed on\nTo to consumers patients here are insurers so Nancy first\nI mean I don't I think we've all um thought about this a lot there's no question that um that a billion dollars is a great deal of money to add to um Massachusetts health care we already have twenty five percent of the hospitals that are in the red it would cause another twenty five percent so full half of the hospitals\nIn Massachusetts would um would be running in the red it's not sustainable the community hospitals are very nervous about what this means for their for their ability to stay open to do with programs that they want to do\nA billion dollars would definitely be passed on to consumers and again what are we trying to solve for we have excellent hospitals in Massachusetts and with the best in the country excellent outcome and um I think there's\nThere's no question that billion dollars is um is money that is not well then I'd love to respond to the I mean the as you know hospitals enough corporations and they this is a twenty eight billion dollar industry right now hospitals make choices about where they're going to put their resources\nAnd our position is those resources need to first began with a patient to be sure that the patient has all of the necessary\nResources available to them the safest nursing care possible when they're in the hospital\nThat is what this ballot question is all about is to ensure that the the health care dollars that are intended for patients are spent on patients\nNot spent on corporate buying of other facilities outside of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts outside outside of the the country for that matter we have corporations that are buying up facilities in Malta in China and opening up there were saying the health care dollars to Massachusetts should remain at the bedside of the hospital's patients in Massachusetts\nI Want to make sure we get some of our callers that it was before we go to a break Ben is calling from Arlington Ben you're on the air\nVoted but it's the truth to where the other side there is that this may make it actually was issued included editor she's I've said this is a vision in [noise]\n... ah thanks very much for your call Nancy what what are your thoughts about that I mean could this\n[noise] you know I have to be honest I've been focusing on um what what exactly it means to put a question like this in front of the voters I think it is a big responsibility to write a ballot question and you have to consider all the different pieces of it um\nThis ballot question the way it's written um has so many unintended consequences we are literally trying to imagine how we would hold onto the fragile gains is made in substance use disorder and mental health\nThe dollars that would be shifted to um to me these ratios of worry me on so many friends um I don't know if it would lend itself to I guess a broader um\nYou know a broader implementation in other professions but I think it would worry me just as much um there is no there is no answer where rigid ratios are ever the right way for professionals to make decisions\nOkay we're gonna have to figure out a time Donna I'm going to give you just a couple of seconds\nFor the safety of the patient if the research showed that other um areas also needed to have limits put in place absolutely there should be and just as in Massachusetts we're looking at safe patient limits for patients were not alone in Massachusetts are surrounding states are also looking to do this other countries that doing this right now\nAnd everyone in the nursing profession is looking at what is the safest way to care for patients okay\nWe're talking with John Kelly Williams and Nancy gained about question one in Massachusetts a valid question that would have ... nurse to a patient ratios at hospitals\nYou can join in by calling us an eight hundred for two three eight to five

would mandate nursed a patient ratios that hospitals and we have both sides in the studio to talk about this\nDown to Kelly Williams is president of the Massachusetts nurses association she represents the yes side on question one Nancy ... is with us as well the chief nursing officer at Boston medical center and she represents a no\nOn question one and listeners on WB you are in New England Public radio and viewers on Facebook Live a reminder that we want to hear from you as well what do you make of this ballot question are you concerned about safety or costs are what questions do you have\nOK lives here we'll let you respond to that yeah I mean I think I'm calling this as hospitals administrators against nurses is just patently untrue um you pointed out that the view our globe um\nPoll showed that nurses are split\nUm nurses that I talk to every day the more they understand the unintended consequences the more they are voting no um but I Will also tell you that every professional nursing organization and Massachusetts including the emergency nurses association\nAnd the med surge nurses association and the American nurses association for Massachusetts in the end for using their society and there's several others and every health care organization that is taking care of patients including the home care alliance of Massachusetts hospice and palliative care Massachusetts ambulance association mental health medical society they're all know on one\nEverybody giving care to patients across the state is no on one\nOkay yes please I mean ... that's so first of all\nThe nurses that wrote the ballot question when members of the Massachusetts nurses association they voted on this when you refer to the emergency nurses association seven and nine of the people that voted for the emergency nurses association or hospital executives that voted on that\nAnd they had to put a disclaimer out about the fact that their membership did not agree with the vote of the members of the executive board so when we talk about who's supporting this question an see\nThere are over ... million people that are supporting this all you have to do is look at the almost three hundred and ... that we have received from people that are concerned and that have heard us over and over and over again saying there is a problem in hospitals with the erosion of nursing care that's being provided to patients\nAnd we need to have a safe limit in place that is why we need people to vote yes on question one okay I Know that\nRest of the show here but I Want to make sure we get into a just a quick question from our audience here Jane has posed a question on Facebook and wants to know how this question might affect the poorest patience and Massachusetts and Nancy the I think that you might be able to answer the question what would you say to Jane who's asking this on Facebook\nI mean I I really appreciate the question and I think one of the reasons that Boston medical center has been so outspoken about are concerned about question one is because we take care of the most vulnerable patients in Massachusetts and um we we know that those patients will be um at the most risk\nTheir ah the fragile gain we've made 'em in substance use disorder and mental health care in Massachusetts art risk with this without question\nI'm Paul had us and John Macdonald from the commonwealth magazine a said that the evidence that our policy choice and more socially just result points to know on one and that is absolutely how I feel I feel the social justice is no\nOkay well

down McCluskey Massachusetts voters soon we'll be faced with a choice establish nursed a patient ratios limited how many patients can be assigned to each nurse in Massachusetts hospital or\nLeave the current system in place we're both sides in the studio to talk about this supporting question one done to Kelly Williams president of the Massachusetts nurses association opposing\nIs Nancy gate and she's chief nursing officer at Boston medical center and listeners on WB you are and at New England public radio and viewers on Facebook Live a reminder that we want to hear from you during this hour what do you make of this ballot question you can call us at eight hundred\nFor two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk you can also tweet us at radio Boston and ask questions of the folks we haven't studio\nLet's talk about California which is the only state to have as similar nurse staffing law but there's a major differences between California's law and the one proposed for Massachusetts one that's often cited as the implementation timeline California's law had a five year fees and\nWhereas this ballot question is so much quicker it would go into effect January first Don why is there such a quick implementation on that first of all the seriousness\nOf what's going on in hospitals actually make this a very serious issue but going back to the implementation date is anyone knows that when you do a ballot question you have to have an an actual date to the law is in effect\nHowever it's really up to the health policy commission how fast all of the implementation is done\nAnd following that implementation\nUm and the standards that are approved by the department of public health including the acuity tool that was referenced at the beginning part of the shell all of those things has to have to be in place there's no automatic fine set up on January first in the sky is not going to fall\nOn January first about what will happen is is that plans will have to be fought for\nThey'll have to go through the health policy commission and then they'll have to be enforcement regulation which that will be up to the attorney general so there are a number of things that have to be in place and having done the ICU law I can tell you that it will take some time [noise]\nNancy your response I'm not a lawyer but the um the ballot question is very ... a specific around this it says that Massachusetts health policy commission um may not delay um or modify the requirements set forth and it does say that it starts January first [laughter]\nSo when do you think it might go into effect then how long would it take so it really\nIs dependent on the health policy commission but they do have the experience of the intensive care unit law that we worked with\nAnd hospitals like Mass General that you heard at the beginning of the show already half and acuity tool that's in place um and may be used as a resource and again um I Know that we are going to be talking about California and how that worked in California\nUm but we've had we've been talking about this for Twenty years this is not a surprise to hospitals that this has been identified as an issue um and it wouldn't it should not take any hospital that long to get to where they need to be [noise]\nIf California is the example that you cite Donna\nI'm wire the limits proposed for Massachusetts so different they're much stricter for example for the typical medical or surgical patient the ratio in California is five patients to a nurse but in Massachusetts You're proposing for patients to a nurse and also the penalties in Massachusetts would be more strict so two points\nThere first of all having been a nurse for as long as I have I can tell you that a lot has changed at the bedside of patients over the last\nTwenty years patients are sicker than they've ever been and that was the need for changing and really looking at real time research about what is going on in the hospital facilities so that is why we had that important\nUpdate to the uh the numbers in the ballot question they're based on the latest research the guidelines from the most um\nAn important standardization of staffing in hospitals based on\nThe specialty area that a patient may find themselves in whether it's in the maternity you know do the medical surgical unit all of that is based on the latest research and as far as the fine goes\nThat's an enforcement and his never meant to be punitive but it was actually at the suggestion of the legislature when we went for for the I ... in ... province back to them concerning the fact that not all hospitals stunts that they have to follow the law\nAnd and we were instructed by then to make sure that we had enforcement language in it\nOkay let's let's talk a little bit about California and our listeners want to weigh in on this as well Claire is calling from Martha's Vineyard clear who lives in beautiful places in the U. S. you're on the air [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radio Boston", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "22"}
