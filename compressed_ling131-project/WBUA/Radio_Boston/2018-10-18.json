been there at the greater Boston chamber of commerce this morning\nIt costs for sixty seven acres of new space in a hundred and twenty two acres of revitalize open space on the waterfront it links to our emerald necklaces and reflects the same values of public health public access in world class design it's invasion of a city more connected to our waterfront into each other\nAnd marijuana is now on the line with us to tell us not to tell us more Mr marijuana nectar radio Boston Thanks for having me today so this planet you outlined to the chamber of commerce today involves sixty seven acres of states along the shoreline\nYeah uh yeah it really is about creating a new neighborhood level plans covering the ... entire\nShoreline that we have here in in the city of Boston ah we released a climber a sub Boston a that's a plan to look at the Marshall waterfront are we today we also putting on two new our piece for climate ready to western climber already downtown uh each area has really projects that need to be completed a some of them have\nI've forgotten some oppose\nAnd it really is looking at looking at how do we um how do we handle what we've seen around the country whether it's been Superstorm Sandy a Hurricane Harvey Hurricane Maria Florence Michael I'm\nUm those are the storms that have have devastated parts of America and and you know caused debts and billions of dollars in damage and [noise]\nA ... ... those cities being better better positions\nMhm they just got a little bit of what the plan would include some of the big parts of that\nOr I mean there's a lot of them a big ... for example we're looking at areas the plan that that we're making capital investments in the city of Boston like in the north end a with a lingo and pull a park\nOr what we're doing that park over by raising that park up allows us the opportunity to create almost like a barrier it's open space that space that's going to be green space and it's an opportunity for us to\nNot just build a new fields for the kids and and people to play on but it's also an opportunity to to have a resiliency and protect\nProtect the north end a Martin Richard Park down in the full point channel ah were were installing a opportunities down there as well as we do that park over\nA in a along with the full point channel part of that will preserve sea level rise in the ... channel will protect the areas like south Boston and in in Dorchester and the back pay and then in other parts of our city that would be flooded if if if if and when the the floods and they see love arises\nWe're on a flooding from incremental sea level rise\nAs the water just go higher 'cause the tides go higher and doesn't solve that problem into solve that problem you'd have to close the whole harbor off and I just like really really doesn't work\n[laughter] so I'm no harbor barrier that's out but what about other concerns were their concerns from the fact of life\nAs the mayor explained this is a really vicious project it's a far reaching strategy right so there's lots of moving pieces this posed up those pieces altogether and he said Boston as an island there are cities and commute up and down the coast that need to get involved and\nThat raises some very very basic questions I talk to each tore she's the director of sustainability program is a better city it's a membership organization of a I think something like a hundred and thirty large Boston businesses and they came together over the big dig\nThings that I\nAnd for the\nHad ever read generally not safe\nWhat happened in ... that's what I'm waiting to be asked\nHim what about the money there is no clear price tag on that is the mayor just tell ... than a you know he is going to look to the business community for some money here people are on board with the way that this will be financed\nWell there's a lot of pieces as he ... and it's over long periods of time uh and it's going to you know there's inflation to count for and the costs money to account for\nSo he's he's probably right not to put a price tag on it because there's so many moving pieces um so it's incremental he is going to dedicate as you said this is the capital fund his ten percent of the year it's about Fifteen to twenty million dollars a year just got the two hundred and thirty two in the bank already\nUh but yeah people are gonna have to give his can be philanthropies gonna have to kick in private companies nonprofits gonna have to kick in it's going to take and then the state and the feds and the fence you're going to be very reluctant but as the ... you know as a mayor said you know you're painting our pay me later it's the cost of doing nothing against climate change\nThat's unacceptable ... how much is going to cost\nTo bail out into you know to drain the the big dig into tunnels that they've flood or what happens next year but [noise] well the the the mayor's in sales mode you know he's got to sell his vision that he's generated bugs definitely ... uh as I said I think they were his speech was very well received\nBut he you know he's got to figure out how to keep the sustain them the momentum\nAnd WB ... thanks so much for

[noise]\n\nThat the same from the movie crazy Rich Asians and I'm Wondering is this the turning point for Asian American actors and so\nVery optimistic because we have a lot more I'm seeing a lot more interesting Asian American filmmaker\nThere's interest um it's it's very exciting\nBut you know it seems like it's almost similar here with crazy Rich Asians very high expectations in some criticism their butts Singapore and the portrayal of of Asian Americans from Singapore I mean\nYou know it seems like maybe film Asian American films are still trying to find their footing here when it comes to Hollywood right right but but we're you know as long as we're making headway\nWe've never seen a more disruptive force in Washington and this president and this administration but I think what gives me a lot of optimism is that these midterms are the change that follow and\nUh and I do think that there's an opportunity to break the gridlock to\nTo change business as usual I mean when you have this many people across the country who have never run before never thought of running before frankly\nAll going to Washington at the same time I I think that that new breed of leader ah the freshness a will help you know stir things up and and maybe change\nOr those that partisan politics that we're seeing right now\nThat you know you've you've I Believe them described maybe described yourself a been described oh for sure as a\nPragmatic progressive what does that mean to you\n[noise] I really want to be effective uh I really want to get things done a I have um [noise]\nYou know I embrace of bold vision of where our country needs to go um but I also I think that there's an opportunity after these midterms to really hear uh the\nUm the country and the plight of working class families and roll up our sleeves and get things done\nSo uh you know while protecting I I was just yesterday in Lawrence with leader Pelosi and congresswoman Clark and congresswoman Tsongas so we're talking about the importance of protecting\nA people who have pre existing conditions and their security and having insurance coverage I mean we that's under attack and ah the pragmatic side of me is you know we have to have a bold vision for transparent transforming our healthcare system but in the meantime I mean we have to\nWe have to really safeguard those principles and die in the dignity that the CIA gave so many people are people like my dad who have a ... who has multiple sclerosis and I really did live in fear that his insurance would be taken away\nAnd we have to build on that and we have to improve I mean the reality is premiums are too high prescription drug costs are too high and\nThen what do you tell the people in your district to blame the SEA\nFor that [noise] well you know I don't think that the uh\nThe high cost of prescription drugs um it was it was something that I think the CIA was going to come back in and address a and it didn't write because right after its passage we were you know defending and protecting and it was slowly getting dismantled\nAh by the Republicans in Congress and so the opportunity to get back to the table and figure out how we add transparency to prescription drug pricing how we enforce price gouging how we make it more affordable um for those you know medicines that people need a is an important next step [noise]\nNow you mentioned Nancy Pelosi who was here a earlier this week it hosted a fundraiser with Nancy Pelosi ah I I Wonder if you were elected\nWould you support her as as a leader and the\nYou know I Do get this question quite a bit uh and so I first have to say because I'm I've admired her career a sheet of the first woman speaker of the house or what she's done for women and for working class families is a is really a model I think a lot of uh a lot of us could have merely\nUm but right now I Am one hundred percent focused on getting elected you know someone reminded me the other day that you know the primary was was long and hard fought a you know I was the last named ... democratic nominee and the country [laughter] so [noise]\nYou know these weeks have been really spent like getting ready for the November six election but I'll I I look forward to having to making a decision and having those conversations about the leadership of the party after I\nJust haven't made that decision white yet okay well let's talk about policy a little bit ah we spoke with a year Republican challenger red green on the show earlier this week and we we asked him to outline his views on some issues he told us he is opposed to sanctuary cities and he supports greater border security\nAnd he said this about a background checks and gun ... gun legislation less listen\nI'm a supporter of the bill of rights which includes the tenth amendment which is you know states rights one size fits all coming out to D.C to me is usually the wrong answer\nMassachusetts has our laws and the people of Massachusetts are very happy with them at the same time we wouldn't want to live under the laws of say Wyoming or Texas but also to understand that the people of Wyoming in Texas may not want to live under our laws\nOkay so I Wonder Lori Drew hand what about you on background checks on gun legislation\nYep this is a this is the point uh\nThat we just disagree on uh I Do believe in universal background checks I mean I think that's the place where we could actually come together as a country ah Republicans and Democrats uh to solve a problem that is you know facing our country they sing our our our kids\nUh you know there is no reason why we shouldn't be\nOr we're not selling a gun to somebody who could hurt themselves or hurt someone else and frankly you know there's people who who aren't clear to fly airplanes should not be able to own a gun or you know I think he's um [noise] uh\nI don't think that this is a state issue I think this is something that we have to take up on the federal level and that and I think it's important\nAnother issue in the district sanctuary cities learning a stand on those are ... opposed to facts or is it is\nYeah you know I think this is a decision a for\nUm for for a community for individual communities I've known mayor Dan Rivera ... mayor ah who I used to work with and uh you know the other night we had a debate and uh my opponent came down really hard on the city of Lawrence and reference to\nOffense in all of us that happened in the city uh this notion that NATO Rivera is not cooperating\nAh when those um when those buses happen it's just it's wrong I mean he says uh in invested in bringing you know violent criminals to justice as anyone and so I think that um you know this\nFear mongering around a\nUm [noise] you know central trafficking targeting communities of color this is this is where him and I don't see eye to eye\nThe role of Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform that is our job it's our laws are outdated\nThis is an area where senators Kennedy and Senator McCain actually found a way to work together and pass a bill that not only strengthened our borders but also a you know address some of the problems with uh with our immigration system are acceptance criteria evaluating\nYou know how we seek of how we evaluate asylum seekers\nAre updating our visa program so takes into account or skills gap in our American workers\nThat is the role of Congress and that's the kind of productive conversation we should be having\nSo you would support a city that would be a sanctuary city would you say that you would support a city's uh ability to declare itself effects for you\nI I Believe right now that what uh\nI'm Lawrence may over there is doing is protecting non violent undocumented immigrants who are\nGoing to the are empty and without notice getting picked up and separated from their family for really you know no reason when he's not doing is uh is you know allowing violent criminals to to live in a city so you know I ah\nAh what's right for Lawrence might not be right for low and I respect that that decision should be kept with local law enforcement and local officials\nThe opioid epidemic which has been an issue everywhere now there was a bill or actually there was bipartisan agreement in Congress ... very recently what\nOther things do you think that federal lawmakers need to do to address the opioid epidemic or what would you like to try to work on regarding that issue that I have a specific plan at this point or not yeah\nNo absolutely I mean you can't travel a far in this district and not be confronted with a heartbreaking story a and the reality is cities like lower Lawrence and have are are just proportionately impacted by this epidemic and\nYou know certainly I think we need more funding we need more federal resources I mean the bill that was passed that um you know funded a were medically assisted treatment more comprehensive ... it's a start but\nWe have to make mark and more available I mean we have to keep people alive uh\nWe we do have to put more funding behind medically assisted trick treatment if there's anything I've learned this is not something you beach with willpower alone or the recovery is long I'm so not only do we\nHave to have a long term approach a but we have to give people the skills that they need to get back on their feet reunited with their families into a good paying job so that we decreased Sally relapse rate [noise]\nAh the third district includes ah some of the communities affected by the Columbia carrier explosion and that over pressure resignation or if you were elected what do you think Congress what would you what Congress or try to get Congress to do for the affected communities\nYes up for your first and foremost I think we have to uh we have to see what the investigation surfaces or you know there are too many questions right now around how this happened how we maintain our our pipelines how we prevent this from ever happening again\nUh you know I I Do ...\nMindful right now that uh what needs to be done is we have to accelerate this timeline or for people to get their gas turned back on because the reality is on Thursday night I think I read the temperatures going up to twenty three degrees I mean how many people need to be real relocated very quickly\nW.

and debate question to\nThe ballot initiative will ask voters to approve or reject the creation of us citizens commission that were proposed among other things\nAmendments to the U.S constitution to overturn Citizens United\nThe landmark Supreme Court decision open the floodgates on campaign money by ruling that political spending by corporations and unions is protected just like speech under the first amendment a yes vote on question too would create the commission a no vote would reject a commission\nToday advocates on both sides of question to join us for a debate brought you buy W the war the UMass Boston McCormack graduate school of policy and global studies in the Boston Globe\nAnd listeners we are going to be asking you to join the conversation as well you can make you can join that by giving us a call one eight hundred for two three eight to five five one eight hundred for two three talk and\nJames good to have you here let's talk briefly about question to what it would actually do if approved it seems like it's mostly about restarting a debate rather than actually amending the U.S constitution because of course one state can't do that on its own\nThat's right I think context matters here so voters in four states have already passed\nNon binding resolution saying they want a constitutional amendment overturned Citizens United but what's different about this question in Massachusetts is that it goes a step further this will actually for me volunteer commission that has actual deadlines to move the debate\nAlong including researching issue and coming up with proposed proposed language for a constitutional amendment or ... minutes\nThat the state legislature or then Congress can vote on that yes of courting you know to amend the constitution it's a long and complicated process\nIt can be proposed by either the Congress with a two thirds majority in both the house and the Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by two thirds of the state legislators so yes a vote unquestioned to would be a first step on that long process and advocates for this ballot question say\nThey thinking and then that could pass in eight years but a quick reminder our last constitutional and then it took two hundred and two years\nOkay so it's all that in mind let's hear from WB or reporter Quincy Walters who has a little background on the debate

Citizens United but\nThat is a a a a a big increase over the twenty four team at terms and we're expecting to a ... at this stage of the midterms and we're expecting the total number to be much greater\nAnd and who knows and and twenty twenty it will be interesting I think we're sort of at a um\nA a a a an inflection point as far as this dynamic that I talked about where the ease of raising small do a small dollar a contribution is on line and this sort of\nBoost that you get rhetorically by being able to say that you are the candidate of small money running against candidates who are beholden to major donors\nDemocrats ... Democrats in particular entering twenty twenty or have a decision to make as to how they're going to run their campaigns and whether they're going to do this preparatory work of cultivating major donors on running a campaign that is dependent on early supplemented significantly by a superPAC or whether\nThat will go a lot further towards determining whether the you know how significant the role of big money in our politics is as opposed to any legal changes or any changes like that which could eventually be er which could eventually result from the proposition that you guys are not talking about a Massachusetts\nPretend this is James ... again a step back and get some context on just on the headlines here but the narrative arc let's start with you for just just to get people to get their head around were at in this moment let's start with Nineteen Seventy one the federal election campaign act which of course was later updated after Watergate in Nineteen Seventy four\nWhere weeds in where did we do with McCain Feingold and we're we now\nIs that uh the the ... federal election campaign act a was a reaction to a lot a lot of these changes by the way our reactions to scandals or a campaign financing scandals or a political corruption scandal\nAnd so Watergate are spurred a lot of the amendments to seek a\nAnd some of the the sort of um uh most significant ones were limiting the types of money that are putting limits on how much individuals parties and political committees could give to campaigns and also creating this public financing system\nThat campaigns up until President Bush\nUsed to sort of supplement their fundraising\nEnemy to interrupt you but you don't over overstepped the importance of ... maybe you can talk briefly what that meant in terms of the context of the conversation today\n... a Supreme Court decision that basically ruled that money is speech and political spending is speech and so\nThat has been the framework under which all these attempts at reform have had to sort of a a huge themselves too and not and avoid overstepping so you\nKnow what what are the Watergate era forms did was limit a lot of the types of money that could be raised but they importantly left this what is known as soft money avenue in place and not allow political parties to accept unlimited funds from corporations individuals\nEven a labor unions for what was what was sort of euphemistic leading\nParty building activities but will we saw was parties increasingly relying on that to do all manner of things sort of in the same\nWay that super PACs are sort of expanded beyond what they were originally envision this soft money became a critical part\nOf a political fundraising to the point where an account for five point two billion dollars worth of the money raised by a political parties between that Watergate between the guy and a two thousand two when we saw a McCain fined gold\nOr the a bipartisan campaign reform act passed in two thousand two as a reaction to again scandals Clinton fundraising scandals where he was\nA um accused of sort of renting out the Lincoln Bedroom to major donors in exchange for soft money contributions to the Democratic National Committee and even to an extent\nThe uh the corporate accounting scandals around Enron uh and and uh WorldCom which ah we had a political fundraising component to them as well\nSo what McCain Feingold tried to do was cut off\nThat soft money a flow and ... as early as ... as sort of a reaction to it we saw some of this big money going instead of going to the party's\nGoing to these outside groups in a way that really weaken the parties and so with Citizens United that was sort of further that by allowing this this big money that was going to these outside groups to be used in even more ways\nAnd really diminishing the power of parties further more recently and twenty fourteen there was another Supreme Court decision in a case called McCutcheon versus federal election commission that allowed a more giving to some of the hard money\nGroups including the parties and campaign in a way that many people predicted would be used as sort of re empower the parties we've seen a little bit of that but certainly big money flowing to these outside groups is still a major factor in our campaign\nSo can in fact I mean to return to Citizens United you mentioned McCain Feingold of course citizen United targeted any ... particular provision McCain final right\nYeah that's right I mean it was it was a you know the the uh what what the restriction on how these outside groups could spend their money and run by doing away with that it really allow for these outside groups to become much more powerful and much more useful to political operatives\nKenneth our time is winding down literally in sort of ten seconds we have left the ultimate goal is our question is a constitutional amendment do you think there's appetite out there across the country for a serious campaign finance campaign finance or for\nYou know it's always one of those issues that voters will tell pollsters that they care about and sometimes they will even become a major issue in a campaign\nOr go to the ballot box it fall somewhere far below the issues that of a you know the economy and their own pocket book and healthcare and eating questions of war and peace\nAnd so it's hard to pass something like that it's particularly I think it is easier to do it through the ballot box because you are not a thing as an adamant that a turtle of trying to get members of Congress\nTo change the system or elected officials at any level to change the system that is clearly worked for them because they're in office adding navigated that system so that are real fundamental impediment the ballot box or a route is is you know in many ways that it could tap into public sentiment but obviously very high hurdle of as a constitutional\nAmendment well candidates

with us after a short break coming up we're going to hear from both sides of question too in a special lived evade and you can join the conversation as well do you think we have a problem with money

WB you are the Boston Globe and the UMass Boston McCormack graduate school policy and global studies were also airing on New England public radio I'm WBRC Anthony Brooks\nAnd I'm the\nGyms to know from the Boston Globe and uh we're we're talking about ballot question to which asks voters whether the state should create a citizens commission that would research and recommend a constitutional amendment dealing with campaign finance reform of before we jump in\nHere the ground rules I guess we'll have one minute to respond to the question followed by one minute a bottle we the moderators that's James me will be able to ask follow up questions to both candidates and our discretion we have a light here in Studio ... uh to keep time Greene means you're on\nMassachusetts first limited campaign contributions in Nineteen oh seven the Tillman act prohibited corporations from spending money in federal elections in Ninety seven unions were not allowed to spend money on elections in Nineteen forty eight only in Nineteen Seventy six\nDid the idea that money is the same as free speech get created and we've had an activist court\nFabricate rights for corporations and money at the expense of the people in our democracy so this amendment actually does the court a favor they've gone back and forth in these five four decisions\nFirst saying one thing then saying and other than Citizens United just knocking bulldozing the laws that protect it our democracy down so the amendment will actually clear up things poker in your response ah I\nI appreciate that Jeff can recognize that he thinks certain people in power at the Supreme Court may have gotten some decisions wrong\nBut if you were to say here and actually think comparing a bunch of state lawmakers who have a history of restricting speech for opposing views and opposition will not be much worse than a I have something to share the that's not the way campaign finance runs in the state\nVery often there's a lot of people that have good intentions but to use it as a weapon to sound speech and unfortunately what we're trying to do is if you vote yes on question to you or empowering people whose only job is self preservation or no offense but they're only job is to win elections\nTo craft your speech as the public into restricted and a time effort time they've actually failed at that I'm pretty badly\n... uh oh to follow up quickly we're winning it all out of time on this particular segment I Want to own it gets ... a follow up question on\nWell you mentioned about winning the lottery and spending that money however you want to spend it on a on a political cause isn't there something different and then gets with a lot of people are seeing right now is there something different to wean you as an individual spending that money and then a made up ...\nAn election spending that money with it donors we just don't even know who's involved there isn't there a difference there that your name you win the lottery you're going to put your pet issue up their versus a nameless cooperation with nameless donors\nWell that was kind of a joke that was you know obviously I don't want is a very important things you know but James okay so you're you're trying to make that distinction of you know big corporations\nWho are not individual and invented one for the purpose of an election okay well that's that's very few and far between I think that's kind of highly regulated at this point but for the most part let's just use the example of a corporation WPRI any other corporation American promised the group that Jeff works for which is a nonprofit corporation\nOr it's made up of individuals' WB are gifted WB are\nAh there's other for profit corporations the corporation is a pretty broad term\nSo it's very important to know the difference you know ingest case his corporations and nonprofit made up of individuals and corporations who donated his group in in this case he's uses nonprofit to fund his belt question um and there's nothing wrong with that that's his freedom to use his nonprofit corporation to fund about question and that's one of the beauties of citizen is that\nThey're able to give more freedom to entities like that but to your point of other corporations like Exxon or whatever you want to name\nUm they actually do have some rights I'm you know I Can't as an individual go up to Exxon or any big port corporation and say hey you know what I Want to list of all your customers on what your financial they have rights because like the government\nCan't by looking at the time so we have to get we have let us in the middle of doing it I Would like to respond to\nThat in the first of all and American promise we have thousands of donors average donation about thirty six box and those are people you can go to the website look up um how was American promise funded see who those donors aren't we believe in disclosure ah people governed out money the ballot committed all ... all the contributions are disclosed\nNow let's talk about politicians or if you want to empower people not politicians vote yes on to the incumbency a power to raise money since Citizens United is so high forty percent of state legislative districts in this country are uncontested now since twenty ten in Citizens United\nPoliticians who are elected have massive advantage to raise money from big interests you then they will regulate they get it from unions they get it from big corporations\nAnd they get it by the boat load and so we've got competitive districts no longer competitive we got incumbents who can't be challenged because it takes too much money and you don't have the power to leverage your lawn making to get big contributions so\nYou want to have more competitive elections challenge incumbents empower the people vote yes\nGo right we've got to jump in there Jeff Clemens president of American promise he's our support so yes on ballot initiative to we're also talking ... spokesperson for the mass of fiscal alliance he proposes voting no on ballot initiative initiative to stay with us as we continue a special WVU our radio Boston broadcast on question to\nWhat do you
