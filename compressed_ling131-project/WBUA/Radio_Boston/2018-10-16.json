then I'm Deborah Becker Harvard University is in federal court in Boston today for the first day of the trial over its admissions policies\nStudents for fair admissions alleges that Harvard discriminates against Asian American applicants WB satisfy reporter Carrie young at the courthouse Carrie thanks for being with us glad to be here so today was opening statements let's start with the attorney for the group students for fair admissions what did he say\nWell it started out sort of with the statement of this is what this trial is about and this is what it's not about and for them they came out and said that that this is not about affirmative action that affirmative action is not on trial\nAnd the benefits of affirmative action or not on trial they are if firmly focusing on the fact what or rather what they say is that Harvard is discriminating intentionally against Asian American applicants\nAnd this opening statement it lasted about an hour um and it's it really focused pretty heavily on a variety of statistical analyses to try and prove this point\nUh at first they looked at academic qualifications of students because that is one rating that ah students are judged on when it comes to admissions it showed that on Asian American applicants according to their analysis were coming in the highest\nAnd then another part that they focused on was that another rating that personal score that Asian American applicants were routinely getting lower personal scores than other ethnic groups and personal scores or they're not really based on something that's a that's a number like uh GPA or an SAT would be it's things like personal\nEven the amount of adversity you faced in your life [noise]\nUm but just to sort of break this down I was looking at some of the plaintiffs numbers if they were talking about them and uh looking at the highest academic rating they were saying that that white students got about a twenty nine percent higher I'm Asian American students came in at about twenty two percent that was below\nA African American and Hispanic applicants as well so they spent a lot of time just talking about these numbers and why those held up ... and ... and\nYou're talking about personal scores there when you say that the the twenty nine percent and the twenty two percent\nCorrect I see what I'm Talking about the personal score versus how high they they achieved academically\nAnd I see a ... but Harvard also spoke today the attorney for Harvard also spoke to die of course disagreed with uh the analysis of that data what's the main issue that Harvard uh takes exception with\nUh there there's ... potential for academic achievement and sometimes if a student doesn't go to a very good school or a if they've had illness or other other challenges uh their grades and their scores may not be reflective of their actual ability and\nUh it's important to try and figure out what that potential is not just their accomplishment but what they could do in the right circumstances\nAnd also look at the big picture what is your whole class look like what is your community look great\n[noise] well I'm not sure how far would go in that direction I mean I personally feel that universities should admit to the students with the best ah ability and and potential and and record of achievement and\nYou know if that means of the university that Asian American students make up you know forty percent of the class instead of twenty percent I I I think that's fine\n[noise] so you think this is going to go to the Supreme Court if it not this case that another case because the affirmative action is going to go back before the U.S Supreme Court what'd you say that\nI I think that's quite likely and I also feel that a a Harvard could lose this case and uh but but not necessarily with a decision that strikes down affirmative action or the courts have held in in recent cases are as far as I can tell that I'm\nA that universities have to exhaust race neutral remedies as they're called before they use race based affirmative action and that doesn't seem to be much evidence of Harvard having made a serious effort to look at some race neutral remedies such as for example\nA use giving preference based on socio economics rather than race or eliminating legacy preference would also be called a race neutral example so although it it benefits whites but it's a it's a proxy so uh I think the decision might well go on those grounds\nOkay Dan gold and senior editor at ProPublica Pulitzer Prize winner and author of the price of

Boston I'm Deborah Becker Massachusetts nurses appear to be split on the upcoming statewide ballot question that would affect their jobs\nAccording to a new WB our poll out today forty eight percent of registered nurses say they plan to vote yes on question one which would establish nurse to patient ratios\nForty five percent said they'll vote against the measure the poll reached five hundred nurses are going to speak with groups on both sides of what is likely the most controversial question on the ballot this fall\nFirst we go to John Kelly Williams president of the Massachusetts nurses association which supports this question thanks for coming in thank you for having so why do you think nurses and the w._b. our poll appear to be split\nI think it's very difficult for NASA's right now especially being in the position that they are in being intimidated and being told to vote no\nUm and the scary tactics that are being used by the opposition I don't think that there's any secret to the fact that nurses have than the canaries in the coal mine actually sounding the alarm with the evolution of nursing care that we're seeing and the inability to be able to provide the kid that we've been trying to provide\nBecause nurses are being assigned to many patients at one time\nTell me can you talk about that a little bit of mean why do we need this why wouldn't a hospital feel the responsibility to make sure that it was adequately staffed what are you seeing on the ground boy that's a great\nQuestion because I asked myself that all the time why our hospitals not hearing what we've been saying now for almost\nTwenty years that we're seeing less and less time for nurses to be able to provide the care that we're trying to give up the bad side\nAnd I hear from nurses almost daily that they're being assigned to many patients and asked patients come into the hospital\nThat coming and sicker than they ever were before but when they are coming into the hospital that coming in because they need nursing care if they need to see a physician that can stop at the minute clinic or stopping the emergency room but if you need nursing care you're admitted to the hospital and you are sicker than you've ever been and you need nursing care\nYou know uh the committee to ensure a safe patient care which supports question one released to pull in April that said that eighty six percent of nurses supported this well why do you think there's this discrepancy that now we're seeing nurses split and I think the public might look at this and say\nWell how am I supposed to know I'm not a nurse maybe I you know shouldn't participated in this at all or vote no and let the collective bargaining figure this out right\nSo I Am a nurse at the bedside and I have been at the bedside from my entire career of over ... has\nThe most important thing that that our patients want to have is safe patient care when they're in the hospital\nWhat's happening right now is is that the opposition that does not want to have this safe patient limit put into law so that patients occupied for safely in every single hospital across Massachusetts\nDoesn't matter where they are but there would be a safe limit not a ratio but a limit to the number of patients that are assigned to a registered nurse at one time in no way does that every means at a nurse can't help a fellow nurse who also has on an assignment of for patients in the medical surgical area\nWhat it means is that the nurse will not have more than four patients and think about it this way that if you're a patient in a hospital do you want your nurse to have four patients or do you want your nurse to have eight patients\nWhen you for that call light on because you're having trouble breathing or you need pain medication or you're just frightened do you want to put that call light on and have dinner is deciding amongst eight or ... for ...\nBut at the same question I mean obviously everyone would say for right everyone ... one would say that they want their uh their nurse at their bedside to be overwhelmed but I guess\nFolks are worried about uh having a valid question decide this and with so many nurses saying no I think people are hearing directly from nurses that they're concerned about some of the effects of this and\nAnd a lot of them been brought up the the flexibility ... what would do in terms of flexibility and allowing a the medical professionals to determine staffing for themselves should is a ballot question\nThe avenue to pursue this really why is it\nHad to come to this um as a nurse who have been calling and sounding the alarm about this for a number of years\nWe've done everything we caught up to this point when you mentioned collective bargaining we've put this into contracts nurses that have been covered by collective bargaining have actually done without wages and benefits increases in order to put safe patient limits in their contract only to have those violated by the very people that agreed to do it to begin with\nWe've sat on committees we've gone to the legislature we've done everything that we can and in two thousand and fourteen when we had a ballot initiative at that time it ended in a compromise for the intensive care unit so there is a legal limit in the intensive care units but right now there is no legal limit in any other unit\nIn hospitals and at that point we said in order for all of patients to be safe it needs to be extended to every unit in the hospital\nAnd we listen to the government mandate a that was expressed early on and that's why the flexibility is in this bill it is in there with the acuity tool that allows for the adjustment but it is a limit there is there is a maximum limit to\nWhat about cost because we need to talk about costs of health policy commission released a study that said that this could increase a cross by as much as nine hundred and forty nine million dollars a year [noise]\nUh and and some nurses are that are reporter Martha ... spoke with when she did the story about our pullout a said that that was really influencing how they felt about this I Want to play a bit of tape here from Michael or go drove who's ... who manages to units at north shore medical center and he said why he's voting no on this let's listen\nIf this law passes this could be multiple to a million dollars to operating budget so I'm fearful of closure of our hospital in other community hospitals\nSo costs what uh what about costs and costs not only to hospitals and how it might affect them because also\nAsked on two insurers will pass it on to ... patients in terms of premium\nSo first of all to the hospital costs so right now hospitals um can well afford to provide safe patient limits the profit margin is that to be able to do this but hospitals choose where they're going to invest their health care dollars\nStoried career that's on point tomorrow from tend to do that again is seven and nine point nine to believe you are Boston NPR News station\nWelcome back to the radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker was just about three weeks left until election day we live in today on the race for the third district and open seats with democratic congresswoman Nikki Tsongas not seeking another term\nThe district is diverse and it includes communities such as lengthened in and fix burg and then it goes along the New Hampshire border to have her on the ceiling and Lawrence genetic ourselves to include parts of Metra west\nThis week we're going to stick with those of the major party candidates seeking a seat today we're joined in Studio by Pepperell businessmen Republican ... let them radio Boston thank you Ira it's great to be so we mentioned here businessman or let's start their year cofounder and CEO of one Ayotte that's correct\nOr my brother and I started the business almost Twenty years ago in Pepperell are literally started out of the garage and uh most folks know proper was a tiny town of the New Hampshire border with they may not know is it was also a mill town and for most of the last century the paper mill is the largest employer in town\nIn the early to thousands when the mill fell on hard times a lot of folks lost her job in downtown was hit pretty hard but within a few short years do little company my brother and I started became the largest employer in town a today we employ over five hundred people we have locations in Westford in Littleton as well and I tell folks I Know what it takes to get the economic engine of the third district revving it's because I've done it\nAnd you also worked in the aerospace industry\nYes at NASA a yes for a short time yes I think I\nSaid so why Congress wire Republican [noise]\nAh well this is my way of giving back or at least that I've I've just been so blessed with the success my brother and I have had with our business or in our business also is is founded on empowering our customers so one of the key things we do have seven thousand Youtube videos were actually show our customers how to repair their own cars\nAnd I think that's what Congress should be doing it should be empowering the people to fix issues themselves there's there's no issues to the people Massachusetts can't solve ...\nWhat do you think is the main issue you would like to deal with if he got elected [noise] could you give me one\nSure I'll give you a couple of 'em but let me take it up even higher that when we first started going on on the campaign trail and talking to voters what we found is there's a disconnect\nAnd the voters feel like they no longer understand how do you see in the federal government impacts their daily lives and so all the issues I talk about are bringing the government back to the people in showing the people here say things that I can do that will impact you every day in your life\nUh so uh one issue obviously jobs are more jobs better jobs and that comes from my uh my company's experience my economic experience\nBut then the other two issues talked about roads and bridges our infrastructure of so many problems with our infrastructure\nOn the ... bridge in a well is a thirty five year old temporary bridge and I've said I'm going to fix that as a matter of fact my first TV commercial actually jumped in the river and swam across faster than the Miramax faster than my brother could drive across the work [laughter] and um and then route to which goes from Congress to garden or you know basically splitting the middle north south of the district\nAnd if you look at all the roads in Massachusetts all the roads the spurs that come out of Boston they're all six lane divided major highways\nA Ninety three three north south the mass pike now even twenty four but route to is still this old antiquated Depression era highway and you have the old for Evans is there and and and gardener and Fitch for gateway cities that need to be opened up to economic development and\nThen the other issue is the opioid epidemic uh this is something we heard about literally from the first day on the campaign just it touches everyone who doesn't care what\nYou look at my anger just passed a bill though do ...\n... they did but there's there's still so much more going on even earlier today we were you tack\nA which is a program for an excuse and the ... started out that at risk youth and they're dealing now with young adults\nUm but the opiates touches that and there were still not doing enough one these one size fits all out of D.C or it makes the politicians feel good but it doesn't actually produce the results we really need to empower the local groups and community groups who are doing all the really good work\nUm to to you know give them the resources that we really actually need to change the way we deliver social services entirely in this country if you think about it\nUh most of our social services are delivered on a Depression era model we're for every problem we have a program but with opiates especially you see there's usually multiple problems you know any given person may need\nUm maybe mental health issue but there's but there's a different program for ever you need to have so there's one program for food there's other program for health for job training\nAnd it's a fifty hour week job just trying to keep up with the benefits\nBut when you have programs that they start with housing you get the people safe and then you bring the services to them and I said we need to start treating people and not problems\nSo you would say for the opioid epidemic more money and more sort of wraparound programming that would deal with a variety of issues for the folks who are suffering that would be our main way of addressing I absolutely\nI call it a surgeon benefits so what we have now is this patchwork system where people can come in and out\nIs based on um you know the given need but they get you know if they've been there for Twenty one days and they're sober they're pushed out\nBut then when they leave their it's almost another crisis moment for them where they're going back into society they're not ready to cope yet I'm distressed is very high any mental health problems they have it then they go back to using\nSo need to get them safe get um house and if you look at the long term costs the surgeon benefits were but where are you putting people out after twelve or Eighteen months you know become productive members of society actually lowers the costs long term to the society that\nDoesn't sound like a Republican plan necessarily I just want to say that in which brings me back to the question I ask you a couple of minutes ago and I think I'd like to just ask that again why a Republican and the Republican in Massachusetts\nWell you know I don't find the labels very helpful or I'm a Republican I I got into the politics with Scott Brown's election I'm a businessman first that's really what got me started with this is my interactions with the state government at the local level or sometimes weren't very positive\nUm and you know that's just rough it but again the labels to me it's about what you do for the people it's about who's you know I look at this as a job interview so I'm a I'm a businessman the people in the third district going to choose who's the best person to represent them in my job is to show them that that I can do the best job for them down in our nation's capital\nMay have a Republican president right now President Trump has said you voted for for President Trump what about the president's agenda what what do you think of it and what do you think of some of the key proposals that the president wants to ah wants to deal\nWith ... as long as it's something that's going to help the people in the third district then I'll work with anybody whether it's the president governor Baker leadership in Congress are but for me it all comes back I look at everything through the prism of will just be good for the people in my district and if the answer is yes then I'll be a full you know full supporter that agenda\nSo let's talk about maybe specifically how about a border wall would that be good or not good for the people in the district\nSo I think the larger issue there is immigration mhm I'm very personal issue to me my brother in law is a naturalized citizen actually our second commercial is about my brother in law his story where he came to work for me and then I invited him to Thanksgiving dinner 'cause he didn't know anyone in that's where he met my sister\nOr we need more legal immigrants our economy's booming right now there's we have jobs in my distribution center we can't hire enough people so we need more legal immigration\nBut ultimately our country as a country of laws and we have to all agree to abide by the rule of law the first thing I'm going to do when I go down to DC it's put my hand in the air and take an oath to defend the constitution and and federal laws\nAnd I can't run a campaign I'm On the issue like sanctuary cities and say encourage a local and state you know communities to disobey the law you know when I'm gonna take an oath to uphold it\nSo you wouldn't have greater sanctuary cities necessary\nNo I'm the only candidate in the race who has taken a stand against sanctuary cities\nAnd in terms of a border wall what would you think about that\nWhat border security I mean is an absolute must if you don't have a a border then you don't have\nA country [noise] how about guns what do you think about reforms forgotten should we have a different types of background checks what what should we do about about gun legislation\n[noise] ah well look I mean I'm a supporter of the the bill of rights so I'm I support all the first ten minutes um which includes the tenth amendment which is you know states' rights and again one size fits all are coming out of D.C to me is usually the wrong answer\nA Massachusetts has our laws and the people in Massachusetts are very happy with them\nOr at the same time we wouldn't want to live under the laws of say Wyoming or Texas but also understand that the people of Wyoming and Texas may not want to live under our laws\nOr health care what should happen with about a care\nSo and the guy I think the or you're back to the labels you know Obamacare is it's a label I'm\nNot even sure what we have left you know is even you know similar to what that was originally was um for me the issues that I get asked about everyday roads and bridges the opioid crisis and those are the issues and bringing it back to people in their daily lives\nOn the issue of healthcare um you look at what we have now this patchwork\nEveryone talks about coverage what's really important is the health outcomes and the quality and then the overall cost\nA ... you look at the current system basically you know the middle class has this actually don't have health care anymore okay technically they're covered but now they have these high deductible plans All right so a lot of folks to the deductible so high that folks in the middle class even though they're covered they can't go to the doctor\nUm and so when I look at that that just doesn't work we have to we have to figure out\nHow to bring patient choice back into the equation so again I'm an automotive um if you look at the car insurance model\nOr someone hits your car and you can go to an end network provider you drop it off everything's taking care of that kind of like our medical\nUm insurance but there's another choice where you could say that the adjuster comes out and says I'll give you twelve hundred dollars for this repair and you can take it to the provider if your choice now you may go somewhere else and they said why don't have to fill it out of the administrative paperwork I'll do that for eleven hundred dollars or\nStation from Boston University you're listening to Ninety point nine W.

state ballot question one of that question three asks whether voters approve of the state law banning discrimination based on gender identity and public accommodations\nA yes vote keeps the current law in place a no vote would repeal it\nToday advocates on both sides of question three join us for a debate brought to you by WBAI the McCormack graduate school at UMass Boston and the Boston Globe and first we're going to introduce this debate about ballot question number three with this report from ... state broke\nThe law at issue here makes it illegal to deny service to transgender people in hotels stores restaurants or other public places it was overwhelmingly passed by the legislature and signed by governor Baker and has been in effect for a little over two years\nWhen that law went into effect in two thousand sixteen it changed my life\nKelly Jenkins says she knows what it is like to be discriminated against because of her gender identity\nI've been refuse service in a restaurant simply for being transgender I've been asked to leave a place to ask the polite word I've been told to leave a place for using the women's restroom and those things have a lasting impact on me that I still have with me when I moved up here to Massachusetts\nJenkins came here from eastern Tennessee back in two thousand forty two years before the transgender public accommodation laws passed\nShe's been working as a teaching assistant at Wellesley middle school for the past three years and she expects to have her own classroom next year the law and powers chickens to be what she calls her authentic so\nI'm Still nervous that I'm going to be discriminated against but I Know I have this law in this state that it protects me and it gives me the ability to do my job and feel of fairly safe so that I can go out there in the world and make a different than teach these children Jenkins\nSays she knew she made the right decision to come to Massachusetts when she arrived for her job interview spotted a giant rainbow flag inside the school her co workers including Eileen shark said Jenkins is an asset to the school he's\nA great teacher she's phenomenal colleague\nShe's ... she's willing to share parts of her tell her story with on our staff and with you in a classroom that studying gender identity expression\nYou know just briefly so the definition of gender identity of Massachusetts law which is chapter for six and seven paragraphs fifty nine passed as you were to see in two thousand eleven and wish this law rests on\nSays that gender related identity may be shown by providing evidence including but not limited to\nAnd that's where they say can sister uniform assertion boats or it can also be shown by any other evidence that the gender religion the sincerely hope so but it's not a requirement that it's consistent that as one would have demonstrated but it's not required it boils down to having just sincerely held identity that's impossible to police\nAnd your response to that Casey what would you say\nWell the law itself is is very clear that there's a different kinds of evidence that people can proper but\nI think the important thing for voters to know if they think about what to do on this question is they are going to hear a number of anecdotes throughout the afternoon that do not involve transgender people that do not involve people asserting this law and saying that they get the protection of this law for the the crimes they're engaging in\nThe law does not allow people to do anything illegal they can be stopped and held accountable and they are\nAnd what voters really needs to be aware of is at the end of the day this is about people like me just trying to go about our ...\nI'll bet you know Seventeen year old transgender girl she's like any other teenage girl she wants to shop is for us she wants to be a professional singer someday but she can't be a professional singer in a theater that won't let Iran because she happened to be transgender [laughter] enough of this law is all about\nOkay I Want to make sure we get some callers in here a ship von is calling from Newberry port Siobhan you're on the air\nHi thank you and just didn't know my son is transgender and he's not an animal freak or any other strange to be on any of it like intention is not to hurt on the other person on the planet and I do the wording of\nThe law states that if equality for all even outside of that meaning building into a restaurant a store or anywhere else\nI don't understand how anyone would fight that on any basis that all people should be created equal or treated equally\nOn and I think that's fair among the ring of what transgender who transgender people are is really a noxious and nasty they've obviously never met anyone that is transgender because more transgendered people get killed side street people than people that are are transgender hurting others\nAnd I just it's just a shame and sharing and that this law should they add it did not include into the future and that's basically all I have\nDone okay thanks so much on ... Bek was how how would you address your Arabs\nAre two points first of all I'm this campaign is really not about the transgender issue this is about promising safety in bathrooms locker rooms and intimate places like that\nAnd the reason why we called this law the bathroom bill is because functionally that is the only place where the law has changed since this bill was passed in two thousand sixteen the Massachusetts commissioned against discrimination or submitted a letter to the legislature October of two thousand Fifteen making it clear that they have the authority and they have the authority already at that time [noise]\nTo a process gender identity discrimination claims in public combinations so if this law would be repealed or nobody's rights would be any difference when it comes to restaurants movie theaters hospitals places like that the only area that it'd be different would be the bathrooms in the locker rooms and that's the concern\nCasey and what you do have a minute to respond to that before we take some more calls\nAbsolutely I you know I think we can all agree uh international lawyers that are in the visor opinion from a state agency is not the same and just does not offer the same of clarity and uniformity as a statewide law that's why large and small businesses support this law\nUm and you know ... people you know what human beings we have to use the restroom sometimes we use a you know we are just as not us when we're in those places as anybody else um\nAnd you know at the end of the day what this is really about is a respect and dignity for everybody and safety for all and it's very clear that this law does not impact anybody's safety but it does make sure that transgender people are able to go about our daily lives okay\nWe're going to get to some of the evidence about safety in a moment but I Want to go to Zach who is calling from Boston that you're on the air\nOf hydrogen for taking my call I just have a question I'm\nI'm concern with the central implications of you know I'm ... I'm open to provide each injured but I'm concerned about the ... the forward by\nTrain biological stock of human socks and according to a tree during that on behalf of the motion and I'm not saying that um we should because people feel\nA certain way about humans are traditionally taught that were born with time figure at the scientific outdoor malady abnormalities Ken or ... or ... or do\nYou know what I'm saying I Do biology has biology is that what you're saying Zak yeah\nOkay uh let's let Casey or answer that briefly\n[noise] you know I think if you've never had the opportunity to meet a transgender person it can be a really challenging to understand what it means to be transgender you know my family is very supportive of me but um they had ... when I first came to them in and explain to them what was going on with me\nYou know I think the most important thing to keep in mind is you know we're all human beings we're all neighbors were family members or friends or co workers\nAnd at the end of the day we don't have to understand everything about each other to be able to treat each other decency and with dignity and respect\nAnd that's that's what yeah some three is all about um that's why there's so much support for it and it doesn't put anybody in risk in the process which is why law enforcement and sexual assault prevention expert resoundingly support yeah some three\nAnd I'm Wondering just briefly Andrew Do you think back as a point\nAbsolutely I mean we have men's rooms and women's rooms because a male ... female bodies are different and that's really all we're trying to maintain a recognition of is that women should not be forced to be in intimate places with mailbox\nDoesn't matter to them how the person who has that nobody identifies if there's a male intact anatomically male bonding with male genitalia and a longer Mashal next to them that make them uncomfortable and what this with the yes on three campaign fails to do is to respect that concern at all\nOf a ... or we're going to have to go to a break right now but I Want to tell our listeners to stay with us we're continuing this debate on ballot question three in Massachusetts it seeks to repeal the two year old state law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity\nA yes vote would keep the current law a no vote would repeal it we've got both sides in Studio with us to talk about this and you can call us at eight hundred for two three eight to five five to get in on the conversation\nI'm Deborah Becker I'm here with Stephanie ever from the Boston Globe and this is radio Boston\n[noise] this is W.

special radio Boston broadcasted debate down ballot question three in Massachusetts I'm Deborah Becker\nAnd I'm Stephanie ... with the Boston Globe in three weeks voters will decide whether to keep the current law that prohibits discrimination based on gender identity in public spaces we have both sides in the studio to talk about\nThis endless reminder we want to hear from you this hour do you support that twenty sixteen state law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity or do you think it should be repealed you can call us at eight hundred for two three eight to five five that eight hundred for two three talk you can also tweet us at radio Boston\n[noise] a a study\nReleased last month by researchers at the Williams Institute at the UCLA school of law examined restroom crime reports in Massachusetts cities such as Medford Melrose Newton where local anti discrimination ordinances were in place before the law was enacted statewide\nI think now no link between transgender bathroom accessing crimes that occur in bathrooms and no difference between the cities that did and did not have policies\nAnd in fact they found very few bathroom incidents at all um this law has now been in place state wide for two years I went opposed to Andrew why aren't we seeing the public safety risks that you are predicting\nWell first of all to dress the Williams Institute study I mean the Williams Institute as a left wing think tanks so does have its own bars including one of its authors of that study Jody Herman is on record saying we shouldn't even have\nMen's rooms and women's rooms at all\nUm I Want direct listeners attention to study put up by ... called woman means something and they looked at the targets a target stores nationally and found that sexual incidents in particular voyeurism related offense\nBut people who wouldn't otherwise have access so particularly men who wouldn't otherwise have access to a bathroom my daughter may be and\nI'm looking now what I've always told my daughter don't get into elevators alone with men don't go into a room alone with a man whether it be somebody's office or any other situation like that I Will no longer be able to tell her that and that's my biggest concern\nRight Courtney a thanks so much for the call Bruce is also with us Bruce is calling from west Monroe Bruce you're on the air\nI think taking my call hey there's been a lot of talk in a debate about you know women being on the bathroom and I want to point out there's another side of the coin here\nI've worked with a transgender woman she was a brilliant professional I enjoyed working with her I and everyone around you regard email because that was your outward appearance if I walked into the men's room and they'll call her married she was in there my first reaction you marry what the hell are you doing here\nI think I Would be pretty darn uncomfortable and I think she would be too so uh does this make any sense to have people who you know I don't really look like you know females to be in the men's or it just makes no sense\nSo I'm going to ask Casey to respond to both of the things we've got some some ... safety issues here from a a woman and says that she's concerned about her daughter and what might happen here and also a\nA folks who may feel uncomfortable what do you do with those uncomfortable feelings Casey how do you address people who are just uncomfortable\n[noise] yeah you know I I understand if you've never met a trench in a person and you're not familiar with people like us um it can be uncomfortable to sort of a figure out what it means and I've I've had people in my life as I've a canal to them and have a lot of questions and and take their time are becoming more comfortable but you know Courtney I'm when I can\nSomebody like in you know he's a teenager or transgender um his parents worry that he will face discrimination just going out with friends going to a movie theater\nUm she has a sister and his parents support a yes vote on three and they support these protections and they certainly wouldn't support these protections for eating at the expense of his sister um you don't have to take my word for it or did this law works and that and everybody kept safe including transgender people but not just transgender people\nYou know you can look to the law enforcement supporters you can look to the sexual assault prevention supporters um who all come out and said resoundingly that we are all safer when each of us is treated with dignity and respect a Andrew where\nUm since Massachusetts was the first state to legalize same sex marriage tendency mostly blue liberal state [noise] how do you convince the majority of people here to do away with rights that are already in place for transgender people\nWere going to be clear we're not doing away with it erodes the order to exist under Massachusetts law because the most juice and Massachusetts where she goes discrimination interpret sex discrimination to include gender identity as the Obama administration is done on Louis the glue Massachusetts does something like that a trench\nAnytime soon but I Want to just circle back to the small cage because\nUh the the culture for the yes on free campaign case your coach or a ... dynasty attorney who helped filed a complaint in in the complaint there's anatomical mail is demanding does he get his journals waxed by the female technician of his choice\nAnd that is the type of thing that I could even predicted this law would do but it's one of the unintended consequences when I ask you a case you do you believe that if he must workers would have to touch\nAnd a compliment other journals and if they're uncomfortable doing\nYou know what Andrew we uh are on a tight clock here because we're also being broadcast in the western part of the state right now and and so we're going to ... we only have thirty seconds so I'm going to have case the answer that\nAfter a break I Want to remind you that you're listening to a live debate on ballot question three in Massachusetts that asks voters whether to repeal the state law that prohibits
