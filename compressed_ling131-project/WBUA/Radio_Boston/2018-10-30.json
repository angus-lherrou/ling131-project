I'm Maria Garcia we're learning more today about the eleven people killed in that tragic shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday they ranged in age from fifty four to Ninety seven eight where men three where women\nTwo of them Cecil and David Rosenthal each is fifty nine and fifty four were brothers both lived in the squirrel hill neighborhood where the shooting took place another two victims Bernice and Sylvan Simon were married a couple in their eighties\nRose ... was the oldest victim she was Ninety seven years old we have a link to all the names and remembrances up on our website radio Boston dot org White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders spoke to reporters in the last hour condemning the attack\nThis atrocity was a chilling active mass murder was an act of hatred and above all it was an act of evil anti Semitism is a plagues of humanity and it is responsible for many of the worst wars in human history\nWe all have a duty to confront anti Semitism in all its forms and everywhere and anywhere it appears\nThe suspect forty six year old Robert Towers was arrested on Saturday and brought to court today where he waved the reading of charges against him and was assigned a public defender\nWe're going to spend some time today on this story and listeners we want to hear from you on this as well how are you reacting where do you turn for hope in moments like these you can call us at a one eight hundred for two three\nThat's one eight hundred for two three talk and you can tweet us ... radio mosque and in a few minutes we'll speak with a scholar a Jewish studies but first David shouldn't a long time my county and joins us from the offices of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette where he is the executive editor David thank you for joining us\nThank you\nFor ... you know we want to express our condolences to people in Pittsburgh we know there's a dark difficulties moment because your community um you live on me three blocks from the tree of life can you give us a sense of how un people around you are are wrestling with this Simon city\nWell people are here now we are in the kind of situation you're\nIn after a shocking death in that you're pushing through with lots of things to do in our case we perform our morning by doing our service through work and so many others have the same situation but what\nI never thought this could happen in my synagogue ever I just never thought if it reached this level that someone would take into their own hands and make a decision that they needed to Georgia Jewish ...\nWhat'd you make of the rights of white supremacy and neo Nazi ism emerging in the country since then [noise]\nThis is terribly frightening it's a terribly frightening time for all Jews but I think it's frightening time for all people\nWho know that when the election took place of President Trump people said now you know what it's like to live as a black person in the United states how it is to live with this with fear and with the kind of rhetoric that is so ugly frightening rhetoric [noise]\nSo [noise] yes when this happened of course was on my mind was Charleston and the murder there and that black church and all the many black churches that have been burned down but arson attacks throughout this country\nI thought also bishop Romero murdered not solve the door the idea of killing people at worship is especially horrifying because we have a sense that we all want to live lives of dignity live in a civilized world and if there's one moment\nOne moment when we're excused from anger from hatred and one moment when we can be vulnerable when we are at prayer prayer is that place of refuge\nAnd which we have our full humanity so the attack as an attack on what it is to be a human\nBeing ... I Want to go back to this idea that you were talking about earlier about\nThe difference in impact versus um intentions right and that it doesn't matter you say what the president intends to say but what matters is the impact and we just heard at the top of this hour a strong statement from the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders condemning this act\nThe president also spoke out strongly against anti Semitism earlier uh we we should remember his daughter is married to a Jewish man do you feel that the White House has responded appropriately\nTo issue a statement is a very easy thing to do it's like sending a birthday card to a an acquaintance or friend\nThe issue is the friendship all year long not just a birthday card so fine the White House issued a statement condemning ... isn't good for that\nThat's not the point the point is assuming responsibility and not just a hundred percent responsibility but even going beyond the minimum requirement and stopping this kind of language and we've heard it over and over again the vulgarity issued from this man this president\nNow let me also if I may make another point which is there is no quid pro quo when it comes to anti Semitism we don't excuse one statement because we have something else under the table to hand it to us in\nOther words I heard in fact uh on on the radio this morning a man calling in and saying well President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel therefore he can't the anti Semitic and his daughter converted to Judaism and married a Jewish grandchildren Jewish so forth\nThat's not an excuse for anything there is no quid pro quo that is I don't care if you move the embassy to Jerusalem or didn't move and what I care about is a Jew shouldn't be murdered\n... ... [noise] you know you teach Jewish studies at Dartmouth College how will this change the way you teach how does this change the narrative of being Jewish in America\nChanges the narrative entirely I must tell you that when I teach modern Jewish history and I talk about the drivers affair and France and the ... and Russia and I talk about the rise of ... and the Holocaust\nAnd then I come to the United states and it's a different story the United states the place of refugees I just says we are nothing like this could happen the difference the American difference although I've also turn an article by my colleague Tony Michael's and which argues that in fact it's not so different\nBut I have to say he's right it's not so different I Can't talk about it is different any longer\nAnti Semitism isn't she kept from our shores\nShouldn't surround us in the United states that's what's frightening and that will change and we have to understand that anti Semitism is not a product of a given country or a particular political movement\nIt can be taken up by any political movement left wing right wing it doesn't matter and used with such gruesome brutality that's what's shocking how valuable it is so easily available\n... professor of Holocaust history at Emory University Deborah Lipstadt like and anti Semitism to herpes infection that lights dormant and then re emerges at times of stress does that resonate for you\nYes it does I've thought about it is a term I said you live in a house you know you have termites and then he lifted you open the door you lift a piece of wood and your base that and they're they are yes it's a kind of infection that can undermine the foundation of a society and that's what's important\nPaint Santa Herschel thank you so much for joining us we appreciate your time thank you thank you [noise]\nAlso today us attorney general Jeff Sessions was in Boston talking about the future of religious liberty and event sponsored by the lawyers chapter of the federalist society WVU our senior political reporter Anthony Brooks was there an Anthony\nI gather the attorney general address the shooting at the tree of life cynic over the weekend tell us what he said\nYes he did so sessions was here to talk about efforts by the Trump Administration to bring in when court cases and supportive religious freedom as they say and he said given what happened over the weekend just couldn't come at a more important time here's a bit of what he's\nWe're still reeling today from the murderers rampage in Pittsburgh that took the life of eleven congregants targeted because of their faith worshipping faithfully in their own synagogue\nThis will not just that an attack on the Jewish faith it was an attack on all people of faith\nSessions call this an attack on Americans values and set it cannot and will not be tolerated so he more or less reiterated what the president said on Saturday when a President Trump called the attack pure\nEvil so Anthony sessions his appearance was scheduled to before the attack to talk about the future of religious freedom a and I understand he was confronted by some religious leaders here in Boston\nYeah and it was pretty dramatic I'm so just as sessions was beginning his remarks will green a Methodist minister from Andover who is in the audience stood up and confronted him reciting and then referring to verses from the Bible here's a bit of a confrontation\nI was a stranger and you know well I thank\nYou for your comments and a Venus\nIs not as a fellow United Methodist\nTo care for those nice [laughter]\nWell thank you for those remarks and attack but I Would just tell you we do our best every day of all fill my responsibility during farce the laws of the United states right\nNow is police escort administer green out of the room another minister a Baptist minister Darryl Hamilton uh stood up and continue to continue to protest\nYou could hear people in the audience they're yelling to him go home he too was escorted out by the police so it was an ... an eventful morning from Mr sessions in Boston but after that a disruption he was able to deliver his remarks\nSo give us a sense of what he had to say so sessions\nWas here to talk about which really become a conservative rallying cry and the way the Trump Administration phrases this is a commitment\nTo religious freedom he talked about the department of justice is religious freedom task force which sessions are established as part of an effort by the Trump Administration to identify instances where religious freedom is under assault in their view and here's a bit of what sessions that\nWe've witnessed the ordeal still ongoing faced by uh the Colorado Baker who simply doesn't want the government to force him to create art that offense his religious beliefs why don't they just leave him alone\nSo this is a key example of what sessions talked about today in that case the Colorado civil rights commission had rules against the Baker saying you're discriminated against the gay couple but the Baker argue that it violated his religious rights to be forced to create\nThat cake for the gay couple and the case with all the way the Supreme Court which sided with the bakers and a session says this is the kind of case that his department of justice is committed to successfully prosecuted\n... now the alliance defending freedom was also a big part of this and then give us some context to is this good\nSo sessions was introduced by Jordan Lorence of the alliance defending freedom now this is a conservative Christian non profit group with the stated goal of advocating training and funding on the issues of religious freedom sanctity of life in marriage and family it's committed to the idea of religious liberty\nAlso controversial the Southern Poverty Law Center for example has designated as a hate group because among other things or it has supported efforts to re criminalized homosexuality that said sessions made the point that this cause conservative defense of religious freedom is gaining traction\nUm he established a so called religious liberty task force in a video Jay and he said neutral umpiring in the courts is ascendant while what he called liberal activism in ideology or on the\nBut you know always I think there's something behind making those decisions are making the correct decisions and and he's a guy who who really combines\nYou know the best of modern baseball which is to use analytics and all of the advance metrics that we have to measure players skills and abilities with like the real old school baseball in tuition and I think finding that happy medium is something that Alex court does really well you know time and again\nThe players expressed how much they enjoy playing for him\nAnd that's not just because the informs them with you know when you face this picture he's probably going to throw you a fastball first time out it's because he trust them to get the job done and he explains the decisions with\nYou know with with metrics but also with with the right amount of um you know sort of one on one attention that I think inspires confidence\nYeah his his agent Scott Morris calls it correlates which is one of the thing I think that matters to players is accountability and he's clearly a manager that believes and accountability\nOr afternoon for he was taking some criticism for not pulling the starter water Rodriguez ... Rodriguez ends up giving up a three run Homer put the Sox down four to nothing it it looks troublesome at that point\nBut he stepped up and said no that's my fault\nWe felt that my daughter was good for us but you know that much of his good for us when it's fresh and uh you know he's able to get past Marcy ready and uh I was I was a actually kicking myself for for a few minutes before the combat\nSo I I think that goes a long way he could have said we didn't execute on the pitch and steady says it that's on me\nAll right so so you know I'm the I'm arts and culture editor here at the U.S I have to ask a question this way so our critic at large at Siegel that if you stay that says if Shakespeare's the merchant of Venice celebrates the question of mercy\nThen of course Red Sox celebrate the question of loyalty basically saying really stood out to to talk radio ... to everyday fans who basically questioned his methods what do you think about that\n[laughter] yeah [laughter] I Wish I could think about it I think that\nFor the first season he show he has a real ability to both look at maps of look at the numbers which is such a big part of baseball in this modern era but also to know his players to know how to communicate to them and how to put them in the best spots to succeed\nSo on the other side Dave Roberts the Dodgers manager has been taking a lot of heat for some of his decisions in the series the\nBlame for the Dodgers I I Can't criticize project of the two thousand for this deal So Matt pick this one [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah I I uh I'm reluctant to criticize they've ah as well just because I think that in the end you know managers can inspire a certain amount of confidence and present analytics and whatnot but\nIn the end of the players were up at the plate with the bad and the players were out in the fields throwing the ball and catching the ball so\nYou know I think that there was you know the Dodgers were just over matched by by a superior team of um you know players who who\nHit well players you fielded with a almost near impact ability will will leave JD Martinez out of that for now but um\nBut I just think that the that the Dodgers really a failed to perform uh granted they ran up against an excellent excellent baseball team that features the highest payroll in major league baseball\nBut uh but you know so so to put it all and the manager I think is is a unfair [noise]\nAll right well that's not happened sports editor for the Boston Globe Matt thanks for joining us thanks for having me and radio Boston's a crisis in Iraq Chris thanks for being here in January right hair they think the fact that they were all\nRight stay with us coming up one Woman's Journey to understand and choose race in America I'm Maria Garcia this is radio [noise]\n\n\nFrom Boston University this is Ninety point nine W.

the book race isn't one of the methods of social segmentation in fact it wasn't really part of the cultural dialogue the way it is in America\nSo I Wonder if you can talk a little bit more about the lines which you did see your community divided by\nOf course I grew up in a India till I was twelve years old\nAnd of course well we didn't have race we had lots and lots of different ways of dividing ourselves up I think all societies do ah for us at that time of course it was we divided up ourselves according to lines drawn around language religion\nEthnic group cast economic class a and even geographic region um such as north versus south India\nUm and just as lots of societies around the world which have devised ways of\nUh creating these lines of partition for creating hierarchy or creating social divisions that were also as many ways of traverse thing those lines right of crossing those boundaries and then also being alert\nOr to checking who's crossing those boundaries we had all of those ways of dividing ourselves up but race we didn't have\n... so I Want to get to um a passage in your book and and have you read it at the very beginning of your memoir\nYou write about a

they will see how angry we are and no one likes an angry black men war and then we brown woman I Am silently editing our conversation\nBut I think you know this already he continues and so you smile wide and crack all those jokes\nAnd the end of the nineteenth century the African American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar wrote\nWe wear the masks that ... and lives it hides our cheeks\nAnd shades our

B. U. R. Bolger was killed in prison the FBI is investigating\nIn his book it was the feared former leader of the winter hill gang end once one of America's most wanted fugitives he was charged with Nineteen murders and convicted in eleven F them WBRC David but Larry reported on Bulger's kinds\nHe was one of the most feared men in the history of Boston\nWhen jumbled you decided to kill somebody he kill them there was no change in his mind and if people knew it\nHad been weeks it's seen his boss said work buried some of the victims and testified Bulger's trial\nPeople didn't want to meet him in the food's a do what was asked of them without even meeting them because they didn't want them made him\nHe rose from the projects of self ... along with his brother William who's parallel path to power went to politics and the presidency of the state Senate and later the University of Massachusetts\nFrom boosting goods from the backs of trucks Whitey Bolger graduated to bank robbery in a stint in federal prison including Alcatraz of which he was a proud alumnus back on the street she joined an Irish game called winter hill and killed as a favor for the mafia\nCause of his ... and there's other ruthlessness he became a legend in Boston says former TV reporter Ron ... was almost like a ghost or go sleep presence even the cops were afraid of him he was ... disciplined\nAnd low profile but Bulger's rise from gangster the godfather was enabled and empowered by the government's wore an organized crime in which the enemy was the mafia the Italian American gangsters\nAnd not the Irish Americans with Boston mafia boss Gen narrow and ... and his lieutenants did not know about their outside hit men was this Bolger in his partners Steven the rifleman ...\nHad been recruited as secret FBI informants\nIsn't that the Supreme irony Whitey Bolger new England's most notorious mob shirt\nHe was he was not only doing that but he was he turned the bureau ended up ... bureaus information he was getting tips from agents from others about coming investigations ... agents fellow agents and others uh subverted the law enforcement attempts\nTo catch up there's nothing there's nothing worse than some of these stories involving informants potential government would this be murdered\nOn the basis of information that bulge regarding from law enforcement and so that is that\nIs the the the corruption that was staggering and went right to the core of this matter it was called the wars lead the worst law enforcement scandal in American history by congressional committee\n... you know one FBI agent as as you've reported on ... forty pounds of explosive FBI agents even gave Bolger the identity of people who were informing on hand and then he of course then murdered those people\nAnd one of the ... and the fact of the matter is in the and many of the people the agents many of the people\nBolden in power him were never held to account it was argued that the\nThe statute of limitations had passed and they couldn't be prosecuted it was never fully fleshed out his relationship with the Justice Department was never fully investigated and what it did not get laid out completely so there's always been about this case the suspicions the on\nClosed chapters and in fact I call it the longest running saga in the English language it ... it it wasn't over when he was convicted it's not over and now it never seems to add\n... new Web to extend far beyond John Connelly but it seems like we'll never get closure will never fully know just how far the corruption\nYeah and you know to to uh I mean I have I have long chief in this story and to and to people who haven't been here for a long time if it's it perhaps is hard to understand but\nSix decades of politics law enforcement\nCulture and even media because the media was involved and protecting the FBI and running the FBI stories and off it involved in ... in accurate stories of covered up what was really going on\nThat six decades across a broad spectrum not just of Boston with greater Boston Massachusetts were involved in this\nFBI special relationship with Bolger and the protection he got\n... the murders Bolger was found responsible for we're in the Nineteen seventies and eighties I mean this was a very particular era what'd you see Boston with a different ... can you have any way to serve\nIn many ways a different city city of ... uh it was\nA different place for law enforcement uh to be sure and and the and the the crime records to be sure you know he really could look out there and say I own this town he really could do that ... uh and yet\nSome of that still play because it's never been fully aired out it's never been fumigate it in one of the ... after ... Massachusetts in the scandal of that the fact that he was tipped off to his indictment a allegedly by a fellow\nBy a former FBI agents who is who got the information from an FBI supervisor even not study what do you think of it ah the cross country runner sixteen years on the lam ah with an investigation that was often criticized would be either\nInefficient in different in different or intentional in protecting him all of that he comes back in two thousand eleven the trial goes on he wants to make his defense and he wants to\nHe wants to be threatened to name names and talk about his special deal with the FBI\nHe's not allowed to do that by a judge or after after motions filed by the prosecution so even though we came away after that trial still warning answers the family of families of his victims warning answers and actually in one stunning\nSetting cheering on the defence the defence of the man who killed their loved ones\nBecause they thought that the defense was was more likely to open up the truth of what had happened and to get the information for the witnesses then the prosecutors themselves\nYou know many people asked how he was able to elude the law so long you know why wasn't he caught earlier he had a recognizable face he was one of America's most wanted how did he get away from the law for more than a decade and a half well\nThat's the question those are the questions about whether the FBI I really wanted to get him or not and for all those times it was like where's Waldo it became you know if it became a ... a week it would be people ask me I was on this case where I've been covering this for about twenty twenty six twenty seven years now\nAnd people would say where is where do you think he has it was a national it was it not only a national was a local compensation it'd be sure where's Whitey and I went out and followed leads\nIn California that that I found out the FBI had never followed obvious leads doing work they never did they was this suggested that Bolger was crossing over the Mexican border to get drugs where his heart condition on the other side\nI went to the border I talked to border patrol in immigration and customs asked them if the FBI it ever\nCome to them and and showing them posters and asked them to be on the lookout for this guy Whitey Bolger crossing the bureau they told me the bureau had never been there never made contact never brought posters\nEven though there was a poster a president and one of those officers of former top a ten most wanted who lived in Tijuana who'd been arrested by those very people as he was crossing the border\nNow earlier you said that we still need answers even after the trial family members\nThe specifics that you want answers to\nWhat to what extent I mean this is this is the question to what extent was she\nWas she protected to what extent\nHow far up the chain how many people involved were involved in protecting him in benefiting from it of taking gifts and money how far did didn't go where there are other people he wants to brag Bolger once bragged that they most any point in time he could go to the FBI officer gets six\nGuns six guys how the FBI office\nTo go with him on a hit with machine guns this with Kevin Weeks his his a surrogate son and Parker told me the ball Jews to brag that he could do that ... would you like to know who we claimed he could do that with\nHe said he took he\nBribed ah several dozen Boston cops along the way when you like to know who he allegedly bribed all those questions never went answered a never never went answered\nYes he was convicted of participating in eleven murders but you spoke with an associate of an associate of his ones who told you that Bolger had told him he had murdered up to thirty seven people\nYeah yeah he ... he and his partner Stephen Flynn me we're both they like to kill people and they killed a lot of\n... so to keep us through his rise in the underworld he was born in the projects of south Boston as you said in your report and found his way to the winter hill gang\nBest thing that ever happened to ... he was his first his his his first arrest they got 'em for a jumping on the backs of trucks uh that was the that was the early days when he was when he was a kid\nAnd suddenly he goes from that he screws to arrest that he was forty forty seven uh but he goes from that\nSuddenly to doing bank jobs armed robberies\nAnd uh he got he got away with three armed robberies\nThey arrested him he went to prison is fifty six\nThat was probably the best thing that ever happened to because Hattie stayed out he wouldn't have been he was a nobody still at the scene he didn't have any status but he had he stayed out he most probably would have gotten killed in the gang wars of the late fifties early sixties in which\nBoston was portrayed by life magazine as murder capital usa\nThere were there were the wars and wars between the Irish gays he would have been in a line of sight but instead he was a federal prison got an early release\nA got an early release and signs of what was to come\nHe uh got a a favorable treatment or consideration from the local Congressman John McCormack who happened to be or become speaker of the house [laughter] ... so he had high level of friends\nUh who high level of friends or people to advocate for him he got out of prison after the gay wars it ended and then started rising through the ranks of this\nGroup in in Somerville located on winter she'll that were took on either the name of which are ill or\n... on the

radio Boston I'm Maria Garcia as we've been hearing this hour on the show James Whitey Bolger once when the nation's most wanted fugitives\nPrison according to federal officials he had just been moved to a high security present and the law enforcement source speaking on the condition of anonymity total WVU art that Bolger was killed in prison\nFor another perspective on this let's turn to declare he's a former reporter for the Boston Globe and author of the book black mask Whitey Bolger the FBI and the devil steel he's also a journalism professor at Boston University declare welcome\nPrimary Dick what's your immediate reaction to the news today\nWell surprise obviously it's a sudden death or in seems to be a violent one but it's you know which was a kind of story that you're expected to come one day or another given his age and ah his health conditions and his track record Keller\n... you know they'll do was one of the most feared men in Boston he oh he had avoided prison for decades but was convicted in twenty Thirteen of participating in those eleven murderers and he was serving two consecutive life sentences Dick remind our listeners of the whole receives claims he was convicted up\nWhile he was convicted of just about everything imaginable from uh the murders that you mentioned two shakedowns and extortion and loan sharking a drug trafficking uh again the whole a range of criminal\nActivity but the thing that I think the you know everyone has to remember it was a a worthy Bolger um you know obviously lived a very long life and career where longevity is is not usually that typical\nUm in part of it was that he was a protective an informant for the Boston beer or the FBI for a couple of decades\nYes they're not only was he a an informant but he was in part protected also added side by the FBI tell us about that relationship\nWell absolutely and and and it was the late Nineteen eighties um when the globe spotlight team which I was a member you know reported in disclosed for the first time this what became known as the unholy alliance between the crime boss ... and the Boston FBI agents\nWhere over time you know initially the FBI hidden enlisted vulture to give them criminal information mainly about the mafia\nBut over time uh Bolger turn the tables and he transformed or the organized crime you didn't in the Boston office into in effect a an extension of his own gang were there a tipping him off\nDo investigations are two other underworld figures who were informing against him and that led to the some of those ah informant steps so it's it's\nIt's really a a horrifying chapter and the FBI history given that it didn't involve single moment or a single case but had become a way of life\nI Want to talk a little bit about the narrative that he formed a throughout his life he was so purposeful yeah about ... creating this myth around him this aura about him he was so aware that he needed to be like to be successful can you elaborate on that part of him\nWell there was the Whitey called so to speak um 'cause then his gang as powerful that was as it was a he never cultivated any successors or anything like that it was all it's all about him he was at the center of it all\nAnd it could be persuasive charming pretend it was almost ... you know politicians touch you would make you think he cared about you but he didn't he cared about himself\nAnd and the moment um you did something to cross him you'd better watch out I'm In and you know that's really how you know he he carried himself through throughout\nI think that's sort of dichotomy is what has created this sort of lower around him as well\nThis image that that he created where you know he was the guy who helped senior citizens carry their groceries into their home he was the guy who cried when when a puppy died but also a man who murdered people viciously and that sort of duality has created this mess around him\nRight now he was I think it\nI think most people would agree are classic psychopath through was a nurse assistant can ultimately care just about himself and those gestures he made that you just mentioned that seemed um helpful in January and we're really self serving to the fullest I mean he was creating a safe zone of comfort and protection there in his immediate world\nWhere people would think well of him\nAnd and and ... grew up around him uh for example and they were cultivated by his his corrupt handlers or the FBI that you know the the biggest one being that I'm he kept drugs out of south well he was the truth is completely opposite I mean he was getting a cut of all the drugs that we're moving through selfie\nUm so you know that's the kind of evil that was in play here\n... yeah so he was on the run for sixteen years and his brother was Senate president here in Massachusetts now as you were mentioning this is a stain on the FBI and the city and it's it's easy to think that this was a Boston bike on but how deep did it all go\nAgain elaborate for us what the city was like that\nWell I yeah I mean he became the most powerful a criminal in the city or from the mid seventies on with the help of of a handful of agents in the Boston officer the FBI you know it was like the city was there's\nUm you have the star agent named John Connelly who still who was in prison today who had recruited him and it was his so called handler and the city was there or Easter\nNow you've reported on and talking with families impacted by Bolger and and his crime organization tell us again who were some of these victims and their families really feel a sense of justice after his conviction in ninth and at twenty Thirteen\nI don't know you'd have to ask the families as far as um for some of them they never knew what happened to their to their relatives their father or their brother or because of\nBolger a would bury them along than the ... river and and their bodies remained undiscovered until one of 'em why does henchmen Kevin which showed them where the bodies were buried I think it was a big moment of course um because he was a fugitive for so many years\nI think twenty eleven was you know the big moment when he was finally captured in Santa Monica where he'd been living under the radar and then you know obviously bringing back to Boston and in in the trial and in twenty Thirteen another big moment\nBut you know I Can't I Can't speak for someone who's lost a father to his violence as is you know rather than out with the death of Bolger if it brings final peace I I just don't know\nIn your view who would want your dad\n[noise] um well sourced reports are\nReferring to might be a someone a fellow in may with mafia ties and it's almost like you know the mafia and elephants never forget that because it was um Bulger's and his partner Steve ... cooperation and informing\nWith the Boston FBI office at a help bring down the ... mafia crime family so there's always been a speculation and wondering\nUm whether the mafia put a target on his back in ... and like I said it seems if this is true that there was an inmate with mafia ties who was responsible for this ah and yeah it's it's like the mafia and elephants never forget\nRight we're hearing you speak about this you know it's it's sobering that that these on the underground connections are still very much dance what came of those those connections between Boulder and the FBI did anything change uh for the FBI to the culture of the FBI change after Bolger\n[noise] um we hope so you know following the this scandal which was the worst informant scandal in the bureau's history um and there were congressional hearings and there were federal court hearings and in the late nineties here in Boston", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radio
