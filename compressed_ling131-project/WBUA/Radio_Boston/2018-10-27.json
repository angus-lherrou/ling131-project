[noise] what she's seen can help kill the must have been taking condition known to us [noise]\nDoes he is related to aging kill a hundred thousand people every day\nBut it clearly number of scientists say it doesn't have to be this way or the policy yes research to carry that remarkable experiments challenging what we thought we knew about how life span\nBillions of dollars being spent all over the well connected to extend on line and this week we bring you some of the world's leading was central to tell me what they found [noise]\nYou'll find out what ... Wang discovered with one and one scientist was busted aging process enough sounds\nAs we answer a question that own if you had probably ...\nPounds alone can we live [noise]\nHeart one\nIt's all in this case\n[noise]\nWe're having a tremendous development in life expectancy we have doubled our lifetime in a very short period and we should really be happy to we were born right on the spot in history [noise]\nFirst thanks that witness cool Christians [noise]\nHe went to the ... for many years then one day decided he'd had enough of treating ... he now runs the Danish aging was set center well he's trying to tell people getting at the first place [noise]\n\nWe'll end with aging ... from the outside [noise] what is actually due to a ...\nWell ... accumulation of damage from the molecular level that didn't spread to the\nCells and tissues and organs and to the whole hawking is Mitch kind of all the hits or that we get all their time on the molecules and then when we can't keep up with the repairing than a staging starch\nWhen does it all began when do we start to decline that is\nSo I'm thirty seven seven it's the guns in east\nYeah now do you stop Oh thanks for the good news [laughter] sorry\nAnd that's more bad news once we start to go downhill week I downhill fast\nIt's twice it's dangerous being forced you to compare to thirty five then again it's twice its dangers being forty nine compared to forty two and so on so your risk of death is increasing eleven twelve percent every year\nAnd a damn their mortality risk levels off around one hundred one hundred and five where the yearly risk of dying it's about fifty sixty percent so if you really optimistic tied then you could say that it never get any worse than fifty fifty\nAnd when you're thinking about these on that's a lot stacked against him when you age as your molecules tissues and organs get tired and damaged you susceptible to a whole range of diseases\nThe studies show actually they are like additional Oregon on to us because they can't even friends how well the way they have\nAnd all of a show how we respond to different medications and sometimes they make us sick but on the other hand they also play that important to keep U.S House the\nMain one wanted to know whether a micro biome has an effect on how we age so she decided to do an experiment and what she needed was an animal with a short life span she chose a particular kind of one\nThey only live about two to three wakes felt that make them wanna from law does not perfect subject yeah [noise]\n\nShe wanted to find out what would happen if you go to the worms micro biology wouldn't live longer [noise]\nShe chose one of the kinds of bacteria that lives inside one gun tweaked its genes to make different varieties and then fed them to separate groups of one [noise]\n\nA few weeks later she went to see the ones expecting them all to be dead now they've reached the end of the lifespan [noise]\nI was so excited because when we find him feel cases animal I'm not that they're still alive when we checked them I was jumping up down because he just totally unexpected and how long did some of the ones live full about fifty percent longer fifty percent yeah those\nExtraordinary so you had the most of the ones who are living for three weeks and there were some that live to fool\nFour and a half four and high school yes I'm was that much more than you would have expected\nYes I think scientists sometimes we do research it's kind of like gambling [laughter] so\nWe have some crazy idea than you know wait wait that ... way to test them but you never know whether your idea is ride around and those moments where you find that reads out that's the best moment\nAnd so they went on to test other things would have different microbe by him give worms will Tony a longer life with a better quality of life in their final days\nSo the way we do it we can look at how well they they have when they're older the worm when they're getting older their physical activity has declined so they move slower and also become a little bit of a card in it [noise]\nShe's got a video of some of these elderly ones [noise] and she's right you can tell their own blog younger one's regular energetically around them the older ones move slowly their skin sucking if they go [noise]\nI don't think they show rank house but it can tell their body structure is not as good as it used to be\nThe ones with the new microbiomes most any Rickles around will quickly and their old age but they were less susceptible to disease to\n[noise] make wine is now carrying out tests on mice to see where the changing them like right by and extend their life and so there's a chance that one day don't just might be able to prescribe pills which do the same for us\nSome of my colleagues say okay you know I think people can they've ... say ... years so personally I think why inject for me is already the number [noise] so how long can we live for\nAbout ... to get us to a hundred and stuff you find\nIn how different micro biome could give us fifty percent more time on us [noise]\nThe bases inventions or a balance of dressing the symptoms of aging not to cool well then if we can go straight to the tools [noise]\nTime for a final expert witness [noise]\nOh\nHeart for fighting your federal budget oh\n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of people have had got in touch with me that Sloan hiring is professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter in the u._k. scientist whose work on an aging because a lot of people like scientists before now it's been a bit of a highly ...\nThat this is a possibility and not wanting to get on that I think it's going to be huge [noise]\nI Want to call begins with the building blocks of all these cells\nSo basically the organs might have different type of tissue your tissues made of different types of cells now cells get told that some cells and say you live our kidneys or whatever will be dividing to replace some cells to kind of dynamic I didn't want to know the more time to cell divides the greater chance of becoming what we would ...\nSome lessons comes from the ... which means to grow old and that's exactly what happened to these cells they've grown old income to the end of that life cycle but instead of dying they hung around I'm putting in a destructive ...\nThey can actually communicate with the cells ran them so it's in essence ... will basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affect all of the cells random side it's almost like self thing I I'm an old south and you guys have been around here about the same sort of a matter of time as I have so you must be able to say you should be thinking about ... does well\nWow so it's almost sort of contaminating them with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive the cells around as ...\nAs we grow older more and more of a cells becomes innocent until up buddy is overwhelmed\nDo they make the cells around them HPV Austin\nThese innocent cells still functioning as they should which is still to be one of the things that leads to diseases like dimension ... type two diabetes\n\nProfessional Harry's wants to know whether she could get these cells to stump behaving like a little cells behave more like a young one\nHappening that was I had a new is that true in my lap and she was still finding a fates and we have some old south and I had some chemicals\nAnd she suggested ... percent shit that some of these chemicals on these skin cells\nAnd see what happened\nAbout a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me\nAnd when you see the microscope what were you expecting to say\nThat they would still my old south so they look kind of lacy under a microscope\nAnd we have a particular die that we can put on our fell coaches the tens blue if that's in essence so when I was expecting to see\nIs that the south would be so blue and still looking old and she will they went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like young south to professor Harry said oh no you've got the wrong south these young sales go do it again and that and she did\nAnd she did it I think again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again she ... about me and I still I'm moving convince because we were not truly ... suspicious scientists and yeah they were taught to to basically throw rocks that you're right there and if it's bad that it probably ...\nHow many rogue city search uh probably about nine [laughter] she did it about nine times and finally I kind of looked at them to actually maybe you're on to something had\nShe'd done something that no one thought possible\nShe'd effectively rejuvenated old thousand ten minutes young south\nAnd they said why loan Harry's just now getting phone calls from scientists and invested from all over the well is the first experiment this reverse aging in human cells they think a discovery could be the secret to a much longer life\nWhen it comes to a lifespan think law in a hurry so it'd be the most ambitious of all our expert witnesses instead\nAs human beings I think we have enough trouble maximum lifespan so she would I Want this research to end up and he's a new generation of empty degenerative drugs with sort of way off yet but in the future for things like dementia and cardiovascular disease what I'm hoping is that\nThis will allow us one treatment which will address several of those at once so that people would have died on Lake will then go on to live than not loaded lifetime so how long can we live\nWe know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty two someone's already got that song from what we cut that thinking is lucky to ride with the discovery of an expert witnesses alone one day we may be able to replace the damaged organs\nTake supplements that give us a useful micro buying stuff ourselves aging how many years ... well if we go to bally's prediction if you're a millennia like me born in Nineteen eighty one you should be able to get to a hundred and Seventy five\nBy the time we get ten and Twenty one sixteen who knows what else will be possible\n\nThis inquiry was presented by me having to marry him and ... my best to take a sentence and if he wants to listen to more episodes do

D. N. A. and also the ... to ... research is over teeth because what we have no is a possibility\nTo identify her through some relatives if one would find that and I think too that what we have learned we uh are quite sure as I understand it that she was born somewhere in Germany\nThat she went to school in ...\nAnd that she was a little bit older than when I saw earlier\nAnd for me I said right there used to use my imagination to solve mysteries that I have created my sense that there was so that the other people have written I can see I'm quite possible picture or who this woman was\nIf I should fifty didn't some words born in Germany around Ninety thirty three years old or something like that when a hit or got into power or not to Seventy three\nTo family so to that they would leave the country because of that perhaps because there were Jews and they went to the closest neighbor country which is ... where she went to school\nAnd more than that I understand we cannot stay to find from or what we have about DNA and also to a research is that of the day\nWe know that the wasted woman who was found dead in no way and not to Seventy and one of the the arrest\nOr not many of us I've had is that she had had some connection vivid Israeli Secret Service I myself have proposed to wants that perhaps she was searching for old now see people in Norway or perhaps\nComing from Germany to Norway at that point the auto solution or order a theory is that she was searching for a ride the terrorists which the secret service of Israel and did very clearly two years after midnight to Seventy two when I was a killing in ...\nI Want to do you imagine that one of her family was killed in a concentration camp during the war she is ... shows survivor\nAnd would be very it's not easy if she would be possible\nThe Israeli Secret Service off to the east coast is just the crime writers imagination working on what we know that you know I still think that this is not perhaps the recruits but part of the troops\nUm\nWell we have come a long way we haven't found any yet but she does she on their tuition and when we started doesn't\nYes and I will not give up now after two years of this project so definitely we will continue to look into deletes we have yes\nWe've amassed so much evidence so much testimony took his so many witnesses said this picture of the way she moved to life and yet despite all these clues and possibilities that story does still feel like we're all just sort of slipped through your fingers still don't know who she really yes\nYes and I still haven't given up hope on bringing her back something that she has lost and that is a name and the dignity\n... it's such a tragic tale and somebody who\nDespite the best that we haven't found anyone who you notice and no one came forward you and you have and you know maybe this is a woman who lived a life solid tree existence she had to come tax she she met them she passed information\nBut she was the lone wolf and ... and who knows when when things seem to unravel at the end and whether she was killed all she took her own life it just felt like\nEverything was just falling apart around\nHer identity you started to slip or just everything she kept together managed to for the way and an had life for him\nBut things are very sad story and I also would love to\nDo to bring back at your identity and to memorialize it properly I think the feedback we've been catching more people care about so now than ever cared about them but I still stunned by what we said at the very beginning someone out there still\nKnows who she was with another family member or an associate somebody has the answer for\nI think so too somebody knows something about her and what happened to her and I do hope that that person you know it does pass and make contact with them to help us solve this case\n\nThis is the last episode of the Syrian two years of research has gone into we haven't given an investigation is continuing\nUnless we sat right back in episode one we'd like to solve this with your help wherever possible\nA Facebook group will remain open and welcome to join his\nFacebook dot com slash death and I study\nAnd our email to specifically on this case is definitely nice finally\nBBC dot com\nThanks so much listening for following this remarkable story with the [noise]\n\nJust did not rally an original ... he made by the b._b._c. was setting and and I can't\nIt's presented by near the end mighty down some kind and original music is by feel kind of\nAdditional investigation by the ... and they can be seen that from and I came to the editor I like\nThe b._b._c. was that his editor if jamon now\n\nIf you don't make I don't know McDonalds [noise]", "show_name": "Radio Boston", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "27"}
