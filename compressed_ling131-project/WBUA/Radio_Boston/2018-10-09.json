more information is available at Newman's Own foundation dot org [noise]\nThis is radio Boston I'm Evan harlot after all the divisiveness and turmoil Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court justice haven't been approved by the Senate and sworn into office over the weekend\nWelcome to the cabinet era of the Supreme Court were five conservative justices are poised to out vote therefore\nAnd more liberal colleagues in a way that friends to turn a venerable American institution into yet another arena for partisan brawling or at least that's the fear Justice Kagan spoke on friday at Princeton University and reflected on this new Supreme Court one without the truth center\nThere has been a person who found the center or people couldn't protect in that sort of way and that's enabled the court to look as though and was not owned by one side or another and a and wasn't did impartial and neutral and fair\nKagan says the court has to be cognizant of how will now be perceived\nAll of us needs to be aware of that every single one of us\nAnd to realize how Russia\nAh the courts a legitimacy is you know the all the we don't have an army and we don't have any money and the only way we get people to do what we say that they should do is because people respect us and respect our fairness\nSo can this court stand above the political fray and maintain its legitimacy or will it fall prey to the part of the ship that splintering this country joining me now is Rosanna color oh she's a professor of law Suffolk University\nAlso with us from Washington DC as Garrett ... he's a professor of constitutional law at the University of Baltimore school of law hello Garrett\nAm and how are you\nI'm doing great gals I start with you because you wrote a piece over the weekend or where you talked about how your sense of the court legitimacy was shaped by your experience growing up in the segregated south and and watching the Supreme Court force communities to accept integration\nWhy start there why didn't you your senses the legitimacy start there\nWell I you know I started there because I start there that is why I as a very young boy I think it was an unusual time to grow up I became aware of the Supreme Court I became aware of that other people around me were very critical of the court they they they thought that the justices were wrong you know I I remember as a boy seeing the\nBillboards that said impeach Earl Warren and so forth and yet I also knew growing up in a relatively small southern town I knew the federal judges who were enforcing or trying to enforce brown versus board of education and the other desegregation opinions\nSo I think we we have footage from that so let's play a clip of Kavanaugh at the confirmation hearings\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit\nFueled with a parent ten up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars that money from outside left wing opposition groups\nWho speaks to what you were saying was on it which is she raises the political stakes himself by invoking political differences and it's right\nExplicitly literally that just gives you pull a few phrases that revenge of the Clintons you know left wing groups justice is try to avoid terms like that\nAt all costs and he's a sitting judge even while he's saying that suffer litigants to think that they're going to go in and get a fair hearing I think that yeah the ... there's a good reason for them to be a skeptical about that and when you call that out that's when you start to really erode the fundamental legitimacy of the institution\nWhen finally not everyone agreed let let's go to David Frum Natick he's got a an opinion on this David how're you doing\nGreat thank you very much for taking my call um I just wanted to comment on a really legitimately burn 'em I personally don't believe that there should be any legitimately burns of the debris court\nAnd the reason I feel that way because judge Kavanaugh then the judge at a very high level than arming or\nA very long time and they're never been any concern about impartiality on 'em and just a comment about the statement that a judge Kavanaugh I made a during the confirmation hearing I I Believe that it very difficult upgrade\nA personal and professional I'm feeling and I think what somebody attacked personally and Douglas family\nI think he's going to respond one way I\nI truly hope and believe that you will respond very differently when he jumped\nThank you David and David raises a good point which is when the nomination was announced a legal scholars from really across the spectrum came out to say he's a he's a respected Scott ... for a legal field he's qualified he's competent that as\nSoon as the ... the politics was hidden behind\nA this these claims about competence had been for a long time so I think there is now this argument that maybe it's actually a good thing that Kavanaugh has come out and indirectly political\nIt strips the veil away from a court that has long been political and got all ask for your sense is there a sense where actually this is just exposing the politics has always been there and maybe that's not such a bad thing\nYou know I'm I'm trying I'm sitting here trying to be a good sport and to find the silver lining in this and I ain't got\nA electron tries\nYes no I appreciate it but you know I think what a what Kavanaugh did or in that speech he crossed a line that Clarence Thomas never crossed\nA he he pulled back\nA mask if that's a mask if that's the way all the justices are then the Supreme Court has no legitimacy and I think you know to to show the the degree of to where she crossed the line you just have to consider that that Justice John Paul Stevens Ninety eight years old man who is seen\nYou know maybe almost a quarter of the Supreme Court's history or said you know shortly before the vote that that he did not believe that anyone who is capable of making that statement\nOught to be on the Supreme Court I was stunned when I saw that and there's one thing for me to say that he shouldn't have done it John Paul Stevens a lifelong Republican\nUh to say that that are specific nominee did not belong in the court we are in uncharted waters are and you know justice Kavanaugh is no longer the well respected judge he was before that speech he is now the person who said those things\nAnd he uh is going to have to deal with that legacy\nWas that you see a silver lining here\nNot seeing the silver lining neither trying really hard time selling this but nobody's buying you know you want to\nVIX is that we have two branches that are explicitly political we vote for them we we ... campaign\nBut then we have this third branch that's different special\nUh and if we get to a place as we really are right now or where the law is what five justices say it is and it just depends which five justices those are then I think we're in a very dangerous place in terms of our perception of and the reality of the rule of law that there is this\nBy in of of of of our citizenry that there really are principles out there that are just ... untrue and not just a a headcount each time that the issue comes up\nSo what is to be done then Garrett are packing the court um term limited appointments enlist investigations what what should people be thinking about\nWell you know I I think that it's a little early to start about packing the court if I uh you know I live right down the street from Congress last time I saw there was a bunch of Republicans there and not enough Democrats\nUnit a pack a phone booth or it it's probably early to think about that but I Do think that the dialogue that is now taking place ... which began at a low level after Bush versus Gore but has now picking up speed about you\nKnow what is the role we want to a court to play in our democracy or how did this happen you know that it's not at all clear that the framers of the constitution anticipated that uh the Supreme Court would\nWould be this kind of arbiter of constitutionality um maybe we want to consider the I'm a jurisdiction of the court maybe we want to consider not you know that the justices should be active justices for Eighteen years and then re may injustices but no longer shit on cases\nAre after that in order to ensure the turnover on the court\nThat's a good discussion I Would hate to have it framed purely in\nApart as in terms of when you know you watch when we get a majority we are going to investigate the living daylights out of you that I don't like to hear a and I don't think it it serves anybody well\nIt may it may not or anybody well it may happen anyway that is if the Democrats take the house they will have the power to continue investigating Kavanaugh's pass attack let's let's go to a caller a Mike from Framingham is something to say on the subject Mike how you doing\nHi I'm doing just great to hear other than my workers load after this non [laughter] with the\nUm ... it's a it's just a minute incredible injustice or any other candidate would have been gone\nAfter ... ... you're just as you're alone never mind we're why cities personally record just as the lie so it's just the\nWay it just on our mind but there was one part of it but I Believe that Democrats drop the ball and Mr White house Senator Whitehouse and nobles triangle and cabin all hesitated didn't said drinking\nAnd he moved right on now you Mr White house would have to explain how you win devil's triangle and how you lose doubles trying ... how do you win that how do you lose that was all games there's a winner and loser the Drake you you know you can look at it going up\nYeah drink or do when I got all my really good sense and I I mean I'm going to ask about this what happened how they pushed harder are they going to continue pushing ... do you see\nI mean this is a comment that so many people make that the Democrats you know come to a knife fight with the dill pickle you know in that they don't really know how to fight back in the trenches in that way and there were certainly opportunities to get a more rigorous cross examination there and reveal\nPlainly to the listening public the degree of deception that that the justice now justice was engaging in a but they just didn't have the stomach for it and in addition I think that format of the five minute quickie questions was never going to really give anyone to kind of attraction that your caller would have liked to see\nA going forward you know the question is it the Democrats just wait it out and get their turn and when they get their turn they pack on their justice is\nUh I I think that there's definitely an appetite for something a little bit more\nAh a brutal and at that as you suggested reopening of these investigations if and when the Democrats have the house\nOr a continuing exploration of whether there are other accusations or of the testimony of the justice in South on the other hand no one wants to see that no one wants to see someone saying a sitting justice is going to be interrogated about perjury so it's a no win\nThat's Rosanna ... she's a professor of law Suffolk University thanks where was I don't think you also with

R. dot org\nMost business owners most corporations are run by people who actually pay their employees first and then pay themselves afterwards a small business owners people are seeing a wage increases they're very happy right now and you're starting to see consumer confidence rise because of that\nAnd I think that shows that people are getting the wage increases and the new jobs being created is really helping our economy and giving us\nA chance to be more competitive not just in Massachusetts but also with other states and internationally\nLet me ask about one more issue and then we'll wrap up but I Want to ask you about immigration and family separation at the border I Know you're for border security that you support the president's approach on this did the Trump Administration go too far here\nThat was actually policy in place under the Obama administration that thankfully when it was brought to the attention of the Trump Administration they seized that kept kept families together in my opinion is that a a solution like what Ted Cruz did which was say let's get more judges to the border so we can process people more quickly and keep these families together I think that was a great solution but\nIn my opinion a secure border ... eliminates the temptation for families to potentially take this risky an effort to come into our country illegally\nBut we all saw images of families being torn apart kids in cages I mean do you have any issues with the way the White House is going about this\nUh look I I've talked to border patrol agents I've talked to immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents they all feel that the president's efforts to try to actually address secure border or is the right way to go I mean there has been fence authorization in the past with Republicans and Democrats are both supporting that there was miles and miles of fence\nBuilt in Texas and in in California and Arizona the fact of the matter is it's just not a complete border and fully secure border I think all he's trying to do is make sure that we\nTake immigration laws seriously as possible if anybody wants to become a citizen of the United states let's bring them in but let's have it done legally\nJeff DOS question and this gets back to some of this rhetoric that we're hearing in this current political moment the president settled more than one occasion that the media is the enemy of the people who agree with that\n[laughter] [noise] I Would not say the media is the enemy I unfortunately feel like the media's become almost as divided in some ways uh on one side of the other I think that is a problem I\nReally hate the fact that people go on social media Twitter Facebook and feel that they can attack even their neighbors right now and and unfortunately we feel like it's more divided country than it's ever been and I\nI I certainly want to do what I came down in Washington to reduce those tensions\nAre focused on the state of Massachusetts what's good about it what can be great about it\nFor the future but it's important to speak out and called the president out when you make statements like that I mean because that comes from the starling is where all the media is the enemy of the people\nI've been at those Trump rallies where he's gotten the whole audience to turn around and sort of a junior at us I'm not saying feel sorry for me I'm just saying it's a scary thing when the leader of the free world does that\nMean first of all we have free speech and of course that allows for the media but at the same time I think free speech also means you can question the media and for a long time it felt like\nCertain aspects of the media focused on attacking one party and I'm I'm not trying to say it's about party but unfortunately it does seem like that can be the case in times and I think what the president was doing was actually just letting people know hey there was a problem and I feel like the media's part of it are\nWell Geoff Diehl Massachusetts state representative for the seventh Plymouth district and he is the Republican nominee for the U.S Senate Jeff thanks thanks so much for coming in the Persian retiring thank you\nStay with us there's more ahead I live in horror with this is radio Boston [noise]\n\n\nThis is Ninety nine W.

I mean if the ... the ... or ...\nYou don't need it was a way to get revenue without having to raise taxes but what you're also doing his mortgaging in a way to control that you have over ... you know these fundamental assets which are really monopoly is it's not as though somebody that's on the gasoline can arbitrarily just find some other\nSolution to their to their heat on in their electricity I said I mean you could put\nA solar panels and and things like that but it's not something you can do in the next twenty four to forty eight hours\nRight that's what makes it such a such an interesting space on some regular respective and labor relations act as a private company but then the operating in an open market and there are limits\nNow in the meantime though right ... deep you has stepped in to say as you put a moratorium on activities a national grid activities that means\nNew business hook like this this is going to affect people in a in a very clear way right businesses are going to struggle to get gas hookups people who buy houses what may struggle to get gas hook ups in the meantime I don't know how long it's going to last um can it lasts for a while is this the only leverage in the state has over a private company I mean I\nMean the other lever that that that they had was regulating 'em up\nYou know a price increase rate increase and saying to them you don't know no rate increase so you could do that you could say rather than you know you could say uh you could do something like that I mean it was fascinating than in labor history if it was the other way around there are numerous occasions in the\nIn the history of the United states where workers will go out on strike\nAnd the company would go to the federal government and say\nYou know this is a threat to national security this is a threat to some aspect of our economy and the federal government would orders are workers back to work using very obscure labor laws to say this is a threat to public safety\nOr so there was a big cold strike years ago it was something that everybody who's read any purposes and the federal government for nothing about\nI'm going to workers who you know we're out on strike you exercising their legal right\nTo strike because they know you have to go back to work there have been a number of big deals drugs where the company will say no you have to go back to work in the order what's called the labor history a cooling off period you know cooler heads prevail figure this out you guys were watching\nSo maybe this is where we're headed on that side\nYeah maybe this is where we're headed if things continue to escalate a state interventions requiring workers to go back to work that's historian Robert foreign distinguished university professor at UMass Lowell thanks so much for joining us Robert thank you say was with us there's more ahead I nothing Horowitz this is radio Boston\n[noise] [noise]\nThis is Ninety point nine W.

the question what's next\n[noise]\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm Evan Horowitz consider this mix of combustible elements\nA major league university charges of discrimination in the future of affirmative action it's all coming to a head next week\nWas the beginning of a trial charging Harvard with discriminating against Asian American applicants Harvard denies it seems they evaluate all candidates in a holistic way and that they are pursuing their establish legal rights created a diverse student body but students for fair admissions that's the anti affirmative action group that brought the lawsuit\nThey disagree arguing that while Asian Americans have the best academic records\nThey have the lowest admission rate among any race that apply to Harvard we're going to speak with folks on both sides beginning today with Ilya Shapiro he's a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Kato Institute\nNow she wrote in the wall Street Journal he thinks quote Harvard is true discriminating\nAnd quote and its admission process he joins us from St Louis how you doing\nI'm doing okay so the tropics off next week so this is going to be a pretty big deal yeah\nCould turn out to be a big deal I mean let's let's start from the beginning before we get to the stakes are what what exactly does students for fair\nAdmissions take issue with in the Harvard admissions process what what is that they're trying to contest\nWhile the Supreme Court over the years has set various standards about\nUh how race can be considered in admissions decision that has to be one of many factors that can't be a decisive factor can't be an automatic points are quota system or things like that and then of course whenever you're way or what\nOr to the expertise of administrators but actually drill down to see that race neutral alternatives works for that the use of races narrow and and things like that so what were what the allegations share or that Harvard is using race in per miserably\nAnd especially Asian American applicants are being harmed because if you take the same level of qualification including graves scores extracurricular is here to service all the interviews all that stuff\nOr Asian kid in a much lower rate than applicants from other uh uh ethnic backgrounds and and if indeed Harvard has toy it that way and that was deemed to violate existing jurisprudence without even opening the door to larger questions about\nShould the constitution allow race preferences at all\nSo it was just so I'm understanding it's not that is impermissible for universities public and private to strive for diversity and to take race into account in that way it's that there are narrow constraints on how they can do it and that Harvard is violating the narrow constraints\nThat's right and they the expert are brought in by the plaintiffs by the students for fair admissions a regression analysis based on data or something that was already public somebody got from Harvard during the discovery process that litigation\nShowing that there is no explanation that he can now this is why we're having a trial to find out from Harvard but he can't find an explanation of why admission rates are what they are um uh without taking into account and permissible a racial discrimination\nSo Harvard there defending their quote unquote whole person evaluation that is their approach to applicants that looks at the you know the whole person where race is one of many factors so here's Harvard's president because on radio Boston in July or some of these factors\nWe seek students who come from broad socio economic backgrounds because that's part of our mission is to create opportunity or we seek students who are geographically diverse um we seek students who are ethnically diverse\nHaving all sorts of students come together in a learning environment is the function of Mars missions process\nApologies to Larry back out whose name doesn't rhyme with my car but Ilya do you think there's value in having diversity in an incoming class\nDepends how you define diversity I think there's definitely value and having people who want to major at\nWell let's wait let's narrow in ethnic and racial diversity you think there's value in having\nRacial and ethnic diversity in an income I\nThink there is value in having different background I don't think it's there's value in judging people based on skin color that's what for me comes out\nAnd you acknowledge though that the Supreme Court has said that that is a permissible a focus of college admissions or no it\nIs it is as one factor among many and and all of that uh what's a kind of tricky with what the Supreme Court has said and this is specifically a after the University of Michigan case as Fifteen Years ago it throughout this mechanical application of points out for a raise\nBut it allowed and encouraged this kind of holistic review which is a Harvard actually invented holistic review about a hundred years ago as a method of potentially capping the number of Jewish admission so history is sort of rhyming in a in a certain sense there but the problem with the Supreme Court set up\nBy allowing this holistic review or the process is a lot less transparent are and some allege including students for fair admissions that the racial preferences are even greater than we're Harvard to use that kind of mechanical points or or for their system or that the Supreme Court threw out\nFor many lobstermen like holler life jackets getting the way up their work never even
