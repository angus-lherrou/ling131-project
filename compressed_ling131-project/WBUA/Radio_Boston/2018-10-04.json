of Flint, Michigan and communities around the world more mutt dot org\n[noise]\nThis is radio Boston I'm Anthony Brooks and we'll begin today with a potential cost of a valid question that has Massachusetts voters closely divided question one would set limits on the numbers of patients assigned to nurses at hospitals\nAnd other health care facilities across the state advocates including some nurses community groups in a long list of elected officials\nSay the measure would improve patient care now comes in study from the independent Massachusetts health policy commission\nIt concludes that if question one were to pass hospitals would have to hire as many as three thousand additional nurses and the cost it could run as high as nine hundred fifty million dollars a year\nThat's almost a billion dollars if you're keeping score at home do your view are common health editor carry Goldberg has been looking at the study and was at the health policy commission today and she's with us now I care hey Anthony thoughts dig into that nine hundred and fifty million dollar figure a bit more how did the commission will come up with that number\nSo first of all the Nineteen fifty million at the high end of a range they're saying it could cost between six hundred and Seventy six and Ninety nine hundred and forty nine million\nThat's a big contrast to what the proponents of the ballot measure ...\nWhich is more like between thirty five and forty seven million dollars right now that's a big contract yes and and it's quite hefty sum even when you put it in the context of Massachusetts having some of the most expensive health care on earth\nAlready which by the way is why we have this health policy commission as a watchdog on health costs in the first place now David our back into the director for research and cost trends that the commission\nEstimates that the costs could amount\nTo just over one percent of ...\nNow one percent of them sound like a lot\nBut it's one or maybe a little closer to two percent of a lot of sixty one billion dollars or as our backs that an understated Lee I Would say that a substantial amount and it's up to three point five percent of total hospitals spending\nAll right so what does that consist of all that's been\nWritten several elements so as you said hospitals would have to hire a couple of three thousand more registered nurses the pay for nurses would likely go up because that's basic economics right there would be more demand for them and if a similar law in California is any indication\nNurses income might go up by an average of maybe like four percent or so\nAnd it would cost money to have this new staffing ratio system in place in hospitals and then there would be some one time costs like it could cost millions to put in like a tool to help us that's how sick patients are and therefore what the nurse ratio should be for a given unit\nRight right ... interesting a flake is bringing that up and he's of course one of the the the key swing votes last friday\nHe was the one who sort of shocked the world when he pushed for a delay to allow the FBI investigation\nSo what do we know about ah the FBI investigation so far first of all when do we know when it's expected to conclude one we might see something about it from it will we see something from it\nI've heard some chatter amongst senators today that it could wrap up as early as today and\nUh the the report with first go to the White House and pretty soon it would be here on Capitol Hill with the according to\nSenate majority leader McConnell available for every senator to look at try to lead won't be released to the public however we don't know exactly when that's going to end the FBI has not been a you know speaking publicly about this investigation as it usually doesn't but\nEveryone is is kind of anxious to see when it comes out and people are on guard perhaps to potentially land today if not later\nRight and so he'll water lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez who who is also made\nAllegations against judge Kavanaugh what are they saying about the FBI investigation so far\nThey are arguing that the FBI is not conducting a thorough investigation that it's not following up on requests from them\nOr for follow up and for interviews to speak with the FBI that it hasn't you know pursued other leave that they consider relevant to the investigation or tried to contact other witnesses that they believe you know could corroborate um or at least shed some light on\nThe the allegations here so they have said publicly that um they you know they worry the FBI's hands or being tied and that it's not conducting a thorough investigation and those concerns I've got a garden and may have had announced critics here on Capitol Hill\nRight meanwhile a Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell talking about a ... vote as early as this week or how soon could that come in and do we know if it'll be a straight a floor vote or good Republican leadership take some kind of different rooms here [noise]\nWell it would have to eventually be a floor vote on the confirmation but what McConnell has said is the full Senate will vote on the nomination this week now if if we want to parse that that means\nIt could go up until Saturday it's not clear whether McConnell is talking about a final a Senate confirmation vote or if he's talking about beginning the process which are involved with a procedural vote\nFollowed by thirty hours of debate this week so a lot of questions now I Will say McConnell has been very confident that cab and I will be confirmed that he has maintained that confidence he does not have fifty votes yet\nAssuming flake is still a yes he said he's going to support the the nomination but he was an FBI investigation first assuming he's still a yes McConnell can only counter forty nine votes right now because Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski had not yet decided it's very likely to come down to those two if\nA one if both of them vote no then the nomination is probably dead at one of them vote snow on the nomination could still survive if the other books yet so I'm a you know than you are watching the site and wants to know how it's going to come down keep your eyes on those two\nInteresting so I I Want to come back to President Trump sort of clearly doubling down on on the strategy of whipping up his base I guess at that rally in Mississippi um where he criticized Waze forty also said\nUm that it's a scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of\nUm what what effect do you think all of\nThis might have on the coming election what's what's your view on that so he'll [noise]\nThe president is trying to counter the argument that uh you know and his critics and critics of Brett Kavanaugh are making\nWhich is that if you know there there is a serious a possibility that Brett Kavanaugh may be\nAssaults her and he does not deserve to be on the Supreme Court not what Trump is pointing out is that someone who you know someone like happened not deserve the presumption of innocence and his view\nAnd it could set a bad precedent for men down the line if Kavanaugh is denied Supreme Court seat in this case or ... by by kind of virtue of presuming to have been guilty um so it's kind of if you know\nWomen are coming forward and an increasing number of the actual assault there is a rampant problem and that women deserve to be hurt or they deserve to be believed he kind of trying to flip that around and say well what about the young man what about the young boys who worry that they could be falsely accused of something\nI'm stuck with like all that is you know of course the argument here is not about ... having a freedom that is not a criminal trial where you go to jail this is about whether you get the promotions so the standard or you know and and the view that as a as a critic should be higher yeah\nMeanwhile are very quickly I Want to ask you very quickly about the New York times story which did this major investigation alleging among other things that Donald Trump's wealth was not self made but was the result of a huge fortunate he inherited from his dad and probably because\nAccording to the times he engaged in a series of suspect\nTax schemes now another time in history and allegation like this against a sitting president would be seen as a huge deal how\nWas the White House responded to this\nYeah there's a lot to unpack the times called it outright fraud I talked to a bunch of tax lawyers and found that um\nYou know the the activities that you are an organization engaged and to um you know limit the amount of estate taxes that Trump would have paid for instance or a very much outside the bounds of the law according to the times reporting and it also goes against President Trump's\nArgument that he is a self made man that has well was only the only a tiny bit of it in his words what inherited when that does\nNot appear to be the case according to this investigation the White House has responded by a by lashing out by attacking the times by talking to press kind of a a familiar captain and used in the past right\nWell so he'll ... national political reporter for Bloomberg Politics thank you so much for joining us today we're very grateful\nThank you\nAll right now the testimonies of ah the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh are at odds are just say the least Ford says she has a hundred percent confident she was assaulted by Kavanaugh when they were in high school\nBut Kavanaugh vehemently denies that it ever happened one way to reconcile the opposing narratives is the so called blackout theory that Kevin I did it but doesn't remember because he blacked out from drinking too much in last friday Senate hearing prosecutor Rachel Mitchell\nBrought up the possibility when she asked cabin on this question have you ever pass out from drinking\nI Love salad would be no but I've gone to sleep but I've never blacked out that's the that's the allegation a and a sense that's wrong\nBut what exactly is a black what do we know about it the answer these questions we're joined by Dr Richard said he's chair of Boston University school of public health department of community health sciences\nAnd an addiction medicine specialist knee joined us from the ... school of public a health a doctor say it's good to have you thanks for being with us sure it's a pleasure to be here\nSo we just start with a basic definition if one exist ... what does it mean to blackout first\nYou know I mean the question that you heard asked there was really the wrong question it's not the same and this is a key point it's not the same as passing out ... blackout is when there's something that you don't remember\nAnd it happened when you were drinking and it happens when you drink a lot very quickly something that might happen in the drinking game when you drink ten or Fifteen shots one and a half ounces of eighty proof liquor or something\nIn that range a and to all around you you appear normal or intoxicated that is that yours you're walking and talking and responding to cues and your environment and and people who are with you\nA bit later the next day or someone asks if you remember what happened some specific events and you don't recall it not blackout so\nWhat does that mean in terms of what's happening chemically in the brain that we're walking and functioning I mean maybe were stumbling around a little bit maybe are words are were slurring are words a little bit but your point is we appear to be conscious conscious essentially but we don't remember a big chunk of what happened so what's going on with the brain\nYou know I mean I I think that we used to believe that alcohol simply base the brain and had sort of a general effect\nOn the entire brain and and that is true at very high levels\nOf but it seems to have some specific effects on receptors and narrow the transmission and a while I Can't really tell you the exact nerve transmission that's that's involved here\nWhat we do know is that there are parts of the brain and involved in learning and and making either short term or longer term memory that are affected and what happens here is the person knows what's going on but the experience doesn't get put into long term\nMemory so they might remember that if you're there in front of somebody and you ask them what happened just now\nBut if you ask them the next day it's not there because it didn't get put into a the hippocampus as a part of the brain where we're learning happens and doesn't stay there for the long term\n... so do we know or something about who experience of these these blackouts in the words are some people who drink more susceptible to them than others\nUh he actually said yesterday that Nathan of all the will start game for most likely if they play the Yankees\nBut if they play the athletics he's not quite willing to make that commitment so it really could kind of depend on who the hitters are which team they're facing and all that he also talked about the home field advantage how much the team loves playing at Fenway they hit better there\nUh the crowd obviously helps give them energy as they go forward right yeah I mean that's got to be a huge in this and the red Sox did incredibly well it's in part to seize fifty seven and twenty four on the air so what about\nChris say all the teams ac had a couple of students on the disabled list he didn't seem to be throwing as well when he came off the disabled list toward the end of the season ... what do you say about him\nSo Alex course that he is not at all worried and he's a hundred percent sure that sale is going to be ready to go come playoff time but I think yeah exactly [laughter] I think it's important to look at the contacts there you're talking about he went on a deal to him\nOr he came back for one started against Baltimore through Ninety eight Ninety nine miles an hour ... almost immediately back on the DL with shoulder information and since coming back that second time his velocity has really been down\nA court said that specifically in this final start against Baltimore last Wednesday that uh what he saw out of sale actually despite the performance and the down velocity was pretty encouraging\nThe fact that when the game was on the line and the last one and he hit Ninety for a few times he wasn't Ninety nine but he went from eighty eight eighty nine to Ninety four I Know is there I Know is there and the fact that he came to me right away you know after the game is over and he he\nHe felt that an amount and he saw it on the video I'm like okay you know this was this was mechanics\nSo or whether it's mechanics or an injury there is no doubt about the fact that silk velocity has been noticeably down in that Baltimore start last week his fastball average just over Ninety miles an hour that's the lowest average basketball of his entire career ... you're scaring me we've got to move on to the\nNew England patriots or for a moment or two of the patriots quieted critics on Sunday by blowing out the Miami Dolphins thirty eight to seven the pets are now two and two on the air how big was that when for them on Sunday\nThere was actually a huge win what you're saying something for September football uh I've been a patriots fan for a long time as well the steam always kind of struggles out the gate and by November December of their clicking on all cylinders but had they lost in Miami they would have been down three games to a division opponent that is a tough hill to climb in a sixteen games even\nAre so I got to ask you a quickly before uh we go about uh Celtics dark Kyrie Irving he made headlines last year when he sat on a podcast\nThat he believed the earth was flat he's given different answers didn't stand about whether we actually believe that or not but he addressed it at the Forbes under thirty some it on Monday what do you say\nWell interesting I bet you didn't think we'd be talking flatter than a sports segment a he's gone back and forth about whether or not he was initially joking he seemed to finally uh admit that he did genuinely believe this when he started at the time at\nThe time I was like using the conspiracies everybody's been there [laughter]\n\nYou know what's going on with our world\nYou know places like how deep the rabbit hole\nEven went on to apologize to science teachers everywhere\n[laughter] right so he's climbed out of that flat earth a rabbit on the radio Boston's Chris that are expressed thanks so much for coming thanks for having me [noise]\nFinally tonight we want to bring you another sample of WB you are in the Boston Globe's new investigative podcast called last seen it goes deep into the unsolved mystery of the world's largest unsolved art heist at Boston's Isabella Stewart gardening museum almost Thirty years ago\nLast night on the show we brought you the end of episode to we heard hosts Kelly horn and jak wrote

murders a lot of organized crime shows a lot of disorganized for immigration\nArmed robberies drug deals armored cars tick up jobs you name it\nBut it's a crime that gave Boston Isabella Stewart

hanging his law offices including one he's especially partial to the concert by Vermeer\nTo print you just talked to two just so wonderful magnificent if your kid appreciate you know from what is a great masters um [noise] what else\nIs ... particular interest in the Gardner heist it isn't only because he feels a lot of what was stolen it's also because he just might know who did it no other defense attorney has represented more criminals who have been tied if only unofficially\nTo the gardener case seven and all they are men Aleppo has long defended for other crimes\nAnd while he won't comment on what they might have known about the plan to steal some of the most valuable and bill loved treasures from Isabella Stewart gardeners collection he will say this about whoever pulled off the robbery\nThis wasn't done by a bunch of ... 'cause this was very well organized well organized for precision reporters every single thing\nBy day let them means the FBI\nAnd he's right in the twenty eight and a half years since the heist they haven't found any of the stolen masterpieces but one of the places the FBI has been looking at the longest reveals a lot about who they think might be behind this still unsolved crime\nIt's a car repair shop called T. R. C. auto electric a place hard to beat for criminals per capita and many of the ...\nPlanning or pulling off the Gardner heist have needed Martin let both services it's because of other crimes they hatched AT T are the [noise] the question is was the plan to Isabella Stewart gardening museum one of them [noise]\n\nIf one road to some of the suspects and Isabella Stewart Gardner museum heist leads to the law officers of Martin Aleppo another leads to Thirteen twenty five Dorchester avenue in Dorchester neighborhood of Boston and one day last summer Kelly drove there with the garden museums head of security Anthony ...\n\nWait to hear that you're you're you're really\nI in my mind it was a much much greater thing okay [noise]\nPicture a low slung brick and cinderblock building much longer than it is wide with corrugated metal doors there's a spindly tree on the sidewalk out front it can it be to start to offer a shade under withering July sun\nDoes everything you'd expect to find it in mechanics and asserting their vehicles herds up three open repair base and their tires and parts leaning against an exterior wall painted an industrial base\nWhat there isn't any suggestion whatsoever that the former T. R.

so I just took a breath and just wanted to get the hell out of that restaurant and ... but I I said well do you have kids and he said oh yeah but they don't want to see me and that's what lodged in my psyche I couldn't get out of my head for three or four years it just circled in my head this\nThis notion of well you've done the worst thing possible to know a human being one who you vowed to love and care for by the way yeah you have a child or children with that person you still love to\nAnd I I just couldn't get that out and and so I had to write my way into it in five years later there
