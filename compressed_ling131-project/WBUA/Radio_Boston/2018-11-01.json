is the team's historian Gordon needs Gordon thanks for coming in oh it's my pleasure ...\nGordon how was the parade you've covered some of these as a reporter but you got to ride along this time as part of the teen how was that yeah it's a bit of a different experience when you're actually on the dark boating and you know\nBoat with with members of the the Red Sox for an office so\nYou're thinking okay the players are going to of course be showered with with the adulation all that and we go by and you're going to think that people are looking in there and gone huh\nBut you haven't lived until you've heard of ... chance of front office front office I mean these fans were happy to see anybody related to the ball club and it was great fun\nWith that is the one constant right because the players the coaches that's all changed since two thousand four of the ownership group at the same\nWell you know it it's funny tell them I I was contemplating that this morning a in advance of coming on with you and I I was thinking about the patriots and in their five Super Bowl is in in the twenty first century and and the three primary components have been you know Bill Belichick Tom Brady\nAnd and owner Bob Kraft year after year after year\nI'm In our case the for World Series you know we've won for World Series with three different managers\nThe optimal spacing window that we found was one to two years after the delivery of one child until the conception of the neck to prevent pregnancy\nAnd not one to two year window that when we found the lowest risk for both mothers and babies and the reason this is good news is that waiting to achieve oh twelve to twenty four month period between Britain conception is actually fairly short\nNow if you're thirty six thirty seven or or thirty eight it may not seem short to you but some previous studies have suggested that the optimal interval maybe quite a bit longer at least Eighteen months it up to five years so the good news is that you don't have to wait too much longer the frustrating news is that there really are added risk at six months and up\nTo twelve months but Kerry put those risks in perspective for us what actually are the risks and how much do they go up at my age\nSo I'm Glad you asked that Maria because it's a really important point what we call the absolute risks are very small even though the relative risks you know the proportional changes are not that small so let's say you have a thousand mothers and they're all over thirty five\nIf they all weigh the recommended year and a half to have another baby about three of those thousand women will get seriously ill or die if they're in a rice and get pregnant again within half a year six of the thousand will get seriously ill or die\nSo overall very few cases but a very dire outcome hadn't and a doubling of that risk ... so what about risk to the baby\nSo let's again take a thousand miles over age thirty five and now we're looking at what's called a severe adverse infant outcome which means still birth where the babies born very earlier a very small [laughter]\nSo if the moms always the recommended year and a half to get pregnant again Eighteen of a thousand births will have severe outcomes for the baby if they don't wait and get pregnant again very quickly it goes up to Twenty one severe infant outcome\nWell we certainly don't want to minimize that impact and it it is a difference but not not a very big one relatively speaking and outcomes for younger moms carry\nSo that's why there is a bigger difference in how the baby's due again we take that thousand moms but these are ages twenty to thirty four if they wait the recommended year and a half fourteen of the thousand births have severe infant outcome if they don't wait it's twenty per thousand here's epidemiologist Laura Schumer's again\nThis shows you both the relationship between pregnancy spacing and increase risk but also the older women tend to have higher baseline risk of many of these outcomes at all tendency spacing lengths\nSo we bottom line is of course as we know it's an incredibly personal decision whether to have a baby when to have a baby when dad the second baby\nAnd she says her research seemed just hopes this new study can help women make these decisions within their own personal contacts and of course in consultation with their medical teams but she says this new data may be particularly helpful for older women because we'd more off and decide to have short pregnancy\nIntervals on purpose [noise] that's carried gold

I first started very very simply and I we were in the car on the way back from her skating practice leave it or not\nAnd I had known that it happened and I really wanted to know more so I wanted to turn on the radio and so I decided I Would tell him a little bit and what I said was you know something really bad happens that it you know me and my interest in a guy and he shot people and he kills them\nAnd we're going to listen to a little bit of the news not a lot just seeking cute little bit more and then I only hear what your questions are and we can go a little bit more from there it's like turn on the news and you heard a little bit more\nUm and he didn't really have any questions right off but that's kinda how I started like really simply and then when she started talking\nI'm you know he said at some point you know mom I don't really think and the close to my story but he was like mom I really don't think this would happen in Lexington because we are diverse you know we have a lot of different religions\nAnd people are accepting\nAnd that sort of like that was the hardest moment for me when he said that and Simon I'm Sorry if I'm not quitting you a hundred percent correctly here but um [noise] 'cause you don't want to burst your child bubble but he even he was even around though a couple of years ago when there was an incident Lexington high school and there was a swastika\nOn one of the bathrooms and we took him to the visuals so he's he was somewhat aware anyway that there's some anti Semitism in the world but this was a whole different ballgame\nAnd so the goal so how do I respond to that and what I said was it really can happen anywhere but you don't need to be afraid so I was trying to sort of juggle\nBeing realistic but also comforting him because it is really rare I mean this is a tragedy it's a Jewish try to Judy it's an American tragedy\nBut it doesn't happen every day and I don't\nReally believe that he's got she'd be afraid every time he walks into our temple\nBut the message that it could happen anywhere fits with this tragedy in Pittsburgh right we've heard a lot from folks from Pittsburgh the squirrel hill neighborhood where this happened was one of the friendliest communities\nFor Jewish people and yet it happened era right gene I Want to bring you in ... and I imagine that it could be tempting for parents than adults to want to just to avoid talking about the shooting altogether so I'm Wondering why or if you think it's important to have the typical conversation\nIf that's a great question um you know first of all of a a um\nIt is it is difficult um uh but when we have but his parents have to understand that their kids are going to be exposed um media these days more than ever before\nAnd I think we have to assume I'm you know that all of our children toddlers school age children adolescents and young adults\nHave seen heard been exposed to something and letting them fit with these kinds of powerful images and stories voices\nCan be very very upsetting it can you know we've known in other a terrorist uh for school shootings\nThat it can cause a traumatic stress responses including ... and they're going to have lots of questions and I think that the parents really need to provide reassurance support garden\nAnd help out the kids navigate these waters the assumption is they're going to have heard this one way or another and we don't want to have them where we are low nobody should worry alone\nAny way I mean do you do try to turn off the TV or maybe even took away a smartphone so maybe you limit exposure [laughter]\nAs as a matter of fact the way I Would think of it as a child psychiatrist and I was gonna ask I was going to ask you how old your your kid\nOh he he's only ten years old and he does not have the cell phone\nAnd we're not actually\nThat's coming up at eleven I'm One a with Joshua Johnson\nAnd sports Red Sox pitcher and postseason hair oh David Price says he's sticking with the Sox\nPrice said he's declining a contract option to become a free agent tea set of Boston I came here to win and we did that this year and that was very special and I want to do it again for his work price will earn one hundred twenty seven million dollars over the next four years it's the richest contract ever for the pitcher [noise]\nDoes your car having nickname does it hold wonderful memories of good times with family and friends\nWill make your cars last memory the best one yet donated WVU are\nWill get top dollar for the old car and you'll be supporting the programming you love\nAnd you may be eligible for a tax deduction go to W. B. U. R. dot org slash cars and thanks [noise]\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm ... years if I say Massport chances are this comes to mind [noise]\nThe public agency is so much more than just Logan Airport it's a self sustaining government agency that generates more than six hundred million dollars a year across three marine terminals the Boston waterfront Logan Airport Hanscom Field and mustard airport and since two thousand and twelfth Thomas Clinton has been at the helm\nNow after six years on the job Glen is stepping down as CEO of the Massachusetts Port Authority but before he retires from that post he joins us now in the studio Thomas Glen welcome radio Boston Oh thank you for inviting me\nI Want to start with your time at ... recent job I'm In your six years at the agency the region has experienced a lot of growth in air traffic money more international flights coming in to Logan Airport and also a lot of growth in shipping so what would you consider to be the biggest accomplishment of Massport on your watch\nSo I guess I Would say three things of the growth of international flights we've added twenty new destinations since I took over and we've increased passengers by about sixty international passengers by about sixty percent\nSecond is the revitalization of the working poor about seven thousand blue collar jobs exist in the working poor and I think we've gotten it back on track\nAnd the third the um the growth of the Australia report which has always been an important potential way to take some traffic away from Logan in his now experiencing some pretty significant successes with major airlines Jet Blue\nI'm American and a delta I picked up just to attribute that growth in air traffic to the humming economic engine that his wings and right now what does Massport done to deserve credit for all that uh that expansion now that's a great question so you know I think ... there's no question that the economy drives our success in is the is the major factor\nBecause I'd like to think that with the various businesses because we're kind of a public private enterprise the airlines are happy with the way we work with them so they're willing to you know try to expand Logan the container shipping companies are happy with the way we work with them so I think\nGood management does play a role in the willingness of our private businesses to take advantage of the opportunities we offer but the strong economy is definitely the key\nSo we got a lot of travel is moving through Logan they're not always happy though Tom you know this we've seen some JD power studies on airports satisfaction or the most recent one from September ... near the bottom among the mega airports I'm Judy powers at Logan is a place where quote\nPassenger disruption and increased traffic will be incredibly hard\nTo avoid what's your response to that so I think two things first of all if you look at the list which we've done you know pretty much every year it turns out the airports in the south in the west do a lot better than airports in the northeast\nSo even though they're not evaluating snow and storms that has an impact on people's total experience and coming to the airport\nAnd second we've made a lot of improvements to the airport I'm In a terminal see is totally redesigned we've added a gates an upgrade of gates terminally we're doing a big project which were both to unveil\nOpens tomorrow in terminal beef so people like the long term benefit of those construction projects but they feel disoriented by the construction while it's happening a JD power has explained that to us so you know I think um you know down the road one of these projects are completed you will see the benefit but in the short run when construction is under way\nYou know it's a little bit disorienting folks\nWe got the construction I got the weather to contend with which you mentioned what about Amazon top what if Amazon picks Boston for a second headquarters and we expect a decision next couple of months by the way it's always Logan in Massport more broadly prepared to handle\nI was in person workforce [noise] so we worked closely with um the state officials in the mayor or governor on the uh gee exercise to kind of figure out and I think we were seen as one of the positives in their decision making we'd hope the Amazon if they were just decided to come here would see Logan is a positive\nBut I I think you're raising an important question you know how to absorb fifty thousand people even if it's over a ten year period because we've had a lot of population growth in Boston over the last ten years um so we're getting to a point you know where we really have to be very strategic and savvy about how to accommodate\nNew growth let's talk about what you're you mentioned them off the top and now it's daily flights from Jet Blue American Airlines or next year delta is coming apart so what impact will those flights have on the economy of Worcester\nSo people in West or I think a very very happy uh that we've had the success that we've had and they feel like it's part of their ... a success story\nSo you go back say Fifteen or Twenty years about four hundred thousand people a year we're using the Worcester airport so that's kind of a benchmark that we're shooting for uh people don't always realize what's there is the second biggest city in New England\nSo it's bigger than Providence bigger than Manchester bigger than Hartford they all have airports so we're very confident that the ... airport will take off and the airlines that you mentioned have you know look at it as a business proposition\nAnd they've gotten on board so I think\nThe growth in central mass and the growth in Worcester is a\nYou know as as part of a big Massachusetts success story do you think that that's a solution to budget was almost airports been operating in the red so what's what's the outlook for the more\nFlights they have done the easier it is to cover the or the operating a not in the capital not so yeah we think that there were more flights in the works and ultimately it will be in our break even and then throw off a margin but\nYou have to make the investment which we've made\nA over the last uh six or seven years\nOnce talked about the different money issue um the Massachusetts state police overtime pay scandal I drew ... you know of course patrols Massport um the Boston Globe reported back in March the compensation for troop F\nHadn't been afforded to the state comptroller since two thousand and ten and then when the figures were turned over we found out that many of those troopers were drying hefty paychecks including one who made more than three hundred thousand dollars for three years in a row I'm so I'm Wondering what responsibility you believe Massport bears for that exorbitant overtime and then the lack of\nDisclosure that went with it [noise] so you know I think that uh to take a step back and it put this in context in order to fully protect the airport we need about a hundred and fifty troopers assigned to troop F\nSo back in the spring we were looking at around a hundred and twenty\nSo when you don't have enough full time staff the only solution is to use overtime 'em and all of our posts are mandatory we don't have a lot of discretionary posts um you know the TSA checkpoints have to have somebody assigned to them\nUh so so that drove the numbers up because we didn't have enough fulltime folks um\nYou know I think that uh you know the governor jumped on top of this and say police have jumped on top of this and they've tried to straighten out you know number of the things that you identified but obviously it's been a\nYou know it's been a kind of a black guy that we're hoping to to get beyond ... was it up to the state police though to do that reporting or or or should or should ... been doing it well they they are state police employees so ultimately you know I think that's you know when\nImportant part of the ah the balancing act although Massport at the time was paying the troopers directly right that's changed since the spring right which we\nChange that because it system had been designed in the seventies and it hadn't really been reviewed so when we looked at it we said well that doesn't really make sense of just you know leads to the opportunity for confusion so how 'bout\nDevelopment and you know we think about that transportation of course out with your agency but you've played a big role in development particularly in the seaport too and I'm thinking about the uh on the hotel project\nWhich began construction earlier this year and a and Massport notable used diversity as one part of the scoring process when picking the winning bidder for that project is that something Massport is going to continue to do and and what were those diversity factors\nSo we tried to different approach ah our share of our real estate committee on the board joined Jackson kind of a negotiated some creative thinking about this so basically we said to the um six people who voted\nDoes a hundred points you get twenty five points for finance twenty five points were designed twenty five points for execution and twenty five points the diversity so we let them decide how they want it to do that and they were kind of competing against each other which is kind of different than the traditional approach\nSo we ended up with a big success with Romney or with a great a diversity component that they are generated and we said well that was successful so we're going to do it again", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radio Boston", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "01"}
