with us thanks for having me actually in the globe a studio we should say you're not on the line but first of all that you've been following this you've been up in a large area tell us what it looks like up there\nIt's very much is what the mayor of Lawrence ... called the disaster zone this isn't just about having gas or a gas stove uh it's it's very much the construction work that's going on there are dozens of projects happening at any given time roads are\nTowards all around and just imagine trailers that you mentioned alternative housing that set up imagine a a bunch of trailers shut up on what would be our Boston Common are really it's it's it's what's the matter is called the disaster recovery effort and it's not about having gas or not having gases every all the side effects that come with it\nRight right so now state officials lots of people are questioning whether this November nineteenth deadline that Columbia gas that to restore service can actually\nBe met a ... what what do you think is happening now is that based on what you're saying does it seem unlikely that that's going to happen that Columbia gas is going to be able to meet that deadline to restore service and what's the big ... thank\nIt seems very unlikely to be clear and and a delay is something that uh even the mayor of of Lawrence and said well somewhat unexpected I think Joe Albany's he's the person who was tapped by Columbia gas to lead that restoration effort he came in with an objective to replace forty eight miles of pipeline\nAmong those local businesses is currently coffee shop in Lawrence which remains closed even now six weeks later earlier today we talked with currently owner John Farrington about how he's been coping hand\nAbout what it was like for him on September thirteenth\nRight in front of my restaurant was the is where the gas came up through the streets\nSo what what's it been like in these leaks ah\nIt's been a roller coaster I came down to the next morning at three AM a snuck in through one of the back roads and uh it was surreal I mean it it was hundreds of fire trucks hundreds of gas workers police\nOr walking house to house and I'm from then that just it it went on to the realization that I have to throw away eight to ten thousand dollars all the food then to realize that it wasn't just a couple of days thing it was it was going to be a month and a half so it's been just you know\nA slow motion wreck\nCan you describe a your business currently in the coffee shop and how long you've been in business\nYeah uh it's a family business I bought off my parents' Twenty years ago a shot at thirty five years ago and I'm just so nice little breakfast lunch diner\nHow many people jammed plea Eighteen fulltime in part time\nHe'd been closed ever since September thirteenth yes what about your employees what have they been doing\nShirley you'd think they'd enjoy themselves they're they're they're just as dangerous as I Am they filed\nWith Columbia gas to get paid through them Columbia gas made that offer about a week or two into it and but one of the problems with that is is Columbia gas then turned around to have head hunters call them to find them employment elsewhere\nYou mean I wouldn't have to pay them exactly so I don't know how many you know took up that offer a finding employment elsewhere I'll find out a couple of days when was that don't have a meeting\nHave have you found claims of Columbia gas\nI have I open the claim up um they have for me I'm about ten grand to to help with some of the business bills and stuff\nSo so how much is this cost you do you think\nI don't know I Know I have absolute zip it might be you know right now\nI have nothing I'm thirty grand in there but that's the normal operating budget\nWhat would you brought in any sickly they think he might have lost\nProbably around eighty two hundred thousand dollars a lot of this fantasy money I only get to keep a fraction of that\nConfident that Columbia gas will be able to help you or or just confident in general I guess you'll be able to get things back to normal\nMy biggest fears is I Columbia gas is just they've gone through several companies trying to manage is the last company just came on a couple of days ago they went from\nReplacing all the restaurant equipment to know repairing restaurant equipment so I'm I'm Still waiting on to see exactly how they're going to handle my equipment here the next step is\nIs is to open up and get people coming back I I I'm In Lawrence I mean you know a great great old mill city\nBut it's a depressed city I Clarence scratch eighty percent of my business in from Andover in North Andover and they come in and you know they love the place and everything else but my fear is\nThat moved on the move on to other places there happens to change and I'm just gonna of loss of business that build up for Twenty years\nJohn Farrington owner of currently in a coffee shop in Lawrence a best of luck to you and I hope that uh I Hope that it can work out to a work out for you at some point ... thanks for telling us about what's going on for you think you\nDo and I said we ... we did reach out to Columbia gas for respond to John Farrington delegation that the company had head hunters contacting his employees that we have not received a response from Columbia gas\nAnd there was some good news today for a mainstay in South Lawrence of St Patrick's Catholic Church father Palo Brian tells us that gas service\nFully restored just in the past twenty four hours nuts he says this is next as\nWe had both the gas restored a few days ago and then the work that needed to be done inside the church completed so ah quite amazingly on a pretty cold morning we actually had a heat at church or great blessing\nThey think they still have some other big buildings that do not have yeah\nWe do have a large meal center from which we served two hundred and fifty thousand meals a year it still doesn't have got us but it was converted to propane by Columbia gas a few weeks ago so we've actually been able to thank God serve hot meals\nBreakfast and dinner every day through the Koran and mail center [noise] excuse me we have a large but thirty plus room office and wrecked rebuilding that has no gas and we have a huge parachute or with that includes a big\nBasketball court and other meeting spaces that also is without ... so and the immediate aftermath of the explosions we actually continue to serve meals with out gas so we put together\nBag meals for breakfast and dinner and were able to distribute them from the mail center we weren't able to host meals in the dining room about ten days after the explosions Columbia gas successfully converted the entire building to propane\nMhm ... and how many would you say that you've been serving thank you are able to do it with propane\nIt's hundreds of people every breakfast and every dinner I'm\nSo we we have a lot of new faces people who\nPresumably would not need our services if they did have got to service well it's also interesting to see that there are plenty of regular guests who are not around because they either have gotten temporary housing without transportation or because they've just moved elsewhere for the duration until\nHopefully the the guy comes back\nNow you're in a neighborhood that was really ... ...\nYes worthy the epicenter my parish ah encompasses so far it's which is the half of large that lost the gas\nAnd said what neighborhood look like right near\nThe neighborhood looks a little bit like regular life but it really does look like a disaster area every single straight has been ripped up there are [noise]\nUm you know excavators and scarves crews and papers around any corner at any given day at this point so it it really does look like\nA unique natural disaster and this was a real disaster took place that not so much the joke is that you\nNeed to get somewhere and you just point your car in that direction and one straight after another after another is blocked off you have no idea how you'll get from here to there but you're just drive until you got there we have no idea when this is going to come back on you know we're we're given ballparks\nBut it's very hard to to know\nWhat do you think of the state of November nineteenth at Columbia gas is that you think everybody\nIs hoping that that date will pan out I don't think anyone is expecting that it will and the news this week is that Columbia gas and other officials are suggesting this may not be as quick as they hoped it would be and again it's a it's understandable everyone knows that\nMost of our buildings have\nStructural issues and have code issue so we're not talking about Beverly Hills it's this is an old city with old buildings and a lot of them are not in good condition\nIt's a ... no one I I think is shaking their fists that reality and saying how can this be but it's just very very difficult to try to be raising kids particularly if you're a single mom to have no good idea when you're going to be able to have hot water again have heat again\nSo even if you're moved into temporary housing which something like seven thousand people have it's a it's an anxiety written on\nNot Apollo Brian pastor at St Patrick's church in Lawrence thanks so much for joining us there ...

B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker well we just heard on the independent candidate for ... county district attorney Michael Maloney and ... when I came to the Democratic candidates Rachel Rawlins Rachel Muslims radio Boston thank you so much for having me so we started by asking air power and it's a what ... what did he think\nUh makes the two of you different\nUm well I Would say that I've\nActually prosecuted a case so uh this is a district attorney's office that um [noise]\nThat prosecute people quite frankly and so I think that in order to do the job you should have prosecuted a case you should've were presented a case to a grand jury which is the way that in Massachusetts um we bring cases in superior court\nAnd so I have actually done the job and then more importantly um the da da ... cases so this is an office of two hundred and Seventy five employees that operates within government\nWhich is different than the private sector twenty million dollar budget thirty four thousand cases a year you need to be a really good manager or because Dan Conley in the sixteen years he served did not try case during one of those sixteen years he supervised in office\nI just wanted to say or your opponent brought up your experience in in the courtroom and ... and said uh you that he thought that he had more experience as a criminal defense attorney because in that on that side of the ...\nI actually have a so I'm you know I I Would love for you to ask me about my experience I've been a criminal defense attorney while I was singing McCutcheon and did handle cases are on the criminal defense side I've been a prosecutor I've been a lawyer for Twenty one years\nAnd so I'm In a dish and I've done civil rights matters before and I've represented the police say very good relationships with the police I endorsed by\nA police patrol means association and I um have actually held the police accountable before and sued the police when they were engaged in um alleged a discriminatory behavior so I have a very broad range of experiences over two decades of work as a lawyer in Boston\nAnd so what is it about that experience and and just about a you know your your background your your temperament that you think makes you ready to take on this this large leadership position or twenty million dollar budget yeah\nSo I've been the head lawyer from Massport I'd been the head lawyer for the MBTA and mass dot that's ten thousand employees that the MBTA andme after um Massport\nHas Fifteen hundred employees that are employed by Massport over Eighteen thousand employees on our footprint\nHad lawyer for both of those all three of those organizations being a lawyer in government is very different than practicing on your own or owning a business you are um you must you must operate within the confines of certain laws so for example public records requests private employers don't have to comply with those type of\nGovernance is that we have\nEthics requirements um we have um you know any number of of of record retention laws that were you know if you've read articles about the state police for example um all of these things I was the head lawyer for in multiple different state agencies and authorities\nAnd then very candidly I have excellent relationships with the federal government because I've been an assistant United States attorney so many of these very large cases that the superior court is handling\nFor the da's office they're working with my former supervisors John Workman Glenn McKinley I'm In the U.S attorney's office because their joint task forces that are looking at the type of cases that da's make decisions about ...\nLet's talk about the list of Fifteen which everyone has talked with you about Iran says wait we did address this ah with your photo like I'm Alone in this is a list of Fifteen crimes that are so called decline to prosecute list and of course that list\nIncludes things like shoplifting resisting arrest but the the most controversial seems to be possession with intent to distribute charges that you might decline to prosecute the Boston police patrol engineering and math retailers association or both of\nHave said that they're concerned about this proposal tell us why on\nSo what's wonderful is I'm I'm proposing something right I came forward with a possible solution to a problem that we have the criminal justice system does not work for too many people overwhelmingly it doesn't work for the poor\nOverwhelmingly it doesn't work for people of color it doesn't work for the mentally ill it doesn't work for people struggling with addiction and I'm and I'm proposing a solution\nWhat I Will tell you is that as a former prosecutor myself the only person in this race that's ever prosecuted a case we have one tool that we use in our tool boxes prosecutors\nJail the tool is incarceration I Want more tools I Want the tool of rehabilitation diversion civil infractions the tool of social workers should be used we have a sixty seven percent recidivism rate in Massachusetts so\nWhat what we're doing now trying to arrest our way to the solution of these petty quality of life crime it's not working it cost us fifty thousand dollars to how someone in the Suffolk County hopes of corrections what I'm proposing is pre arraignment when these individuals come in with one of these Fifteen\nOr counterterrorism bureau or patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN all help lead to today's arrest I couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset we would identify and arrest the person or people responsible for these acts\nWe can make that promise because of the confidence we have our ability to investigate it deliberate precise manner plays arrest means that New Yorkers in the day people across our nation are safe but it's direct to raise that there might be more packages out there\nAnd if you see something out there called nine one one and in New York City we have a number also won eight eight eight NYC safe when the thanked them as the public to contact the thirties with information during this investigation\nNew Yorkers don't back down they step up every single time we've been you're listening to special coverage of the Justice Department press conference on NPR see\nOur city always you also to the media for broadcasting the photos and YPG released\nBecause it's certainly help workers around our city identify

vote for a high school we simply [noise] ah so\nEach of the devices was being brought a through what are called total containment vehicles to our lab and they were coming out of Syria autumn\nA and we've received some of them the first to the we were see where the devices that were sent to former President Obama a and B I direct your fever back to congressman waters and so the analysis began on that uh I think yesterday\nAnd we were starting to receive information over the course of the last twenty four thirty six hours ... was known yesterday\nAs a fulltime yeah it's a question\nFor ... and the two year old fashioned describe your reaction to when you got\nLead to a ... also could you give us as a wad\nFor\nDo a lot of the first part\nOf my reaction to hearing that we had a possible match\nOr just validated my unbelievable faith\nAnd confidence in mental image of law enforcement and in particular the FBI lab there's a reason why the FBI's lab is known as one of the very best in the world and the folks who worked there are extraordinary and once I knew that they had a print I was pretty confident that we'd be able to find the right person as far as the the devices themselves\nA it's important to say as as is in the complaints\nAre that even if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not uh they were functional as they say is what we're doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain\nEnergetic material or which if subjected to the right combination of heat or shocker friction or could be dangerous to the public and the public should treat any device like Gordon\nHow could you tell us plainly why was the target demographic [noise]\nI don't know of and then uh what you might uh normally expect a I'm a better part ... appears to be a partisan but that would be determined by the facts\nAs the case goes forward and I'm not able to comment on that you see cooperated [noise] we're not going to be discussing whether ... stands at this um can you ... um\n[noise] what do you do the\nGiven more [noise]\nMore focus not on the talk but on the work the work of the men and women of law enforcement here in the work that was done over the last week is something that should make every American proud and grateful and it's too early to stage for us to be discussing motivation in this particular\nCase you have you\nMight notice they prefer survive workers\nAre a lot of people committing acts of violence under any motivation\nYou can't do you believe he's the only one off\nAnd you continue to make reference to other\nThere you have any sense of how\nWho have a job to do that is very important for our democracy\nBut what I Am saying is we have to look at how we're treating one another um whether we are a political and I are sitting there on the Democratic Republican how do we have a conversation about the ... right how do we have a conversation with our neighbor who maybe voted for Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump\nHow do we have those conversations where there are several um and they don't turn on the way we are talking\nAbout right right and and how do we know when you're surrounded by this you know presumably to the point where someone would be sending out explosive devices to those uh that maybe and disagreement ed\nDon't forget we are surrounded by the answer we are in an awesome program it talks about politics where everybody is still a word as productive where there is an audience that buys into the ethics of the people who run this station have have\nBroadcast everybody's so it it can work this is actually the answer it can be replicated in many other ways person to person I and other kinds of institutions\nBut I'm I'm very I'm honored to be able to see amongst people that that are part of the solution the problem is the rights of ecosystem has the wrong incentives and people have been dragged into this national brain a politics where everybody is not in every storm of activity\nElectrified the whole rest of the country we're told some county official in the middle of nowhere said something racism y'all get mad about it like my\nI Am I supposed to get angry about that the ... are gone\nAnd I think that we need to figure out how to take national politics out of everything else we do there's no reason why we have to be downstream from the office of national politics here in Massachusetts is no reason why the debates have gone badly in this day for the past couple of weeks we have our own political through here we have to stand up for it\nI Want to I Want to go to another on local race where there was some tension also this past week and that was in the attorney general's race here in Massachusetts Democrat more Hayley the incumbent her challenger Republican attorney\nJane that man they also had a debate a double the Boston Globe the UMass Boston debate in and we have a little clip here of of what was likely their sharpest exchange when Mick man a criticized Haley for her offices lawsuits against President Trump including the suit against the president's travel ban let's listen to\nThat is against our public safety interest in in essence she wouldn't leave us at the mercy of nice averages coming into Massachusetts and I got to tell you that the is my number one [noise]\nAnd that was mailing here is Haley or this is the response from attorney general ...\nIt didn't take me long to see Donald Trump yeah they didn't take Donald Trump but a few days or a few weeks to do something illegal are unconstitutional and that's where we then and that's why you see the thirty six Las Vegas [noise]\nInto I I Want to say at the the audience here some folks were yelling or some folks had to be spoken to because I was rock is it's a it's a level of nastiness\nOr that I don't recall seeing much before and I'm I Wonder do you wonder what do you do about that what do you do that that level of nastiness the level of decorum that we seemed to have gotten to in our public debates political debates at this point what do you say\nThat one of the things I did after\nUm the twenty sixteen election I decided to hold a couple of conversations of Clinton Trump uh conversations people that voted for Trump for people who voted for Clinton brought them together as it turned out uh in some of these conversations they have more common than they actually uh you know where they different\nWe have to get to a place where we can actually a dialogue without the labels of who are getting to a point where we're insulting people I mean some of the terminology years use in that clip was was quite offensive calling people savages but\nI Do believe we've got to create a space coming out of the midterms and twenty twenty where we actually bring human beings together get off Twitter get our social media\nAnd I think that there are activities I can do that I think there's a leadership question with our local elected but then also organization that promotes a commonality bring people could do other different parties I think we've got to re stitch\nUh some of the community that a boost coming up praying apart right now that sounds like a lot of work ahead I think it's important\nWork ... had to agree yeah Jim McMahon is a piece of work it should've hers convention speech my God I'm we should never picked him as our nominee I voted for dance was of course he was a revolt men who cares what it sounds like\nI think we have to strengthen institutions you have to create space as studies that but we have to defend that space you have to say if you're an institution whether you're the mass GOP or whether you're a non profit or whether you're in and media you have to defend you have to have them you have to say we have rules about how you want to treat each other and here\nI mean you have to be responsible what happened how they got Jim McMahon is because that the Republicans to vote in primaries and ... and that the commission had been had been trained to respond to the kind of of of rhetoric that he uses he's one of many politicians across the country because of his rhetoric because of this rhetoric because everybody has the wrong incentives here\nI mean we even had a better choice wasn't like men ran alone\nSo I just think that we have looked institutions and say what are your ethics are you willing to defend them are you willing to work against these these things coming down from the national guard or you want to be the good citizen and try to create space for productive civil conversations and a lot of institutions are failing\nI Want to just go to another breaking story briefly a before before we end here and that's a story today of Columbia gas state officials in Columbia gas announced today that that November nineteenth deadline that we heard about her gas to be restored throughout the ... valley has to be pushed back in some cases almost another month no big surprise\nThere folks didn't expect that November nineteenth was the the most realistic date a for all service to be restored but it's been six weeks\nSince over pressurized gas caused explosions and fires that left one person dead thousands still without gas and and some folks say they're frustrated Lourdes married Dan Rivera says he's really concerned that Columbia gas is not doing enough let's listen\nThey need to cut checks faster the amount of time people are waiting to get reimbursed for items with their spending everyday and the businesses are waiting to get their lives back in order is unacceptable\nIs any war and as they as a mayor of of a city in Massachusetts you can probably sympathize with what he's going through here six weeks with so many people affected who's going to be most affected by this politically do you think\nAnd I know quite well and um I Know he's fighting for his folks that I think from the political from a political standpoint I Want to say something a little bit more broadly\nAt the end of the day of these pipes these gas pipes are that are underneath of many of our cities and towns uh they're all their antiquated I remember I'm really pushing to figure out how we repair these gas lakes that are all over the state quite dangerous how do we push the utilities do this\nAnd the fact that there is a bit of a challenge here because if you push the the the entities to repair those the rate payers ... may for it so\nI we need to have a national and state solution to get these guys by a fix fix the infrastructure it's easy to ignore things you can't see\nIn politics and went in a disaster like this happens um people start you know ... ... ... being activated how politically who who are I think is in fact impacted look at the end of the day or every elected official from the governor to the merits of the counselors and all the rest\nIn the ad must call for a solution on repairing these types and if they don't\nIn addition to Dan Rivera pushing for more action if they don't they should be held accountable state reps ... everyone across the board this was a moment where we should really gather this energy of this disaster and push for resolution on a pair of these pipes and lines yourself a result\nDan is a fantastic ... I met him a years ago and the bigger condition team I'm I really would for him I think you'd like your I spoke to people\nI think the politicians are looking good in terms of how they're managing the uh the the crisis but I agree with Sandy I Do think that\nYou know their whole time or bridge collapses what do we do you know that these uh pipes can be eighty nine years old gas pipes um this happens well what do we do um you know America has a great deal of infrastructure many categories structure that is all aging\nAnd we keep hearing these stories the little failures all the time and I think what we need to figure out is how we we handle all that so you know how fast can we start fixing it who pays for it what is the best way to handle all of this and I think the point I agree\nThat many politicians to sort of not just simply you know handle the crisis and then wait for the next somebody said well what do we do know about all the infrastructure items and what is a realistic plan well\nLately don't have time to do all of our lives that sleep but I Do want to play a little bit of tape a that would have been I have a they just might have been you know I'm here so I'm gonna I'm gonna do mind so this this is from Tuesday night Jimmy Kimmel\nPlayed a compilation we have to do this because it's game three of the world series this he played a compilation of Los Angeles broadcasters trying to speak in a Boston accent [laughter] All right it's great ready ready we're going to hear\nA little bit the Dodgers will take on the red Sox first on their turf right there in Boston that's that ... that\nGame one of the world series for the Fenway palm\nFenway Park to see the green monster up close\nSo [laughter] so how they\nDo does anybody ever get the Boston area who had a really bad I'm Sorry that stumped onto that wasn't so great that\nGuy All right well I think than it was such a bass though I I Want to say thanks so much for being with us headlines Massachusetts Republican political activists and political writer thank you\nBut you also said he warned former mayor of a new one former Iraq War veteran or current Iraq War veteran as well currently the executive director of the shore and scenes that are on media politics and public policy at Harvard thank you\nSo what do you say to those folks who say you know right now especially we we might have to try to unify ... what would you say\n[noise] um I Do think we need to unify but I Would argue that it's better to do it outside the party system I I played rugby for a long time and I had read the book uh playing the enemy\nWhich is about um the south African World Cup team that Mandela used to kind of bring people together and when he came out of prison he worked with uh the people at a press them and try to build that coup coalition because he realized that you needed to um kind of bring both sides have got to find something comment to rally around so\nI think doing it outside the system is um unfortunately the way that we need to do it at this point\nClearly idea edited candidates running or we just ask them a couple of quick questions about policy and where they stand or if they have particular ideas about big issues and I'd like to do the same with you or I Will be I'd epidemic here thoughts on on how to address that\nUh I think one of the first things we need to do is expand access to medically assisted treatment that's been proven to work at the type of a challenge that you can't do on your own so that's one area my backgrounds and workers' compensation and that's one of the areas where the crisis started or from the chronic pain prospect of people are injured at work\nI typically have that spring springs breaks and so I'm looking at things like a prescription drug monitoring physician dispensing those are things that we can\nDo in that area and then also look where the problems are so uh allow medical uses the treatment in for people who are incarcerated and hooking up with the appropriate help when they get out I think Jeff confusion and those sorts county does a good job of making sure people have care when they\nWell they don't do all forms of medication assisted treatment of people who are incarcerated methadone buprenorphine they're not\nRight so I decided that's what I'd be advocating for to be able to do they've started a pilot down in Rhode Island they found overdose rate dropped dramatically when they started with out at\nNight and you think that should be expanded here including to the middle ...\nAh yes and I think border security I think border security is important I think we need to comprehend\nI support a path to citizenship I also think that we need to upgrade our um immigration system as far as modernization and I think it's important when I joined the race or immigration wasn't quite as high up on the list but I think it's being used to divide us which is sad were nation of immigrants so\nThink we need to move forward that very quickly\nSanctuary city ah I think\nThat needs to be done on us city by city basis I don't think we can dictate that at the state or the national level I think local law enforcement and needs to know um ... what's important in their areas and it when it's a dictated at a higher level I think it ends up being an unfunded mandate that's not what local police forces are charged with are funded for\nAnd what about guns background checks for gun legislation how would you deal it\nSure um Parkland is actually one of the reasons I got in the race um after that I had gone into the um\nOn the common when they have the the gathering and I was thinking back to what the president said after Sandy Hook that we can do better and I think in areas like gun violence that's something that we need to consider making incremental progress and this is an area where there's a fair amount of consensus on background checks ah banning assault weapons those type of things [noise]\nHealth care we do that they were looking at\nA I'm In favor of moving to a Medicare for all of a system in a single payer I come from the healthcare industry particularly on the payer side there's a lot of complexity there I think could be solved\nWith a a single payer I also think we need to be able to right size care and have the appropriate a delivery model for example nurse practitioners and twenty three states have what's called full practice authority and not allow them to do things that are trained for but in a state like Massachusetts they aren't allowed to do with our physician supervision that adds to costs and removes the\nBreath of care there's more than ... nurse practitioners that could deliver care and in a wider amount of space is ...\nAnd I ask you that local issue here ah it was an issue that we did speak about earlier in the show as well and that's the Columbia gas issue because we did hear a today that the deadline which ah Columbia gas said it might have everything restored is actually going to have to be pushed back in ... December now and it was supposed to be nice to have been acting\nA lot of people thousands of people out there struggling businesses stuck with businesses yesterday they still they been closed for weeks now because of this [noise]\nWhat's it Congress do in a situation like this when you've got thousands of people out there is there anything that can\nUh I think I'm the letter that the legislators just sense as important as far as the emergency funding for economic um challenges with a disaster [noise]\nAnd I think the local government has done a good job as far as setting up those funds that people can apply to a I think two million dollars is out in the last few days\nAnd I also think this is something that should be factored into our energy policy going forward some of the new forms of energy I get shot down because of cost and so forth but I don't think we always account for the infrastructure and the maintenance needs from the legacy and more mature forms of energy so I think we need to bring that into debate as well\nAnd we need to look at restructuring energy delivery system [noise]\nAh I I Do think we need to be able to account for all the costs so as you guys were just discussing um there's a lot of danger and costs that are associated with\nA ... existing system we need to be able to account for that appropriately and then a factor that into our decision models in the future I think we need to upgrade our energy grid make it more whether smart I'd be able to take advantage of a lookout west there's good solar and wind but we can't take advantage of that in the east and renewable say ever reliability challenge that we need to address\nWhat would you say the number one issue you're hearing about on the campaign [noise]\nUm I think healthcare in over to stomach are probably the two top issues\n... ... and they are and folks when they do talk about those issues they are saying that they really want Congress to address\nI I think health care in particular I think the pre existing conditions is really resonating with folks ah that's one of the reasons also I got the race I have a friend who has an inflammatory breast cancer and she started off in private practice is an attorney or when she came down with the illness was under her husband's plan but she had previously had her own plan she wouldn't be able to\nProbably be here right now between preexisting condition lifetime limits those type of things with my brother in law has multiple sclerosis he worked for the seasonal industry or he wouldn't have as good a care without something like that for ... [noise]\nUh some campaign date I Believe it's the latest campaign data suggest that you raised about Thirteen thousand dollars a gate or campaign five thousand dollar loan um and that's compared to about seven hundred and twenty five thousand dollars raised by Republican right green about one point two million raised by Democrat larger hand\nHow do you keep up with that kind of money\nIt's challenging one of the things that I've made a top priority in my campaign of political reform I think public financing would make a lot of sense\nUm I think a reversing Citizens United I'm having things like a nonpartisan redistricting right now money plays a huge part of this and there was even more money in the primaries um Rufus Gifford at two million Dan Coats had three million or so it is very challenging to keep up with that you can do a little bit with technology these days um but not quite that big yet\n... says how do you make of that bitter bitter primary fight with all the Democrats are we thinking that I think you become the nominee\nThe district um I think from the standpoint there was a lot of engagement I was impressed by all the candidates are I think they uh it was nice to see diversity ... half women Half Men um different people of color so from that standpoint I think uh it was good to get a lot of different folks involved in the picture\nOff from my standpoint I started a little bit late in sort of stuck in a little bit of oxygen out of the room as far as a lot of people involved\nAre ready for getting the support later on has been a little bit more challenging but there was a lot of engagement there like I\nMake melon independent candidate running for Congress in Massachusetts third congressional district thanks for coming in from it\nAnd left there last week as we said we spoke with Democrat larger Hannah Republican ... and you can find those conversations at our website radio Boston dot org stay with us coming up did some of those accused of witchcraft during the Salem witch trials escape to the Framingham area and hide in caves link go take a walk in the woods there to look\nI'm Deborah Becker and this is really about [noise]\nThis is Ninety point nine W.
