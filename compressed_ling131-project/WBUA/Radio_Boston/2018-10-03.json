aired earlier today\n[noise]\nThis is radio ... and I'm Deborah Becker if you think the criminal justice system is biased should you be barred from sitting on a jury\nThat was the threats to the question before the Massachusetts Supreme judicial court today in the case of a juror who was dismissed after saying that she believes the criminal justice system is rigged against African American males\nJoining us on the line to talk about this and judge Nancy Gardner retired federal judge in senior lecturer at Harvard law school she's also WB or legal analyst and she wrote an abacus brief in this case\nHi Nancy Hi [laughter]\nSo so let's get a little bit of background here after searching an apartment in Brockton police found cocaine\nAnd they charged Clinton Williams and African American man with possession with intent to distribute now during jury selection for Williams trial\nA prospective jurors was asked if she might have bias and she said yes because she worked with a low income youth including teenagers convicted of drug crimes and she also said she does think that the criminal justice system is unfair to young black males\nThe prosecutor asked that should be excused the judge dismissed or for cars so what's wrong with that\n[noise] what about it this way if she had said for example that I Believe that the criminal justice system is always fair and that the outcome is always correct we would not have recused start even though that's not true\nWe would not have disqualified her even though that's not true and so to some degree this is a statement that is a general statement which actually is is also true that is to say that the criminal justice system is unfair\nThe problem was there was another question that the judge should've asked which is having that in mind having that in in in your view would you be able to be um would you be able to be fair in this case in other words one can have a general view of the of the criminal justice system but nevertheless said this is what I Would do\nIn a particular case we do that in the death penalty setting all the time what's your opinion about the death penalty well I Am generally oppose well do you think that you could impose it if the facts require it yes that second question\nIs the bias question because that is saying this set of ideas would be an impediment to by being fair in this case but general\nViews about the criminal justice system on either side should be in a different category\n... says so basically would you say are the guidelines for determining potential bias and a potential juror the fitness of a juror I mean it it can people can have all kinds of opinions and I would assume that you would want a variety of opinions among the jury pool so\nGold us MCA sort of just worth and [noise]\nDo what's in this new deal and what will it mean for American workers and companies well joining us to talk about this in the Boston Globe's click steady columnist Evan Horowitz and unwelcome never happy fundraising so you're saying\nWell look versus eleven let's not talk about that I like to have to say well you call this NAFTA to point out what do you mean\nWell I mean I guess we should start with what the heck to call it I mean after two point oh is that the U.S and the idea for the next rests on like the village people the U.S MCA a smoker um it really seems like we should be calling it NAFTA because it's mostly NAFTA\nThe changes are slight non trivial but light and the basic framework remains in place low tariffs among the three nations of North America\nSo so let's talk about some of the some of the changes even if they are ... the babies are dairy auto what are the big eight and you're like\nYeah so well it depends what you mean by big ... of the goals of the Trump Administration was able to accomplish include some increased access to the Canadian dairy market Canada has traditionally made it very difficult for other countries to export a dairy and agriculture\nAnd now some dairy farmers will be able to export more cheese\nA little more milk more sort of dry milk powder that's easier to transport um so that's a slight gain we're talking about fractions of a percentage point in trade for a teen number of jobs but it's something that you mentioned really cared about and the got it\nAnd then next thing is some new incentives to make sure auto manufacturers build their cars in the U.S instead of a in low wage factories in Mexico and soon as this good for Canada\nIs it good for Canada I mean again the big picture is it doesn't change all that much Canadian dairy farmers are not happy but it's not going to affect them in a significant way and the Canadians got something in exchange for that which is\nThe ability to continue either exporting were dumping depending on your perspective suffered lumber this has been an ongoing American complaint about Canada they subsidize their lumber industry and then the excess ends up back in the United states under price and it hurts loggers and lumber industry in the U. S.\nUh and the Trump Administration longest previous administrations tried to end pieces and after that made this possible they didn't so the Canadians get to keep subsidizing exporting lumber they have to give up a little bit of a except a little bit more than ... ... what about this independent tariff defeats settlements system that was involved\nSo that's okay so they're there to to think that they brought here one is become the lumber problem that is it\nA canned the nation's contest each other when they dump and the answer is it's very hard to do and it's still very hard to do the other is the investor a state settlement process that's like\nCompanies who are really unhappy about some new law in Mexico or in Canada there was a system where they had their own special courts where they could go and contests these laws that are passed by parliaments\nAnd they could win rulings from court special courts outside of a normal court system of this has gotten increasingly um controversial in light of ... in other places for instance you've had cigarette companies that will soon nations for anti smoking campaigns are any special courts and\nSaid look I'm really unpopular and that mostly went away there's still one exception which is different oil and gas company in Mexico decides to nationalize the gas industry you'll still be allowed to complain but apart from that no that's gone and not actually could be a big deal it's something that the business lobby in the United states cared about they may continue to lobby against the new NAFTA\nWill say so this is a victory for the way\nI think if nothing else it shows that I think it counts as the first real evidence that Trump's a scorched earth or some ... um foreign policy negotiating strategy can pay off\nA he has taken well he's levy tariffs against Canada and Mexico he threatened to throw out the agreement he threatened further tariffs he's in the negotiations refused to negotiate with both at the same time to go to kind of divide and conquer strategy a this generated a lot of resentment but then it ended in an agreement\nAnd I think until now it's been hard to point\nTrump's negotiating posture aggressive as it is can work but now he can he can say yes we got disagreement and I think that's a big deal I guess the big deal for the agreement and in some ways just reinforces his tendency to act in a completely different ways with other countries\nAnd this went through Sunday this year and it was sort of frenetic this was a deadline right oh why does\nThat mean it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't a deadline you know it's like\nUm it was a self imposed deadline and the reason was often poses because well there are elections coming up in Mexico and we really want to get the new deal signed before the new government comes into Mexico because they may not like it\nSo this is a very strange part of this whole thing is you've got a new president has already been elected in Mexico but hasn't taken office to take off in December and they're trying to rush this through before she take office\nIn fear that he may oppose it so there's a kind of it's not anti democratic ... an outright anti democratic but there are sort of playing with against democratic systems in other countries to make to move this fast that's the only reason we have this deadline\nIt thought these just deal still needs to be approved\nIt needs to be approved by all three countries I that's easier in Canada and Mexico we have ... systems it's harder on the west though I'm there won't be a vote until January that's because these kinds of deals\nHave long vetting requirements congressman tickets times going to look I have to by law so they may not vote until after the terms and after the new Congress comes to DC in January which means you could see Democrats in control the house getting a vote on this deal\nUm I still think they'll vote for it but it'll be an interesting test\nA and magic ... she not that maybe I I enjoy that are gone and listeners you can see a [laughter] basically the challenge will be\nPeople if the Democrats take control of the house it will be on a wave of anti Trump sentiment right so they will come in and it will be very hard for them to vote for Trump trade deal like a smoker\nUm US NCA or NAFTA or whatever calling it\nA on the other hand this trade deal is not a big deal there aren't big reasons to oppose it\nAnd the few changes that do exist aligned with some democratic priorities like uh there are tighter of their better protections for workers in Mexico that's something that Democrats support why would they vote against ...\nOkay ... it'll be interesting if it Horwitz clicked steady columnist for the Boston Globe thanks so much for coming in thank you to stay with us there's more ahead\nI'm Deborah Becker this is radio Boston oh\nFrom Boston University this not only nine W.

B. U. R. Boston NPR News station\n\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker with deep divisions over the sexual assault allegations against the dream Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh we want to spend some time today talking about how young people are processing this controversy and this cultural moment\nA Quinnipiac University poll released yesterday said forty eight percent of American voters most believe Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford forty one percent most believe\nBrett Kavanaugh and today President Trump said this\nIs a very scary time for young men in America when you get the ah you'll see of something that you may not be guilty or\nHow does this divide effect teenagers particularly when it comes to talking with them about sexual assault and consent joining us in Studio ... mega rebel she's founder and director of partners in sex education\nEducation to schools across Massachusetts Hi thanks for coming in hello thanks so much for having me and listeners we want to hear from you have you talked with your children about these hearings and what do you tell them what do you tell teenagers about their Brett Kavanaugh\nHearings and the Senate Judiciary committee hearings and they're related controversy that's been going on since the hearings ended what education around sex and consent looked like in your school\nIt would feel regretful embarrassed humiliated or ashamed of the next day including him\nAnd I think there's a way that help people understand that\nNot only somebody saying yes because again\nIt's it's not like going to a movie but if you go to this well they won't like it oh come on let's give it a try it's not the same kind of thing so getting enthusiastic and said like yes this is something they're both ready for that both interested in the fall it's okay to try\nIt I think they can get a little more clear to not cross the line that people well she said okay and\nMy also so ... is there are those good guidelines ... thank\nYou how ... and that was an amazingly um articulate explanation of enthusiastic consent I particularly like your description of how somebody feels about it later that somebody should not be doing things with their and shamed of\nUm [noise] uh and and all of those other things so I Love that description I Do want to address\nUm the uh the idea that we have comprehensive way of ... in Massachusetts I um would love to know what community or in on an because it sounds like it is does a great job\nUm with comprehensive sexuality education however Massachusetts as a whole is very inconsistent because Massachusetts does not have any required\nUm curriculum and is one of the about half of the states in the nation that requires no kind of sexual health\nUm curriculum doesn't require\nAnything at all only eight states in the nation require consent curriculum and Massachusetts certainly not one of them and I just wanted to say that we had tried to pass last year the healthy youth act\nAnd healthy youth act would have required not that schools had sex ed but that if they had sex ed it'd be medically accurate\nAge appropriate and inclusive and so that means maps to the national ... standards it has to be true and has to be gender and orientation inclusive it does sound as if uh you may have that in your community so I think that's excellent but I Hope that we can get all the communities to catch up in Massachusetts and so right\nNow than in the schools that you work in I mean are there wide differences\nA among schools in terms of what students are taught\nSo uh partners in sex education um goes to a wide variety of schools including some public schools in charter schools although the bulk of the schools that we go to our independence schools\nUm public schools are very inconsistent\nAnd whether they have sex education and this is largely based on whether they have a health teacher who is committed to sex education and who I can do content education and all of these things I strongly recommend having health teacher um because that is the person who is the most well versed in social emotional\nLearning okay well maybe that's the topic of our our next show mega rebel founder and director of partners in sex education and organization that delivers sex education in schools across the state thanks for being with us and thank you so much\n\nFinally tonight we want to bring you another example of WB you are in the Boston Globe's new investigative podcast titled last seen it looks at the unsolved mystery of the world's largest art heist at\nBoston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum last night we brought you the first part of episode to warehouse Kelly horn and jak wrote Alito began exploring the idea of what is the Gardner heist was an inside job\nTonight then the second half we learn about some strange behavior of security guard Rick address twenty minutes before\nAbbott's buys into the into the museum the alarms we'd have tells us he opened and closed the same door why would have done that was he's signaling the bad guys investigators have wondered what's he saying hey the coast is clear\nOr was it ... it has always said it was\nJust something he did every night to make sure the doors alarm was working\nI don't recall what it was something I did write it [noise] does the alarm off the door of a you know a lot of course\nI don't care what he says there's no way\nJohn Paul Kroger trained guards including ... for the overnight shift at the Gardner Museum\nThat right there is a huge risk it makes no sense that you would allow yourself to why in the world would you open that up there's a camera outside that shows palace road there's no reason in the world why you would ever open the door\nSo if you could somehow be proved that added opened and closed the outside door every time he worked the overnight then you'd opening it the night of the highest looks a lot less of suspicion\nIn two thousand ten Rob Fisher the assistant us attorney in charge of the guard your investigation had an idea ... to security changed from the night before\nThere authoring when Rick ad that was also in dating show me that Abbott opened and closed the door that night and I believe that he did it as a matter of course what did you see when you when you watch the video from the night before\nIt was not a guard checking to make sure the doors were secure in long it was somebody being let in after hours and being let in you know\nWhere the robbers when\nMost exactly twenty four hours later oh\nSo the surveillance footage from the night before the Gardner heist does show that opening the door\nWhen the U.S attorney's office released the surveillance video twenty five years after that they did so with a public appeal who is this man it was the closest thing to a bombshell that we've had and the gardening mystery was that guy was it a dry run for the robbery\nAnd we finally going to solve this thing\nWell no and now and now we know who came in the night before\nYes\nWho is it it's a personal we've identified and we are absolutely certain that she's entry was not connected to to how you did in any way shape or form\nAnthony ... won't id the night before a visitor but three former security guards we interviewed confirmed his identity as well as a source close to the investigation demanding question was the gardener museums deputy director of security it turns out recap it was just letting in his boss\nBut John Paul Kroger who trained the guards for their third shift duties says no one was to be let in the museum after hours ever not your boss not even caught\nThe protocol was very straightforward name and badge number call and verify their identity and then if there's a legitimate reason for them to be there then only you let them in a wreck has made some statements that they were never trained on that that's completely false\nThe other guard on duty tonight at the highest the one we're only calling by his first name Randy says security at the gardening museum was lack\nA dear member or somebody order a pizza or some kind of food delivery and they're just posed a write in when they came to the side door it looked like the kind of things done there all the time\nBy night guards give Randy as he says he did witness a pizza delivery guy being ... into the museum in the middle of the night how tight could that security protocol have been\nCertain people really did take their jobs seriously and then others really did not\nCynthia de just worked at the Gardner Museum as a security guard at the time the heist to hear her tell it if there was a rule against late night visitors wasn't followed not even by the gardeners then director and Holly\nShe had had dinner with people and brought the men after dinner like at ten o'clock at night or later she would bring people in to the museum and go into the galleries that breaks that\nThat mindset that breaks that chain of command do not let anyone in after five well\nWhat is a guard an underlying the posted than do\nThe why is this a big deal why can't the museum director comment at night to walk through the galleries with a trusted friend\nWhy can't the deputy security director come in and chat with the guard well it's a very big deal according to security experts what if the director at the door is under duress with a gun to her head\nWhat if there's a bad guy just beyond view of the security camera waiting for his chance to slip into the museum\nThat's why you would never let anyone in after hours simpler the rule the easier it is to follow no one means no one\nIs Abbott's own bosses broke the rules is it fair to blame him for breaking it to\nEnd up all the door opening business say more about the state of security at the Gardner Museum than it does about ... what\nOne eight hundred nine zero nine nine to a seven you can give online at W.

nominee Brett Kavanaugh and FBI investigation into allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were in high school is expected to wrap up this week Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell expect there to be a vote to confirm\nMeanwhile President Trump who'd been somewhat restrained in his comments about all this\nShifted tone yesterday at a political rally in Mississippi where he mocked while before\nI had one right I Want to be\nWell usually goes you know I was wondering how did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago when I don't [noise]\nI don't\nLook him Senator Susan Collins of Maine Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska all key swing votes in this nomination fight\nCriticized the president Collins calling his comments just plain wrong Murkowski calling them appalling joining us now from Washington is so he'll ... poor national political reporter for for Bloomberg Politics but he'll are good to have you thanks for being on the show\nHey Anthony thanks for having me you don't want to ask you about the president who's been as we mentioned somewhat restrained about all of this but then yesterday he sort of return to form what kind of reaction has there been to this attack on Christine Blasey Ford [noise]\nRight well they were reaction on Capitol Hill is as you can imagine an overall pretty negative Democrats are very critical of his remarks several Republicans as you pointed out those three key goats like Murkowski in ... also critical of president\nBut it remains unclear that that changes the calculus in any meaningful way the senator these Republican senator that you just mentioned are not going to\nCast their votes on the ... or something the president says there are a ... a ... you know thinking of a lot more complicated\nRight well I Want to talk a little bit about Senator Jeff flake who was in Boston on Monday and ...\nAnd then yesterday at the Atlantic festival in Washington he raised concerns about the partisan nature of Kavanaugh's testimony last friday here here's a bit of what he said\nIt was very troubled by the tone of the remarks the initial defense the judge Kavanaugh gave I Hope that I Would sound that ... if I felt that I was unjustly maligned but then it went on\nAnd the interaction with some members were sharp and partisan and that concerns me we can't have this on the court\nSo interesting about that so he was when I heard Senator Flake in Boston a on Monday he was a little more restrained then that comment or which is pretty forceful are saying that we can't have this on the court when what are you hearing that comment\nWell this has become a big part of the whole debate surrounding Kavanaugh one of the um main democratic arguments is that his credibility came in the question that hearing about his temperament was not very judicial and otherwise he lashed out you know he was angry with low the village rent at times\nUm he in other words the flakes sounded like what an innocent man would sound like if he's accused but still the argument is is that how I judge should sound ... artist and um you know attitude so I that's been a big part of the ...\nPart of the discussion that's been I'm a huge part of the criticism coming forward that even if he is innocent\nCan someone like Brett Kavanaugh will be trusted to rule and to jog in partially if he's expressing the overtly art invent them in front of course the question are there are some ... is he going to hold a grudge as a result\nRight right ... interesting a flake is bringing that up he's of course one of the the the key swing votes last friday he was the one who sort of shocked the world when he pushed for a delay to allow the FBI investigation\nSo what do we know about ah the FBI investigation so far first of all what do we know when it's expected to conclude one we might see something about it from it will we see something from it\nI've heard some chatter amongst senators today that it could wrap up as early as today and\nUh the the report with first go to the White House and pretty soon it would be here on Capitol Hill with the according to\nSenate majority leader McConnell available for every senator to look at privately it won't be released to the public however we don't know exactly when that's going to end the FBI has not been a you know speaking publicly about this investigation as it usually doesn't but\nEveryone is is kind of anxious to see when it comes out and people are on guard for it to potentially land today if not later\nRight and so he'll water lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez who who is also made allegations against judge Kavanaugh what are they saying about the FBI investigation so far\nThey are arguing that the FBI is not conducting a thorough investigation that it's not following up on a request for him to them\nUh for follow up and for interviews to speak with the FBI is that it hasn't you know pursued other leaders that they consider relevant to the investigation or tried to contact other witnesses that they believe you know could corroborate um or at least shed some light on the uh the allegations here so they have said publicly\nThat um they you know they worry the FBI hands or being tied and that it's not conducting a thorough investigation and that was concerned that the ... and may have had announced critics here on Capitol Hill\nThat's a mistake but there's also this sort of disbelief that someone could entirely forget something a traumatic or something serious that might have happened and and that isn't the case you ... you really can forget in a blackout the other thing that strikes me that really struck me about the interaction\nIs a I I think everybody would agree that when he was asked about his alcohol use\nThat she was quite annoyed at the question he seemed angry about it and annoyed that somebody might be accusing him of drinking too much\nAnd it turns out that one of the medical questionnaires that we used to detect alcohol use disorder\nOr one of the questions is about if you've ever been annoyed when people ask you about or criticize your drinking I'm not suggesting that he has an alcohol use disorder he may or he may not I can't diagnose that up but it is a feature and it it raises that question I I also wouldn't suggest that heavy drinking disqualifies anyone from\nHaving an important job as many people with alcohol use disorder or fully employed and quite successful or but it does it raise that question for me\nWell it's interesting too because if you look at this for example from a judge or Kavanaugh's point of view if he's absolutely convinced that he didn't do this\nI'm Andy had a blackout I mean he sort of being asked to prove a negative I mean he certainly didn't do it if he had a blackout he wouldn't remembered if he did so it's sort of puts him in this peculiar situation as well if he is innocent\nRight I think in in that case if if if he understood what a blackout was and he understood that it could happen if you drank heavily and rapidly then he would have to at least be open to the possibility that he did something terrible and didn't remember it and\nPeople who have recurrent blackouts or and and have a more serious condition alcohol use disorder often feel guilty that they may have done something and they and they feel regret about it and say gee you know I I really don't remember it but if I did that I'm really sorry about it right well\nWell this has been really fascinating I'm a doctor Richard said she's chair of Boston University's school of public health department of\nCommunity health scientists and he's in his diction medicine specialist Dr ... thanks so much for joining us to I really appreciate it has very glad to join you thanks listeners stay with us there's more ahead we're going to talk
