and what we're learning from this trial involves more than just the case that's being heard\nI lost it in front of the groups are the group students for fair admissions claims that Harvard discriminates against Asian American applicants and Harvard maintains that race is just one factor that takes into account to create a diverse student body and it denies that any discrimination going on\nBut this six days of testimony in this trial have raised questions for that Harvard admissions college admissions in general especially involving issues related to economic diversity and whether that should be considered in admissions as well\nThe last time today talking about these questions that trial and about defining diversity on campus let's there we want to hear from you should economics considered in college admissions in how\nHow do you define diversity you can call us at eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nYou can also tweet us at\nRadio Boston and first we're going to go to the w._b. you are at a fire reporter max Larkin who has been following this Harvard tile welcome max Hi dad so tell us what happened today\nWell you had top Harvard officials on the stand for the second day in a row and they're being asked about the kind of efforts they've made to find a way to build the kind of diverse class they want without resorting to race without considering race at all the Supreme Court has asked that colleges like Harvard make a good faith effort to find\nSo called race neutral approaches to fostering diversity\nThe lawyers for the group suing Harvard students for fair admissions are grilling dean\nAt ... am with Harvard say\nThey say we've ... first of all that we convened to separate commissions Harvard convene two separate commissions that were designed to look into that question they said at the end of that process of looking at it they said they found no workable way to use race\nUm or they they found no workable way to build a diverse um and really academically excellent student body without ...\nAnd now there's also been talk about socio economics and that kind of diversity and the student body ... has that been addressed in court acts\nIt started to come up in earnest yesterday dad and I think it's a fascinating thing that's always been in the background here so Harvard more and more has a racial breakdown that largely matches that of the country but it's much more skewed when it comes to income like most universities in this country certainly most elite universities\nMhm I'm Wondering you know do you when you hear the statistics that we heard for example in the Boston Globe that wealthy students out number low income students at Harvard twenty three two one what do you think about socio economic diversity in how how to possibly change that or or does that doesn't matter\nYeah I think I mean I agree I agree that it isn't surprising to hear that mom I Do think it's also important as role said to note that I'm Harvard is one institution the vast majority of students go to school and institutions that are not Harvard and many of them reflect\nA much more diverse population of students including socioeconomic status\nBut I guess I I don't mean to interrupt but I guess that I'm going to ask grow all this too I mean if you're saying well that's the top school so that's that's okay if it's the top school and that's primarily well see I mean isn't that further separating thing\n[noise] I guess you also have to ask is it indeed the top school right I mean is it the top school the very the place where each individual students will excel\nUs you know a student who is best prepared to meet the challenges that they intend to encounter in the world that's the best school for them that may not be harbored that may be harbored depends I truly believe it depends on the individual student and it isn't just about\nUm you know that the school that is ranked the best but the school where that student can thrive and excel\nAnd want to make sure we get some time and to take calls as well listeners remember we want to hear from you about this should diversity be considered in college admissions how and how do you define diversity you can call us at eight hundred for two three eight to five five minutes eight hundred for two three talk\nDavid is calling from Lexington David you're on the air\nHi thank you [laughter] um I think diversity of the uncommon classes more important than racial diversity although the only thing that's somewhat important too\nBut uh we have in this country on expanding journey quotient which is so I think one of the top two churning quotient from the among western industrialized nations and it's getting worse and politically\nOr people or bending the rules so that the rich are getting ever richer\nAnd the I think having a you know a bunch of lower class people at Harvard with a much better ratio than one twenty three so that\nThe upper class people at Harvard to get to know them and hear their stories a might help do something about this problem in the future uh which which you know near racial diversity I live in a\nRacially diverse neighborhood where the average house is\nProbably worth close to a million dollars I mean you know we're we're not that different from each other and uh it's nothing like the difference between me and someone is growing up in\nA bad part of town with the family income of twenty or thirty thousand dollars a year and then I just think put the Harvard ... through the country a great service by a having a lot more diversity of class okay\nWell Thanks David very much for the call rule I Want to ask you um I\nI Wonder you know the Harvard has said that you know it does it ... well the students and in part it does that because it helps that isn't it more low income students right so\nA who otherwise wouldn't be able to enroll right we were charging them full full tuition here and we're able to offer more assistance to lower income students that is that fair\nAnd in many schools have said that right they say that it helps us you know what if we admit more if we met wealthier students are helping to subsidize the lower income students is that fair\nWas certainly fair and the keys of other institutions but in the case of a harbinger of Stanford or yellow others with with with\nEndowments that are thirty billion plus Harvard could if it wanted offer I'm Free tuition to every student that attended there and still be able to have enough money to to run its operations would likely be able to still bringing the kind of um\nOf funding that they do through all of my relations and other forms so to just for Harvard if if this was their argument\nIf if it wasn't for these um these high income students coming to our situation I think that's just a fallacy that might have been the case or maybe a couple of hundred years ago but not today I I Do want to mention one of the things is\nThis hitting of of of whether or not we need to preference low income students\nOr racial minorities are I think is is is on hopeful ah there if we're looking and we have to be up to date on this but if we're looking at\nUm what is crowding out both racial minorities in low income students it is these other preferences in his preference at Harvard for instance around legacy admissions around um students with athletic abilities and\nMany many other things that we see coming out of the secrets awesome as trial would you if you if you listen to ...\nUm who's being forced to grudgingly so uh it's it's all the world that Harvard does its admissions are and we can see that which which crowding out students is not\nUm is not this preference for low income students who for racial minorities it's all these other things\n... ... can you weigh in there in terms of legacy in athletics and those types of admissions criteria on colleges I mean to those need to change so we can have more diversity\nI think it also goes to the diversity of our classes you know again diversity is so broadly defined and so we're trying to\nPut together a diverse student body is we're trying to populate aren't a lot of teams are orchestras are student government we're trying to bring in students who represent that broad variety of backgrounds in terms of their abilities and accomplishments in terms of their perspective than in terms of how they contribute to our campus climate so I Would argue that\nThose factors are part of the diversity that each institution and trying to build\nYou know we heard a cut from a island Shapiro on a and R billboard to the show today who's on radio Boston earlier this month senior fellow at the Kato Institute and and said you know replacing white privileged kids of doctors and lawyers with black privileged kids have doctors and lawyers doesn't seem like adding diversity so I\nGet the point but how would you measure a sort of socio economic diversity and use that as a criteria for admissions Stephanie\nI'm Sorry can you repeat the question again so it how do you make sure that you're achieving socio economic diversity what's your income standard ... how how do you know when it when you you're achieving a more diverse student body\nYeah that's a that's a really good question I mean I think that um you know there I I guess I'm not fully aware of their being at the civic um metric around at that that each institution would be held to there's so many complicating factors that figure into how every institution put together\nIts class from I'm from a financial perspective you know it was stated earlier that you know Harvard is different Harvard could indeed meet that need it every student who applied that just isn't the case that the vast majority of institutions in this country and so we do have to\nReally look at what are the revenue need that eats institution ... and how can we generate them and it varies greatly across institutions and institutional type\n... and I'm Wondering where what happens with the Harvard child from here\n[noise] uh well we've got a lot more to go it's a three week trial um and you we can expect that we're going to hear I'm not just the end of the plaintiffs case but we'll be hearing for instance from\nUm a Mickey friends with the court so students who've been affected by this policy and generally praised the policy are going to get a chance to testify in Harvard will present each case that what it's doing is not only complying with the law but beneficial kind of necessary for its institutional priorities\nWB are at a fire reporter max luck and thanks for being with us thank you also wrote\nWill Fernandez program

based primary care at a public health collaboration that what you're talking about that we might need to to prevent this revolt well\nI think that's one of the near things that we're going to need to do in order to build a healthcare system instead of a market you know the the neighbor's house station where opening in Central Falls is one single clinical enterprise that has primary care behavioral health\nUm and an urgent care and emergency medical services in Lebanon X ray I'm and substance abuse treatment all in one one place one team of people responsible for the care of the entire population of the of the city of Central Falls are about twenty thousand people\nThat's what it looks like\nYou know sort of city by city in place by place\nBut I think what we really need to do is start the revolt\nThe only way to get this done given the weight of money that's transferred to the other side the weight of resistance to any small change\nThe only way to get this done is to build a movement that is going to have to look something like the civil rights movement or the abolitionist movement or the movement for marriage equality you know we have in this nation been able to fundamentally change our society\nA number of times but we have to work on it and it doesn't happen overnight and it doesn't happen just by writing a law it happens by\nGeneral mobilization of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people are working together the the resistance is so huge\nLA and kind of cynical\nUm well I think all of us have gotten cynical and all of us have gotten to accept it of the one trillion dollars that people who have something to sell spent point over five percent of that money on lobby\nThat's five hundred million dollars a year round lobby that kind of spending has totally distorted the political process and has made things so that uh our legislators often pay much more attention to people with something to sell than they do to the people they represent\nAnd the only way to get that back is is to build a mobilization\nYou say doctors doctors should do this and they should unionized and they should strike well\nDoctors nurses health care physical therapist healthcare workers in general\nWe have a as a model\nI'm living in chestnut hill Dr Bernard wound won the Nobel Peace prize prize in Nineteen eighty five he's a a model in a teacher

realize that all of the cardiology if he could ever do would be useless if there was a nuclear war\nI'm so he began to work with colleagues around the nation and around the world and he met a colleague who would similarly renowned and the Soviet the then Soviet Union a doctor ... you've been each has enough and together they organized something called the international physicians to prevent nuclear war\nUm that group of people do lots of organizing both inside the healthcare community has an outside of it and actually forced nuclear disarmament and that's what got them the Nobel Peace prize that's the example that I think all of us need to follow\nWhat do you say that it has to say you know yet it's expensive and that's why it's the best in the world costs money\nUm it's not the best in the world um when we look at it we ranked somewhere between forty first in fifty seventh and the world for Republicans outcomes um depending on which outcome we're looking at him which year it is\nWe're not even close to the best outcomes in the world so our infant mortality rate is three times the best achievable rates in the world for the average American and nine times the best achievable outcomes for African Americans that is not the best in the world\nSome would say though that there are people from other countries who flip flop care to take the health care that we have that in channeling my father in law here you know I Know exactly what he would say so\nThey'd say well they all are hospitals are top notch in and then if you look at the mass ... of the world where some people have florists dedicated to that and you know to be able to get health care here what do you say a few\nPeople come here for a very sophisticated healthcare but most people in most parts of the world understand that their basic healthcare is way better than ours is in most countries most countries that do this with any level of\nSophistication of success everybody has access to primary care a similar to the model we're building in Central Falls\nUm that primary care is available to them and that's where they start and they make sure that every single person in the society has that

agencies a multi state investigation into all of the opioid manufacturers and distributors who need to be held accountable for the crisis that they created that his work that is important and that is work that I Will also continue\nMr McMahon she energy treatment or own after you've talked about the new ... the idea that we should look into paying for private addiction treatment what does that even mean and who would pay\nOkay here's here's the problem right now the current government sponsored programs have Ninety nine per cent sale you're right we have people who were going through their like revolving doors there are people now opiate addicts have gone through dozens of times to government sponsored programs\nOne type through eighty seven percent successful for opiate addicts in other words start to finish with a program by gives out\nNo relapse in other words we can give opiate addicts bill life back what what has to be a comprehensive program now everybody says well we can't afford that kind of a program where already paying some in some cases up to thirty times but people going through the government programs\nSo I Am saying let's do it right let's do it once\nLedge you'd be opiate addicts their life back and make them productive citizens and taxpayers in the commonwealth of Massachusetts\nAttorney general Halley which I thought\nWell I you know I I agree with Jay that we need to be doing I think this is your position you'd agree we need to be doing all we can to make access to treatment longer treatment more sustained treatment available for all who are afflicted with disease and substance use disorder\nSo it's a reason I sued frankly the Trump Administration when they threatened to cut off Medicaid funding to our state 'cause that under cuts our ability to get people access to the care and treatment that they need so I've long been an advocate for treatment and I think truly we need to do a better job\nOr not just as a state but as a country dealing with real issues of substance use disorder of addiction and behavioral house it frankly I think are present in all of our families and and that's where I come from on this\nUh education treatment support well certainly doing all we can to get after those who are pumping poison into our communities\nI Want to talk a little bit about the criminal justice reform and as it relates to this particular topic when a component of the criminal justice reform bills you may know I'm just McMahon was eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for low level drug offenses where you stand on that of a mandatory minimums\nOkay on mandatory senators I'm there is um I I Do draw the line with just people who are just opiate addicts themselves I Would prefer to put them in some kind of a treatment facility and give them rehabilitation to give them a life back\nIf we give them the their lives back they will not go back to opiates and we deprive the drug traffickers of another customer has to be done one by one however\nI Am not in favor of giving drug traffickers are drug distributors\nA pass on their crimes you've got to do it on a two prong approach you've got to eliminate the customers and then you've got to eliminate the provisions of this poison it by being tough on them will drive him out of state or put him in jail either way we eliminate the problem\nTreasure what does your dog does include mandatory sentence for footing oh do you consider that exemption\nWell I'm I consider the legislation that was passed to be important legislation and you know one of the things I recognize as attorney general when I started is that we didn't actually have a lot on the books that made the trafficking of federal crime and sentinel is really what is poisoning killing so many people right now in our state\nI Am proud and it was my office that propose that lot in the first place and we have been out there enforcing it as I said earlier my office alone has prosecuted hundreds of individuals for drug trafficking crimes\nIn addition we have taken millions and millions of lethal doses of setting on heroin off of the streets I think I'd been aggressive um and I will continue to be very aggressive working with local state and federal law enforcement on this issue\nAs for our sentencing guidelines I advocated that we eliminate mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders I agree that these individuals need more than anything care and support and there are ways to do that now with in the criminal justice system as a result\nOf the criminal justice reform legislation that I help support\n'em and that's important work that that the attorney general's office needs to continue to do\nThat directly and ah you said the attorney general's office needs to let those and law enforcement and know that they have the support of the attorney general what do you mean by that well I'll\nTell you exactly what I mean uh uh my opponent just mentioned a few moments ago that she has a going out to hundreds of individuals when it comes to drugs apparently not enough individuals because we've ... she has a sanctuary city policy\nOr she encourages cities to become sanctuary cities in other words she didn't want to deal with the feds now we've got clear evidence of that and the just two weeks ago and and sanctuary city Lawrence\nWhich was an all federal job they wound up wind enough bent nova Joe how from Massachusetts\nAnd they were all illegal aliens some of them members of MS Thirteen right here under our noses\nDealing in and distributing and trafficking in heroin and start no we just saw two days ago the same problem\nIllegal aliens showing this stuff they found Seventy pounds on you know someone mentioned that phone us ... that's the jovial the house from Massachusetts there's too much out there and she won't deal with the feds but I Will I Will\nSettle time it's time attorney general hilly can you respond to\nThe ... and it's it's totally inaccurate not only has my office prosecuted and investigating cases with\nFederal law enforcement here in Massachusetts we didn't work in those cases hard with our federal partners in New Hampshire as well because if you want to talk about\nThe Lawrence area for example you have to consider the pipeline that exists and the trafficking that his existing between our states between among the Maine New Hampshire\nAnd Massachusetts that's why my office set up a sentinel strike force at the outset with state local and federal agents FBI da both New Hampshire in Massachusetts says they said\nThree years ago out of the gate I it was my office that security a million dollars from our federal government the U.S department of justice to pursue these cases that his work that we've continued and I will continue as attorney general\nYou know when I mention um the the prosecution's and the cases that we've had and we had had a number of cases and take down\nUm but I also come back to the need to recognize that\nAs aggressive as we are and will continue to be if we don't deal with real issues of treatment and education in this state we're not going to get to where we need to be that continues to need to be a focus\nSo I I just would like also would like to take a minute before we remind folks are about what they're listening to a exactly what you think of this idea about private treatment and success of treatment and the system that we have now attorney general Haley\nWell you know I think that ah it's important that we make chicken treatment available both public and private means right now I talked to a lot of people who call my office and my health care hotline who are desperately seeking access to treatment and care and coverage we need a system that works better for people\nLast week I was testifying before a health policy condition and some of the issues related to the cost of health care and the barriers that people confront and just trying to find\nAccess to healthcare it's something that is a priority for me as attorney general it will continue to be a priority and we need to continue to do all we can\nTo seek the support frankly at the federal government here so that we had we have access to the resources that we need to better take care of our people\n'cause I Want to remind listeners you're listening to a special edition of radio Boston live from the campus center at UMass Boston this debate is between the two candidates for Massachusetts attorney general\nThe debate is sponsored by WVU our and our partners at UMass Boston so corporate graduate school of policy in global studies and the Boston Globe\nWe have with us incumbent democratic attorney general more healing and her Republican challenger Jane McManus who's a trial attorney from Cape Cod we're broadcasting live on Ninety point no end up we'll give you are also streaming live video\nThe best judge's decision is on the computer [noise]\nOwn out your ... your take on this uh ... what's your view of the red flags law\nWhich allows a family member to petition the court to temporarily take away someone's gone if they pose a threat to themselves for someone else you would express it I think believe it or previous debate that people who are prone to violence for people with mental health issues should see gun ownership restrictions is this a reasonable gun on a restriction well\nFirst of all the right now under current law or the chiefs of police over the licensing authority generally the chiefs of police in any town or city or the police commissioner or their designate he's\nAlready have a right when it comes to shoot ability um I don't actually agree with the suit ability the way it is written because it leaves the subject of standard\nAs opposed to an objective standard that every other statutes on the planet as but this was the subject of stand it struck the police chief has some issue as the suit ability he can revoke someone's license to carry them they have to go to a hearing to get her back\nBut this law here that you mentioned goes way too far it allows an invasion of someone's house when since Seventeen Ninety the founding of the country almost we've had a\nRight of protection that government officials cannot invade your home or your private papers or anything that you have unless they have probable cause and so if they have probable cause then they can get a warrant and do what they have to do but not just on a hunch that said okay\nAnd then just respond 'cause this is an important law that I think was past sixty two percent of gun deaths in this country are suicide to me any measure an effort that we can take due process provided to make sure that somebody who is a danger to themselves\nDoesn't have access to a weapon that will kill them temporarily remove that weapon I think that's an obligation something that we go on to those individuals and certainly to their families the\nGeneral Haley or office a is investigating the state police Senate uh overtime and payroll scandals and some folks have been charged us some people if\nShould be fired maybe the secretary of public safety should go because of this do you have confidence in the current leadership here in terms of what's going on with the state police and what what what\nElse should be done I think that we have seen time and time again any problems with culture involving the operation of the state police however\nMy office has been aggressive we were the first to investigate and announcing investigation into the ... the the pike scandal already we've returned indictments against three former lieutenant of the state police\nAnd that investigation is ongoing\nWe've also been involved in the investigation regarding allegations of a champion of police reports with respect to the former crawl in the state police so my office has been very involved in these matters we will be aggressive we will continue to hold us accountable who needs to be held accountable\nI Do support though the reforms that have been undertaken by the current colonel and by the bakery administration were going to continue to work in partnership that is important that we have\nA state police department of the highest quality and one that the public believes in and has confidence in and I certainly want to do everything I can to support the hard working men and women within the state police who are out there every day on the front lines working hard to to protect our families and our communities\nMeasures for the ... like I I have no confidence in uh what my opponent just said about what investigation she's going to take with the state police\nThere was a Supreme judicial court decisions that just came down two weeks ago talking about people in her office in the the the decision there when it came to another scandal that's already in the government and that is a scandal at the state we drug lab\nIt's above the attorney general's office then engage in agree just prosecutorial misconduct fraud ...\nLack of moral compass\nTheir conduct was ... has a boat and magnified by the fact that it was not limited to an isolated incident but rather to his theories of calculated misrepresentation the ramifications from them as ... a nothing short of the stomach\nThat means there's heavy corruption in the attorney general's office\nI don't trust them investigating corruption when they have their own office and the people who were responsible for doing that\nThey weren't fired they were promoted inside\nLetter to correct the record on that night that they do not work for your office these folks do you know these these folks worked under the prior administration I did not hire them I did not supervised than they did not when during my time\nSo I have a face in our office I I you know I\nI think that's a very unfortunate recitation and I just wanted to clear the record that that occurred under prior administration again by the way my office has worked from the beginning to make sure that steps were taken to address issues surrounding\nThe wrongdoing and the misdeeds us on your rock and the handling of evidence that the drug lab our office has been out there including in that very case\nUm that was recently decided by the U.S Jaycee my office advocated for the dismissal of thousands of cases as a result of that misconduct at the lab\nBut let's just so folks know if they're listening for from the audience so they just know what were referencing here this was a Supreme judicial court ruling in the case of a drug labs scandal out ... the former chemist on your fair uh\nWas accused of using drugs samples that were being tested as evidence in criminal cases and thousands of cases where does this by the state's highest court just two weeks ago and in that ruling from the judge the judge did say that former assistant attorney general did engage in prosecutorial misconduct\nSo I Do think oh these two folks have gone on to other jobs not in your office should be age you'd be responsible for\nMaking sure that there are legal ramifications against these folks attorney general hilly\nThere had been legal ramifications against the endocrine currently the matter is under review by the board of bar overseers\nUm but I really do take issue with the characterization about the integrity of the hard working men and women in the attorney general's office the attorneys the investigators the troopers\nYou know everybody on down the line you've got six hundred people working their tails off day in and day out on behalf of people across the state to make sure their rights are protected you know and I and I really\nResent the ... of their integrity I think that we're very lucky to have these men and women doing the work that they do may I respond\n[noise] [noise]\nThe way the visuals\nWere responsible for this they have gone on to bigger and better jobs I said six figure incomes one of them went on to be in it is and it is now and just in court magistrate with the uh Suffolk superior court and the other one is a general counsel for the alcoholic beverage control commission\nAll with the endorsement of more Healy\nIs Jay Jay that are just you know what a bleak picture to please scandal Bora Huey investigating it\nAre you kidding if it hadn't been for his ruling nothing would get done she usually Johnny come lately she's been getting around it and the press for doing nothing about the state police scandal we've known about it for over a year and just the other day she decided to do something about it\nYou know drew leveling who is the U.S a journey if it weren't for him we would have nothing going on as far as the ... no problem we have here because he's the one that's doing all the work and we have no indictment and the they please unless she came out on a\n... that's time attorney general Haley\nI I think I've been through this I'll let the record speak for itself we were the first to announce and investigate the state police we have been involved in any number of state police investigations and in terms of our drug prosecutions as they already set in my office has prosecuted\nAnd continues to prosecute and hold accountable drug cartels drug traffickers so that just inaccurate those characterizations 'em and all I can say is we're going to continue to do the work that we're here to do\nAnnouncing in doing something with two different things [noise]\nDrug use sued over the president's travel ban and separating families at the U.S border in his you know we now have a caravan of thousands of people from on doors for each of us border which should or how should law enforcement responds curbing it gets to the border\nWell law enforcement ought to do its job they're processes in place to deal with folks as they arrive at the border but I think part of what this speaks to the failure of the federal government to take action on immigration reform and what needs to happen and you alluded to the cases that we have brought against the Trump Administration\nYou know we sued as a state to protect the DACA program because these are kids who are serving in our military starting businesses paying taxes who all of a sudden we're going to have the red ripped out from under them we sued and we do and we won\nWe sued to protect a people when this Muslim ban came down\nYou know who I heard from two over the weekend when that Muslim men first came down our colleges and universities including the University of Massachusetts that literally had students and professors step overseas\nAre teaching hospitals and research institutions and major employers and businesses in the state who
