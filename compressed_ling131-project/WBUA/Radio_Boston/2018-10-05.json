horrendous aversion as well to people who do horrible things to women not to mention killing them and little kids yeah [noise] so you know helped me out I mean talk about this sort of moral complexity

Massachusetts in a small yard or he volunteers are at the council on aging and drives you know elderly women usually two doctors appointments in the grocery store et cetera [noise] and he listens to books on tape mainly history\n[noise] um what I discovered in you know you and I've talked about the creative writing process before but for for me it's it's it's really all about finding which\nThere and and it it it's a weird kind of thing because this is a work of the imagination yet there is a feeling that when when it's going well that you're not making this stuff up that you really just kind of uncovering it [laughter] and so when I began to find was\nA he had sort of cast if he'd been out of prison for twenty five years and that he he sort of put himself in his own solitary that he uh he doesn't date women he he sticks to himself is a very solitary existence and what I kept feeling from him was was this complex combination of contrition\nUm but he still has a hot tempered yeah he still has a short fuse and he knows this about himself\nAnd um I got this reactor yeah yeah that's right I forgot [laughter] that's right\nWhite hot reactor that sometimes turns on and get some and in the case of killing his wife gets them into all kinds of trouble\nYeah as a kid he was a comic book reader in and um he began in in the letter is you know that he begins to write to Susan\nIs a way to sort of describe the crazy kid he's views himself as having been he talks about himself in the third person he describes himself that he could have been a a character in one of his own comic books and you could call him the reactor [noise]\nAnd um that that rang true to me so I kept going with it and I'm discovered more things about him but I Do I Do want to tell you though that I shared Sherry ambivalence I [noise]\nBut it's so hard you know I I think it's impossible to write character driven fiction um it's honest if if if you're judging your own characters I think you've got to allow anyone in in a way that they are um\nEven if you don't like it you know police Pascal I Love this line anything written to please the author is worthless and [noise]\nSo it didn't please me but it didn't just please me because I felt that I was uncovering something honest about the men even though I detest what he did but like kept discovering was ... I could not to test it more than he did\nYou know you seem you are haunted by [noise] certain lives I mean how wrongly certain lives can go I'm thinking of your last novel the garden of last days you featured a nine eleven attack or and yet you know sort of flush them out in a real way he\nOr he went on a whole person someone going so long you tell the story of Daniel why do you suppose you're drawn to these cares\nYou know I I don't know I I but you're absolutely right to put it that way I Do seem to be [noise]\nHaunted by how wrongly certain lives can go in and um I don't know I mean I you know a lot of us grow up around dysfunction and bad news and I certainly had my share as well I don't know if that has shaped how Amazon adult I Do know that\nUm I Do know that in this bumper sticker Christianity but I Do believe it's important to hate the sin and not the center [laughter] and and um even those of us who do the most heinous things\nAh they were somebody's baby and I'm not saying excuse them and I'm not saying you embrace them and I'm not saying you let them out of jail even\nUm but you know I Love this line from Tom Waits you know the great singer songwriter from one of his songs are attacking mine\nThere is no devil there's just God when he's drunk [laughter] that's a great it's a great life as bless me too many people out there is I mean that line could get Tom Waits you know in prison or worse Rogers across the world right now but it's it's it's a line that I find myself so I'm subscribing to\n[laughter] I don't know why I'm remind I was reminded of this ... I Love your memoir county and I remember I think you're talking to you about your dad at the end of town and and you said something that's stuck with me for years because I sort of read that and and and then when I got to the end of the novel I was sort of St mad\nInjuries to have you know she was like he was tough on the family and and I asked you you know how you sort of found capacity to be so loving to him at the end of his life and you said\nI truly believe that people do the best they know how to do that sort of went back and extracted that quote right and it just made quite an impression on me and is that the way you also look at Daniel I think so\nI think so because I now I remember in that conversation we had\n... which I I Do believe that all of us get out of bed across the planet or get off the ground wherever we sleep trying to have the best day we know how to have ... which is not necessarily the best day we can have yeah and that's where growth comes in right you know a\nYes reading from Daniel's point of view or certainly has led into that question you know one of my favorite lines from Flint Oreo con or one of her essay she says a writer's beliefs are not what she sees but the light by which she sees [laughter]\nSo I look back at you know all that I'd written over the years um I've learned I've learned a lot about when I Believe in that one ... keeps coming up yeah I'm\nA good one I mean it's a good one to keep in mind I think like I think if\nIt leaves room for all of us to grow and we all screw up hopefully we don't screw up is horribly is doing our own people like him\nRight but they screw up given their demons given their upbringing given their background they're sort of I mean not that you're again as you say you're not excusing someone who murders their wife but it's it's like worth getting into their shoes and trying to understand what\nIt let me tell you why I think it's worth it because I I don't believe I'll just speak for myself you know I've been writing all my adult life and and if I have learned nothing you know what I've been learning or I'd be keeps coming to me lately\nIs a deeper I dig down into my own psyche and I write these these stories I don't think there is another I don't I don't believe in the other ... I think we are one with everybody and even those who do things that we did test\nEven those elected to an office who do things we did test him you know there's the we're we're all we're all in this somehow and and I and I think it's it's it's good for our humanity individually to imagine walking in the shoes of any other kind of human being even those we did test\nI Want to come back and ask you to talk about something that you mentioned a moment ago when when when you are right this is about the writing process when you're writing when do you know that the creator force it is with you I mean in other words I'm asking\nOn the one hand I imagine a writer pushing a vision of a story along deciding where it wants to go but there's a point when you suddenly feel sort of um that the story is guiding you you know that's what you described in my my guess is that must be an amazingly an amazing relief\nIn it and it's it's as deeply pleasurable a creatively and and for me it comes about when when two forces are in play and\nIn one is it has to be curiosity yeah\nYou know you have to be authentically curious about a situation in the same way by the way you can't force yourself to fall in love with a particular person you've ever tried that I tried it once did and you either fall in love or you don't yeah or the same way I don't think you can you can choose what you are curious about either so\nThat's number one you need to have that as creative fuel that seems to me and then the other thing is you've got to bring in at least three to ... for me three of the five senses and every moment in order\nInto the truth of that human being like right now we're in a in a radio station we'd be having a totally different conversation if we were sitting outside on a deck with a sea breeze right even if we're talking about the same thing we would change just on that level\nSo I found over the years if I can get those two ingredients together um and then proceed with you know fear in face that something will come something always comes something always comes one of my favorite lines is from an ancient Chinese anonymous port\nBut what I just heard is absolutely preposterous ... this is this is more of a cover up\nThen invests than an investigation market place yeah let me ask\nYou about last friday's extraordinary hearing with with Dr ... judge Kavanaugh did Democrats in your view perhaps make a mistake I mean they spend a lot of that time demanding an FBI investigation\nAnd are people who might feel the other way could say well they got it people will debate whether or not the hearing was complete the investigation was complete enough but Republicans in particular wavering Republicans now have the cover that the FBI went back and took another look\nAnd I'm Wondering if you feel with hindsight the Democrats play this hand badly\n[noise] well the goal which we had was to get an FBI investigation\nIn reality what has happened is that we've had a\nA a a shadow of the uh the uh pretend an investigation by the FBI under constraints that had been imposed by the Trump White house in terms of how far they can go so to the extent to which they can put the name F. B. I. on this investigation\nThat's the totality of the credibility that that that you we can give to of this process because uh beyond that it's empty pages ... nothing behind it except to cover sheet saying FBI so its cynicism\nOr on stilts that's what the Republicans are engaging in\nA day are definitely trying to rush to judgment there in gate of engaging the systematic cover up the entire way we still haven't seen Ninety three percent of all of the documents that that Brett Kavanaugh chandeliers inside of the White House Ninety three percent of all of his documents are in a\nIn the American people know that what's at stake ultimately is that Donald Trump said that he was going to appoint someone to the Supreme Court\nWho would repeal wrote the weight would repeal the Affordable CARE Act and protections for a pre existing conditions all that gets lost in this a charade which the Republicans have constructed a and called an FBI investigation\nThat are marketing it literally out ten seconds or Fifteen seconds left or so but it doesn't look like at least from where I'm sitting in Boston that the Democrats are going to be able to stop this though is that a is that the way it looks to you at this point well\nThe the experts didn't have John McCain coming out to put his thumb down at one o'clock in the morning to save the Affordable CARE Act so you have any of it or we're going to continue to work everyday Heidi Heitkamp a drum not to go to just announced that she was going to vote no in most experts\nSay for the past two or three weeks that she would vote yes the cabinet so I don't think we know the answer yet far and that's why we're going to keep our energy level Ohio and I and I hope that the American people do as well as our airport and for us to assume that we're going to lose so I think we can we still have a chance to win\nMassachusetts senator Ed Markey thanks so much for joining us today we're very grateful no thank you much\nRegime [noise]\n\n\nFinally tonight we want to bring you another installment from WVU are in the Boston Globe's new investigative pod cast last seen it dives deep into the unsolved mysteries of the world's largest art heist at the Isabella Gardner Museum in Boston almost Thirty years ago\nLast night we brought you the first half of episodes three we heard from host Kelly horn and jak wrote illegal beginning there and look at this idea was the high plane in Dorchester auto body shop in the belly of Boston's criminal underworld\nTonight we have the second half of episode three picking up with retired FBI agent David ... talking about a tip from FBI informant Anthony Romano\nOnly told me that a car Milam or Leno wanted to Rob looms Fargo vote facility in eastern\nSide of the Boston FBI county remind out with a century accuser line informant his notes on the ... and ... and conversations he had served inside T I C helped ... work on his angle on them and they helped Cronin where kids on the Gardner [noise]\nWe obtained Anthony my mind as a confidential informant or parts of the ...\nNineteen Ninety and November Nineteen Ninety eight\nEither alongside ...\nFat which that's not the name is mother gave\nFat which he was born Richard Tchaikovsky picture a sharply dressed Bostonian missing all of his hair and some of his front teeth within ...

B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station\n[noise]\nNinety nine WB you are with special coverage from radio Boston Good afternoon I'm Anthony Brooks and we're following breaking news as the U.S Senate gets set to vote on the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh tomorrow this morning following the FBI's weeklong investigation into\nCleared a major hurdle in the Senate procedural vote of fifty one forty nine that moves the nomination to a final vote tomorrow and here's where we stand right now Arizona Senator Jeff flake says he will vote yes to confirm Kavanaugh he was one of the key\nRepublican swing votes in this nomination battle Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski the one of the other key Republican swing vote says she will vote no so this could come down to Republican\nSusan Collins of Maine who's expected to announce her decision from the Senate floor any minute now and we will bring you that live\nA when that happens until then I'm joined by our friday week in review panelists tc oughta daring professor and co director\nOf the center for social innovation at Boston College she's also a member of WB ... executive advisory board and a regular member of our weaken review panel to sound a Happy Friday thanks for coming in thanks for having me also with us Tom Nichols who's a professor of national security affairs at the U.S Naval War college in Newport Rhode Island and\nThe Harvard extension call a school he's here in his personal capacity not representing the U.S Naval War college Tom thanks so much for coming in nice to be back\nThanks so uh what a week and as we wait for Susan Collins to begin her comments on the Senate floor to ceiling I'll start with you\nThere is a huge amount of pressure on this Republican senators shoulders right now what are you thinking about\nYou know I'm having had some Public Leadership roles in my career previously\nWhen you ask to be put in these leadership positions you have said I Want the burden of responsibility of representing the American people and sometimes that\nBurden sit very very heavily on your shoulders and I my heart goes out to her for the difficulty of this decision and I also think this is a moment when we need so many people to remember that they asked to be the leaders in this position making these decisions when that\nLittle bit of information about us Susan Collins of Maine she was among the senators who voted yes to move this toward a procedural vote which uh Tom might\nLead one to indicate or just to suspect that she will vote yes tomorrow but it doesn't necessarily mean that so we're waiting to hear from her but what are you thinking about what what is Susan Collins a you know juggling in her mind ... before she makes us very difficult decision\nWell it's a I think the procedural vote as an important point to make I used to work in the U.S Senate a long time ago and culture is a vote that says we can debate and go to a vote and have and and uh actually talk about the vote itself so\nPeople who vote yes on on um ... I can say look I let the process play out I didn't vote to Stein me a final vote\nAnd so that's a pretty common thing now it's pretty unusual for somebody to flip\nIn between the cloture vote and a final confirmation vote now she does that\nThat'll be interesting and really the thing about his from college you couldn't scripted this I mean this kind of nominee with this sort of scandal in this kind of uproar with a female senator from a small divided kind of purplish really kind of read versus blue New England state I mean if you submitted this was a TV script\nA they tell you to rework it 'cause it's a little to\nPat [laughter] yeah Everytime I picture here I see Iraq on one side in a hard place on the editor right in her ... standing in between them\nWell a all morning a we have ah been listening to some of the testimony by members of the Senate I Want to play a clip from Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal who was speaking on the Senate for just a moment ago he's among the Democrats all the Democrats obviously voting are not actually we're waiting to hear from Joe Manchin as well but\nMost Democrats or will be voting no\nAnd a senator Blumenthal focused on the demeanor of judge Kavanaugh during that a difficulty hearing a week ago today where he came across as very sharp very angry very partisan so here's a little bit of what Richard Blumenthal said just a few moments ago\nBe denied is that\nPicture of Judge Hannah\nCommittee which indicated profound a lack of temperament and trustworthy\nTom Nichols um what's your view on this how badly did judge Kavanaugh undermined his credibility among a number of people would that performance a week\nAnd um I think it was disastrous and uh you know speaking personally I I'm a kind of moderate New England conservative of the old school when Kavanaugh was named first pipe popped up I said well\nThat's about what you'd expect I mean this could have been a ... a bushel Rubio point here Scott Walker appointee um to me that outburst in front of the Senate was disqualifying in and of itself it he he went down the rat hole of conspiracies he pointed at the Democrat in a way that even Clarence Thomas today on on our ...\nDidn't go part as he went angry but he didn't single out of the party I'm so that was the distinction\nHere not just that he was angry but that he was red hot part of ...\nBut he was part isn't that he was a I think doing damage to the institutions of government by going for these conspiracy theories and I think you know some of my former cameras on the writer saying well you can't disqualify the guy because he lost his temper over being smeared\nIn one hearing and my answer is this is why we have hearings it's not a longevity promotion\nIf hearings don't matter and how the nominee conducts him or herself in a hearing doesn't matter don't just do away with hearings and just promote people based on link up service we don't do it that way we have hearings for a reason and I think Kevin are completely flamed out in his ...\nWhat did you see last week to shutter without a performance by Kevin\nI appreciate what times that and I'll add to it because qualifying was actually the term that came up for me as well and I'll go back to my original point we're talking about him saying I better than anyone else I deserve to hold the role that one of only nine people on the planet we'll hope to be a two word of other people's needs\nAnd who's John I'm going to interrupt because our understanding as we are going to senator senator he was a ... hour man until this live

considerable of focus on the future of abortion rights based on the concern that judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn roe v way protecting biz raid is important to me\nTo my knowledge judge Kavanaugh is the first Supreme Court nominee to express the view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition\nBut rooted in article three of our constitution itself\nHe believes set precedent it's not just the judicial policy it's constitutionally dictated to pay attention and pay these two roles of precedent\nIn other words precedent isn't a goal or an aspiration it is a constitutional tenet that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary\nCircumstances and the judge further explain that precedent provide stability predictability reliance and fairness\nThere are of course rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court foot race leaving you overturn a precedent\nThe most famous example was when the Supreme Court in brown versus the board of education

justices who authors like Casey decision which reaffirmed row\nFurther more pro choice groups vigorously opposed each of these justices nomination incredibly\nThey even circulated by and with the

have been wrong\nThese same interest groups have speculated that judge Kavanaugh was selected to do the bidding up conservative idiot lives despite his record of judicial independence\nI asked the judge point blank whether he had made any ... Mad Men or pledges to anyone at the White House to the federalist society to any outside group\nOn how he would decide cases he unequivocal like assured me that he had not\nJudge Kavanaugh has

every year we ... less than two survivors in every day we must seek to stop the criminal behavior that has hurt so many\nWe all this to our cells our children and generations to come\nSee since the hearing I have listened to many survivors of sexual assault many were total strangers who told me their heart wrenching stories for the first time in their lives [noise]\nSome of our friends that I had known for decades you have with the exception of one woman who has confided to me years ago I had no idea that they had been the victim of sexual attack\nI Am grateful for their courage and their
