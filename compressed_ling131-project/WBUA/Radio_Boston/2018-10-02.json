backdrop to this protest is the appearance at Arizona Republican Senator Jeff flake who broke ranks with fellow Republican members of the Senate Judiciary committee on friday and called for an FBI investigation on cabin up\nBoston mayor Marty Walsh joined the protestors today\nShe never voted off events on the Senate this clearly a lot of betting on WB\nOur senior political reporter Anthony Brooks joined us from Boston city hall plaza now Anthony hello welcome back to the show\nHey good to be here to\nTell Jeff Flake Republican senator just spoke about an hour ago I'm told that this Forbes under thirty summit what did he say\nWell his main message was that he pushed for this extra FBI investigation because he'd been troubled for some time that they weren't getting the answers that they needed about allegations of sexual misconduct by I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nBack when he was in high school flake said he wants to make sure that the FBI investigations are just standard as he put it\nAnd he talked about his decision making at the end of that extraordinary hearing a last friday here's a bit here's a bit of what he's\nHad been trouble for a while but I I felt that we weren't doing due diligence with a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court\nIf there are questions that haven't been answered and the the FBI could have investigated I felt that it needed to know since the Judiciary Committee only have one person majority for Republicans eleven to him\nI'm On the eleventh Republican\nSo does he use that leverage to convince um some of his fellow Republicans and the White House and you have some Democrats going along with him that\nHe would advance I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination the full Senate if the FBI or took up this limited uh investigation which is doing now he was also asked if he found\nDr bloody for credible she's a professor who who brought the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh\nIf he found her credible then why uh advance her nomination to the floor and flake said basically that he also found a Kavanaugh's denials believable so that's why he wanted\nA ... the FBI to do more and he was also asked if he was uncomfortable with Kavanaugh's anger and his and his sense of partisanship\nAnd he said he was uncomfortable with that but he also said if I had been accused of something that I didn't do I'd be angry too so that was a what he said pretty much in summer\n\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker or their secret courts operating in Massachusetts the Boston Globe says there are in the form of closed door hearings before a single court official where thousands of criminal charges can and do disappear\nThe paper analyzed data from what are known as show cause hearings which are held before court clerk stand the paper says its analysis shows an arbitrary part of our state's criminal justice system\nGlobe spotlight reporter Nicole Duncan joins us to talk about this Nicole welcome to radio Boston Hi thanks for having me also on the line at Joe Simon's a criminal defense attorney and Boston Thanks for being here Joe\nHi thanks for having me during our conversation also we're going to hear from a member of the governor's council parents Kennedy and we'll talk with him as well but first call I Want to start with you why are you calling me secret court\nSo in Massachusetts and around the country generally criminal proceedings for adults are always public suffer in the minute a person is arranged arraigned on a charge in the courtroom you or I can go into that courtroom and we can look up the case\nBut in Massachusetts if your kids were crime and haven't been arrested you generally have a right to this hearing that data that's completely hidden from the public\nUm I Can't go into the hearing and it's a very different from every aspect of the open court that you know we see in court houses across the country but this on three arrest yeah Priya right in Korea rest sorry not pre arrest it's usually for people who haven't been arrested much pre arraignment\nOkay a silk so give us an example of of what you found here in terms of the criminal charges that are heard in these show cause hearings\nSuch a huge range I mean in general misdemeanors are the ones that are going to go to this but in our story we actually found that\nNo one out of twelve of them were felonies so there are some serious charges that were going into these uh to these hearings for example on the beginning of our story it's an average aggravated assault claim and into domestic violence\nCase there is a motor vehicle homicide case and so these are the kinds of cases I end up\nUm being within these closed hearings without any accountability so how would it be that\nThese cases when you're talking about charges like motor vehicle homicide\nThat there wouldn't have been an arraignment already that they already wouldn't have been slated to go through traditional court as opposed to his show cause hearing lick will who makes that determination that these cases might be fit to go to a show cause hearing as opposed to a traditional judge\nAnd so in some cases the police department might set it up for hearing instead on instead of going straight to arraignment because they find that the person isn't a flight risk or a danger to other people for example I'm so that it so they're saying oh there might be\nUm some questions about it so they might send it to these kind of hearings and in general if you are accused of a misdemeanor and you have and I'm been arrested\nYou know some people will know that you have a right to this hearing so a lot of defense attorneys um they might see that their client is going to go straight to arraignment that they can say oh hold on one second we're actually going to have to stop for hearing\nWell let's ask our our defense attorney who we have on the line Joe Simon's so does that typically happen if you see that you have a client in the system here do you try to divert a case to a clerk magistrate\nAbsolutely if it's a misdemeanor though was committed outside of the police officers presents then you have a right with some slight exceptions for example domestic violence crucial but uh you know sometimes that happens we're\nThe police making arrest even bring somebody to court and then you realize that the person who actually has a statutory right not to be arraigned for cork marriage streets hearing a lot of cases\nJudges agree to dismiss that some of them never come back some of them do come back and get screened out and then some of them come back and and the cork issues to complain\nAre problematic Joe\nI don't think so I think they serve a a good purpose so for one thing in Massachusetts [noise] anybody can go into a courthouse and do a clerk's office and apply for a criminal complaint against anybody else there's really no bar\nUm in almost no oversight to that except that they have these court registry hearings\nTo the court magistrates are of a function where they screen out cases that really have no business being in criminal court or many times there isn't probable cause the crime was committed and somebody simply seeking redress that you should be better served in civil court\nUm she comes to police despite doing their best efforts in responding to calls to make split second decisions and don't always have the ability to analyze whether in order to really\nShould be going to court whether there's enough probable cause\nBut I think ... and you know I think the article and and you know the coal certainly correct me if I'm wrong here but it brings up that there's an arbitrary system here what if you don't know about such a thing a show called hearing what if you were if you have not hired a private attorney who knows about such things and\nYou may not have the same opportunity to have your case heard by clerk magistrate and you are going to go before a traditional judge where they're likely will be something uh in public or at least or possibly a criminal record\nAnd that's very different from what happens in these hearings does this result in a different system for people depending on who's in the know or who can afford a lawyer to fight it\nUnfortunately yes those definitely true and I can't tell you how many people don't call me until after they've tried to go to the court's hearings by themselves\nPeople call me and say oh I've got the invitation to court I don't know if I Need to go or not I don't think a lot of people realize what they really are even people who were summonsed to go to these hearings because the the way some of them are awarded or well you can appear and if you want to have an attorney you can bring one\nUm [noise] I think people would be um should\nBe better advised of the the consequences\nAre the chances that they have [noise]\nYou know to protect the rights when you say invited to court I don't think anybody gets invited and willingly right to say that I've\nBeen invited to [laughter] conversation with the clerk at me off and then you see things on the record too I mean for them to their detriment everything's under oath so they might see something that can invert and we could be um you know deemed some sort of a mission or cause I can mission against their their life right\nBut but you're saying that these are on the record but Nicole what you found that there is no recording these proceedings or are they these are not public\nDefinitely not a requirement to be recorded um there within the guidelines of the district courts they say it's recommended that we call it a lot of courts and really it's kind of a toss up whether you get into a district court where it's actually recorded\nUm there certainly aren't public transcripts for anyone um I mean some people compared this to a grand jury proceedings but those are really different um\nThere are those are\nThose are with the jury the citizens who are making these decisions\nUm end their transcripts or some type or they're usually recorded those times um and so it's a really different case and I think you\nReally hit the nail on the head and you're saying that there were these big disparities I mean we were looking at places\nThat just had completely different standards of justice you know you go to a court like Chelsea and only Eighteen percent of those cases\nHave charges issue but then you go to stir and eighty percent of those charges will issue would would issue and when you look at racial disparities in some individual courts I mean you see some really troubling things we have a ... a statistic from Brookline courts\nSo about eighty percent of the white defendants who went to show cause hearing could leave without a charge but only forty five percent of minorities do\nAnd so you know I can see why people may say this this is a wave screening but without any kind of open hearing you know you don't have people who are able to study um why these disparities exists and how to change that\nWay but but is this a system though that as Joe says is a way to sort of weed out frivolous cases and perhaps improve the efficiency to a certain degree of the criminal justice system\nI think there'll there'll be people who argue about that I don't think that there's necessarily within our story we're saying this entire system should be abolished there is a really big difference between not having these hearings at all and having these hearings but having them open to that there can be people coming into these hearings to give some oversight I think\nA lot of people would agree that oversight is good for everyone defendants uh people that people who are involved in this even for you know the magistrates like we can see that\nUm and we can have records about things that might have gone wrong in this case is well let's\nBring in parents Kennedy who's a member of the governor's council and on this because the governor's council approved the appointment of of click magistrate so welcome to radio Boston is er Kennedy\nThank you Devon thank you for having me on\nWhat about him oh usually outside they have searching directors\nBefore him and he's the first guy to come outside of the company he joined the company in April as a member of the new board of directors they cut back for each team members to twelve\nAnd a ... and he's got a sterling career as a running them a model conglomerate very tightly focused company ... increased shareholder value many times over market value many times over\nBut you know he faces a huge task is an outside or jobs I spoke with Bill all that he's the managing director of the Martin dressed hundreds MIT entrepreneurship and he's a professor of practice at MIT Sloan school business\nHow do you keep about ...\nAnd ... which is for internal person it can be hard to put your homework but if you get an extra little person they can look at it differently and change it but they're not part of the DNA so it's really hard for them to keep it that people can get you don't have the people you're just not going to be able to get this thought\nYou know it's all about people as far as a lead is concerned in most people actually because they've got three hundred thousand employees scattered over a hundred and thirty countries around the globe this is a big shift to turn\n... so where does this mean for the company or would you say how how would you explain it\n[noise] well it means it's got to be a different company this was a company that invented the industrial age and now has to reinvent itself and cannot do that well you know you can't cut your winter success and it's just you can't be done\nI mean if they have a massive right I'm right down to announce today of twenty three billion dollars in its power unit\nIt's got a over thirty billion dollars in unfunded pension liabilities this is a company really at the edge so really struggling what'd you say\nYeah I mean it's worth a hundred billion dollars let's put that in perspective for a third of the world's energy is generated by\nA GED and forty percent of the world's energy software that you know managers that is ... is a big company but\nYou know its stock was removed from the down it was the dog and the down in the listed first time in a hundred and twenty five years\nSince ... remind us that in terms of this moved to Boston two years ago uh what did she get for the city and state and how about the promises to this area\nThe hundred and fifty bucks and promises a hundred and twenty five from the state saying one of the hundred and fifty bucks a hundred and fifty million did I say that's about to change [laughter] hundred and\nTwenty five million dollars or twenty five million dollars from the state you know tax incentives and all kinds of things and twenty five million from the contingent upon bringing jobs to city and eight hundred jobs they promised by twenty twenty five\nI'm GE he promised a chicken fifty million dollars to local institutions it's been making payments and it's been funding a lot of different things organizations health care and into schools in Boston [noise] um but it's a\nIt's a new corporate headquarters oh good question well so that was on hold they they decided they would never be able to ... to buildings are warehouses big doing that there was a building of the new kind of building toward a million dollars is on hold\nGoes to the twenty Twenty one I think it's going to be completed on WB our boss and other supporters

never been arrested for anything related to the Gardner heist\nBut he's also never escaped the suspicion of investigators who said that the men who robbed the museum had help from the inside that they knew their way around it and knew that the police weren't coming there implication is that al ... is the reason why\nThose investigators have never publicly named Abbott's as a suspect they won't even name him as one of the security guards on duty that night but Rick Abbott must be a suspect why else would he have to keep answering investigators' questions and testified before a grand jury\nWhat forget it didn't make a mistake when he let that feeds into the gardening museum what if buzzing them in was all part of a larger plan to ride that [noise]\nWhat if ... was the inside guy on the largest art heist in history [noise]\n\nWhenever something is stolen from a museum the most likely culprit is an employee according to data reviewed by the FBI about eighty percent of museum robberies are inside jobs so given that stat and the fact that this security guards opened the door and let the thieves walk right into the gardener\nIt makes sense that investigators would look hard at Rick abba our colleague from the Boston Globe's Steve Kirk ... has been looking hard at Abbott too\nHe's been reporting on the highest for more than Twenty years for the globe and he's written a book about

about\n[laughter] [noise]\nSo who was ... on march Eighteenth Nineteen Ninety\nYou had a long flowing ... you know didn't dress when it came to the museum and as a as a night watchman regard or to the night of the ... he was wearing short of tight red leotard ... in a in a cowboy hat\nAbbott's get up the night of the robbery does bear mention if only because Abbott himself knew how an security

B. R. dot org thanks a lot\n\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker with deep divisions over the sexual assault allegations against the dream Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh we spent some time today talking about how young people are processing this controversy and this cultural moment\nA Quinnipiac University poll released yesterday said forty eight percent of American voters most believe Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford forty one percent most believe Brett Kavanaugh and today President Trump said this\nIs very scary time for young men in America would you be you'll see absolve you may not be guilty or how does this\nI'm Talking with them about sexual assault and consent\nJoining us in Studio is mega rebel she's founder and director of partners in sex education an organization that delivers comprehensive sex education to schools across Massachusetts Hi thanks for coming in hello thanks so much riding and listeners we want to hear from you have you talked with your children about these hearings\nAnd what do you tell them what do you tell teenagers about the Brett Kavanaugh\nHearings and the Senate Judiciary committee hearings and they're related controversy that's been going on since the hearing the end it looked as education around sex and consent looked like in your school\nYou can call us at eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk you can also send us a tweet at radio lost him so Meg or what have you been hearing a from educators and young people amid all of this debate about the Capitol hearing\nSo our organization partners in sex education has always taught about consensus I that's an integral part of teaching about healthy relationships and communication and sort of getting the basis of how young people should learn to\nRelate to each other and certainly a consent questions have been coming up in classes um our educators are not trying to get into political um debate for the students but I have been hearing I'm even as recently as today\nFrom an educator that ah that they were talking about it um and a lot of the conversation tend to be polarized by gender which is unfortunate because I feel like we should be getting the same message ...\nSo give me an example of of what was happening in terms of their polarization\nAnd well I just that I think that young men are\nAre not are not always understanding I think the young men are often told and for instance by the president and I quote their tolls and they're the ones that are somehow victimized by us\nAnd I think even polarized along gender lines as a mistake I think that we all need to think about how to do better in terms of how to communicate and how to respect other people's person HUD and how to\nUm respect that I have have sexual morality in carrying relationship and not just make it down to the the letter of the law in terms of consent\nSo is there something specific that you say is there sort of a general rule of thumb that you tell young people about about understanding what consent looks like\nWell that that's a great question because the way young people often want to approach it is like I said off into the letter of the law and so there are things about the law that they need to know they need to know that the legal age of consent amassed she's sixteen\nThey need to know that if somebody is under the influence of drugs or alcohol they cannot legally consent um and so these are you know and there's many other aspects of these are important\nBut I think that ah when you're talking about sometimes you're just talking about just what is criminally prosecute rubble and what is not and that should not be the standard that we hold and that should not be what we're teaching we should be teaching people how to be\nRespectful and so consent education needs to be broader than that and it needs to be not just about sex consent education is about everything and it can be taught from a very\nVery young age ... and how how do you do that at a young age\nA for instance um when anyone we we talk about this with in elementary schools all the time in terms of somebody's physical space and somebody's boundary isn't just somebody else want 'em to be touched or not is that okay keeping your hands to yourself\nI'm ... whether ah children are um you know allowed to say yes and now to the things that happened to them and I think ... at a very very young age and should happen in the home\nRight so a a child says no to to to being tackled and what do we do often adults because it's fun to make children laugh will continue to tickle a child or what have we taught them about their capacity to say no to that which happens to their bodies\nAnd so I think that if we respect that no\nAnd then we're teaching them that if that they're now will be respected and we're teaching them from the youngest age that they can also have that same kind of respect for other people now\nWhen I talk a little bit of out of the women as well as we mentioned boys a little bit but ah and and just in case somebody hasn't heard uh some of the testimony we're in a place of of the uh emotional a piece of what Christine Blasey Ford said last week during the Senate Judiciary committee here that are that\nI Believe he was going to rape me I Try to yell for help when I did read put his hand over may know stopped me from yelling [noise]\nThis is terrified me the most and it's had a lasting impact on my life it was hard for me to freeze and I thought that was accidentally going to kill me [laughter]\nSo ah the mega rebel and Lynn that type of testimony has is Calif\nHow should parents and teachers deal with that\n[noise] wow yeah that that is really emotional and [noise]\nI think that the problem there at first I Want to say that the problem there in that situation is not as as we often assume a miscommunication misunderstanding about whether or not she gave consent clearly\nShe did not right that is a basic um a ignoring of her person HUD\nAnd ... and her that was you know to make a point to other men\nWas a man I'm\nKind of showing off in a way for I'm not from Atlanta that that is a whole different situation but those are also [noise] the kinds of things that with a a social emotional learning curriculum\nThat we can the traffic on the classrooms so what should um [noise] what should parents tell their young people I guess I'm telling ya livid and tell young women um and\nI guess the idea that you should be respected that you have a right to say say yes or no with what happens to your body and that I feel like if young women believe that they should be respected than they should be heard\nThan they would be more able to uh communicate but also more able to report when something goes wrong because there are actually very very low numbers of of young women and young men\nBecause let's not forget the young men are also assaulted at a really um\nUnfortunately high rate so they'd be left young women and young men who feel that it is their fault and who feel that they will not be believed and unfortunately these messages that are happening on the national stage are reinforcing the idea that it is their fault and that they should not be believed and we need to fight very hard to prevent\nThat let's let's take some callers now James is calling from Manchester by the sea James you're on the air\nHi how're you doing okay how are you I'm not an ... I Know that you know I Believe\nThat everybody should be heard that there was an allegation you'd have to do that to the root causes them to use my son's high school in high school girls make them up to start talking to him as ... interested in him and his car shock wave of you to draw them nervous about\nWhat they might say if the advances or encourage those that were ...
