Democrats in particular entering twenty twenty\nOr have a decision to make as to how they're going to run their campaigns and whether they're going to do this preparatory work of cultivating major donors on running a campaign that is\nDependent on early supplemented significantly by a superPAC or whether they're going to turn their backs on that I think that will go a lot further towards determining whether\nThe you know how significant the role of big money in our politics is as opposed to\nAny legal changes or any changes like that which could eventually be er which could eventually result from the proposition that you guys are not talking about a Massachusetts\nPretend this is James ... against a step back and get some context on just on the headlines here but the narrative arc let's start with you for just just to get people to get their head around were at in this moment let's start with Nineteen Seventy one the federal election campaign act which of course was leader updated after Watergate in Nineteen Seventy four\nWhere weeds in where did we go with McCain fined gold in where we now\nIs that uh the the ... federal election campaign act a was a reaction to a lot a lot of these changes by the way our reactions to scandals or a campaign financing scandals or a political corruption scandal\nAnd so Watergate are spurred a lot of the amendments to seek a and some of the the sort of um uh most significant ones were\nLimiting the types of money that are putting limits on how much individuals parties and political committees could give to campaigns and also creating this public financing system that campaigns up until President Bush\nUsed to sort of supplement their fundraising\nEnemy to interrupt you but you don't win over over ... the importance of ... maybe you can talk about briefly what that meant in terms of the context of the conversation today\n... a Supreme Court decision that basically ruled that money is speech and political spending is speech and so\nThat has been the framework under which all these attempts at reform have had to sort of a a huge themselves too and not and avoid overstepping so\nYou know what what uh the Watergate era forms did was limit a lot of the types of money that could be raised but they importantly left this what is known as soft money avenue in place and not allow political parties to accept unlimited funds from corporations individuals\nEven a labor unions for what was what was sort of euphemistic Lee dean party building activities but will we saw was\nParties increasingly relying on that to do all manner of things sort of in the same\nThat super PACs are sort of expanded beyond what they were originally envision this soft money became a critical part\nOf a political fundraising to the point where and accounted for five point two billion dollars worth of the money raised by a political parties between that Watergate between the guy and a two thousand two when we saw on McCain Feingold\nA the a bipartisan campaign reform act passed in two thousand two as a reaction to again scandals Clinton fundraising scandals where he was\nA um accused of sort of renting out the Lincoln Bedroom to major donors in exchange for soft money contributions to the Democratic National Committee and even to an extent the ah the corporate accounts\nUh and and uh WorldCom which uh had a political fundraising component to them as well so what McCain Feingold tried to do was cut off\nThat soft money a flow and ... as ... as a sort of a reaction to it we saw some of the big money going instead of going to the party's\nGoing to these outside groups in a way that really weaken the parties and so with Citizens United that was sort of further that by allowing the the big money that was going to these outside groups to be used in even more ways\nAnd really diminishing the power of parties further\nMore recently and twenty fourteen there was another Supreme Court decision in a case called McCutcheon versus federal election commission that allowed a more giving to some of the hard money\nGroups including the parties and campaign in a way that many people reject it would be used as sort of re empower the parties we've seen a little bit of that but certainly big money flowing to these outside groups is still a major factor in our campaign\nSo Kenneth uh in fact I mean to return to Citizens United you mentioned McCain Feingold of course citizen United targeted a ... particular provision McCain Feingold right\nYeah that's right I mean it was it was a you know the the uh what what the restriction on how these outside groups could spend their money and run by doing away with that it really allowed for these outside groups to become much more powerful and much more useful to political operatives\nKenneth our time is winding down literally and sort of ten seconds we have left the ultimate goal just ballot question as a constitutional amendment do you think there's appetite out there across the country for a serious campaign finance campaign finance or for\nYou know it's always one of those issues that voters will tell pollsters that they care about and sometimes they will even become a major issue in a campaign but I think ultimately when voters go to the ballot box\nIt falls somewhere far below the issues that of a you know the economy and their own pocket book and healthcare and even questions of war and peace\nAnd so it's hard to pass something like that\nIt's particularly I think it is easier to do it through the ballot box because you are not facing this impediment that uh the the turtle of trying to get members of Congress to change the system\nAre elected officials at any level to change the system that is clearly worked for them because they're in office having navigated that system so that real fundamental impediment the ballot box or a route is is you know in many ways or it could tap into public sentiment but obviously very high hurdle to pass a constitutional amendment\nWell Ken is for the New York times reporter and author of the book big money thanks so much for joining us which is really interesting and important background we're very grateful\nThat pleasure listening or stay with us after a short break coming up we're going to hear from both sides of question too in a special live debate and you can join the conversation as

live debate about ballot question to today's debate is ... by WB you are the Boston Globe and the UMass Boston McCormack graduate school policy and global studies were also airing on New England public radio I'm WBRC Anthony Brooks\nAnd I'm the gyms to know from the Boston Globe and uh we're we're talking about ballot question to which asks\nCreate a citizens commission that would research and recommend a constitutional amendment\nDealing with campaign finance reform of before we jump in here the ground rules I guess we'll have one minute to respond to that question followed by one minute ... bottom we the moderators that's James and maybe we'll be able to follow up questions to both candidates and our discretion we have a light here in Studio ... uh to keep time Greene means you're on\nIt wrong for forty years they have gone all over the place a series of five to four decisions you're going back to Buckley but remember Buckley came after two hundred years of American history Massachusetts first limited campaign contributions in Nineteen oh seven the Tillman act prohibited corporations from spending money\nIn federal elections in Nineteen oh seven unions were not allowed to spend money on elections in Nineteen forty eight only in Nineteen Seventy six\nDid the idea that money is the same as free speech get created and we've had an activist court\nFabricate rights for corporations and money at the expense of the people in our democracy so this amendment actually does the court a favor they've gone back and forth and these five four decisions\nFirst saying one thing they say and another and then Citizens United just knocking bulldozing the laws that protect democracy down so the amendment will actually clear up things\n... your response I I appreciate that Jeff can recognize that he thinks certain people in power at the Supreme Court may have constant decisions wrong\nBut if you were to sit here and actually think comparing a bunch of state lawmakers who have a history of restricting speech for opposing views and opposition will not be much worse than a I have something to share with you that's not the way campaigns are runs in the state very often there's a lot of people that have good intentions but they use it as a weapon to sound speech\nAnd unfortunately what we're trying to do is if you vote yes on question to you or empowering people whose only job is self preservation and no offense but they're only job is to win elections\nTo craft your speech as the public into restricted in a time after time they've actually failed at that I'm pretty badly\nPull over to follow up quickly and we're running it all out of time on this particular segment I Want to and when they get ... a follow up question on\nWell you mentioned about winning the lottery and spending that money however you want to spend it on a on a political ... isn't there something different and I think that's what a lot of people are seeing right now is there something different to wean you as an individual spending that money\nAnd then a made up corporation for the purposes of a an election spending that money with it donors we just don't even know who's involved there isn't there a difference there that your name you win the lottery you're going to put your pet issue up their versus a nameless cooperation with nameless donors\nWell that was kind of a joke that was you know obviously I don't want is a very important distinction I Know but James I mean okay so you're you're trying to make that distinction of you know big corporations\nWho are not individual and invented one for the purpose of an election okay well that's that's very few and far between I think that's kind of highly regulated at this point but for the most part let's just use the example of a corporation WPRI any other corporate America promised the group that Jeff works for which is a nonprofit corporation\nOr it's made up of individuals' like W ... give to WB are ah there's other for profit corporations the corporation is a pretty broad term so it's very important to know the difference you know ingest case his corporations and nonprofit made up of individuals and corporations who donate to his group in in this case he's uses nonprofit defined as about question\nUm there's nothing wrong with that that's his freedom to use his nonprofit corporation to fund about question and that's one of the beauties of citizen is that they're able to give more freedom to at that he's like that but\nTo your point of other corporations like Exxon or whatever you want to name um they actually do have some rights I'm you know I Can't as an individual go up to Exxon or any big port corporation and say hey you know what I Want to list of all your customers on what your financial they have rights just like the government\nCan't look and you got your time or we have to ... we have like let us in the middle of doing it I Would like to respond to hang out\nIn the first of all and American promise we have thousands of donors average donation about thirty six box or those are people you can go to the website look up um how's American promise funded see who those donors are we believe in disclosure ah people governed out money the ballot committee all the all the ... contributions are disclosed\nNow let's talk about politicians or if you want to empower people not politicians vote yes on to the incumbency a power to raise money since Citizens United is so high forty percent of state legislative districts in this country are uncontested now since twenty ten in Citizens United\nPoliticians who are elected have massive advantage to raise money from big interest to them they will regulate they get it from unions I get it from big corporations\nAnd they get it by the boat load and so we've got competitive districts no longer competitive we've got incumbents who can't be challenged because it takes too much money and you don't have the power to leverage your lawn making to get big contributions so\nYou want to have more competitive elections challenge incumbents empower the people's vote yes\nAll right we've got to jump in there Jeff Clements president of American prophecies are supports yes on ballot initiative to we're also talking Paul trainee spokesperson for the mass of fiscal alliance he proposes voting no on ballot initiative initiative to stay with us as we continue a special WVU our radio Boston broadcast on question to\nWhat do you think about the role of money in our electoral process give us a

Americans know we'd have to do this or lose our democracy I think um people are feeling shut out of the political system there either turning away or they're turning into anger and I think what we can do with this amendment is bring Americans together\nBecause eighty percent support it we've seen Nineteen states now have passed initiatives and resolutions supporting this amendment is Ken\nHarris James mentioned for those states where by ballot initiative\nEight hundred cities and towns around the country\nAre doing this and you know a Brad Smith said on your show the other day that there's ... and from his perspective a concern that this will have a ripple effect if we vote yes on to\nAnd have the citizen commission we need that ripple effect that's exactly the intent and um so we hope this ripple effect will get a people moving in other states to do a similar citizen commission and get together as citizens to make sure we can have a ... a political system that works for everybody\nSo Paul ... your response to the Nineteen states eight hundred cities and towns does that suggest to you that there's a sort of critical a massive concern across this country about this issue\nOr I Would actually argue the opposite after ... United actually what happened was Republicans Democrats independents conservatives liberals and everything between have been exercising their free speech because us citizens that it's it's funny you you have me here of course I work for I work with masters classic conservative organization based in Boston\nOr in um defending Citizens United in Massachusetts the biggest benefactor said it's you know there are the unions Nanette tends to facts in Massachusetts or union superPACs\nAnd that's the case across the country is that you know this issue has empowered more people have a speech and as a result both political parties benefit and every you know every part of the of the spectrum liberals and conservatives they also benefits\nW.

take the bait\nWell she has no choice because Trump's been putting it out there in in in the Trump era distraction is the rule the game [noise]\nYou know that mean the reality is that we all have family lore about who we are and where we came from and we were all raised with stories and that may or may not be true\nAnd if you ever saw that television commercials for ancestry dot com or a guy stands there and lead a hose and it says I was raised to think we were German and now I found out were Scottish and the changes were killed [laughter] you know you can't be blamed for what your family told you I mean you have every reason and write to respect it and believe it\nI don't have totally should be a what do you think of this you think that uh that she did this because she had to this deal with the president was saying\nUm and he needs to focus on the middle [noise] independence and uh the moderates and that's what he's done\nI think that's generally true but I Do think that um he is concerned whether he needs to be or not we'll see but I think he is concerned that a lot of those folks won't show up I I think\nYeah well they have a reason to an so that gives them a reason that okay well what might make people show up at the polls in these ballot questions right I mean we certainly got some some are\nVery interesting controversial ballot questions here on radio Boston we hosted two debates on the questions this week the first ones on\nQuestion three which asks whether voters approve of the state law that bans discrimination based on gender identity in public a combination now yes vote\nWould keep the current law a no vote repeal that and on the show we add Casey staffer Deanie who's with freedom for Massachusetts and he said a yes vote protects people's rights\nYou know we're all human beings we're all neighbors were family members or friends or co workers and at the end of the day we don't have to understand everything about each other to be able to treat each other decency and with dignity and respect\nAnd then we also spoke with Andrew back with President of the Massachusetts family Institute urging a no vote he said this has nothing to do with the chance\nOr concerns really have nothing to do with individuals or done a far as transgender it's the abuse of potential abuse of this law by people who are predators\nNow the campaign uh for question three has has values and very um [noise] a very controversial ads ah regarding this question and I'm On a play part of a digital video ad that's urging a no vote on question three in in this add a man enters a woman's locker room and hides when a woman comes then\nAs the woman starts to get undressed uh she realizes the man is in there ah let's listen to part of the ad\nIs Massachusetts question three media\nWho says he is a woman can enter a woman's locker room\nEven convicted sex offenders\nAnd if you see something suspicious and say something to authorities you didn't want to\nYikes so Arlene just wondering what do you think of the the the ad and and the debate on this question which I think is public safety and human rights well\nI I have a a arguably unique perspective on this I've been working on this issue for ten twelve years so I feel very passionately about voting yes to 'em and I think was fair amount of people will vote yes to protect trans folks\nUp with the premise is simple that the trans neighbors should be treated equally under the law the same respect and dignity that anyone else documentary would deserve and walk [noise]\nYou know but it parallels what happened with the gay and lesbian community in Nineteen eighty nine we passed the exact same bill that you can't discriminate and I'm based on sexual orientation employment housing credit public accommodations [noise] Twenty years now our opponents use the bathroom argument against us back then\nTwenty years later the trends equal protection bill passes and the exact same argument comes up except this time it's about\nYou can't discriminate based on gender identity in employment housing credit public accommodations one of the legislature do they bifurcated the bill they pass just the employment peace in the education piece in the housing ... and they said well wait on public accommodations and a few years later a year or so ago they pass the bill saying you can't discriminate and two years ago was twenty seven sixteen\nThat you can't discriminate against trans people based on gender identity and public accommodations which means hospitals and grocery stores or non public buses and in a theater\nSo the argument about safety is bogus because the people who were screaming about safety now they actually opposed it poses protections when it had to do with employment denying people jobs and they use the same argument against us the gay and lesbian community so\nWhy not go after the safety argument that instead of just focusing on the human rights argument would that be a better way to do is we'll\nWe actually did and they and the campaign is doing that still we made a point when lobbying the bill to show that the police supported the legislation that women's groups supported delicious legislation and\nThat uh entities like Jane Doe that dedicate themselves to protecting women also supported the bill and now they support us they want to vote yes on question three as well so we have the facts but our opponents are using fear mongering\n... tells you have your your thoughts on on this campaign in particular\nI mean I think the other side obviously on this you know it's their right to bring it to the ballot and and and go through this but [noise]\nYou know in a perfect world just has no place on the ballot you know this has been debated through thoroughly and it has a ... you know in in the legislature has acted on it bill was signed into law a you know since that happened I haven't seen any sort of horrible things that have happened and I I guess to bring it to a very personal level\nI spend a lotta time worrying about my Fifteen year old daughter but this does not make me word [laughter] you know I I just I\nI I just don't really see an issue here huh\n[noise] ah okay well I now have to end with our hubs here and they said the brief stories are events that have caught our attention this week uh that's all we have time for unfortunately so let's do these above I'm Arlene your how 'bout\nOh well my hubbub is about Halloween that it's just it's not just for kids anymore\nThe beacon ... times recently lifted I'm reminded people of the street closures that'll take place on Halloween so that trick or treaters can walk in the street without cars and traffic\nAnd in fact many neighborhoods are now finding that the adults are getting into Halloween whether they have kids or not\nWhether they they just hang out on their porches and their decks and their city stoop says they give out handy and dress in costumes and Halloween has become a great opportunity to get to meet and to know your neighbors you know sometimes people know each other because they share kids in common or they know each other because they ... they all have dogs and the dog park together [noise]\nUm but even with the people that you may disagree with politically you can enjoy and appreciate each other as neighbors at least for a few hours I'm On Halloween we can all benefited or\nWearing a mask [laughter]\nBecause you're living in a nice to everyone will join each other and joining a holiday it's it it you know\nA common ground with neighbors and so I actually believe Halloween can help make the world a better place even if it's just for one day a year\nI write I'm a very nice to have a family with two of them are you going to just rather not think about how they said my parents to get together somehow avoid if that happens [laughter] well\nFor those of you who've been wondering what goes on at US embassies around the world um here's a report from our embassy in Australia there an unknown number of people mistakenly received an email invite to a cat pajama party last week\nThe imitation featured a cat lying back on a couch in an electric blue cookie monster causing with a plate of cookies on its ... Waze belly\nTurns out it was a training air made by a new staff member testing out the embassies email newsletter platform and the embassy will be introducing quote strong new management control to ensure that there is no repeat of this high high level diplomatic gaff\nBut it appears that party has taken on a life of its own a New Zealand embassies among though not around we should no no no but I think it's actually the New Zealand or a embassy to Australia and\nI had not out on a ... there was a good idea ... how does he owns embassy\nIs among those who will attend to virtual online celebration of pajama a cat a party\nA [laughter] All right very nice well for my ... I'm going to start with a question to both of you did you buy a mega millions ticket one billion dollar jackpot and I just wanted to point out and\nI'm told that tickets today are selling at a rate of three thousand dollars a minute or so in Monterey\nSo you guys did you miss this decision making millions ticket I keep losing would lottery tickets but the biggest problem is that I forget to buy them definitely lose that way\nI have a strange perspective on this I Want like a two million dollar lottery when so that I'm sort of below the radar I don't have all these hassles that come along with the world going after and try to scan your eye sailing at all or is kind of scares me\nA ... yeah ... like the New Hampshire later ... first and I asked for anonymity for uh she would accept the jackpot well\nFor this I I actually the gas from my job and I'm allowed to do this right so I have at your job math ... rights to help us understand the odds here because we're talking about three thousand tickets a minute being filled which we we found incredible so we asked George ... the director of the math resource center at ... and\nTo come on the show and just to just about a minute or so\nHello professor welcome to radio Boston\nI thank you very much so these mega millions a odds here are one in three hundred million or so that doesn't sound very good just briefly tell us what is the math behind those numbers suggest\nWell it basically the math is a series of all the different combinations of the way you could draw the numbers and so you know there are probably send their kids out there trying to put together groups and groups of people to try and capture every number on the hope of winning\n... think about how long it'll take to do the re right\nSounds like an awful awful lot of work in a lot of money and they also actually changed the odds\nNot that long ago to make it even harder for you for people to win a so the jackpot would get bigger so from a math perspective I'm Wondering when with those kinds of odds what's your advice here\nWell the lights as simple you're not likely to win\nUm and I should note that right now the military's a space operations currently fall under the air force but of course this idea of a space for us would bring that entirely into its own separate branch and so is this something that might really happen\nWell it's real and it's really happening at at least in some ways the Trump Administration is is taking steps as I mentioned to get space force going\nI'm of course it's up to Congress to approve a new branch of military diminished rations hoping that happens by twenty twenty but really it it could take much longer for an official military branch called space forced to be created\nRight WB were busing supporters and

get a spot\nUnfortunately you know we do have to turn people away but it's it's so popular\nRace officials estimate about forty percent of all applicants are turned away\nStomach crunches due to a need for specialized skills there are restrictions about who is eligible to run the starting line and volunteer umpires have to know the race rules but some of the demand is because of repeat

they do get Brooks brother's race jackets for caring lie he's been volunteering for ten years despite only wrong for one coming back to the point of pride\nIt's hard to put it into words but it's just
