that we are a public institution that exists to serve the citizens and the public good\nAnd to shine a light on public issues and choices I Want\nTo thank dean David cash in the form of graduate

minute ... we the moderators James and now I Will be able to ask follow up questions other candidates at our discussion\nAnd listeners are several ways you can follow along to the aside from listening on WB you are Ross or broadcasting a Facebook Live feed of today's event you can see that you can see that at Boston Globe dot com radio Boston dot org or W or you wouldn't be dot edu as well as on Facebook to review our to watch\nIt can also follow us on Twitter and hashtags are using today is math a gene\nSo let's begin with opening statement from the candidates or we will hear first from or healing she served as Massachusetts attorney general sense twenty fifty before she lives elected she worked in the ages office in separate positions and as the chief of the civil rights division\nThrough general view is that the only way or do you what he said response\nNo I think absolutely not looking as somebody who spent a lot of time on this issue over the last five years certainly we need to do all we can to get after the drug cartels and those who are pumping poisons to our communities and our neighborhoods but we're not going to get there by that work alone\nMy focus has also been on treatment that's what I hear from families they need more access to a behavioral health services I have made that a priority will continue to make that a priority I also think we need to stop addiction before it starts\nThat's why I took the initiative\nAnd recognizes substance use prevention education was frankly and I met need in our state and it's why we worked together with Chris herring and others to launch project here to make it available in every public middle school in the state where we can talk to young people about substance use disorder and about making healthy decisions\nI have also been proud to lead as your state attorney general working with other state agencies\nIn multi state investigation into all of the opioid manufacturers and distributors who need to be held accountable for the crisis that they created that his work that is important and that is work that I Will also continue\nMr McMahon geology treatment on ask you you've talked about the new ... the idea that we should look into pay for private addiction treatment what does that even mean\nAnd who would pay okay here's here's the problem right now the current government sponsored programs having Ninety nine percent failure rate\nWe have people who are going through their like revolving doors there are people now opiate addicts have gone through dozens of times to government sponsored programs\nPrivate pay programs one type through eighty seven percent successful for opiate addicts in other words start to finish with the program five years out no relapse\nIn other words we can give opiate addicts their life back what what has to be a comprehensive program now everybody says well we can't afford that kind of a program where already paying some in some cases up to thirty times but people going through the government programs\nSo I Am saying let's do it right let's do it once\nLet's give the opiate addicts their life back and make them productive citizens and taxpayers in the commonwealth of Massachusetts\nAttorney general Halley which lectures about well I you know I I\nAgree with the J that we need to be doing I think this is your position you'd agree we need to be doing all we can to make access to treatment longer treatment more sustained treatment available for all who are afflicted with disease and substance use disorder\nSo it's a reason I sued frankly the Trump Administration when they threatened to cut off Medicaid funding to our state 'cause that undercuts our ability to get people access to the care\nAnd treatment that they need so I've long been an advocate for treatment and I think truly we need to do a better job\nOr not just as a state but as a country dealing with real issues of substance use disorder of addiction and behavioral house it frankly I think are present in all of our families and and that's where I come from on this\nUh education treatment support well certainly doing all we can to get after those who are pumping poison into our communities\nI Want to talk a little bit about the criminal justice reform and as it relates to this particular topic when a component of the criminal justice reform bill as you may know August McMahon was a limited mandatory minimum sentences for low level drug instances where you stand on than a mentor even them\nOkay on mandatory sentences um there is um I Do draw the line with just people who are just opiate addicts themselves I Would prefer to put them in some kind of a treatment facility and give them rehabilitation to give them a life back\nIf we give them to their lives back they will not go back to opiates and we deprive the drug traffickers of another customer has to be done one by one however\nI Am not in favor of giving drug traffickers are drug distributors\nA pass on their crimes you got to do it on a two prong approach you've got to eliminate the customers and then you've got to eliminate the perpetrators of this poison it by being tough on them will drive him out of state or put them in jail either way we eliminate the problem\nTo regional he would just do law does include mandatory sentence for federal do you consider the exemption\nWas passed to be important legislation and you know one of the things I recognize as attorney general when I started is that we didn't actually have a lot on the books that made the trafficking of federal crime as federal is really what is poisoning killing so many people right now in our state I Am proud\nAnd it was my office that proposed that law and the first place and we have been out there enforcing it as I said earlier my office alone has prosecuted hundreds of individuals for drug trafficking crimes in addition we have taken millions and millions of lethal doses of setting on heroin off of the streets\nI think I've been aggressive um and I will continue to be very aggressive working with local state and federal law enforcement on this issue\nAs for our sentencing guidelines I advocated that we eliminate mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders I agree that these individuals need more than anything care and support and there we used to do that now with in the criminal justice system as a result\nOf the criminal justice reform legislation that I help support\n'em and that's important work that that the attorney general's office needs to continue to do with\nDirect man you've said the attorney general's office needs to let those in law enforcement and know that they have the support of the attorney general what do you mean by that\nWell I tell you exactly what I mean ah ah my opponent just mentioned a few moments ago that she has a going out to hundreds of individuals' when it comes to drugs apparently not enough individuals because we've ... she has a sanctuary city policies\nOr she encourages cities to become sanctuary cities in other words she don't want to deal with the feds now we've got clear evidence of that and the just two weeks ago and and sanctuary city large which was an all federal job\nThey weren't dumped wearing a ... cent milk for Joe how from Massachusetts\nAnd they were all illegal aliens some of them members of MS Thirteen right here under our noses\nDealing in and distributing and trafficking in heroin and start no we just saw two days ago the same problem open mic thawing again you'll easily aliens showing this stuff they found Seventy pounds\nOn ... no ... that's the job you know the house from Massachusetts there's too much out there and she won't deal with the feds but I Will I Will\nHave all the time it's time for attorney general hilly can you respond to\nThe ... and it's it's totally inaccurate not only have my office prosecuted and investigating cases with\nFederal law enforcement here in Massachusetts we didn't work in those cases hard with our federal partners in New Hampshire as well because if you want to talk about\nThe Lawrence area for example you have to consider the pipeline that exists and the trafficking that his existing between our states between among the Maine New Hampshire\nAnd Massachusetts that's why my office set up a sentinel strike force at the outset with state local and federal agents FBI da both New Hampshire in Massachusetts says they said\nThree years ago out of the gate I was my office that security a million dollars from our federal government the U.S department of justice to pursue these cases that his work that we've continued and I will continue as attorney general\nYou know when I mention um the the prosecution's and the cases that we've had and we have had a number of cases and take downs um but I also come back to the need to recognize that\nAs aggressive as we are and will continue to be if we don't deal with the real issues of treatment and education and the state we're not going to get to where we need to be that continues to need to be a focus at the time\nI I just would like also would like to take a minute before we remind folks are about what they're listening to a exactly what you think of this idea about private treatment and success of treatment and the system that we have now attorney general ...\nWell you know I think that ah it's important that we make ... treatment available both public and private means right now I talked to a lot of people who call my office and my health care hotline who are desperately seeking access to treatment and care and coverage we need a system that works better for people\nLast week I was testifying before a health policy commission and some of the issues related to the cost of health care and the barriers that people confront and just trying to find access to healthcare it's something that is a priority for me as attorney general it will continue to be a priority and we need to continue to do all we can\nTo seek the support frankly at the federal government here so that we have we have access to the resources that we need to better take care of our people\nOf a I Want to remind listeners you're listening to a special edition of radio Boston live from the campus center at UMass Boston this debate is between the two candidates for Massachusetts attorney general the debate is sponsored by WB you are in our partners at UMass Boston for corporate graduate school of policy and global studies and\nDemocratic attorney general more healing and her Republican challenger Jane McManus has a trial attorney from Cape Cod we're broadcasting live on Ninety point nine WB you are also streaming live video\nOh not your ... your take on this uh ... what's your view of the red flag law which allows a family member to petition the court to temporarily ticket where someone's gun if they pose a threat to themselves for someone else\nYou would express it I think I Believe it or previous debate that people who are prone to violence for people with mental health issues should see gun ownership restrictions is this a reasonable gun on a restriction well\nFirst of all the right now under current law\nOr the chiefs of police ... the licensing authority generally the chiefs of police in any town or city or the police commissioner or the designation\nAlready have a right when it comes to suit ability um I don't actually agree with the suit ability the way it is written because it leaves the subject of standards as opposed to an\nObjective standards that every other statutes on the planet as but this was the subject is bad joke the police chief has some issue as to suit ability he can revoke someone's license to carry then they have to go to a hearing to get it back\nBut this law here that you mentioned goes way too far it allows an invasion of someone's house when since Seventeen Ninety the founding of the country almost we've had a right\nOf protection that government officials cannot invade your home or your private papers or anything that you have\nUnless they have probable cause if so if they have probable cause then they can get a warrant and do what they have to do but not just on a hunch that said okay\nAnd then just respond 'cause this is an important law that I think was past sixty two percent of gun deaths in this country are suicide to me any measure an effort that we can take due process provided to make sure it's somebody who is a danger to themselves\nDoesn't have access to a weapon that will kill them temporarily remove that weapon I think that's an obligation something that we go on to those individuals and certainly to their families and the\nAttorney general Haley or office a is investigating the state police amid a overtime and payroll scandals and some folks have been charged us some people have said that the\nHead of the state police to be fired and maybe the secretary of public safety should go because of this do you have confidence in the current leadership here in terms of what's going on with the state police and what what\nWhat else should be done I think that we have seen time and time again any problems with culture involving the operation of the state police however my office has been aggressive we were the first to investigate and announced an investigation into the ... the the pike scandal\nAlready we've returned indictments against three former lieutenant of the state police and that investigation is ongoing\nWe've also been involved in the investigation regarding allegations of a campaign of police reports with respect to the former crawl at the state police so my office has been very involved in these matters we will be aggressive we will continue to hold us accountable who needs to be held accountable\nI Do support though the reforms that have been undertaken by the current colonel and by the Baker administration were going to continue to work in partnership that is important that we have\nA state police department of the highest quality and one that the public believes in and has confidence in and I certainly want to do everything I can to support the hard working men and women within the state police who are out there every day on the front lines working hard to to protect our families and our communities\nMeasure respond best effort like I I have no confidence in a ... my opponent just said about what investigation she's going to take with the state police\nThere was a Supreme judicial court decisions that just came down two weeks ago talking about people in her office in the the the decision there when it came to another scandal that's already in the government and that is a scandal at the state we\nDrug lab it's about the attorney general's office they engage in agree just prosecutorial misconduct fraud upon the court lacked the moral compass\nTheir conduct was ... and magnified by the fact that it was not limited to an isolated incident but rather to a series of calculated miss representations the ramifications from their misconduct uh nothing short of the stomach\nThat means there's heavy corruption in the attorney general's office I don't trust them investigating corruption when they have it in their own office and the people who were responsible for doing that they weren't fired they were promoted that they can ...\nTo correct the record on that right if they do not work for your office these folks do you know these these folks worked under the prior administration I did not hire them I did not supervise them they did not when during my time\nSo I uh I have a safe in um our office I I you know I I think that's a very unfortunate recitation and I just wanted to clear their rent\nAgain by the way my office has worked from the beginning to make sure that steps were taken to address issues surrounding the wrongdoing and the misdeeds\nUs on your ... in the handling of evidence that the drug lab our office has been out there including in that very case um that was recently decided by the U.S Jaycee my office advocated for the dismissal of thousands of cases as a result of that misconduct at the lab\nBut they said let's just so folks know if they're listening to folks in the audience so they just know what were referencing here this was a Supreme judicial court ruling in the case of a drug lab scandal out ... the former chemist on your fair uh\nWas accused of using drugs samples that were being tested as evidence in criminal cases and thousands of cases where does this by the state's highest court just two weeks ago and in that ruling from the judge the judge did say that former assistant attorney general did engage in prosecutorial misconduct\nSo I Do think oh these two folks have gone on to other job not in your office should be AGP responsible for\nMaking sure that there are legal ramifications against these folks attorney general healing\nThere had been legal ramifications against the folks and currently the matter is under review by the board of bar overseers um but I really do take issue with the characterization about the integrity of the hard working men and women in the attorney general's office the attorneys the investigators the troopers\nYou know everybody on down the line you've got six hundred people working their tails off day in and day out on behalf of people across the state to make sure their rights are protected you know and I and I really\nResent the ... of their integrity I think that we're very lucky to have these men and women doing the work that they do mayors\nGoing [noise] [noise]\nWay the rituals that were responsible\nFor this they have gone on to bigger and better jobs I said six figure incomes one of them went on to be in it is and it is now a just a court magistrate with the uh Suffolk superior court the other one is a general counsel for the alcoholic beverage control commission\nAll with the endorsement of more he'll you know\nJust wrong to talk about that this is Jay Jay that are just you know what we can actually say\nPlease scandal ... Bora Huey investigating it are you kidding if it hadn't been for his ruling nothing would get done she usually Johnny come lately she's been getting around it and the press for doing nothing about the state police scandal we've known about it for over a year and just the other day she decided to do something about it\nYou drew leveling who is the U.S a journey if it weren't for him we would have nothing going on as far as the sentinel problem we have here because he's the one that's doing all the work and we have no one died as soon as they please unless she came out\nOn at times that's time attorney general Haley\nI I think I've been through this I'll let the record speak for itself we were the first to announce and investigate the state police we have been involved in any number of state police investigations and in terms of our drug prosecutions as they already set in my office has prosecuted\nAnd continues to prosecute and hold accountable drug cartels drug traffickers so that just inaccurate those characterizations 'em and all I can say is we're going to continue to do the work that we're here to do\nAnnouncing and doing something to different things [noise]\nStranger you sued over the president's travel ban and separating families the U.S border and as you know we now have a caravan of thousands of people from on doors heading to the U.S border which should or how should law enforcement response was driven and we're\nWell law enforcement ought to do its job they're processes in place to deal with folks as they arrive at the border but I think part of what this speaks to is the failure of the federal government to take action on immigration reform and what needs to happen and you alluded to the cases that we have brought against the Trump Administration\nYou know we sued as a state to protect the DACA program because these are kids who are serving in our military starting businesses paying taxes who all of a sudden we're going to have the rug ripped out from under them we sued and we do and we won we sued to protect a people when this Muslim ban came down\nYou know who I heard from sue over the weekend when that Muslim ban first came down our colleges and universities including the University of Massachusetts that literally had students and professors stuck overseas or teaching hospitals and research institutions and major employers and businesses in the state\nWho are adversely affected by that order on so many friends we have needed to stand strong as a state\nW.

days but I knew it was it was going to be a mother of so it's been just you know\nA slow motion rock\nCan you describe a your business ... coffee shop and how long you been in business\nYeah uh the family business\nUh Saddam thirty five years ago and I'm just so nice little breakfast lunch diner\nHow many people jammed play\nEighteen fulltime in part time\nHe'd been closed ever since September thirteenth yeah what about your employees wouldn't have been doing\nShirley you'd think they'd enjoy themselves they're they're they're just as dangerous as I Am they filed with Columbia gas to get paid through them Columbia gas made that offer about a week or two into it\nAnd but one of the problems with that is is Columbia gas then turned around to have head hunters call them to find them employment elsewhere\nYou mean I wouldn't have to pay them\nExactly so I don't know how many you know took up that offer a finding employment elsewhere I'll find out a couple of days when the foot down and have a meeting\nHave have you found claims of Columbia gas\nI have I open the claim up um they have for me I'm about ten grand to to help with some of the business bills and stuff\nSo so how much it costs you do you think\nI don't know I Know I have absolute zip in my home right now I have nothing I'm thirty grand in there but that's the normal operating budget\nWhat would you brought in and they said they think you might have lost\nProbably around eighty two hundred thousand dollars a lot of this fantasy money I only get to keep a fraction of that\nConfidence that it'll be a gas will be able to help you or or just confident in general I guess you'll be able to get things back to normal\nMy biggest fears as I Columbia gas is just they've gone through several companies trying to manage as the last company just came on a couple of days ago they went from\nReplacing all the restaurant equipment to know repairing restaurant equipment so I'm I'm Still waiting on to see exactly how they're going to handle my equipment here the next step is is\nIs to open up and get people coming back I I I'm In Lawrence I mean you know the great great old mill city\nBut as a depressed city I I ... eighty percent of my business in from Andover in North end over\nAnd they come in and you know they love the place and everything else but my fear is that moved on the move on to other places there happens to change and I'm just gonna of lost the business that build up for Twenty years\nJohn Farrington owner of ... coffee shop in Lawrence a best of luck to you and I hope that that I Hope that it can work out to you a work out for you at some point thinks or thanks for telling us about what's going on if you think you\nDo want to say we we did reach out to Columbia gas for respond to John Farrington validation that the company had head hunters contacting employees that we have not received a response from Columbia gas\nAnd there was some good news today for a mainstay in South Lawrence of St Patrick's Catholic Church how their Palo Brian tells us that gas service to the main church itself was fully restored just in the past twenty four hours nuts he says this is next as\nWe had both the gas restored a few days ago and then the work that needed to be done inside the church completed so quite amazingly on a pretty cold morning we actually how to shoot at church or great bussing\nMay they may still have some other big buildings that do not have yeah\nWe do we have a large meal senator from which we served two hundred and fifty thousand meals a year it still doesn't have got us but it was converted to propane by Columbia gas a few weeks ago so we've actually been able to thank God serve meal's\nBreakfast and dinner every day through the Koran and mail center [noise] excuse me we have a large the thirty plus room office and wrecked rebuilding that has no gas and we have a huge parachute or with\nThat because it's a big basketball court and other meeting spaces that also is without ... so and the immediate aftermath of the explosions we actually continue to serve meals with our guests are we put together\nBag meals for breakfast and dinner and were able to distribute them from the middle center we weren't able to host meals in the dining room about ten days after the explosions Columbia gas successfully converted the entire building to propane\nMhm and how many would just say that you've been serving since you were able to do it with propane\nIt's hundreds of people every breakfast and dinner I'm so we we have a lot of new faces people who presumably would not need our services if they did have service\nWell it's also interesting to see that there are plenty of regular guests who are not around because they either have gotten temporary housing without transportation or because they've just moved elsewhere for the duration until hopefully the the gas comes back\nNow you're in a neighborhood that we really hit by these\nWhich is the half of large that lost the\n... and said what the neighborhood looked like right now\nThe neighborhood looks a little bit like regular life but it really does look like a disaster area every single straight has been ripped up there are\nA excavators and scarves crews and papers around any corner at any given day at this point so it it really does look like\nA unique natural disaster and this was a real disaster took place but not so much the joke is that you\nNeed to get somewhere and you just point your car in that direction and one street after another after another is blocked off you have no idea how you'll get from here to there but you're just drive until you got there we have no idea when this is going to come back on your work were given ballparks\nBut it's very hard to to know\nWhat do you think of the state of November nineteenth at Columbia gas has said do you think that everybody\nIs hoping that that date will pan out I don't think anyone is expecting that it will and the news this week as but Columbia gas and other officials are suggesting this may not be as\nQuick as they hoped it would be and again it's it's understandable everyone knows that most of our buildings have structural issues and have code issue so we're not talking about Beverly Hills it's this is an old\nCity with old buildings and a lot of them are not in good condition it's certainly no one I I think is shaking their fists at reality and saying how can this be but it it's just very very difficult to try to be raising kids\nParticularly if you're a single mom to have no good idea when you're going to be able to\nHave hot water again have heat again\nSo even if you're listening to a temporary housing which something like seven thousand people have it's a it's an anxiety written on\nNot Apollo Brian pastor at St Patrick church in Lawrence thanks so much for joining us ... name of that is coming up we'll hear from those candidates running for ...

NPR News station [noise]\nAttuned to the Democratic candidates Rachel Rawlins Rachel welcomes radio Boston thank you so much for having me so we started by asking your opponent or what ... what did he think uh makes the two of you different since you both have progressive platforms what would you say [noise]\nUm well I Would say that I've actually prosecuted a case so uh this is a district attorney's office that um [noise]\nThat prosecute people quite frankly and so I think that in order to do the job you should have prosecuted a case you should've for presented a case to the grand jury which is the way that in Massachusetts um we bring cases in superior court\nAnd so I have actually done the job and then more importantly um the da dun try cases so this is an office of two hundred and Seventy five employees that operates within government\nWhich is different than the private sector twenty million dollar budget thirty four thousand cases a year you need to be a really good manager odd because Dan Conley in the sixteen years he served did not try case during one of those sixteen years he supervised in office\nI just want to say or your opponent brought up your experience in in the courtroom and ... and said uh that he thought that he had more experience as a criminal defense attorney because they hadn't been on that side of things and\nI actually have a so I'm you know I I Would love for you to ask me about my experience I've been a criminal defense attorney while I was at the end McCutcheon and did handle cases are on the criminal defense side I've been a prosecutor I've been a lawyer for Twenty one years\nAnd so I'm In addition I've done civil rights matters before and I've represented the police say very good relationships with the police I endorsed by\nA police patrol mentioned so see Asian and I have actually held the police accountable before and sue the police when they were engaged in um alleged discriminatory behavior so I have a very broad range of experiences over two decades of work as a lawyer in in Boston\nAnd so what is it about that experience and and just about ah you know your your background your ear temperament that you think makes you ready to take on this this large leadership position or twenty million dollars\nI support I've been the head lawyer for the MBTA and mass dot that's ten thousand employees that the MBTA mass died um Massport has Fifteen hundred employees that are employed by Massport over Eighteen thousand employees on our footprint\nHad lawyer for both of those all three of those organizations\nBeing a lawyer in government is very different than practicing on your own or owning a business you are um you must can you must operate within the confines of certain laws so for example public records requests private employers don't have to comply with those type of governance is that we have\nEthics requirements um we have um\nYou know any number of of of record retention laws that were you know if you've read articles about the state police for example um all of these things I was the head lawyer for in multiple different state agencies and authorities\nAnd then very candidly I have excellent relationships with the federal government because I've been an assistant United States attorney so many of these very large cases that the superior court is handling\nFor the da's office they're working with my former supervisors John weren't men Glenn McKinley I'm In the U.S attorney's office because their joint task forces that are looking at the type of cases that da's make decisions about\nLet's talk about the list of Fifteen which everyone has talked with you about I don't as as we we did address this uh with your photo like I'm Alone in this is a list of Fifteen crimes that are so called decline to prosecute list and of course that list\nIncludes things like shoplifting resisting arrest but the the most controversial seems to be possession with intent to distribute charges that you might decline to prosecute the Boston police patrol engineering and math retailers association or both of\nHave said that they're concerned about this proposal tell us why on\nSo what's wonderful is I'm I'm proposing something right I came forward with a possible solution to a problem that we have the criminal justice system does not work for too many people overwhelmingly it doesn't work for the poor\nOverwhelmingly it doesn't work for people of color it doesn't work for the mentally ill it doesn't work for people struggling with addiction and I'm and I'm proposing a solution and what I Will tell you is that as a former prosecutor myself the only person in this race that's ever prosecuted a case\nWe have one tool that we use in our tool boxes prosecutors\nJail the tool as incarceration I Want more tools I Want the tool of rehabilitation diversion civil infractions the tool of social workers to be used we have a sixty seven percent recidivism rate in Massachusetts so\nWhat what we're doing now trying to arrest our way to the solution of these petty quality of life crime it's not working it cost us fifty thousand dollars to how someone in the Suffolk County hopes of corrections what I'm proposing is pre arraignment when these individuals come in with one of these Fifteen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radio Boston", "city":
