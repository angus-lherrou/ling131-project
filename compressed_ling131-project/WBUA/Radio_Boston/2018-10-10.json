created a potentially dangerous situation will burn by allowing gas lines to over pressurized just like what happened before the gas explosions in ... valley last month so that was a different company Columbia gas\nUh fortunately there were no injuries or property damage this time but the state is not taking any chances deep you that's the department of public utilities told national grid to discontinue new gas installations\nExcept in emergency cases at least until there's a full review of the incident national grid held a news conference and we'll bring this afternoon WB are you are Bruce Kellerman was there and he joins me now Bruce good see if you too and\nSo it's been nearly twenty four hours since the gas was shut off and move on to tell me about what was said at today's event\nIt was a little unusual as these things goes first of all it was taking place in a parking lot and\nLocking lot classic parking lot meeting ... news conference or fruit and Ninety three national grid or had brought him two hundred a replacement workers to fix this problem they surrounded or semi surrounding area with huge trucks to block out union workers who is standing on the side they were afraid to intrude on his news conference\nThe president national grid of of Massachusetts was there and I I smoke was her name is Marcy reason and she said that national grid takes full responsibility\nYeah we made a mistake for a we had a technician working routine maintenance in one of our regulator station and say [noise]\nUm the good news is that we have governance structures control themselves in place in the event that some of those who say\nUh the hot you know she says that they're not very frequent in fact she couldn't remember when the last one was but national grid says it's going to reimburse every one of the company says it's going to be ... you know paying people what their expenses where they need to present receipts\nUm it's going to start ... reap pressure rising these types I guess are about three miles of them in this area it's going to bring them up to about two pounds per square inch slowly testing lines and then it's going to start turning on the gas for people beginning tomorrow and ending by Thursday\nSo this might not resonate if my she might not be you're talking about it except for what happened last month and our Mac valley where the pressure inside those Columbia gas pipes was twelve times higher than normal which caused explosions people's homes were destroyed people are displaced people are still displaced right in your in your high school student was killed so\nThis overt pressure is ... is it something that's happening more and more is this a fluke of events something to fear\nHave been privatized and then the privatization workforces have been cut 'em and there's also no shareholders and other investors who want to return on their investments and and so increasingly where it used to be that the state had more purview over what was going on\nIt's you know it's abstract and many more layers away from local control I mean years ago in fact some cities even on their water their water their gas in their electric there were municipal\nCompanies that done got sold off because\nI mean if the ... or ... you don't need it was a way to get revenue without having to raise taxes but what you're also daughters mortgaging in a way to control that you have over\n... you know these fundamental assets which are really monopoly is it's not as low somebody that's on the gas line can arbitrarily just find some other solution to their to their heat 'em into their electricity I said I mean you could put\nA solar panels and and things like that but it's not something you can do and the next twenty four forty eight hours\nRight that's what makes it such a such an interesting space but some regular perspective and labor relations that there's a private company but the operating in an open market and there are limits to what the state can do now\nIn the meantime though right deep you has stepped in to say is you put a moratorium on activities a national grid activities that means\nNew business hook like this isn't going to affect people in a in a very clear way right businesses are going to struggle to get gas hookups people who buy houses what may struggle to get gas hook up in the meantime I don't know how long it's gonna last um can it lasts for a while it is the only leverage in the state has over a private company I mean\nI mean the other lever that that that they had was regulating 'em up you know a price increase rate increase and saying to them you know no no rate increase so you could do that you could say rather you know you could say\nUh you could do something like that I mean what's fascinating is in in labor history if it was the other way around so there are numerous occasions and the and the labor history of the United states where workers will go out on strike and the company would go to the federal government and say\nYou know this is a threat to national security this is a threat to some aspect of our economy and the federal government would order the workers back to work using very obscure labor laws to say\nThis is a threat to public safety or so there was a big coal strike years ago it was something that everybody who's read eating purposes and the federal government or nothing about\nI'm going to workers who you know we're out on strike you exercising their legal right\nTo strike to say no you have to go back to work there have been a number of big steel strikes where the company will say no you have to go back to work in the order what's called and labor history a cooling off period you know cooler heads prevail figure this out you guys were watching\nSo maybe this is where we're headed on that side\nYeah maybe this is where we're headed if things continue to escalate a state interventions requiring workers to go back to work that's historian Robert foreign distinguished university professor at UMass Lowell thanks so much for joining us Robert thank you say was with us there's more ahead I never harlot this is radio

I\nThink there's value in having different background I don't think it's there's value added judging people based on skin color that's what for me comes out\nAnd you acknowledge though that the Supreme Court has said that that is a permissible a focus of college admissions or no\nIt it is it is as one factor among many and and all of that uh what's a kind of tricky with what the Supreme Court said and this is specifically a after the University of Michigan case as Fifteen Years ago it throughout this mechanical application of points up for re\nBut it allowed and encouraged this kind of holistic review which is what Harvard actually invented holistic review about a hundred\n... the number of Jewish in Michigan so history of sort of rhyming in a in a certain sense there but the problem with the Supreme Court set up\nIs that by allowing this holistic review or the process is a lot less transparent are and some allege including students for fair admissions that the racial preferences are even greater than we're Harvard to use that kind of mechanical points or or for the system or that the Supreme Court threw out\nAre you wearing one either for many lobstermen like holler life jackets getting away at their work never even considered that Peter Frederick then he's been fishing for over forty years\nBig bulky life jackets number one you can't work on them and number two is hot and on a daily today to have anything else besides shorts and tee shirts and your your rent is going to be miserable so now I have given us are\nThe most frequent cause of death and the lobster fishing community is falls overboard\nJulie ... is with the northeast Center for occupational health and safety sixteen your study from the Centers for Disease Control and and every fail fall the lobstermen was not wearing a life jacket but Sorenson acknowledges the barriers to eat in addition to the heat bulk in high cost they can run between eighty and two hundred dollars\nSome of the styles would buckles can get caught and traps making the job even more dangerous says Sorenson determined it's the life jackets that have to change\nI think you need to assume that people are doing the best they can and that may be what we need to do is public health researchers is make it easier and more rewarding for them to do the favorite thing or the healthier thing\nSorenson lunch to research projects aimed at redesigning the life jackets she and her team recruited hundred eighty one lobstermen in Massachusetts and Maine for different types of life jackets for four to six weeks but Peter Fredrickson and his son Josh who works as Peter ...\nParticipated in the study Josh says they were given versions clips around their weight if you live to Ninety as it's like a fantasy back basically\nThis not pack has this year to cartridge that deploys the pull the rip cord inflating the pack\nIt's a far cry from the old orange horseshoe that Peter Fredrickson says it's still not perfect\nThe belt loosen up and the falls off it wasn't easy to claim and you get dirty on a lobster boats\nBut at work those issues and other feedback from the study or now with the manufacturers who use it to reevaluate the design researchers plant start faced to next summer\nUsing social media and community events get more lobstermen interested and then he jacket [noise]\nThey may not win over everyone back on it though Steve ... says if there was a design that didn't get his way he might consider it\nBut life jackets just aren't his main concern\nI don't think of it that much there's more has is on the boat I could lose fingers I could get some serious lacerations with the knives\nHand injuries leg injuries\nFalling overboard is on my mind but it's not at the very top\nFor the friend extends to study changed their minds\nAre going to where it all the time now is you know I'm sixty five years old that former Donald when my balances on what it once was our or feel like this I I've never gone over the sides are but I saw it so it makes her\nPeter Fredrickson of others will take advantage of the new jackets as well [noise] they had lots of men never think they're going over until the moment they do\nThat report from WVU ours ... stay with us there's more ahead I never ... this is radio Boston [noise]\nFrom Boston University this nutty point nine W.

B. U. R. has revealed that the agency sought permission to destroy documents some dating back decades that could be essential to future investigations joining me now is Wu our digital producer producer alley Germany I alley as a pleasures that across from you thanks\nSo common story what was in these records that the state police wanted to destroy sure\nSo the first request was made back in March of this year by the state police and they want it to destroy time and attendance records for twenty ten and twenty eleven plus billing records bank records and twelve years worth of accounting records\nSo it's a lot of stuff that might sound like a lot of it might be of interest to any investigator auditors looking into the state police practices which is happening right now and so that was the first request and then a month later in April\nThey please also petition to throw recruitment in hiring records personnel and payroll records in ... spinning Twenty years and then there was a third similar requests in September\nSo the police and other agencies are allowed to destroy records like this it seems\nLike they are in the state has this several hundred page document it's very wonky it's called the records retention schedule\nAnd it says how long all sorts of different government records needs to be kept so in some cases it's just a year like say for something like a meeting notice or job applications but in other cases for like a murder trial though needs to be kept forever so yeah the the please could legally ask for these records to be thrown out\nBut I never tried yeah but something gotten the way what stopped the process\nYeah so there's a slice of government that I had never heard of it the records conservation board made up of appointees from various state agencies and chaired by a lawyer from the attorney general's office\nAnd the board told the state police no you cannot destroy these records that the police were under ... are under investigation and they table any decision pending the ongoing audit\nAnd were they happy about it I mean what was the state police said well first of all of us anything about why they made these requests during a time when they're under investigation\nYeah so the spokesman for the state police said that they were just following the rules they were allowed to ask for these documents to be destroyed and he said none of these documents were actually the subject of many outside investigation or audit but at the same time they're going to now keep past ... records until further notice\nAnd he doesn't mean that in a vague way when he says they know me I Know them he was a bench manager with the Astros last year does that give them an advantage you know so the worst or does it give the ashes adventures they know what's going on in his head\nA it's an interesting question and we'll kind of have to see how it plays out I don't know I I I think our score has shown that as a manager he's willing to do whatever it takes to win regardless of what it might mean for the future to see the Chris Bell moved from last night it's interesting you bring sailing in the eighth inning\nUh last year the Astros manager AJ Hinch actually did almost the same exact thing would there is just in Berlin\nAnd core criticize it at the time he said what are you doing if we moved again we don't have them for game five\nSeems to have reversed is thinking about that maybe being in the hot to be made the difference was that it worked yeah fair enough in it's a risk reward thing I think [laughter]\nSo this game against the ashes of the series against the ashes a rematch chance vindication last year in the division series the ashes beat the socks and then went on to win at all so let's do like a free post mortem here like let's say\nAnd the Sox have lost why do you think they will have lost that is if things go wrong what do you expect it is I Will go wrong\nPitching a hundred percent pitching uh you've ... who looked pretty good in game one he'll go but after that\nWhere do you go it is and then also the bullpen is a problem so I think it's picking up and down the road or we'll we'll have to speak on how to match up against ... and that's just pitching is phenomenal yes I mean the Astros are a great team I they are peaking at the right time I Am very worried for the red Sox and the series I I think if I were a betting man I I Would have to pick the Astros and I hope I'm wrong I Hope I'm wrong\nI think for the folks in Vegas agree with you write the line favors the Astros at the moment I mean so let's see what the other way ten days now we're talking and the red Sox have pulled it out what went right when did you write how they ...\nI think the key is going to be off as if they're able to score and potentially score first in a lot of these games I think that will really make the difference uh according to ESPN playoff seems to have scored first are fourteen into this year in the play offs it's always great to get those runs on the board early so look forward to Saturday seeds they can put up some runs early Saturday and Sunday is going to be an interesting weekend\nThat's radio Boston's ... thanks so much Chris ... stay with us there's more ahead I'm Evan ... this is radio Boston\n[noise]\nGuards spreading\nHi David dream here get your day

dot com [noise]\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm Evan Horowitz ready to delve deeper into the combustible trial that starts next week the one that charges Harvard University was discriminating against Asian American applicants\nYou have people that are being admitted because of the color of their skin as such a significant factor better overwhelms the other considerations or this or that show at any given level qualification it's much harder to get in if your Asian American applicants that whites than with you know that the black\nThat's Ilya Shapiro potato Institute we spoke to him yesterday he's backing students for fair admissions there the anti affirmative action group behind the lawsuit\nBut Harvard vigorously denies these claims insisting that applicants are evaluated in a in a holistic way\nNot the admissions process use are consistent with their well established legal right to admit a diverse student body so today we'd get some more insight into that argument from Nicole oh gee\nThe supervising attorney for Asian Americans advancing justice Los Angeles there are a nonprofit legal aid and civil rights organization representing a group of Harvard students who decided to back their school and defend affirmative action she joined us from not surprisingly Los Angeles political\nSo we just heard some is the first clip from what your Shapiro was arguing yesterday that admitting people because of their skin color is harming Asian Americans did did you have a response\n[noise] yes I think that statement is completely factually inaccurate [noise] for several reasons\nAnd not give me the residents okay so I'm\nSo first of all there is\nNo evidence that anyone is getting in only because of their race in fact the evidence and the Harvard case shows that race has lots of an impact on admissions decision and then class\nThen geographic location and major et cetera and also number two\nThere is a conflation of two issues that are happening in this case and I believe in the media as well which are reflected in your other guest's comments\nNow there is a difference between discrimination against Asian Americans the white applicants and whether and affirmative action or race conscious admissions policy is unduly burdening Asian Americans and it's really important to take apart the two things\nAs a positive consideration in the admissions process will do nothing to address whether or not Asian Americans are discriminated against in favor of white\nIs interesting because I mean the arguments are making it seems to be just an argument about fairness on some level Asian American applicants to Harvard have the highest academic credentials on average ... the lowest overall acceptance rate how was that not a burden on Asian American applicants\n[noise] so there's a couple of reasons why that question I guess in that question it there are some this understandings about the admissions process\nSo I think first and foremost it's important to understand\nThat traditional academic um indicators of qualifications like SAT scores and grade do not matter that much in elite school admission\nInto so many of the people who apply have extremely high traditional academic credentials\n[noise] that's right you know they couldn't even admit as many people\nUm as apply who have perfect SAT scores and GPA's right and so of course it's going to depend on other factors I think another\nThing that needs to be another myth I guess it needs to be dispelled about the admissions process is that these traditional academic indicators\nActually tell us anything really about and applicants potential for success as a student and as a person later in life now doesn't give some baseline understanding\nOf um qualifications yes but it tells very little beyond that\nThough there's for example a student that gets a Thirteen hundred on the SAT and a student gets a fourteen hundred on the SAC\nSAT all that really tells us is both of those students even though one got a hundred points higher [noise] um [noise] are likely to get somewhere between an a minus and the C. plus average GPS a freshman at all that's all it ever tells us that doesn't tell us anything about graduation rates about later success\nAnd in fact it tells us a lot more about a person's race or class than anything else\nSo I mean do you acknowledge vote that I mean Harvard's own history shows that race can be used as a factor in a discriminatory way men in the twenties or the response to an increasing number of Jews students being accepted the school instituted a character based component to admissions\nAnd that essentially allowed the school to discriminate against Jewish applicants with a defect do quota is is the suggestion that's such a thing as impossible or just that it isn't what's happening now\nNo definitely I don't think it's impossible that Harvard I'm discriminated against Jewish applicants and the path nor that Asian Americans experienced discrimination in many aspects of life today what I Do dispute is that\nHarvard\nIntentional use of race to ameliorate ... past and current discrimination to make its campuses more diverse and inclusive and to provide opportunities to identify the most promising candidates that may be obscured\nAnother piece on north pleasant street is goes shed by artist Tom Friedman number seven on an audio tour you can use\nThe idea for this piece of ... came from the site which ah had several frat houses and I was\nA sculpture looks like a very small house rain but with two by fours painted white\nIt sits on what used to be called ... wrote parties there once contributed to the schools is UMass label the houses and a few hundred ... members were adjacent to a quiet neighborhood the buildings privately owned were demolished around two thousand six UMass now owns the land ... referred to as fat green\nHow officials had been open to all of this the challenges have been manageable but many as this is Thirteen pieces set up on town and school property requiring land permits and liability insurance mowing the grass around the sculptures was a problem and the summer heat melted the fixing on one piece\nWhich collapsed [noise] almost immediately inviting piece common sounding by Eric ... up near the town's new rotary had to be dismantled because of noise complaints from neighbors first metal pipes meant to be played for stuff with cloth than they were removed altogether we hung for special events\nThe sculptures get more interactive is you go towards town into Kendrick park you can even sit inside Sarah Raymond\nSculpture and we are the pieces called day trip and it's made from a concrete drainage covert the culverts openings are covered with color glass I've got a blue um peace on the circle on the top\nA pink and a purple piece\nThe sun moves the colors move along the culprits walls Freeman says families playing the sculpture during the

around if they care about advancing the cause of racial equality duplicitous\nRacist delusional Confederate intellectually challenged or how about flash that there's more of those came from etched into a seems latest book of essays\nWe can't breathe black lives white lies and the art of survival just you know these are the kinds of essay that end with a simple argument you know this is what we need to overcome racism where this other thing\nThey're more like a explorations weaving past and present art and news to paint a multi dimensional picture\nA black life in America here here's a scene reading from his book on the burden African Americans Kerry just walking around\nHeadlines reminders of all the same and different way of black money can collide with his inconvenient breathing walking waiting to cross that the light\nUsing a golf club as a king well crossing a Seattle intersection settings will walk tearing candy in a can of iced tea any of these can be seen as an forgivable trespass alien intrusion on ground that must be defended the wrongful arrests the point blank executions the gunshots through the back\nThe militarized police response is the illuminating silence white so style liberals and most critical the paucity of convictions all point to the say existential question\nHow can we strapped in a strange land\n... reading from his new book of essays we can't read he's the former editor of the crisis journal the N. double ACP and professor at Emerson College he joins me now in Studio you're very welcome back to where the Boston Thanks seven I'm Glad to be here is my first time sitting across from you songs I have [laughter] so\nWhat are the really remarkable things about the book for me anyway it's just the sweet but a past and present and started opening essay which is about lying yeah there's a common topic in the Trump era because of the role lives have played a and presidential communication\nBut your point is deeper like for black Americans it's always been ... this is not the Arab wise it's always been an era of lives why did you\nMean when I was kind of I'm fascinated by um just the idea of stories clashing in in my\nIn my classes I use is called from Muriel route Kaiser where she says essentially the universe is not made of Adam's it's made up stories right and so we often look at a descent and difference as a matter of clashing civilizations flashing values while I'm a storyteller\nSo I look at them as a as a clash of stories and so one of the things I'm looking at is the story of the African American experience here in the United states and the ways in which it has been distorted\nAnd and twist it and the ways in which we can combat that\nAnd the the lying framework it's important to you because of the probably the way your father not about lying and the way that resonated with your experience of this twisted nature of\nYeah yeah I I talk about that in the book I mean I just started go from the personal to to the larger stories but in our house so my father sort of police vocabulary there were certain words\nActually there was a pretty long list of words that we weren't allowed to say or to say to each other I'm One of a six children and one thing we could do is call each other liars my father's reaction to that where it was was uh something to watch it really upset him the idea that we could accuse each other\nOf something it's treacherous is false it's [laughter]\nAnd now everyone is accusing everyone every other person a false of all the time um there's a lot also in the story so between the person on the national debt is local I mean about Boston's legacy of racism like to tell us for instance about the slave wall you stumbled across in ...\nOh yeah I'm In for it it uh when I was just going by in a car and it said slave law but we'll just said later and we know who built the wall we know his name his name was pomp or we know when he built it up so I thought wouldn't it be just so much more simpler and clearer to say it's ...\n... how do we know who built the wall and we have now did you discover\nThere was a very good Historical Society in Medford and they have a wonderful a website and they've they're people who have done this work so Simpsons work has been done I'm saying you know why not bring it out into the\nLight yeah and even the names are interesting but as you point out in this piece that the name pomp or it's connected to a whole bunch of sort of a exaggerated highfalutin kinds of names\nThat yes yeah yeah well a slave holders or I don't know if it was you know their own a limited a view of of heroism are or maybe some worked um idea of irony I don't know but they often gave\nA the lowly as members of society the people who they claim to own this property these really lofty names they named him after generals and philosophers and an orchard and it's just\nIt's like a stick Joe as it is hard to get into the mind\nRight we might want when I'm hesitant to speculate but one does wonder yeah\nAnd and there's a lot more forgotten racism in greater Boston I mean do you feel it when you're walking around everything from you know the fights over yucky way and find you a hall [noise]", "show_name": "Radio Boston", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "10"}
