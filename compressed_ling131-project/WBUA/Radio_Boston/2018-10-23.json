today\n[noise]\nNinety nine WB you are this is is that show broadcast of radio Boston I'm Deborah Becker ... down the ... from the Boston Globe it's now just about two weeks away from election day when Massachusetts voters will among other things beside three statewide ballot questions\nToday we brought you live our long debates on each of them today is their final debate and that is on question one a yes vote would establish nursed a patient ratios in Massachusetts limiting how many patients could be assigned to each registered nurse at hospitals and certain other health care facilities and no vote would mean no change it\nAnd both sides of this debate there's a lot of money that was in favor have raised about nine million dollars that was opposed about twelve million today on radio Boston we hear from both sides on question one our debate is brought you buy WB you are the McCormack graduate school at UMass\nBoston and the Boston Globe where also airing today a New England public radio and you can watch a Facebook Live video of this debate at our website radio Boston dot org or Boston Globe dot com and before we hear from our gas and take your calls we want to introduce some of the issues in the debate over question a lot and\nSome hospital units already staff at or better than the nearest a patient ratio spelled out in the ballot question\nWBRC method eating or visited what visited one of those hospitals to see what that looks like how things might change if question on passes and whether more nurses make a difference\nThere are twenty seven days in a unit called white seven at Massachusetts General hospital\nPatients abdominal surgery is mostly and any type of trauma that can serve\nWhen Britain opinion only a staff nurse arrives around seven am on a typical day she gets her patient assignment finds a spare computer and logs in [noise]\nAnd I have to classify each patient according to how many times I take the vital signs trains they have if they have emotional needs and each time I click one of those buttons my patient gets classified according to a certain number of the higher the number of them are too fast\nAnd the more time they need with a nurse not all hospitals in Massachusetts use a program like this to assess patients but they would all be required to if question one passes at Mass General nurses click more buttons if a patient needs to be watched constantly or unclear buttons as they improve\nAnd as their patients' needs change to recent capital to ... the nursing director Ron White seven adjust the nurses assignments\nSafer and you've tried other ways to get this kind of thing accomplished to ensure patient safety and ensure that nurses are overwhelmed Nancy says that this needs a lot more work in California the only other state in the country that does have these sort of mandated limits has not proven to improve patient outcomes\nLet's get into the specifics of this why and what exactly would mandate\nFor the typical medical or surgical patient the law sets the limit for patients to a nurse in emergency rooms the limit would be a max of five patients to er nurse the limit for psychiatric units would also be five patients to a nurse so John how are these limits set into the question and why\n[noise] so the the limits are actually using the professional standards of the organizations um one that you didn't mention was actually a a one standards which govern the staffing guidelines for labor and delivery and maternity care\nAnd that's exactly where we got those limits from we looked at all of the research that showed a including Dr Linda Akin's study who when she studied the medical surgical patients the reason that it is one to four\nAh with the flexibility with the acuity tool to actually for medical surgical enough to take less patience\nIs because when you go above that limit when and medical surgical patients uh five is assigned to a registered nurse that's when you get to see the beginning of the medical medical problems seven percent of an increase of medication errors medical complications happened\nWith the fifth patience and every subsequent patients after that\nCompounds the increased risk to that patients so we've done our homework on this and looking at California what they did we look to the most recent research and actually modified hours to be more consistent with the fact that patients are sick or in the hospital now than they've ever been\nNancy or any of these numbers written into the ballot question or any of those numbers palatable to your side\nWho I Would say that the biggest issue with a ballot question is the rigidity of these numbers um they're the research that Donald was quoting is all based on average is in every single case people do not look at the ratio of nurse to patients and the reason is because that ratio when it is that fixed and when it is that rigid has\nHas limitations for that and there's to be able to use her professional judgment to be able to work with the physicians to decide to take another patient and her assignments and\nI think when we look across the board at the emergency department for example your example of one to five the emergency department requirements and the law are one to one first for the most critical patients want to if the patient needs care between Fifteen minutes and an hour one to three from one to two it's\nIt's it's so rigid and it would mean an emergency department that a nurse even if she was ready to take another patient from the waiting area she wouldn't be able to do it because this this law would keep her from using her judgment\nSo I'd like to follow up on something Nancy just said you you mentioned averages about on this question is written for at all times so why was it written that way why not use an average why why do you need the same number of nurses at night as you do during the day\nSo I I think that's a great question but having been a nightmare so my entire career I can tell you that nighttime is a critical time for patience because even though we would like patients to be able to get adequate rest at nighttime that's even more critical time for nurses to be able to assess\nThe patients stability and debt clinical status at that time because what will you have to do that while they're sleeping to make sure that you are covering all of the assessments that you need to do to make sure that your patient is the safest\nAnd I don't think there's any secret that patients are in the hospital and out of the hospital as quickly as they possibly can be so patients that would have had that extra day perhaps to be assessed in a different way\nIs already home so we have a very short period of time to do all the work that's required to ensure successful recovery and when\nWe hear about you know almost a billion dollars a year I'm just wondering uh Nancy your\nResponse first in Donald you know would that would that not be passed on\nTo to consumers patients here are insurers so Nancy first\nI mean I don't I think we've all um thought about this a lot there's no question that um that a billion dollars is a great deal of money to add to um Massachusetts health care we already have twenty five percent of the hospitals that are in the red it would cause another twenty five percent\nIn Massachusetts would um would be running in the red it's not sustainable the community hospitals are very nervous about what this would mean for their for their ability to stay open to do programs that they want to do\nA billion dollars would definitely be passed on to consumers and again what are we trying to solve for we have excellent hospitals in Massachusetts where the best in the country excellent outcomes and um I think there's just no question that billion dollars is um is money that is not\nWealth and I'd love to respond to the I mean the as you know hospitals enough corporations and they this is a twenty eight billion dollar industry right now hospitals make choices about where they're going to put their resources\nAnd our position is those resources need to first began with a patient to be sure that the patient has all of the necessary\nResources available to them the safest nursing care possible when they're in the hospital\nThat is what the ballot question is all about is to ensure that the the health care dollars that are intended for patients are spent on patients\nNot spent on corporate wind of other facilities outside of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts outside outside of the the country for that matter we have corporations that are buying up facilities in Malta and China and opening up there were saying the health care dollars to Massachusetts should remain at the bedside of the hospital's patients in Massachusetts\nI Want to make sure we get some of our callers and it was before we go to a break Ben is calling from Arlington Ben you're on the air\nI'd read from the city where the other side is that this may set a precedent markets ... position included shoot I've said this is a vicious [noise] okay\nThanks very much for your call Nancy what what are your thoughts about that I mean could this ballot question extends to two other professions\n[noise] you know I have to be honest I've been focusing on um what what exactly it means to put a question like this in front of the voters I think it is a big responsibility to write a ballot question and you have to consider all the different pieces of it um\nThis ballot question the way it's written um has so many unintended consequences we are literally trying to imagine how we would hold on to the fragile gains is made in substance use disorder and mental health\nThe dollars that would be shifted to um to me these ratios of worry me on so many friends um I don't know if it would lend itself to I guess a broader um\nYou know a broader implementation in other professions but I think it would worry me just as much um there is no there is no answer where rigid ratios are ever the right way for professionals to make decisions\nOkay we're gonna have to figure out a time Donna I'm going to give you just a couple of seconds ...\nFor the safety of the patient if the research showed that other um areas also needed to have limits put in place absolutely there should be and just as in Massachusetts we're looking at safe patient limits for patients were not alone in Massachusetts are surrounding states are also looking to do this other countries are doing this right now\nAnd everyone in the nursing profession is looking at what is the safest way to care for patients\nOkay we're talking with John Kelly Williams and Nancy gained about question one in Massachusetts a valid question that would have ... nurse to patient ratios at hospitals\nYou can join in by calling us an eight hundred for two three eight to five five I'm Deborah Becker with the Boston Globe's pre on a

are in New England Public radio and viewers on Facebook Live a reminder that we want to hear from you as well what do you make of this ballot question are you concerned about safety or coughs or what questions do you have\nTo save patient care\nOK Nancy I'm gonna let you respond to that\nYeah I mean I think I'm calling this as hospitals administrators against nurses just patently untrue um you pointed out that the view our globe um\nPoll showed that nurses are split\nUm nurses that I talk to every day the more they understand the unintended consequences the more they are voting no um but I Will also tell you that every professional nursing organization in Massachusetts including emergency nurses association\nAnd the med surge nurses association and the American nurses association for Massachusetts in the end for using their society and there's several others and every health care organization that is taking care of patients including the home care alliance of Massachusetts hospice and palliative care Massachusetts ambulance association mental health and medical society they're all know on one\nEverybody giving care to patients across the state is no on one ... okay\nYes fleas and I mean ... that's so first of all\nThe nurses that wrote the ballot question when members of the Massachusetts masters association they voted on that when you refer to the emergency nurses association seven and nine of the people that voted for the emergency nurses association or hospital executives that voted on that\nAnd they had to put a disclaimer out about the fact that their membership did not agree with the vote of the members of the executive board so when we talked about who's supporting this question an see\nThere are over ... million people that are supporting this all you have to do is look at the almost three hundred endorsements that we have received from people that are concerned and then I heard us over and over and over again saying there is a problem in hospitals with the erosion of nursing care that's being provided to patients\nAnd we need to have a safe when in place that is why we need people to vote yes on question\nOne okay I Know the two of you can go back and forth until the rest of the show here but I Want to make sure we get into a just a quick question from our audience here Jane has posed a question on Facebook and wants to know how this question might affect the poorest patience and Massachusetts and Nancy the I think\nThat you might be able to answer the question what would you say to James is asking this on Facebook\nI mean I I really appreciate the question and I think one of the reasons that Boston medical center has been so outspoken about are concerned about question one is because we take care of the most vulnerable patients in Massachusetts and um we we know that those patients will be um at the most risk\nThere are the fragile gains we've made 'em in substance use disorder and mental health care in Massachusetts art risk with this with a ... question\nI'm Paul Harrison John Macdonald from the commonwealth magazine I said that the evidence that our policy choice and more socially just result points to know on one and that is absolutely how I feel I feel the social justice is no\nOkay well we are going to get back to our conversation in just a minute we're taking a break but stay with us as we continue our debate on question one in Massachusetts which would establish nurse to a patient ratios in hospitals\nReminder you can join the conversation by calling us at eight hundred for two

hunker down McCluskey Massachusetts voters soon we'll be faced with a choice establish nurse to a patient ratios limited how many patients can be assigned to each nurse in Massachusetts hospital or leaves the current system in\nAbout this supporting question one done to Kelly Williams\nPresident of the Massachusetts nurses association opposing\nIs Nancy ... is chief nursing officer at Boston medical center and listeners on WB you are and in New England Public radio and viewers on Facebook Live a reminder that we want to hear from you during this hour what do you make of this ballot question you can call us at eight hundred\nFor two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk you can also tweet us at radio Boston and ask questions of the folks we haven't studio\nLet's talk about California which is the only state to have is similar nurse staffing law but there's some major differences between California's law and the one proposed for Massachusetts one that's often cited as the implementation timeline California's law had a five year fees and\nWhereas this ballot question is so much quicker it would go into effect January first Donna why is there such a quick implementation on this first of all the seriousness\nOf what's going on in hospitals actually make this a very serious issue but going back to the implementation date is anyone knows and when you do about the question you have to have an an actual date the law is in effect\nHowever it's really up to the health policy commission how fast all of the implementation is done\nAnd following that implementation um and the standards that are approved by the department of public health including the acuity tool that was referenced at the beginning part of the show all of those things has to have to be in place there is no automatic fine set up on January first in the sky is not going to fall\nOn January first about what will happen is\nIs that plans will have to be brought forth to the department of public health for approval they'll have to go through the health policy commission and then they'll have to be enforcement regulation which that will be up to the attorney general so there are a number of things that have to be in place and having done the ICU law\nI can tell you that it will take some time\n[noise] Nancy your response\nI'm not a lawyer but the um the ballot question is very sick a specific around this it says that Massachusetts health policy commission on may not delay um or modify the requirements set forth and it does say that it starts January first [laughter]\nSo when do you think it might go into effect that how long would it take so it really\nIs dependent on the health policy commission but they do have the experience of the intensive care unit law that we worked with\nAnd hospitals like Mass General that you heard at the beginning of the show already have and acuity tool that's in place um and may be used as a resource and again um I Know that we are going to be talking about California and how that worked in California\nUm but we've had we've been talking about this for Twenty years this is not a surprise to hospitals that this has been identified as an issue um and it wouldn't it should not take any hospital that long to get to where they need to be [noise]\nIf California is the example that you say Donna\nI'm why are the limits proposed from Massachusetts so different they're much stricter for example for the typical medical or surgical patient the ratio in California is five patients to a nurse but in Massachusetts You're proposing for patients to a nurse and also the penalties in Massachusetts would be more strict\nSo two points there first of all having been a nurse for as long as I have I can tell you that a lot has changed at the bedside of patients over the last Twenty years patients are sicker than they've ever been and that was the need for changing and really looking at real time research\nAbout what is going on in the hospital facilities so that is why we had that important\nUpdate to the uh the numbers in the ballot question they're based on the latest research the guidelines from the most um\nAn important standardization of staffing in hospitals based on\nThe specialty area that a patient may find themselves in whether it's in the maternity unit other medical surgical unit all of that is based on the latest research and as far as the fine goes\nThat's an enforcement it is never meant to be punitive but it was actually at the suggestion of the legislature when we went for for the icy you lie and brought ... back to them concerning the fact that not all hospitals stumped that they had to follow the law\nAnd and we were instructed by then to make sure that we had enforcement language in it\nOkay let's let's talk a little bit about California and our listeners want to weigh in on this as well Claire is calling from Martha's Vineyard clear who lives in beautiful places in

University and what we're learning from this trial involves more than just the case that's being heard\nA lawsuit from the groups are the group students for fair admissions claims that Harvard discriminates against Asian American applicants and Harvard maintains that race is just one factor that it takes into account to create a diverse student body and it denies it any discrimination going on\nBut this six days of testimony in this trial have raised questions about Harvard admissions and college admissions in general\nEspecially involving issues related to economic diversity and whether that should be considered in admissions as well\nWe want to spend some time today talking about these questions as trial and about defining diversity on campus lived there we want to hear from you should economics be considered in college admissions and how\nHow do you define diversity you can call us at eight hundred for two three eight to five five and that's eight hundred for two three talk\nYou can also tweet us at\nRadio Boston and first we're going to go to W. B. you are at a fire reporter max Larkin who has been following this Harvard trial welcome max Hi dead so tell us what happened today\nWill be you had top Harvard officials on the stand for the second day in a row and they're being asked about the kind of efforts they've made to find a way to build the kind of diverse class they want without resorting to race without considering race at all the Supreme Court has asked the colleges like Harvard make a good faith effort to find\nSo called race neutral approaches to fostering diversity\nSo lawyers for the group suing Harvard students for fair admissions are grilling deans and other top officials about whether they really have done that and what has Harvard say\nThey say we've ... first of all that we convened to separate commissions Harvard convene two separate commissions that were designed to look into that question they said at the end of that process of looking at it they said they found no workable way\nTo use race um or they they found no workable way to build a diverse um and really academically excellent student body without records to race\nAnd and now there's also been talk about socio economics and that kind of diversity and the student body how has that been addressed in court max\nIt started to come up in earnest yesterday dad and I think it's a fascinating thing that's always been in the background here so Harvard more and more has a racial breakdown that largely matches that of the country but it's much more skewed when it comes to income like most universities in this country certainly most elite universities\nAnd I'm Wondering you know do you when you hear the statistics that we heard for example in the\nBoston Globe that wealthy students out number low income students\nAt Harvard twenty three two one what do you think about the socio economic diversity in how how to possibly change that or or does that doesn't matter\nYeah I think I mean I agree I agree that it isn't surprising to hear that mom I Do think it's also important roles said to note that a Harvard is one institution the vast majority of students go to school and institutions that are not Harvard and many of them reflect\nA much more diverse population of students including socioeconomic status\nBut I guess I I don't mean to interrupt but I guess that I'm going to ask Carl this too I mean if you're saying well that's the top school so that's that's okay if it's the top school and that's primarily wealthy I mean isn't that further separating thanks\nI guess they also have to act is indeed the top school right I mean isn't the top school the very the place where each individual students will excel\nTo meet the challenges that they intend to encounter in the world that the best school for them that may not be harbored that may be harbored depend I truly\nBelieve it depends on the individual student and it isn't just about um you know that the school that is ranked the best but the school where that student can thrive and excel\nAnd I want to make sure we get some time and to take calls as well listeners remember we want to hear from you about this should diversity be considered in college admissions how and how do you define diversity you can call us at eight hundred for two three eight to five five minutes eight hundred for two three talk\nDavid is calling from Lexington David you're on the air\nHi thank you [laughter] um I think diversity of income and classes more important than racial diversity although I think that's somewhat important too\nBut uh we have in this country on expanding Jenny quotient which is so I think one of the top two ... quotient from the western industrialized nations\nAnd it's getting worse and politically uh people are bending the rules so that the rich are getting ever richer\nAnd the I think having a you know a bunch of lower class people at Harvard with a much better ratio than one twenty three so that\nThe upper class people at Harvard and get to know them and hear their stories or might help do something about this problem in the future uh which which you know near racial diversity I live in a\nRacially diverse neighborhood where the average house is probably worth close to a million dollars I mean you know we're\nWe're not that different from each other [laughter]\nUh it's nothing like the difference between me and someone who has grown up in a bad part of town with the family income of twenty or thirty thousand dollars a year and then I just think that the Harvard could do the country a great service\nBy a having a lot more diversity of class okay\nWell Thanks David very much for the call where I Will I Want to ask you um I\nI Wonder you know ... a Harvard has said that you know it does it ... well the students and in part it does that because it helps it admit more low income students right so\n... who otherwise wouldn't be able to enroll night we were were charging them full full tuition here and we're able to offer more assistance to lower income students is that is that fair\nAnd many schools have said that right they say that it helps us see how what if we admit more if we ... wealthier students they're helping to subsidize the lower income students is that there\nWas certainly fair and the case of other institutions but in the case of a harbor or Stanford or yellow others with with with\nEndowments that are thirty billion plus Harvard could if it wanted offer I'm Free tuition to every student that attended there and still be able to have enough money to to run its operations would likely be able to so bringing the kind of um\nA funding that they do through alumni relations and other forms so to just for Harvard if if this was their argument to say that we just we'd go broke if if if it wasn't for these um these high income students coming to our institution I think that's just the fallacy that might have been the case or maybe a couple of hundred years ago but not today I Would I Do want to mention one of the thing this\nThis hitting of of of whether or not we need to preference low income students\nOr racial minorities are I think is is a is an hopeful ah there if we're looking and we we have to be up to date on this but if we're looking at\nUm what is crowding out both racial minorities and low income students it is these other preferences in his preference and Harvard for instance around legacy admissions around um students with athletic abilities and\nMany many other things that we see coming out of the secret sauce in this trial if he lives in ... um who's being forced to grudgingly or to do uh to tell the world now Harvard does its admissions\nAre and we can see that what's what's crowding out students is not\nUm is not this preference for low income students who for racial minorities it's all these other things\nHuh ... can you weigh in there in terms of legacy in athletics and those types of admissions criteria on colleges I mean to those need to change so we can have more diversity\nI think it also goes to the diversity of our classes you know again diversity is so broadly defined and so we're trying to put together a diverse student bodies are trying to populate aren't a lot of teams are orchestras are student government we're trying to bring in student you represent that\nBroad variety of backgrounds in terms of their abilities and accomplishments in terms of their perspective in terms of how they contribute to our campus climate so I Would argue that\nThose factors are part of the diversity that each institution and trying to build\nYou know we heard a cut from a island Shapiro on a and R billboard to the show today who's on right near Boston earlier this month senior fellow at the ...\nReplacing white privileged kids have doctors and lawyers was black privileged kids have doctors and lawyers doesn't seem like adding diversity so I get the point but how would you measure a sort of socio economic diversity and use that as a criteria for admission Stephanie\nI'm Sorry can you repeat the question again so it how do you make sure that you're achieving socio economic diversity what's your income standard ... how how do you know when it's when you you're achieving a more diverse student body\nYeah that's a that's a really good question I mean I think that um you know there I I guess I'm not fully aware of there being a civic um metric around that that each institution would be too there's so many complicating factors that figure into how every institution put together\nIts class from I'm from a financial perspective you know it was stated earlier that you know Harvard is different Harvard could indeed meet that need it every student who apply that just isn't the case that the vast majority of institutions in this country and so we do have to\nReally look at what are the revenue needs that each institution ... and how can we generate them and it varies greatly across institutions and institutional type\n... and I'm Wondering where what happens with the Harvard trial from here\n[noise] uh well we've got a lot more to go with a three week trial um and you you we can expect that we're going to hear\nI'm not just the end of the plaintiffs case but we'll be hearing for instance from\nUm a Mickey friends with the court so students who've been affected by this policy and generally praised the policies are going to get a chance to testify in Harvard will present each case that what it's doing is not only complying with the law but beneficial it kind of necessary for its institutional priorities\nOkay W. B. R. and if I report in math luck and thanks for being with us thank you ... also\nWrote will Fernandez program director and lecturer at the higher education at a higher education administration at the Boston University ... College of education and human development thank you Stephanie now vice president for enrollment in communications at Ohio Wesleyan and president of the national association\nFor college admissions counseling thanks to you as well thank you very much unless they're stay with us coming up we'll talk with Rhode Island doctor who says it's time for a health care revolution I'm Deborah Becker and this is radio Boston\nThis is Ninety point nine WB you are an WB words out of work coming up at four o'clock on all things considered we'll hear from the deputy director of the ACLU immigrants' Rights Project about how many migrant children remain separated from their parents and the reasons for that\nThat and much more on all things considered starting at four here on Ninety point nine WB you

stream on shopping experience were home an auto can be bundled together no doubt progressive learn more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive Mm\nWell I think that's one of the near things that we're going to need to do in order to build a healthcare system instead of a market you know the the neighbor's house station where opening in Central Falls is one single clinical enterprise that has primary care behavioral health\nAnd an urgent care and emergency medical services in Lebanon X ray I'm and substance abuse treatment all in one one place one team of people responsible for the care of the entire population of the of the city of Central Falls are about twenty thousand people\nThat's what it looks like you know sort of city by city in place by place\nBut I think what we really need to do is start the revolt\nThe only way to get this done given the weight of money that's transferred to the other side the weight of resistance to any small change the only way to get this done is to build a movement that is going to have to look something like the civil rights movement or the abolitionist movement\nOr the moving for marriage equality you know we have in this nation been able to fundamentally change our society\nA number of times but we have to work on it and it doesn't happen overnight and it doesn't happen just by writing a law it happens by\nGeneral mobilization of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people are working together\nThe the resistance is so huge LA antenna cynical um well I think all of us have gotten cynical and all of us have gotten to accept it of the one trillion dollars that people who have something to sell spent point over five percent of that money\nI've hundred million dollars a year round lobby that kind of spending has totally distorted the political process and has made things so that uh our legislators often pay much more attention to people with something to sell than they do to the people they represent\nAnd the only way to get that back is is to build a mobilization\nYou say doctors doctors should do this and they should unionized and they should strike\nWell doctors nurses health care physical therapist healthcare workers in general\nWe have a as a model\nI'm living in chestnut hill Dr Bernard wound won the Nobel Peace prize prize in Nineteen eighty five he's a a model in a teacher I'm In a mentor um and actually wrote the introduction to the book\nUm with duct duct alone ... ... is a world famous cardiologist world famous cardiologist who in the late sixties and seventies began to realize that all the cardiology if you could ever do would be useless if there was a nuclear war\nI'm so he began to work with colleagues around the nation and around the world that he met a colleague who would similarly renowned in the Soviet the then Soviet Union a doctor ... you've been each has enough and together they organized something called the international physicians to prevent nuclear war\nThat group of people do lots of organizing both inside the healthcare community as an outside of it and actually forced nuclear disarmament and that's what got them the Nobel Peace prize that's the example that I think all of us need to follow\nWhat do you say that the folks who say you know yeah it's expensive and that's why it's the best in the world costs money\nUm it's not the best in the world um when we look at it we ranked somewhere between forty first and fifty seventh and the world for Republicans no gums um depending on which outcome we're looking at in which you're it is\nWe're not even close to the best outcomes in the world swords in mortality rate is three times the best achievable rich and the world for the average American and nine times the best achievable outcomes for African Americans that is not the best in the world\nSome would say though that there are people from other countries who would flock here to take the health care that we have about channeling my father in law here you know I Know exactly what he would say so\nThey'd say well they all are hospitals are top notch and and then if you look at the Mass General of the world where some people have florists dedicated to them to you know to be able to get health care here what do you say a few\nPeople come here for very sophisticated healthier but most people in most parts of the world understand that their basic healthcare is way better than ours is in most countries most countries that do this with any level of\nSophistication or success everybody has access to primary care a similar to the model we're building in Central Falls that primary care is available to them and that's where they start and they make sure that every single person in this society\nHas that kind of access here in the United states\nOnly about fifty percent of us have a new primary care in a regular with\nSome of our could have ideas that they have more time to to flush them out but I'm I'm sure we'll have you back a doctor Michael ... practicing physician in Rhode Island and author of the book healthcare revolt how to organize though the healthcare system and resuscitate democracy fall at

Massachusetts is home to more than three hundred thousand people from Puerto Rico and most have been affected in some way by Hurricane Maria the storm disrupted power and communications across the island and resulted in about three thousand death\nJoining us to talk about this is WB liars see mount ... lives in Puerto Rico just after Hurricane Maria and recently returned for a look at how things are now one year later I said well good afternoon so what stands out from your return trip to Puerto Rico\nSo really this island is is facing a mountain of problems it's come a long way since the storm hit a year ago but\nThe the major underlying issues I mean Puerto Rico's crumbling infrastructure the economic crisis that the island is facing\nI'm One of the things I should say that I really haven't put a lot of thought into job is this idea that Puerto Rico is it is a colony of the United states\nA lot of people uh feel that way you know and when we were we were staying in the sun food section of San Juan it was almost like nothing had ever happened but when we headed to smaller towns and into the mountainous region of Puerto Rico it's really another world\nSo tell me first before we get to that contrast to what officials they're saying I understand you met with the mayor of San ...\nYeah uh we met with got 'em and you didn't lose the mayor of\nOf a Puerto Rico's biggest city or the day after the hurricane and she's the one uh she's uh BU grad as you might remember and she really made a name for herself a in her very public confrontations with President Trump over the administration's response to to a Hurricane Maria\nLike many others it she says the island is getting second class treatment when compared to states that have also experienced disasters to illustrate this point she told a story about the head of the Puerto Rican energy authority\nThat director of prep off half the time told the Puerto Rican people that he was told that\nPuerto Rico cannot purchase any generators in a electric pulls from countries outside of the U.S but the U.S they didn't have any polls laugh because of emergencies and that happened\nAs a colony of the United states we are a literally a hostage market\nI mean it's interesting because uh you lean has really become something of a of a national or even international figure but she's also a municipal leaders so she really she
