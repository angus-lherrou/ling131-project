Massachusetts in the scandal of that the fact that he was tipped off to his indictment a allegedly by a fellow\nBy a former FBI agents who is who got the information from an FBI supervisor even study when you think of it ah the cross country one sixty years on the lam a wicked investigation at all was often criticized will be either\nInefficient in different in different or intentional in protecting him all of that he comes\nBack in two thousand eleven the trial goes on he wants to make his defense and he wants to he wants to eat threatens to name names and talk about his special deal with the FBI he's not allowed to do that by a judge or after after motions filed by the prosecution so even though we cable way up\nThe family of families of his victims warning answers and actually in one stunning setting cheering on the defence the defence of the man who killed their loved ones\nBecause they thought that the defense was was more likely to open up the truth of what had happened and if you get the information for the witnesses then the prosecutors themselves\nYou know many people asked how he was able to elude the law so long you know why wasn't he caught earlier he had a recognizable face he was one of America's most wanted how did he get away from the law for more than a decade and a half\nWell that's the question those are the questions about whether the FBI I really wanted to get him or not and for all those times it was like where's Waldo it became you know it it it became a ... a week it'd be people ask me I was on this case where I've been covering this for about twenty twenty six twenty seven years now\nAnd people would say where is where do you think he has that was a national it was it not only a national was a local conversation to be sure where's Whitey and I went out and followed leads\nIn California that that I found out the FBI had never followed obviously leads doing work they never did they was the suggested that budget was crossing over the Mexican border to get drugs for his heart condition on the other side\nUh I went to the border I talked to a border patrol and immigration and customs asked them if the FBI it ever come to them and and showing them posters and asked them to be on the lookout for this guy Whitey Bolger crossing the bureau they told me the bureau hadn't never been there never make contact never brought posters even though there was a poster\nA president and one of those officers of former top a ten most wanted who lived in Tijuana who'd been arrested by those very people as he was crossing the border\nNow earlier you said that we still need answers even after the trial family members want answers can you go to some of the specifics that you want answers too\nMuch to what extent I mean this is this is the question to what extent was she was she protected to what extent how far up the chain how many people involved were involved in protected in in benefiting from it of taking gifts\nAnd money how far did didn't go where there are other people he wants to brag Bolger wants brag that they most any point in time he could go to the FBI officer gets six guns six guys the FBI office to go with him on a hit with machine guns\nWith Kevin Weeks as his a surrogate son and Parker told me the ball Jews to brag that he could do that ... would you like to know who he claimed he could do that with\nHe said he took he bribed ah several dozen Boston cops along the way when you like to know who he allegedly bribed all those questions never went answered a never never went answered\nYeah he was convicted of participating in eleven murders but you spoke with an ... an associate of his ones who told you that Bolger had told him he had murdered thirty seven people\nYeah yeah he ... he and his partner Stephen Flynn me we're both they like to kill people and they killed a lot of them\n... so he goes to his rise in the underworld he was born in the projects of south Boston as you said in your report and found his way to the winter hill gang\nBest thing that ever happened to ... he was his first his his his first arrest\nThey got 'em for a jumping on the backs of trucks uh that was the that was the early days when he was when he was a kid and suddenly he goes from that he screws to arrest that he was forty forty seven uh but he goes from that suddenly to doing bank jobs armed robberies and\nUh he got he got away with three armed robberies\nThey arrested him he went to Princeton and fifty six that was probably the best thing that ever happened to him because Hattie stayed out he wouldn't have been he was that nobody still at the scene he didn't have any status but he had he stayed out he most probably would have gotten killed in the gang wars of the late fifties\nEarly sixties in which\nBoston was portrayed by life magazine as murder capital usa\nThere were there were the wars and wars between the Irish gays he would have been in a line of sight but instead he was a federal prison got an early release\nA got an early release and signs of what was to come\nHe uh got a a favorable treatment or consideration from the local Congressman John McCormack who happened to be or become speaker of the house [laughter] ... so he had high level of friends\nPeople to advocate for him he got out of\nPrison after the gay wars it ended and then started rising through the ranks of this group in in Somerville located on winter she'll that were took on either the name of ... or ... in fact uh [noise] uh it's first Boston mob boss named winter\nWay they did

the show James Whitey Bolger once one of the nation's most wanted fugitives was found dead at West Virginia presented according to federal officials\nHe had just been moved to a high security present and the law enforcement source speaking on the condition of anonymity total WVU art that Bolger was killed in prison\nFor another perspective on this let's turn to declare he's a former reporter for the Boston Globe and author of the book black mask Whitey Bolger the FBI and the devil ... he's also a journalism professor at Boston University declare welcome\nPrimary what's your immediate reaction to the news today\nWell surprise obviously it's a sudden death and seems to be a violent one but it's you know it was the kind of story that you're expected to come one day or another given his age and ah his health conditions and his track record Keller\nMhm you know they'll do was one of the most feared men in Boston he oh he had avoided prison for decades but with convicted in twenty Thirteen of participating in those eleven murders and he was serving two consecutive life sentences Dick remind our listeners of the whole receives claims he was convicted of\nWhile he was convicted of just about everything imaginable from uh the murders that you mentioned two\nShakedowns and extortion and loan sharking a drug trafficking uh again the whole range of criminal activity but the thing that I think that you know everyone has to remember is that are already Bolger um you know obviously lived a very long life and career where\nLongevity is is not usually that typical\nUm in part of it was that he was a protected an informant for the Boston beer or the FBI for a couple of decades\nYeah so not only was he a an informant but he was in part protected also added side by the FBI tell us about that relationship\nWell absolutely and and and it was the late Nineteen eighties um when the globe spotlight team which I was a member you know reported and disclose for the first time this what became known as the unholy alliance between the crime boss ... in the Boston FBI agents\nWhere over time you know initially the FBI didn't enlisted vulture to give them criminal information mainly about the mafia\nBut over time uh Bolger turn the tables and he transformed or the organized crime you didn't in the Boston office into in effect a an extension of his own gang were there a tipping him off\nDo investigations uh two other underworld figures who were informing against him and that led to some of those informants steps\nSo it's it's it's really a a horrifying chapter and the FBI history given that it didn't involve single moment or a single case has become a way of life\nI Want to talk a little bit about the narrative that he formed a throughout his life he was so purposeful in about ... creating this myth around him that aura about him he was so aware that he needed to be like to be successful can you elaborate on that part of him\nWell there was the Whitey called so to speak um 'cause in his gang as powerful it\nThey did in ... successors or anything like that it was all ... all about him he was at the center of it all and it could be persuasive charming pretend it was almost hit hit a politician's touch you would make you think he cared about you but he didn't he cared about himself\nAnd and the moment um you did something to cross him you'd better watch out um and and you know that's really how you know he he carries himself through throughout\nI think that's sort of dichotomy is what has created that sort of lower around him as well this image that that he created where you know he was the guy who help senior citizens carry their groceries into their home he was a guy who cried when when a puppy died but also\nA man who murdered people viciously and that sort of ... has created this mess around him\nRight now he was I think I think most people would agree a classic psychopath who was a nurse assistant can ultimately care just about himself and those gestures he made that you just mentioned that seemed um helpful in January and we're really self serving to the fullest I mean he was creating a\nSafe zone of comfort and protection there in his immediate\nWorld where people would think well of him\nAnd and and ... grew up around him uh for example and they were cultivated by his his corrupt handlers up the FBI that you know the the biggest one being that I'm he kept drugs out of south well he was the truth is completely opposite I mean he was getting a cut of all the drugs that we're moving through selfie\nUm so you know that's the kind of evil that was in play here\n... yeah so he was on the run for sixteen years and his brother was Senate president here in Massachusetts now\nAs you were mentioning this is a stain on the FBI and the city and it's it's easy to think that this was a Boston bike on but how do you get it all go and and tell us again elaborate for us what the city was like that\nWell yeah I mean he became the most powerful a criminal in the city or from the mid seventies on with the help of of a handful of agents in the Boston office or the FBI you know it was like the city was there's\nUm you have the star agent named John Connelly who still who's in prison today who had recruited him and it was his so called handler and the city was there or Easter\nNow you've reported on and spoken with families impacted by Boulder and and his crime organization tell us again who were some of these victims and did their family really feel a sense of justice after his conviction in ninth in at twenty Thirteen\nI don't know you'd have to ask the families as far as um for some of them they never knew what happened to their to their relative their father or their brother or because of Bolger a would bury them along the ... river and and their bodies remained undiscovered\nUntil one of 'em why does henchmen Kevin which showed them where the bodies were buried I think it was a big moment of course um because he was a fugitive for so many years I think twenty eleven was you know the big moment when he was finally captured in Santa Monica where he'd been living under the radar and then\nYou know obviously bringing back to Boston and and and the the trial and in twenty Thirteen another big moment\nBut you know I Can't I Can't speak for someone who's lost a father to his violence is is you know rather than out with the death of Bolger if it brings final peace I I just don't know\nIn your view who would want Bolger dead\n[noise] um well sourced reports are\nReferring to might be a someone a fellow in may with mafia ties and it's almost like you know the mafia an elephant never forget that because it was ... and his partner Steve Lebanese cooperation and informing\nWith the Boston FBI office at the help bring down the ... mafia crime family so there's always been a speculation and wondering\nUm whether the mafia put a target on his back in ... and like I said it seems if this is true that there was an inmate with mafia ties who was responsible for this uh then yeah it it's like the mafia and elephants never forget\nRight we're hearing you speak about this you know it's it's sobering that that these on the underground connections are still very much kids what came of those of those connections between Boulder and the FBI did anything change uh for the FBI to the culture of the FBI change after Bolger\n[noise] um we hope so you know following the the scandal which was the worst informant scandal in the bureau's history um and there were congressional hearings and there were federal court hearings and in the late nineties here in Boston there\nNow due to point seven WB you wait his very eighty nine point one WVU wage Brewster and streaming at W.

teen how is that yeah it's\nA bit of a different experience when you're actually on the duck boat and and you know it's funny column I was\nA riding on a duck boat with with members of the the Red Sox for an office so\nYou're thinking okay the players are going to of course be showered with with the adulation all that and we go by and you're going to think that people are looking in there and gone

constant right because the the players the coaches that's all changed since two thousand and four of the ownership group at the same\nWell you know it it's funny tell them I I was contemplating that

you're thirty six or thirty seven or or thirty eight it may not seem short to you but some previous studies have suggested that the optimal interval maybe quite a bit longer at least Eighteen months it up to five years so the good news is that you don't have to eat too much longer\nThe frustrating news is that there really are added risk at six months and up to twelve\nMonths but Kerry put those risks in perspective for us what actually are the risks and how much do they go up at my age\nSo I'm Glad you asked that Maria because it's a really important point what we call the absolute risks are very small even though the relative risks you know the proportional changes are not that small so let's say you have a thousand mothers and they're all over thirty five\nIf they all weigh the recommended year and a half to have another baby about three of those thousand women will get seriously ill or die if they're in a rice and get pregnant again within a half a year six of the thousand will get seriously ill or die\nSo overall very few cases but a very dire outcome and and a doubling of that risk ... so what about risks to the baby\nSo let's again take a thousand miles over age thirty five and now we're looking at what's called a severe adverse instant ... which means still birth where the babies born very earlier a very small [laughter]\nSo if the moms always the recommended year and a half to get pregnant again Eighteen of a thousand births will have severe outcome spread to be if they don't wait and get pregnant again very quickly it goes up to Twenty one of your infant outcome\nWell we certainly don't want to minimize that impact and it it is a difference but not not a very big one relatively speaking at outcomes for younger moms carry so\nThat's where there's a bigger difference in how the baby's due again we take that thousand moms but these are ages twenty to thirty four if they wait the recommended year and a half fourteen of the thousand births have severe infant outcomes if they don't wait it's twenty per thousand here's epidemiologist Laura Schumer's again\nThis shows you both the relationship between pregnancy spacing and increase risk but also the older women tend to have higher baseline risk of many of these outcomes at all tendency spacing lengths\nSo we're bottom line is of course as we know it's an incredibly personal decision whether to have a baby when does have a baby when the second baby\nAnd she says her research seemed just hopes this new study can help women make these decisions within their own personal contacts and of course in consultation with their medical teams but she says this new data may be particularly helpful for older women because we'd more off and decide to have short pregnancy\nOn purpose [noise]

children\nAbout the Pittsburgh shootings um so tell us what did you tell your son\nSo I I ... I first started very very simply and I we were in the car on the way back from her skating practice believe it or not\nAnd I had known that it happened and I really wanted to know more so I wanted to turn on the radio and so I decided I Would tell him a little bit and what I said was something really bad happens that it you know me and my interest in a guy and he shot people and he kills them\nAnd we're going to listen to a little bit of the news not a lot just seeking cute little bit more and then I only hear what your questions are and we can go a little bit more from there it's like turn on the news and you heard a little bit more\nUm [noise] and he didn't really have any questions right off but that's kinda how I started like really simply and then when she started talking\nI'm you know he said at some point you know I don't really think and the closing my story but he was like mom I really don't think this would happen in Lexington because we are diverse you know we have a lot of different religions\nAnd people are accepting and that sort of like that was the hardest moment for me when he said that and Simon I'm Sorry if I'm not quitting you a hundred percent correctly here but um [noise] it gives\nYou don't want to burst your child bubble but he even he was even around though a couple of years ago when there was an intern at Lexington high school and there was a ... on one of the bathrooms and we took him to vigil so he's he was somewhat aware anyway that there's any Semitism the world but this was a whole different ballgame\nAnd so the goal so how do I respond to that and what I said was it really can happen anywhere but you don't need to be afraid so I was trying to sort of juggle being realistic but also comforting him because it is really rare I mean this is a tragedy it's a Jewish try to Judy it's an American tragedy\nBut it doesn't happen every day and I don't\nReally believe that he's got she'd be afraid every time he walks into our temple\nBut the message that could happen anywhere fits with this tragedy in Pittsburgh right we've heard a lot from folks from Pittsburgh the squirrel hill neighborhood where this happened was one of the friendliest communities\nFor Jewish people and yet it happened era right gene I Want to bring you in ... and I imagine that it could be tempting for parents some adults to want to just avoid talking about the shooting altogether so I'm Wondering why or if you think it's important to have this difficult conversation\nIf that's a great question um you know first of all of a uh\nIt is it is difficult um uh but what we have but his parents have to understand that their kids are going to be exposed to media these days more than ever before\nAnd I think we have to assume I'm you know that all of our children know toddlers school age children adolescents and young adults\nHave seen or heard been exposed to something and letting them fit with these kinds of powerful images and stories voices\nCan be very very upsetting it can you know we've known in other a terrorist or for school shootings that it can cause a traumatic stress response that can cause anxiety and they're going to have lots of questions and I think that the parents really need to provide reassurance support guidance\nAnd help help the kids navigate these waters the assumption is they're going to have heard this one way or another and we don't want to have them worry a low nobody should or yellow and blue\nJeans you you try to moderate that in any way I mean do you do try to turn off the TV or maybe even took away a smartphone so maybe you limit exposure [laughter]\nAs as a matter of fact the way I Would think of it as a child psychiatrist and I was going to ask I was going to ask you how old your your kid\nOh he he's only ten years old and he does not have the cell phone and we're not actually big TV watchers we never leave the TV on with the news running we get most of our news from NPR this is not meant to be a big plus for NPR\nWhere funded by you our listeners by Huntington theater\nCompany presenting the man in the ring and ethics new play from Tony ...

B. U. R. dot org\nWelcome back to radio Boston I'm ... years if I say Massport chances are this comes to mind [noise]\nThe public agency is so much more than just Logan Airport it's a self sustaining government agency that generates more than six hundred million dollars a year across three marine terminals the Boston waterfront Logan Airport Hanscom Field and blisters airport and since two thousand and twelfth Thomas Clinton has been at the helm\nNow after six years on the job Glen is stepping down as CEO of the Massachusetts Port Authority but before he retires from that post he joins us now in the studio Thomas Clinton welcome to radio Boston Oh thank you for inviting me\nUm I Want to start with your time at ... recent job I'm In your six years at the agency the region has experienced a lot of growth in air traffic money more international flights coming in to Logan Airport and also a lot of growth in shipping so what would you consider to be the biggest accomplishment of Massport on your watch\nSo I guess I Would say three things ah the growth of international flights we've added twenty new destinations since I took over and we've increased passengers by about sixty international passengers by about sixty percent [noise]\nSecond is the revitalization of the working poor but seven thousand blue collar jobs exist in the working poor and I think we've gotten it back on track\nAnd the third the um the growth of the ... airport which is you know always been an important potential way to take some traffic away from Logan in his now experiencing some pretty significant successes with major airlines Jet Blue\nI'm American and a delta I couldn't just attribute that growth an air traffic to the humming economic engine that his wings and right now what does Massport done to deserve credit for all that are that expansion now that's a great question so you know I think ... there's no question that the economy drives our success in is the is the major factor\nBecause I'd like to think that with the various businesses because we're kind of a public private enterprise the airlines are happy with the way we work with them so they're willing to you know try to expand Logan the container shipping companies are happy with the way we work with them so I think\nGood management does play a role in the willingness of our private businesses to take advantage of the opportunities we offer but the strong economy is definitely the key so we got a lot of travel is moving through Logan\nThey're not always happy town you know this we've seen some JD power studies on airports satisfaction out of the most recent one from September ... near the bottom among the mega airports I'm Judy powers at Logan is a place where quote\nPassenger disruption and increased traffic will be incredibly hard to avoid what's your response to\nThat [noise] so I think two things first of all if you look at the list which we've done you know pretty much every year it turns out the airports in the south in the west do a lot\nSo even though they're not evaluating snow storms that has an impact on people's total experiencing coming to the airport\nAnd second we've made a lot of improvements to the airport I'm In a terminal see is totally redesigned we've added a gates or an upgrade of gates terminally we're doing a big project which were about to unveil\nOpens tomorrow in terminal beef so people like the long term benefit of those construction projects but they feel disoriented by the construction while it's happening a JD power has explained that to us so you know I think um you know down the road one of these projects are completed you know we'll see the benefit but in the short run when construction is under way\nYou know it's a little bit disorienting folks\nSo we got the construction I got the weather content with what you mentioned what about Amazon ... what if Amazon picks Boston for a second headquarters and we expect that decision next couple of months by the way I'm so his Logan and Massport more broadly prepared to handle the addition of what would be a fifty thousand person workforce\n[noise] so we worked closely with um the state officials and the mayor or governor on the uh gee exercise to kind of figure out and I think we were seen as one of the positives in their decision making we'd hope the Amazon if they were just decided to come here with the Logan is a positive\nBut I I think you're raising an important question you know how to absorb fifty thousand people even if it's over ten year period because we've had a lot of population growth in Boston over the last ten years um so we're getting to a point you know where we really have to be very strategic and savvy about how to accommodate new growth just talking about what\nThey are you mentioned them off the top and now is daily flights from Jet Blue American Airlines or next year delta is coming up what so what impact will those flights have on the economy of Worcester\nSo people in West or I think a very very happy uh that we've had the success that we've had and they feel like it's part of their ... a success story so you go back say Fifteen or Twenty years about four hundred thousand people a year or using the Worcester airport\nSo that's kind of a benchmark that we're shooting for uh people don't always realize what's there is the second biggest city in New England\nSo it's bigger than Providence bigger than Manchester because in Hartford they all have airports so we're very confident that the ... airport will take off and the airlines that you mentioned have you know look at it as a business proposition and they've gotten on board so I think\nThe growth in central mass and the growth in Worcester is a\nYou know as as part of a big Massachusetts success story\nDo you think though that the solution to budget was almost airports been operating in the red so what's what's the outlook for the more flights they have done the easier it is to cover the or the operating a not in the capital not so yeah we think that there were more flights in the works and that ultimately it will be in our break even and then throw off a margin but\nYou have to make the investment which we've made\nA over the last six or seven years\nOnce talked about a different money issue um the Massachusetts state police overtime pay scandal at ... you know of course patrols Massport um the Boston Globe reported back in March the compensation for true Beth\nHansen or forward it to the state comptroller since two thousand and ten and then when the figures were turned over we found out that many of those strippers were drying hefty paychecks including one who made more than three hundred thousand dollars for three years in a row I'm so I'm Wondering what responsibility you believe Massport bears for that exorbitant overtime and then the lack of disclosure\nThat went with it [noise] so you know I think that a ... to take a step back and put this in context in order to fully protect the airport we need about a hundred and fifty troopers assigned to troop F\nSo back in the spring we were looking at around a hundred and twenty\nSo when you don't have enough full time staff the only solution is to use overtime 'em and all of our posts are mandatory we don't have a lot of discretionary posts um you know the TSA checkpoints have to have somebody assigned to them\nUh so so that drove the numbers up because we didn't have enough fulltime folks um\nYou know I think that uh you know the governor jumped on top of this and say please have jumped on top of this and they've tried to straighten out you know a number of the things that you identified but obviously it's been a\nYou know it's been a kind of a black guy that we're hoping to to get beyond but was it up to the state police though to do that reporting or or or should or should Massport have been doing it well they they are state police employees so ultimately you know I think that's you know when important part of the ah the balancing act\nAlthough Massport at the time was paying the troopers directly right that's changed since the spring right\nWhich we change that because at the system had been designed in the seventies and it hadn't really been reviewed so when we looked at it we said well that doesn't really make sense of just you know leads to the opportunity for confusion\nSo how 'bout development you know we think about that transportation of course out with your agency but you've played a big role in development particularly in the seaport too and I'm thinking about the uh on the hotel project which began construction earlier this year and a and Massport notable used diversity as one part of the scoring process when picking the winning a bit\nSport is going to continue to do and and what were those diversity factors so we tried to different approach or are you sure about real estate committee on the board joined Jackson kind of a negotiated some creative thinking about this so basically we said to the ... six people who did\nThis a hundred points you get twenty five points for finance twenty five points were designed twenty five points for execution and twenty five points to diversity so we let them decide how they want it to do that and they were kind of competing against each other which is kind of different than the traditional approach\nSo we ended up with a big success with Romney a with a great a diversity component that they generated and we said well that was successful so we're going to do it again",
