I'm having a heroin and we start today by jumping over the city hall plaza where how weak is well underway you know how weak Boston's annual festival for the future and joining me now from ... weakens radio Boston's own Jamie belong you hey Jamie\nHey how you doing I'm doing really well festival for the future it's quite a tagline sounds really grand an idealistic and not eager to hear what's actually happening there what what are you seeing\nWell it is grand an idealistic were actually in the thick of hope week right now it's in its fourth day and I'm at the w._b. you are booth it's outside the center stage in massive tense protecting us from the rain and you don't want to get all the way\nI Do I don't want to get electrocuted those agreements are there people coming and going or speech is happening at you know as we speak\nI I was walking around a little earlier and there's kind of something for everyone here there's a lot of public are there to massive round domes for an immersive multimedia experience\nAs a presentation hall they're calling it the the the hall of the future with VR headsets in three printers and robotic arm did you get to the our heads in his living room I didn't get my own there are not having the mouth are you from there's also these um wax figures of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates with for a little crazy but\nUm in terms of what actually happens here it's a chance to hear these big deep smart conversations in talks with the people who are facing and thinking about the ideas that will be facing in the future\nAnd like what kinds of things are they talking about what what were they talking about today\nSo they're covering a lot of ground in any given day but just they're just for today there was a session on legalize marijuana and parenting there were a couple of films screenings or a session on\nMedicine or there's conversations on filmmaking and data and now a analytics and the importance of diversity in the workforce but I Would say the heart of today's events or are these big for a on the main stage and they're focusing on the future of work data in robotics\nAnd somebody that's sort of two bad I'd like to talk about laughter yoga more but since we're doing work data and robotic uh I'll just ask the big robot question which is how long before they steal our jobs\nWill have to say you know which were not that original come up with that question it's been set a lot on the main stage today on a lot of folks ... said you know look they are coming for our jobs but maybe in a different way than we might think\nSo earlier I was speaking to some of the folks to Cambridge Bay company soft robotics they make these like robot arms of course the finger thing that pick up delicate item like fish eggs or fruit\n'em and they told me that in their view they're not taking people's jobs instead they're helping companies complete sort of repetitive sometimes difficult and dangerous tasks sort of feeling jobs that companies are struggling to fill anyway with are low unemployment rate that's their view anyway I\nThe initial claim right that s F F a students for fair admissions got it wrong is coming out of the idea that right now they're attacking affirmative action programs\nAnd race conscious admissions using Asian Americans as the sort of excused or\nThe key to this whole situation that actually race conscious admissions are away for Harvard to discriminate I'm not necessarily support students of color\nAnd use it gives them when they're ... using Asian American students as part of a broader strategy to undermine ... more generally\nI mean I I Do think it's a little more complicated than that obviously the Asian Americans involved in the case to have some say in this but at the same time and were blamed the\nConservative activists who's who's behind the group behind the group or this isn't his first case\nIt's just so happens that now in this new iteration of his attack on affirmative action he has found this group of Asian Americans to end his argument I'm as portraying these people\nAs students of color um who are at the same time being somehow disadvantaged by race conscious admissions\nYourself you support the ideals of affirmative action the idea of a diversity is important virtue of the university\nYes definitely I mean I think that's something that's um highlighted in the piece I wrote\nA woman what what'd you think diversity brings to to university that it's important\nI think diversity is of course important in terms of and I mean everyone talks about the kind of educational benefits or the social benefits\nOf having a diverse learning environment and I do concede to a lot of those points but I think more than this kind of diverse learning environment that seems a little wishy washy to me that um affirmative action brings\nA it's more about its potential right to actually help people of color who have been to Stuart Lee put at a disadvantage in\nArenas of higher education so I think that affirmative action has the potential maybe it's not perfect at the state but still has the potential to remedy a lot of this inequality\nAnd to think of it was like an engine of opportunity for people who haven't had access before definitely so then what's Harvard getting wrong in this [noise] so I think this\nWas written at a point in the summer when they were these allegations of Harvard potentially having a bias\nI don't think there's sufficient data to say whether heart rate is actually discriminating or not but the fact that uh Asian Americans were so concerned because of the certain types of stereotypes that they've grown up with and maybe even come to internalize and fear\nEspecially things like the model minority stereotype the idea that Asian Americans just by virtue of their race and culture are more hard working um and that feeds into a lot of\nStereotypes about the kind of Asian American test taker and the the kind of molded and perhaps\nAnd creative Asian American students at the fact that Harvard perhaps is getting it wrong that sentiment is not coming from necessarily that they're discriminating against 'em there possibly using race admissions to discriminate against Asian Americans\nIn the admissions process but that Asian Americans um even though they'll support Harvard 'em and their endeavors to keep race conscious admissions that doesn't mean that we're not going to still keep heart rate accountable to students of color and two it's Asian American students um\nNow you mentioned also that part of the reason you feel strongly about from the news as an engine of opportunity [laughter] so I Wonder\nHow economics plays into this for you I mean I Know for instance on I think it sort of on the news but one of the things about the Asian American community United States is that on average we've been very successful but it's also the most on equal racial community and the country um and I wonder if there's discussion about this about whether these kinds of programs to help\nThe poor more struggling um parts of Asian American community in the U.S or how that plays them [noise]\nYeah I think you're right in pointing out how easy it is to gloss over\nThe fact that affirmative action can bring 'em great benefits to the Asian American community particularly those on the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum which\nAre frequently glossed over right so the Pacific island they're committed community so um people like Vietnamese immigrants among immigrants Cambodian immigrants\nThe fact that these communities have such low access to education and have such low levels of college entrance and graduation rates [noise] um and the fact that affirmative action and race conscious admissions policies\nCan greatly benefit those communities if used in that way\nIf this lawsuit goes forward and admissions becomes race blind how would that affect the way people enter the kind of identity that you brought to have the kind of or don't do that other people bring to Harvard would it be\nDiminished do worry about this\nI Do worry about this a lot because I think it's important to highlight that this case\nIsn't just affecting you know the the kinds of learning environment or the diversity just within the college itself what is it due to the high school student who's applying to college and needs to represent themselves on this application\nI think that race blind admissions is maybe implicitly but maybe even explicitly\nSaying that race is not important right that race is not\nImportant part of your identity because it has\nNot affected your materials circumstances but perhaps like living in a quote unquote post racial society um as these people claim that it also does not affect your identity at all and your identity right it's such an important\nPart of your application process to college and for me when I was applying to Harvard and it's a college more broadly race was such a large factor of my application race informed\nA lot of the activities that I did on campus um so I started a group for Asian American students at my high school\nAnd an informed what kinds of groups I was searching for and what communities I wanted to contribute to and be a part of once I joined the college and I made that very clear on my application and race and formed a lot of the research interest that I had in high school um race informed\nUh the supplement essay that I sent and\nKind of identity that I formed in high school that would then inform what kind of student I Would be and what kinds of experiences I Would add to my college community\nAnd I think that if I came in to this application process with the idea that those factors all of them didn't matter I don't know what I Would have been left with how I Would have represented myself to the fullest\nWithdrawal starts Monday mhm if you got two minutes and chambers with the judge you know or is there something new particularly want to say I think I Would\nSay that is the ultimate goal is to you know whether it be you know supporting since color addressing historical inequalities by racism making education\nAccess more equitable ... I think that as I say is trying to say that if you have these ideals than you would take away race conscious admissions because it is in fact hurting Asian Americans and I would tell the judge that actually\nThere are many Asian Americans who do not believe that at all and that\nIf you're going to get rid of affirmative action don't say you're doing it for the Asian American community because that's a statement that many of us rejects so don't\n[noise] find another reason that you're not doing this in our name says Harvard student Julie Chung co chair of the pan Asian council in previous president of the Harvard Radcliffe Asian American women's association Jewish thanks so much for being with us now thinking\nEarlier today we spoke with amber actually James along business student at Harvard and a member of the black law students association James sides with Harvard wasn't that she sees the law students and tempted to further the goals of Edward Blum who's helped orchestrate this and other cases against affirmative action she talked about how this case has divided the Harvard community\nCollege by dot com [noise]\n[noise]\nI'm David Folkenflik coming up tomorrow on point justice Kavanaugh takes a seat on the Supreme Court Nikki Haley had for the exit protein Michael threatens lives the weekly news round table digs in plus some lawmakers seek to prevent many people from voting ahead of this fall's midterm\nThose efforts don't show up in pools but could affect the results that don't point tomorrow from tend to new and again it's seven and nine point nine to meet you are Boston's NPR News ...\nLooking back to radio Boston I'm Evan Horwitz or let's check back in with radio Boston's Jamie below and you're down at how weak city hall plaza Jamie who do you have the booze now\nHey I've been I'm joined now by Julian Armstrong she works on a A N cognitive technologies that liberty mutual hello Julian Hi there\nI'm so can we start with sort of what that actually means when you do\nShare to most people that work on a chat bought so technology that can just have a conversation with you interpreting those on\nAnd our call centers\nSo okay when I hear chap odds and Gulf under like think\nPeople that used to do that are now not doing that so how were you thinking about the jobs that may be ...\nSo what we're trying to do is we're just trying to take away the simple questions the questions that\nI'm as a call center happy doing the same question over and over and over again and divert those over to the chat bought\n'em and free up the cult interrupt to these things that humans are good at sort of the empathy and creativity and they've got time to spend more time with\nNot looking to see what we're looking to augment them and what I\nSaw a piece you wrote about teaching chapel empathy if you don't want the job was to take the jobs of the people who are trying to do everything\nSo I Do think that we are um\nQuite a long way up from tap but really being able to empathize with you um I think what we do on the campus there it's empathize with you um insofar as they can realize you're frustrated and that they would be better to pass it up to him and\nI see I see but but still I I [noise]\nDo you say to the just the regular people who are listening out there they're legitimately worried like no I work in a call center somewhere and [noise]\nI don't want this like what are you where do you say the ... [noise]\nI guess it's a person that called for the call center you don't want to wait for forty five minutes to get a really simple answer\nNo but I don't love the idea of yelling at a at a at a ... I'm Sorry I didn't understand that on the other end you know\nUm and I think for the people he working centers it's technology is still very emerging\nIt's definitely not going to be taking anyone's job today uh-huh um maybe five or ten years we will see it [noise]\nUm so maybe if you ... do you need to start thinking about OK what are the things that we're still going to need people people need people I'm wearing insurance company were there to support people we don't want to just put you on the computer and never have you interact with any people that would be a terrible experience that's not what we want\nRight so um so okay you're someone who's looked at and studied AI for a while now where do you see the store next frontier\nSo I think definitely I'm watching how it's integrating entire life to things like smart speakers virtual assistant\nDefinitely very much people are really accepting it I'm into their day to day lives and I think\nThat it's an exploit technologies are going to be a massive thing we're going to\nThem to be able to handle a vast people are using them to set timers and do their shopping list but it's just going to get sort of more and more pervasive we're just going to be used to them being there\nOkay but so along those lines than you on mosque among many others have warned against a a and that maybe they need more regulation I mean\nNot to be a very negative hear about this scandal but is is is that a concern is that something you're thinking about\nI think it's obviously something you need to think about of course\nThere are privacy issues and of course we don't want a guy to just real our lives and make decisions for us\nUm but I Do think there is a really powerful thing and sort of helping\nUm have better lives and be more humid [noise]\nUm so do you think of like a voice assistance and they really helped the sort of take her eyes off screen mhm and start looking at other humans and start actually having conversations with other humans as well and they're in [noise] um so I Do think there is a teacher and I think we're very long way out any sort of ... a I worry about it today\nAll right we'll we'll stay hopeful for the future Julian Armstrong is a technologist at liberty mutual thank you so much for joining thank you very much I've been a bacteria WB your\nRadio Boston producer reporter Jamie below and you live and how we can see all plaza thanks so much Jamie thank you I've been\nExcept this one didn't end up at the center of a high film\nIt landed in the palm of an Eighteen year old student eager to better understand for nature by visiting the Swiss mountains where the German philosopher wrote some of his most important works\nSome Twenty years later that student now a philosophy professor at UMass Lowell and a family man went back and his latest book tells the entangled story of those to visit it's called hiking with nature\nOn becoming who you are part memoir part philosophical exploration part confession\nThe author John ... joins me now in Studio John or will continue to Boston Thanks driving it's amazing to have is you haven't read the book and like\nWorked with whatever aspect of yourself got poured into the pages it's uh I'm excited to sit across from you and ask you questions now\nAre you excited to answer questions what what what gets in each in a second but I really do want to start by asking it seems like it's a book about you even more than it's a book about each ah your path to becoming a philosopher father and a family visit my over reading that\nIs our elders about life in a book about philosophy and those two things should not be divorced so I'm ... the idea that philosophy can be a type of therapy for a person\nAnd including the philosophy of neat I mean it's true lots of people think about using philosophy for the therapy or as therapy but needed not always the first one that comes to mind but let's let's pause for a second right do we gotta get some grounding here\nUm nature you right in the title the book is full of his ideas aphorism by graphical detail\nGive us one grounding principle to help us understand what needs to was all about\nSure on so many Nineteen year olds I'm not alone and being drawn to reach us so [noise]\nUm his concept of the will to power the idea that what human beings find most meaningful in life are volition and acts of delicious and meaningful creative acts\nUm many you only see what I mean like ... deliberate acts of chore yes I'm exercising your will in meaningful ways\nOn many young men who are brought up in conventional backgrounds like I was at Nineteen central Pennsylvania uh brought up in a Lutheran family not unlike nature's um I was a good little church boy a good little school boy just like nature\nAnd for a for men and women um in their teens who were brought up that way nature is the invitation to be otherwise it's an invitation to escape [noise]\nUm and that's what I saw um when I was given that envelope\nAnd you've got this envelope but who gave you a sample of first of all is amazing like how many students get an envelope full of cash from\nThat's right you know at the end of my junior year um my professor Douglas Anderson and my ... a professor teaching me nature Dan Conway got together and handed me a an envelope for three thousand dollars and said\nI'm you're writing in your writing a thesis on the will to power and insanity and genius\nAnd you didn't have undergrad these as it was a master's thesis um and you should go to those Maria and we've already set this up you're going to stay and Frederick needs his house which is now a museum but they had contact with the curators and for nine weeks I hiked the trail behind sills Maria\nI'm and try to exercise my will to power\nUm to both good effect but more often when I was Nineteen to pretty disasters\nYou had some harrowing moments in that first trip\nI did and in fact part of the book is about the limitations of the will to power and each is known 'em by by fascists by the alt right as a as a philosopher the hammer ... it's all about exercising the will and part of this book is about how misguided that interpretation of each actually a ...\n... the fact that you had these harrowing moments as a Nineteen year old it's hard to know reading the book did you want to they were you going there too I don't know face your mortality and some in a way that you understood or were new at\nIt's a great question so [noise] um nature when teachers says famously that God is dead what he means is that the cultural institutions of our lives\nAre in that church state\nFamily in the Eighteen sixties and still today those don't exercise the same power over us as they once did historically and the question for nature was what are you to do in the absence of their guidance and going and going to Switzerland for the first time it was my first time outside of Pennsylvania [noise]\nUm it was the first time that I had ever considered radical freedom\nA radical possibility and nature like his contemporaries soaring kick regard\nThinks that a radical freedom is accompanied by anxiety great anxiety and that's what I experienced up in the mountains the first time and you're left with a scar I did um I got lost um and ... lost in the mountains for two days and it was very it turned out it was very

Boston dot org\n[noise] this is radio Boston I'm Evan Horowitz and it's friday which means week in review starting with the race for governor you know the person who oversees the government of Massachusetts\nIncoming governor Charlie Baker met his challenger Jay Gonzales for a first debate this week a channel for were bigger push back against the charge and he's a status quo leader\nIf I was the status quo governor since still be thousands of homeless families living in hotels motels in Massachusetts there arts if I were the status quo governor we wouldn't have a huge offshore wind hydro program going on to replace a third of our fossil fuels with clean renewable energy\nAnd Gonzales kept repeating his response that just not enough\nIt's not nearly enough that's not an ambitious agenda there's so much more we need to do to make a difference for working families in the state and our transportation system is the thing I hear the most about everywhere I go I Will provide the bold leadership we need to fix it\nJoining us this week to talk about the contest and lots of other things Massachusetts is sheer center political editor at the Boston Globe and someone who has in the past saved me from making embarrassing errors my own\n[laughter] I notice here I I don't think so much for having me on the show it's great to see you here\nIt's great to be sitting here with you also with us is Michael Jordan is executive editor of commonwealth magazine Michael great have you too good to be our hope you don't feel outnumbered by the globe ease at the table no no I'm\nSorry to be here on everyone okay so the short version is at least of the debate Baker presents himself as an effective administrator someone who's improve the tea improve programs for the homeless ... taxes\nAnd all his push for big programs big spending and attack the governor for thinking too small Cheryl what'd you take away from the debate\nWell the takeaway for me and you know the ten other people who watched it during the red Sox game um I wasn't really civil and engaging debate is actually a nice reminder of what meeting democracy should look like often when incumbents are twenty points\nAhead maybe more in the polls are lonely debate there and put it in one sense I'm certainly not saying that's a good thing that's a strategy some incumbents a employ and in this case Charlie Baker I signed up for three debates and the debate he the most recent one with him and Jake Gonzales\nWas a nice to just score it seems like a nicer might've what politics is supposed to be like a normal normal times\nIf only the Sox weren't playing and people knew about that Michael ... yeah I mean I agree I bought a I mean one of the interesting wrinkles drawing on C SPAN and I was thinking uh you know not to be all sort of\nA Pollyanna for God's you about Massachusetts but I thought it really showed as you're saying it it it showed the state well to the country in the sense that it was very substantive I mean I think\nIf there's been talk obviously about this eleven billion dollar the wall and the harbor\nA and eventually they decided that was not at all not they've come to terms that it's probably not the best idea that they want to look at these sort of smaller projects\nBut we're going to feel it sooner rather than later and in many ways this could be one part of Marty Walsh his legacy as mayor of Boston the next couple of years I just how he set for the city during this pivotal time to be resilient against the forces of climate change and most notably flooding last January that's a preview member of the storms in the flooding in the harbor\nThat the previous things to come it's quite it's scary\nYou know uh I'm not on the environment Baker said last night that he's fail to meet his own pledge of one percent spending on environmental issues he says only been about half a percent of total but Gerry spending um as I put it\nThat follow judge from not delivering on my problem is the um the only caviar cut out for a moment we're going to go there I've ... not delivering on my commitments um I don't like not delivering a commitment to make\nThat was at the museum of science forum last night where he just acknowledge she hasn't delivered on this commitment you sorry about that ... has made a similar pledge by not later\nWill dedicate one percent of the state budget to environmental agencies and we will make meaningful progress each year until we get there that is a commitment of mind you can count on\nSo I guess I'm circling back to the governor's race here but I that's why we don't mind is this something that's at stake in the governor's race Massachusetts is preparation for climate change\nSyria I think it's an issue that are Democrats and liberal ... like to talk about I think you are in Massachusetts compared to a whole lot of other states you find a lot of environmentally focused voters\nUm is the question or will it may will it be the decision maker for other fifty five percent or so of independent voters out there\nUh I I don't know I don't necessarily see that in these times but it's still a major sheen is going to just continue to be I think a growing issue\n[laughter] how's this for a segue from grade me from the destruction of the planet to the destruction of state records oh that's very good aren't Santa and let's talk about ongoing scandals at the Massachusetts state police twenty Eighteen has been a year of state police scandals from fake overtime claims to charges of political favoritism\nTwo former state police commanders were in court today denying the charges of overtime abuse yesterday and other trooper pleaded guilty to embezzlement in federal court\nAnd W. B. U. R. broke the story this week that the agency sought permission to destroy document some dating back decades that could be essential to future investigations Michael what did what'd you make of the most recent twist in this story\nAh I mean when I made of it was that was a horrible look uh for the state police and and I mean there's just no other way to look at it uh\nYou know there was I guess technically that request to destroy records you know complied with the you know the all all the regulations around how old they have to be and so forth but I mean you'd have to be crazy to to to not realize there's a broader context at the moment with what these investigations and\nUh you know the governor came out and said this shouldn't be done there shouldn't be seeking these but I think there's still a lot of question about you know they were three different request submitted by three different people I mean what prompted those requests to was there any one higher up\nIn you know on the food chain that had to approve them or that may be initiated\nThe the the request and is is there any accountability now for for how that happened I mean we need kind of a de construction of of how this came about it's not enough that we just know that this records board denied the request inside of the ongoing investigations I think\nThere is still you know to ... it doesn't smell good well you mentioned the governor's comment on it less listen to that\nWhat they did was completely consistent with standard operating procedure they shouldn't be destroying payroll records they shouldn't be operating under standard operating procedure at this point in time given everything else is going on with respect to those who is a fair\nAnd since I Can't get away from the governor's race let's also listen to Jake ... response which was sharper\nThe colonel should be fired the secretary of public safety should be fired the governors should appoint someone to lead the his they bully who's going to root out corruption someone from the outside who's got credibility\nShira ... is this the governor's fault or should we think more broadly about what's going on behind this lack of oversight cultural problems at state police how do you see responsibility\nI think in terms of voters if there's one major issue where the candidates are split on in terms of recent news it's just one right\nBecause Charlie Baker has clearly said by colonel Carrie ... throughout this chickens also said she and many others need to go right this is certainly a difference there is is that the guy concrete distinction absolutely between the two candidates and I think it's an issue and an opportunity for taking time to get a lot of traction a\nCharlie Baker has decided and several of his response since about that a ongoing from this incident that I it's happened prior to this time it was just average before his time and our editorial board notice a new to this morning that that's they don't think that's good enough anymore or he's been in office for three and a half years\nAnd we have a quote actually I have in front of me from the the globe editorial bakers the boss now which means the buck stops with him under this governor the state police clearly thought they could get away with blatantly inappropriate behavior how extremely disappointed you go on I just\nKnow I I I mean that's obviously auditory aboard which is separate from our news department but I Believe that Governor certainly has uh an issue with but this year and it's a political issue as much as it is it a state issue\nMichael do you have a sense from where this should start if the problem is going to get fixed\nI mean you know as hard to know whether ... you know you can follow says you know the three of you know fifth dropped from the head down even though she's newly appointed he thinks there needs to be a change in leadership and someone brought in from the outside so I'm not sure about that I mean the other thing that I Would just note is that\nUh you know when there are problems that come up it anywhere in government that's that's that's not good but there is a particularly corrosive effect of corruption within law enforcement and that's something that\nAnd for size enough there's been a lot of talk about corrosive in what way I mean just in terms of a of a public confidence in government I mean these are the people who who you know enforce norms of behavior on all of us and yet if this is what's going on\nWithin the department I mean it just undermine so I I Want to sound too dramatic it undermines the whole premise of the rule of law but at some at some point it does\nI agree these are the people who give you speeding tickets right these are the people who are a lot of citizens have the most interaction with writer ... hopefully not have the most interaction with I should say but it is one\nAspect where you touch upon governments in your daily life they're following you on the highway for speeding things like that right you\nSee cops intersections you see it all so I think it really has a pervasive effect and the way other issues\nDown and and do you think it is improving you think the charges brought are making a difference or do you think no in fact we're just at the beginning of fixing Michael I\nMean I don't know I don't know how much more there is to be a can be discovered I mean it it you know I mean I think we're in that phase where it doesn't look good but it's kind of the the cleansing process that you have to go through to get to a a better place on the other end of it also you know hopefully you know things are are getting better\nBy by the sort of sunlight being a you know flashing on what's going on there and and the kind of\nCases and investigations running their course\nAll right well maybe let's end with some later news than the corruption that corrosive Lee undermines faith in government um how about everybody loved the hubbub the brief stories are events that didn't get a lot of general attention but caught your attention this week Sheera which jumped out at you\nWell that's got some attention but I thought it was such a such a fun idea that I wanted to bring it up a British developer scape has plans to build a hunt a one billion dollars in privately run dorms five buildings up to three thousand bats for\nEssentially college students and they wouldn't be exclusive to single school they'd be these towers where students mostly upper class and they say gravitate towards these will be housed in one building\nIt sounded like a fun community ah ah that they could um that could be here and the city and ... not only promise for college students who ... who unfortunately because of budget constraints ended up living conditions that are not always a up to par\nAnd also for the city which is having a housing crunch right it opens up a lot of\nLot it opens has the potential to open up some housing for uh for the workforce instead of the student fourth I my my thought is this story noted that this company looked for Eighteen months for a spot in America to open up their first storm and like it took you're Eighteen months defined Boston what we're here we're going to college students\nNo but they're not the only one struggling to get permission to build buildings in a narrow sister Michael you're up\nTo mind something that has actually been building for a while but actually will will kind of a come with a bang tomorrow so are we going to have a little bit of mad as\nTomorrow a artist for humanity which is a small was founded as a small nonprofit back in Nineteen Ninety One will celebrate the opening of a new addition to it's at the center which has its main building in South Boston and this will double to more than five hundred the number of Boston teams that it serves\nThrough what is a really cool model of paid\nMentoring a of young people in art and design field um and so uh it's an amazing program it's great that they're they're going to be able to search so many more kids are as their name says ours ours remained anymore are more humidity or you know what could be what could be wrong with that who's opposed to that exactly\nAh build the technology so that the robots can recognize landmarks so as the robots moving around and say okay I Know what that is I Know what that is\nA okay corner of of chair I Know what that is okay I Know where I Am\nAnd then a bill\nFrom landmarks and the ability to figure out sort of X Y Z on a map where you are I'm a move around and create a a map of where the spaces and then from the map of the space okay how do I divided up that space into rooms\nAnd then\nThe next time I turn on to go do the job I'm keeping track of where on that map I Am so I Know which room I'm In at anytime\nCurious concept a kitchen is you might know where it's kitchen is but it could eventually be extrapolated to understand what if you take it into a different home oh this is the kitchen because there was a stove and the fridge and that sort of thing\nI mean I think that's where things will go down there I found the road right now um what we do is we show you your floor plan we guess where it's likely rooms are and then you can go at it that map\nLittle push a wall here a divider here and and then named the rooms because ah kitchens might be recognizable but if you call the play room the den uh it's gonna be a long time before we had a I can figure that out so\nChris mind if I you might have cut in and ask questions I had a guy so it isn't it it seems to me like the futuristic stuff on offer isn't isn't always the stuff people most want or need like like moving furniture around that sounds that sounds very cool\nBut but what I'm looking for is a robot that will fold my laundry and and do dishes I mean like ... the washer was a major innovation like you haven't been major innovation\nIf we're close to another of those right so you know the the industry is progressing are and we started off with things that we thought we could do at a price point that was lower than the value that the service was ... and that's a good business you can sell\nYou know we sold over twenty million robots and last year the Roomba vacuum and it was actually the number one selling vacuum cleaner in the United states which is like well we got one are\nNow you asked about folding laundry or things that require arms and this idea that understanding the home is critical for the advancement of robotics uh I think that that's a great example because what's the point of having arms\nOn a robot if you don't know where anything is so that you know the all important go to the kitchen and get me a beer\nIs irrelevant or an impossible request if I don't know where the kitchen is and don't know where the refrigerator is but uh and so that this idea of ... technology has gotten to the point where we can\nUnderstand where room is so that's like a big deal that's like the beginning of understanding enough about the home to go\nUnderstand a little a\nLot so I like the idea of the the importance of understanding is building ON Technology it it does make me wonder how much we have to give up about ourselves and our privacy to make it work that is how much did the robots really have to know about our homes and our lives before they can be useful and and are you concerned that we're giving up so much about our private space it\nWell you know I think that if you want the robot to clean the kitchen it needs to know what the kitchen is just some great meaning the bounds and so for those need a picture of the kitchen it doesn't\nNeed a ton of detail\nWe can do that and again this is something that as a consumer if you want this I think you need to know two things I'm One what am I going to get for it okay robot is going to be able to clean the kitchen when without giving us information it can\nAnd second is the company that you're giving that information to going to treat that information or in a respectful way using best practice to try to ensure that that information is\nIs is held a secure and so you know I robot is investing a continuously aggressively and\nAnd we tell you what you're going to get for sharing the data and if you don't want to do that\nWell then the ... in your kitchen they'll just playing the whole house and maybe that's okay but\nBetween benefit\nConfidence uh is a trade off we have to continue to look at\nWhat's called Angle's cofounder and CEO of I robot going
