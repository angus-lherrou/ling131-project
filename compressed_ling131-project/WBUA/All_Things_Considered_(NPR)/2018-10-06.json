Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on a vote a fifty two forty eight one of the closest margins ever minutes\nDuring a private ceremony later today NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow was in the Senate for the final vote and he's with us now from Capitol Hill it's got welcome thanks for joining the same show so first of all set the scene for us where people who are not able to watch\nIt you know these votes are one of the most formal moments that ever happened in the Senate Senator sit at their desk and vote one by one while the vice president presides\nSo as that was happening person after person in the gallery interrupted with visceral personal protests strip mentioned [noise]\nCircles who spent [noise]\nSergeant at arm's will restore order in the gallery\nSo that's that's a woman yelling at Joe mansion that she was an assault or survivor that he's putting his personal politics ahead of her experience that happened over and over again another man yelled at Jeff Flake that he was a coward and all Thirteen people were removed from the gallery during the vote\nAnd I think that sums up this whole story and one seemed to send it struggling with its formal responsibilities made hyper partisanship an emotional set of circumstances and both parties retreating to their tribal basis\nThis has all been so partisan and divisive um but even accounting for the theatrics county that people sometimes bring to politics gets you a sense of this anger will linger in the Senate\nI think so uh senators from both parties are incredibly angry for very different reasons and and just listen to some of today's concluding speeches Mazie Hirono Democrat from Hawaii says this is another case of a woman being ignored\nThat's what I Am left with Mr President anger theory this guy\nThat could not see the truth of what Dr for I've tried to tell us\nAnd Republicans feel like this has been character assassination from day one here's John Cornyn\nI Am disappointed more than I can say those who of unleashed these unjustified attacks on the judge and his family and disappointed than their lack of any empathy remorse for what they have put them through\nWell let let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and it's got because because many senators have said all along that they found Christine positive for sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony that they talk about\nThat they did Republican after Republican was making that same argument often and in strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing that Ford was sincere that's a word that kept coming up\nThey said they believed that something happened to her but either that they didn't believe that Brett Kavanaugh was the one who assaulted her\nOr did they just didn't see any evidence backing for it up on that claim that was the final view from Susan Collins of Maine when she made that speech yesterday ensuring Kavanaugh would be appointed a confirmed to the court that there were no corroborating accounts more questions than not\nSunni and we have the same result as Nineteen Ninety One when Anita Hill testified about

heard by now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court\nAs you likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh now we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford\nThe woman who told a Senate Judiciary committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they had been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country has tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet the the full impact and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but but certainly what she has done\nA has unleashed something that is going to move the country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter\nI have found their voice to come forward to have the courage to come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford want to happen now listed makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and is now that the information be provided to the people making the decisions so that those making this decision could make an informed decision with all the facts\nThat's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she did want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not\nNot get was an FBI investigation as FBI investigations are typically conducted they did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important\nCritical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting a vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect\nOn both parties I mean there is some evidence that Republicans are now much more interested in the midterms than they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and this is going\nTo be an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will\nBecause it has raised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and is a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting on November first the pay will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but as the new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefits\nWe decided to check in with some Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nMy name is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old\nI work at Jefferson ville Indiana at Amazon so on the day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match up physically and virtually so I've been at this a film it center since it opened in\nAbout six years ago\nAnd I am making fourteen forty but after the pay raise goes into effect I'll be making her out roughly sixteen and I have a son who does travel ball and for me this means more sports equipment more opportunities to go to tournaments that kind of thing\nSo for myself and my family I Would rather have the money on my paycheck now\nThen the weight the two years for my stocks to that\nI don't want to get my name but I'm a Packer at us a film that center on the west coast and I've been doing it for about a year iron Thirteen Seventy five an hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five\nAn hour oh let's concerning us mainly is were given a monthly bonus and when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles and we're worried about not getting or pay out and making less\nMy name's first emerging as Andy ... Amazon for the last three weeks I wars in the ... I started working in the store\nIs approaching the company that you received a merchandise [noise] to bring the inventory for making seven dollars for hours and no longer the trees were going to be freezing dollars an hour after November first\nFeel very excited about it very hard to decode other provider I now I can use to my farm and better quality and all sorts in history and we're talking with my family because I don't have to be looking for Chicago full time job is going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work out which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour\nIn addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nMost of the employees that we're talking about our warehouse workers\nWho do want to raise some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with um you could hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses so particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what does the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal right\nSo there have been a few reports and a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about them\nOptions are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested in to the company and they would get\nBig massive bumped from stocks two years later two years is a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company says pretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money with the Fifteen dollar minimum wage then you were\nBefore so I think part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase and the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees didn't know that it was coming\nAny idea why why why did they announce it so suddenly and why no\nOne is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company on Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that the conversation at the top level was happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a state of stories a highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number the median income was released as twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for family of four\nNow that is a worldwide numbers what the company will point out that said this is the second most valuable company it is run by the world's wealthiest man so the contrast has been putting quite a bit of pressure for Amazon to to do something\nBefore we wrap up your part of the Amazon announcement also mentioned that the company plans to lobby for a higher federal minimum wage and I'm asking you to speculate but do you think this is going to have an impact beyond Amazon itself\nI think that was one of the most important parts of their announcement at the very rare for a corporation especially for Amazon to take kind of a very political stands and in this particular case I mean we're talking about federal minimum wage right now is seven dollars and twenty five cents it is an extremely low\nMultiplying the everyday impact on the patient and physician experience learn more nuanced dot com nuance the power of you multiply [noise]\n\nI'm Janine hurts with these

Van Dyke he was found guilty last evening on second degree murder and other charges for killing Seventeen year old Laquan McDonald back in October two thousand fourteen\nMore than a year later dash cam video ... large protest when it showed the officer shooting McDonald's sixteen times Van Dyke testified that he felt threatened by McDonald\nA podcast called sixteen shots from member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune has been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life or connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there was take from the courtroom when the jury returned to\nVerdict we you're fired [laughter] guilty of that [noise] we find him guilty of aggravated\nBattery was fired [noise] first WB\nEasiest Gen Y is host of the podcast sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again she might welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thank you so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now the reaction was\nRelease um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activists who believe Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also this sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting would climb McDonald fatally CBD shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat this is one officer one case but this is not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke we\nHeard from the head of the F O P the fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiments\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\n[noise] what what you said some of the riveting moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified to you know how that day started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and starting his day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologist\nThe defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke\nOr the officers said that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy he's not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it's sad when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you mentioned in the pockets of reported on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues do you have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these refs or does it just to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abusive\nPolicing practices or after the video was released of this shooting\nThe department of justice came in and investigate it CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy and practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nAnd someone talking to activists who are pushing for police reform again they say this is one case that we think to some degree of justice was done\nBut when we look at the police department as a whole you know what is reform look like you know what if they're going to look like moving forward is this a consent decree in the city is in the process of\nEnacting a consent decree to reform the police department but is it going to be effective because there have been promises in the past that the police department was going to be reformed there have been different panels for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that has worked so what's gonna happen from here\nAt ... she's the host of sixteen

Court\nAnd we've been hearing a lot from senators and spokespersons an activist but we wanted to see if we could broaden things out to hear other conversations\nAnd we thought who better to talk to the local radio calling hosted journalists who hear directly from their audience is on a regular basis so we called Liz Redskins she's a reporter with Alaska Public radio who's been closely following

that's at Minnesota Public radio Carrie thank you so much for joining us [noise] Hi Michelle thank you\nLet me start by saying that nobody is pretending that this is scientific research but I did want to reach out to all of you because I Know that people your audience is reach out back to you and carry on\nPulled some tape from it let's just play a little bit of it here it is\nThat the Democrats are completely crews are used to be a Democrat or will not be going into the correct on there's going to go up all the good old ... it's like we don't charge against each other rather just rather sugar and Shuster missions really bad climate that we're in what I Know\nI I'm very dismayed with the choice of\nKicking party over morals or character and also I think it was really obvious from the proceedings that Kevin I wasn't fully truthful\nTo carry a you as you can hear you're getting people from all across the political spectrum but I understand that you were actually telling us what the comments aren't falling neatly along the usual partisan lines tell us a little bit more\nExactly right or in the show that you're playing the comments from my question to the audience was is what's going on with Brett Kavanaugh and the confirmation hearings motivating you as a vote or is it influencing the way you're thinking of\nSome very competitive races in Minnesota\nAnd I you know I can usually predict how the calls are going to come in what I Am seeing as people are highly engaged and it really knowledgeable about what was happening and they were calling with some unexpected things to say\nI mean you hear that one caller saying I'm disappointed that it's all about party you hear the other caller saying I usually vote democratic this has turned me off and I think that's pretty representative of the calls that I've been getting over the last couple", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "06"}
