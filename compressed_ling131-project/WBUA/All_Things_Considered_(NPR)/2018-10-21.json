going to return to a difficult and for some people and traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years ... says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd dumped Palmer is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr primary thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christie block the Ford testify about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that is what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth flash ah the things that she forgot wore the same things I for gosh you know so I Would say well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I sit in the article I committed a crime and I did\nYou know what you wrote it's hard to read and you know for some people it's gonna be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw\nLet me start by saying this was an unusual\nEvent for me because I never went to parties\nNever so I I don't even know why I went and I didn't know anybody all of a sudden a kids came upstairs and said hey\nGo outside and look through the basement window to about ten of us went out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out and so the kid went down\nAnd he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off many he he took her panties off\nAnd then he he pulled honest than any one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumps up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\n... you also write that you and other boys with the party started touching another young woman who was also passed\nOut on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes later a\nShe was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody wants touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her\nAnd they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed in shame they would have been told it's your fault\n[noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilty you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us as you said I wanted to tell this story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men talk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard people\nSay these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a\nQuote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't say I don't I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent on this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward in a talk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it\n[noise] how did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] [noise] well [laughter] let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rape part that I witnessed or they're not sell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that so this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's ... and how did you explain that to your voice [noise] well\nJust I was truthful with them and uh they were very receptive on their dad you know that can you know we we kinda can't do too much wrong in the in the eyes of our kids are they both told me that my two older boys they don't think would happen now\nAnd they said everybody at that window would have had their phones al videotaping it that's what they too but that\nDoesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they\nYeah I mean but in that sense that kid wouldn't have done it because you wouldn't have wanted to be on film\nYou know we feel ... you know what they would kind of alluding to\nWell how do you feel now that you've got an off your chest\nYou know [laughter] and I have mixed feelings I'll be honest there there are days when I regret it and then there are days that I'm Glad I did\nYou know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time some of it it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit that\nA lot of women ah said ah they were glad I did it they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a\nSalted who wrote\nTo me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good\nMoving and one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of that I could quote but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder what happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening what would you what would you say\nThe only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help uh you know a few women had called me a he will they knew I wasn't I Would have been he will if either help these women than that I didn't do it down ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years have been many disturbing stories involving male athletes and the women in their lives so it may be hard to remember just how shocking it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine when Carolina Panthers wide receiver rake Ruth was charged with orchestrating the murder of his pregnant girlfriend she Rick Adam's\nAdam's [laughter]\nCareer was acquitted of first degree murder and that supported the death penalty but he was convicted of planning the murder carried out by hit man\nShe was able to deliver the child named chance or but she died weeks later could Ruth was sentenced to more than two dozen years in prison but with time served he's scheduled to be released tomorrow from Sampson correctional institution in Clinton North Carolina\nScott Fowler has been covering the story for nearly two decades or the Charlotte Observer and he's just released a seven part report in a pod cast about Ruth the murder and the aftermath it's called careers and it's got Fowler is with us now from Charlotte Scott thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you so much for having me on the show really appreciate it\nThat's my understanding that you you never talked with him after the the murder but he authorized his attorney to speak with you it's my understanding from your reporting that to this day he's still denies that he was planning a murder\nHe says it was a drug deal gone wrong in essence he says that he was a coward not a killer that he thought that van ... trying to kill him\nAnd he left the scene but that he didn't do anything about is that about right\nYes van Brett Watkins was the hit man that proof hired to commit the murder or you know drive by shootings sort of situation\nAnd the Harvard arts music with animal shape vessels from the ancient world
