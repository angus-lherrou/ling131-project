forward at this point it also had an reach out to a third woman who came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh that's Julie sweat Nick\nUh and then there are number of possible witnesses who could have information about the various a legit events in question when of course is Kevin us read mark judge we talked a lot about him judge has said he'll cooperate with the FBI or

he's a history professor at North Carolina state now\nAnd his comments don't relate to allegations of sexual misconduct but really about how much Kevin I drank and what led you didn't says is that he frequently drank with Kavanaugh when they were at Yale us as Kevin I was a belligerent and aggressive drunk\nA but at the same point in time the White House has put out statements from two college friends who say Kevin did not behave that way they don't match or those allegations don't match the cabinet that they knew a it's important for Democrats um to talk about Kevin most truthfulness about
