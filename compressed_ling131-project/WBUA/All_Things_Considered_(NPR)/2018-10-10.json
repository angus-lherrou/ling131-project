MPs fuzzy sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship in that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now or they've met with each other in a number of occasions and there was a personal bond there that is translating into policy\nThat's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal who show key chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court has given abortion rights opponents an opportunity that they have long hope for the weekend or overturn roe v Wade that's the Nineteen Seventy three decision that legalized abortion nationwide\nMeanwhile Planned Parenthood is announcing a new strategy to protect abortion rights NPR's Sarah McCammon reports\nThe Supreme Court can't just get up one morning and overturn roe v Wade the justices would first have to take out the case that would give them a chance to reconsider that landmark decision but abortion rights opponents hope that will happen soon ...

expand Medicare to cover all Americans in an op ed published today in USA Today Trump says the Democrats' plan would hurt seniors he made a similar claim last night at a campaign rally in Iowa\nA majority of Democrats have already signed up for his socialist healthcare plan that would of blood or right Medicare and eliminate Medicare Advantage for twenty million seniors\nAlright fact checkers have challenged the president's planes and one of those factors is our very own Scott Horsley who joins us now to set the record straight have got good to be with us so we are just weeks away from the new terms now Democrats are talking a lot out healthcare to both sides are clearly focusing on this issue now they\nAre also you know health care is an emotional issue it taps into people's fears and vulnerabilities it also taps into our pocketbooks in a big way so it has long been a potent issue for mobilizing voters especially older voters who are more likely to show up at the polling place\nIn the past Republicans have campaigned against Obamacare this year Democrats think it's their turn their campaigning against GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare\nFully half the Democrats' campaign ads had been devoted to this issue Here's Senate democratic leader Chuck Schumer\nThere is one issue above any other that is going to find the results in the November sixth election and that in health care\nAnd President Trump is apparently also sensing the political power of that argument so he's mowing a counter offensive with this critique of Medicare for all\nSo why does come saying about that program in particular this this idea basically letting everyone get Medicare instead of having to pay for private insurance\nThe first thing the president says in his USA Today column is that it would carry an astonishing price tag thirty two point six trillion dollars over a decade and that sounds like a lot of money as it is but what the president leaves out is important context which is that our current healthcare system\nIs on track to pay even more than we already have the costly as health care system in the world and if you count tax breaks for the insurance that workers get on the job\nThe federal government already thoughts about two thirds of the total bill but we're not getting any of the efficiencies or the buying power that would come from replacing private insurance with a single payer system\nAnd how does the president explain why shifting to a single payer regime would hurt senior citizens\nHe argues that Medicare for all would lead to rationing that doctors and hospitals will be put out of business that seniors would lose control of their healthcare\nBut he offers no evidence for those claims he he really seems to just be a playing on generational fears that any effort to boost health security for younger Americans has to come at the expense of their senior ...\nOkay that realistically what are the prospects ultimately for Medicare for all\nEven if Democrats win in November they're not going to have the power to pass Medicare for all over the president's certain veto Anna like Obamacare an GOP plans to replace Obamacare Medicare for all might not look so shiny and bright when you actually\nBut if we're going to have that debate Elsa it's probably useful to do so with facts not fear and unfortunately the president's op ed column today doesn't really contribute to that\nFinally the president has repeatedly said that he had kept his promise to protect people with pre existing conditions is that true\nHe has made that promise repeatedly but in fact he and his fellow Republicans have tried to unwind the protections in Obamacare\nAnd they proposed replacing them with unspecified state level guarantees the insurance industry has warned that could destabilize the market create a patchwork of state regulations and raise prices for older sicker Americans\nThat NPR fact checkers Scott Horsley think he's got You're welcome [noise]\nParts of the Carolinas are still trying to assess the damage from last month's Hurricane Florence\nAnd now here comes Michael the storm slammed into the Florida Panhandle today with gusts of a hundred and fifty five miles per hour by the time Michael reaches the Carolinas tomorrow it is expected to be downgraded to a tropical storm\nAs NPR's Tom Gjelten reports from Wilmington North Carolina at some of the problems are hurricane can bring only emerged weeks after the storm has passed\nThe market north apartment complex in Wilmington U Haul trucks lined the streets the apartment buildings here survived the storm and tax but the power was out for many days during heavy rain and the units were damaged by mold the roughly five hundred residents are being told to have to vacate Florida\nWithout yeah where to go to\nGary Moore and his girlfriend are hauling furniture out more says they'll put it all in storage he was planning to move in with his mother but he just found out her apartment has been temporarily condemned as well\nFEMA representatives are on the ground here and you can give to displace tenants some rent money to get them started but they can't find new housing for them the apartment owners giving each tenant a thousand dollars in cash but Moore says that won't go far\n... and they know they love to go to a game of the month of able to do it at all like\nUnison rather a\nMars girlfriends terrorists who king sits in a chair by the front door her head in her hands\nI'm stressed out [noise]\nThe red cross years has about seven hundred and fifty people in Wilmington need shelter now not counting those living with friends or relatives churches that provided shelter want their facilities back\nSchools that sheltered people are reopening so the housing problem here is actually getting worse not better\nSame with the economic situation some problems show up only after business owners assess the damage employees can be caught unprepared like Tony Witherspoon she worked at a gourmet markets in downtown Wilmington\nWe closed during a hurricane we actually opened\nBack up to date for the public after the hurricane ...\nWe received a letter that they were going to be temporarily seething operation\nSo it looked like a promising situation suddenly turned oblique\nThey didn't give us a date that they may possibly be opening and they kind of gave us a very short notice three days\nGabriel Robinson who worked in a pub in downtown Wilmington had a similar experience after the hurricane damage to his business I came in for a few days\nTo help with the cleanup process but other than that I have no idea about the work environment or what's going to happen with the\nNative business owner was available for comment this day Robinson has come to the offices of stepped up Wilmington a nonprofit that helps disadvantaged people find new employment step of Wilmington workload has doubled since the hurricane challenges like the one Robinson faces are not uncommon\nIt leaves me in a position where I don't know if I'm unemployed I don't know when my next paycheck coming\nSmall businesses are especially vulnerable to something like a hurricane Gary Coleman who directs the small business center at Cape Fear community college here says unless the business has insurance a disaster can wipe it out\nIf you don't have the insurance you don't have a hard time recovering 'cause you've lost that you know three or four weeks of income\nYour employees are likely to have become displaced me can't get them back [noise] so it delays your ability to open up your store or restaurant or or your business\nFEMA famously estimates as many as forty percent of small businesses will fail in the aftermath of a disaster like the one that hit North Carolina\nCommunity leaders here hoped to disapprove that production but it's too soon to tell whether it's with the economy or housing some injury becomes apparent only as time goes by Tom
