S. throughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different this is about couples that live outside of the United states that did not have an ogre filled situation\nYou know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who has a great representative for the United nations or another international organizations\nTo come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say this\nThe other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa so it creates a hardship in so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get these are the only way they would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow figure out how to get married in another country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat is James Wiley Bruce ... he was ambassador to the Dominican Republic from two thousand Thirteen to two thousand Seventeen\nHe's currently a principal at

considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin police violence and misconduct in the news again after former Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was convicted of multiple charges late last week in connection with the killing of a teenager outlook on McDonald\nBut recent events have also brought the issue of violence against police to the spotlight also last week seven police officers were shot in Florence South Carolina as they tried to issue a search warrant one of the officers currents carry weight died a week earlier to Mississippi police officers were killed during a shootout with a suspect\nThe violent crime has fallen over the last few decades but according to the FBI killings of police officers is up slightly over the past year\nAnd policing remains one of his country's most dangerous jobs we wanted to hear more about this so we've contacted Maria haven't felt she is a professor police science at John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you for having me yeah what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there's been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nI from my perspective it's certainly what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know yes when when you say twice\n... percent but then when you look at the\nNumber we're talking about four to something off his says versus said this\nOn the office of so from my perspective it's fairly well Dr they'll send the winds of police officers were killed in the line of duty you know we don't know exactly what Dr phil fan there and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some trends that we as saying that it's dangerous and disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents um but today it's not the case if you look at the most recent years we're looking more at the embassy is a police officer in meditation\nAnd we're looking at an investigative activity um whereas I handling and know persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and ... no longer be\nThe most frequent reasons I'm for this\nI mean you're saying that they're premeditated by what kind of of act doors as it as it were\nNot people who see police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out to oppress the police are biased racist and and um with Senate things the last few years\nIn general how the climate on in the last few years is that on that believes in the United states [noise] so when when you put the two together and the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness plus the triggering event\nThen you have the the cuts us off it out come so somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of the Supreme Court you think police officers wishing that the demonstrators so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them as part of this ... this thought that the governments that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because it kind of take your anger out to get on a given police station instead you you're doing it against the Soviet preventative of the government was a police us\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens and the cases of police officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise\nOr their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with the\n... when we're looking both on the investigative enforcement um deaths and the ones that are part of the ... the activity if he says definitely entertaining each shoe office so frequently\nA seat in the car and a police car and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that ah\nIt's always a reasonable thing to do given the as particular environment given us that and political development that might be putting their lives and then ... so\nThis is a technical issue is how you approach in the past and how he quotes a house\nOr well you know that it's a ... who is armed and dangerous to me that we have Eighteen thousand police agencies and when you have Eighteen thousand police agencies you cannot Institute standards for recruitment stand up for training which would certainly help us\nMitigate the negative perception of of policing the profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there was also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable that nine officers in one year are killed in that line of duty as an outcome of premeditated took to because it was directed against them explicitly another democratic society should\nAccept a nine police officers in one year in separate incidents killed by members of the top ... can accept\nThat is Maria haven't felt she is a professor in the department of law police
