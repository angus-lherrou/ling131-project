you think this year has attracted a record number of algae be two people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that as we get broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican\nAre states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nThis is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an allergy to be the woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people are going to carry I water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name of ... it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games\nAt the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our\nPrimary ballots that would've uh regulated we're trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities

that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I got you know some wonderful fellow than interns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time\nUm but it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you ... and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan\nPaved the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nAnd it's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my eggs inside\n[laughter] and I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana and just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put a solid a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae be two key writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do you think that in the Trump era is more challenging to gain Republican than it was ...\nIs the first president to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans he's\nAsked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman and especially trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae keep candidates as well do you know\nYeah I mean I can tell you uh do you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how do you what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what Amelia discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive\nSo I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure Gina in the mail you do as well to those young people that are following behind us [noise]\nI Want to thank all three of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and the million mark ... is running for state legislature in Montana\nIt was great talking with all of your pleasure pleasure to speak with all of us [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News listeners have the chance to attend to open meetings of WB whereas executive advisory council the next meeting will be held Monday morning October twenty second at eight thirty\nFor more information call six one seven three five three one one nine seven or email us at GM at W.

quiet\nRegardless at how Americans feel about the appointed ... provisions that are very popular once it became clear that those visions are in trouble I think that has sort of changed the landscape of how politicians will talk about it that cycle\nDemocrats are determined to protect those popular provisions if they win one or both houses of Congress in November on the other hand if Republicans keep control they could take another run at repealing Obamacare\nVice president Jessica Anderson of the conservative group heritage action says that could happen during the lame duck session even

suggested rogue killers might be to blame\nTo understand how autocratic countries like Saudi Arabia interpret these remarks we called up tomorrow Kaufman with us she served at the state department under President Obama and is now with Brookings she says Trump is following through on a position he took more than a year ago\nOn his first foreign trip when he went to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia he said explicitly we're not here to lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do who to be or how to worship\nAnd that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitments as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights law\nBeyond Saudi Arabia or do you see a link between President Trump's America First transaction based approach to international affairs and the actions of dictators overseas\nI think if I were a dictator especially one with a decent relationship with Washington a cooperative partnership with

during the Obama administration where the president's condemn the actions of foreign leaders whether that was ... in Russia or Bashar will also in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so is it really possible to say that this is happening more because President Trump is in office\nI think they're both direct and indirect ways in which President Trump's blondes a attitude about human rights

lesser violations of prison rules\nNPR's investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week today NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's the sound we associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel doors shut\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it there are no more heavy steel doors for the women and that's not a somebody here\nBecause this prison is new and it's different inside the razor wire this place looks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nThey set out here from John and helped us depending on what level there and that's the warning shows on showing us around and do what we do that and the community is when I was fired for outside and our yard went in ... and I guess\nIt's still a prison the warned as the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places\nAre specially harsh because across the country women get disciplined at higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rolls they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch what NPR in middle school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's and men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction can have big consequences\nWomen get time at it to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges that matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children each you know younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today it could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had a copy stain may have ... um\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen aren't data found women at this prison compared to ... other prisons were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive now dom tells her corrections officers that came out fewer tickets for breaking the rule the prisoner can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signal a gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just women want to have some control over how they look at how they present themselves\nNominate putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different has the person they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent and that women do better when prison is less punitive\nSo Thomas changing the rules especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more into demand compliance\nLast [noise] tell me that if that were there\n[laughter]\nOn the mental health ward Stacey runners in charge of Bella a therapy dog a towering great Dane with a slate gray coat wonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nIt was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you get it felt like everything was [noise]\nIt's just meant to be punished\nOnce she was sick and stayed in her cell through breakfast nothing prisoner brought up and down up from the dining hall and put the fire pillow so to sleep when this crime happened [laughter]\n... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item [noise] yeah that was pretty rough that\nWouldn't be a violation today but back then wonder says she lost good conduct credits those are days taken off her sentence for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary\nWonder is serving time for a second degree murder now she says the changing the way women are treated here hoped to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nHave tried to contribute as much as I said it's institution so I'm not a shame you know and it helped me with my own my own shame them I don't regret\nThe psychiatric unit and the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with ... therapy animals\nThere are large TD Garden and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now Dr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show is around\nTwo cells there for so here and then\nHe runs health services for all of our prisons several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chain for months at a time in a basement sold his property victims is the panic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison have long histories of being victims of violence too but research in general response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on show dump the warden\nMainly the correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker it's a customer service\nSome presidents that welcome the change in discipline policies others say there are bigger problems here like not having\nWell one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained that the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison the warden has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she wrote for which some concerns and what she said is you know ordinary sounds people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there is one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get the Ninety six cannot caused problems\nDom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down [noise]\nAnd it's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago\nThere are ... sells a guard would watch separated from a station above when women with mental illness lived here they would often yell into the night this is what prison cells today across the country you really look like for women or men\nYou dehumanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into that realm that\nStrip them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nBack back to white giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for a lesser infractions often lead the ending up in a cell block like this one Joseph Shapiro NPR News\nLaura how

in shaping U.S foreign policy including for Saudi Arabia Ayesha hello so what can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with my ...\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person since Trump took office\nTheir first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both both in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convinced Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first\nForeign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to Canada or Mexico first\nUh and he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and be on many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so it was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this\nBut President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that\nContinued as president and so a big part of Christmas portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared knock I

Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations and a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nSo now with this controversy where the White House is getting daily questions about it and the secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where do things stand today with Christian or on the ground for us\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion there was one of the White House official who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a\nAfter ... show gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials oppressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a with right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience\nThat it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett Berlin who was a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel\nTo Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security\nChain and then there's the question of financial ties between the cushion her family Trump and the Saudis\nAnd a lot of that is not clear because we don't have\nA President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear and some of these dealings are are not transparent but we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars in apartments from him and there have been reports\nAre that Kushner a Christian or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying

going to go to the substance of these talks today in a minute but start with the optics they are tricky I mentioned friendly handshakes and smiles meanwhile the agenda is to to discuss an alleged murder murder plot by the Saudis\nYeah it was kind of striking because you know in the face of it it looks like it's very typical visit by a secretary of state going to see the king in his palace a brief stop\nAt the foreign ministry um and a lot of time with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman who's this young very powerful figure here we're told that the conversations have been\nDirecting

about the substance what did they say to each other and these direct and candid talks well they've the U.S officials have said very little about that I mean they say that Trump sent Palmdale here to convey the message that it's really important for the Saudis to conduct a thorough transparent investigation\nInto the disappearance of this Washington Post columnist\nUm U.S officials haven't weighed in about all of these reports\nIn the news that the Saudis are now portraying this is like an interrogation gone horribly wrong we don't know exactly how the Saudis have been spending this with ... in

being with us pleasure to be here\nWill you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae to people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that as we get broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican\nOr states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run Amelia ... what do you think\nThis is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at the table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an allergy to be the woman being a first generation American being a veteran and I think you know in in so many of those identities\nI think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going

I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got you know some wonderful fellow than and turned on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so and so little time\nUm but it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nI Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan paved the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into posts\nLooked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age inside a [laughter] I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do you feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been made altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put a solid a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then and how we've made gradual progress over the

President Trump is the first president to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans he's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's\nEasy to look at one or two incidents to say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties folks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again we're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B.
