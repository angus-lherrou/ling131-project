S. A. official explained the financial angle to a house hearing in twenty Thirteen\nWe believe the Pennsylvania avenues site has considered her potential for higher and better use them as a headquarters of the federal agency we hope to unlock that hidden value and apply it to the creation of a new facility\nIn fact Donald Trump before he was president showed an interest in developing the old FBI side but by twenty sixteen he was about to cut the ribbon at the current hotel he bragged about it on the campaign trail theories in Fairfield, Connecticut\nWith very very complex super luxury hotels good old boy a lot of people\nIt's almost finish as more\nAnd last winter Trump stopped the FBI's move it happened in the White House meeting with officials from the FBI and gee I say the new plan is to rebuild the old headquarters although it means moving thousands of workers elsewhere\nThis spring GST administrator Emily Murphy told a house committee Trump had nothing to do with the decision to rebuild the the direction that we got came from the FBI was the FBI detracting she has asked what's requirements of gay but the emails released today suggest something else\nOne G essay official referred to the project as quote a demolition new construction per the president's instructions\nAnother referred to it as quote what ... is directed everyone to do\nJury ... a democratic congressman from just across the Potomac in Virginia he said that redevelopment could land a competitor across the street from Trump's hotel\nA number of us thought the president had to have something to do with this pressure on it\nYork Times that quote the president wanted to save the government money and also the FBI leadership did not want to move its headquarters Kathleen Clark is a law professor at

help minorities get transportation industry contracts\nTaylor according to the Seattle Times began describing himself as multi racial after taking a consumer ancestry test\nThe test indicated Taylor had four percent sub Saharan African ancestry and six percent indigenous American he says that's enough for him to qualify as minority so what is a minority then\nThe question really you're asking is does the DNA test tell him what his identity as or tell any of us with our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times knows instead DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups or individuals are defined by themselves and how others perceive them\nNielsen says home DNA tests or find something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't design them for that\nYou know the sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right I'm there also a profit making entity\nAnd she hopes the courts will be able to tell the difference so programs designed to level the playing field for people who have historically been shut out of these opportunities can continue to do that\nI Would hope that uh the court is able to take seriously and the fact that these sorts of programs were meant to start at the counterpoint to
