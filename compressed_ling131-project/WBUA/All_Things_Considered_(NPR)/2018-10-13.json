Trump\nI just want to congratulate you because you of yellow\nAnd to talk more about how has released came about and what this means for the U.S turkey relationship we're joined now by NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate them hey can you start by describing the scene in the oval office this afternoon\nYet so you had President Trump seated in the middle of next to him a was a pastor Brunson and his family on the other side there were senators and members of Congress and secretary of state Mike Pompeo all who had worked to secure\nFor instance release at one point Brunson said that he wanted to pray for President Trump and he got down on his knees\nLatest hands on the president\nAnd prayed that that President Trump be given supernatural wisdom will what led up to this whole moment yet so pastor Brunson was arrested more than two years ago as part of a round up following a coup attempt on Turkish president\nRegimen type air to one uh he'd been accused of espionage and aiding terrorists which the pastor denies to this day of course\nUm there was a lot of lobbying from President Trump from all those members of Congress the state department and especially vice president Mike Pence worked a lot on this case um Brunson was moved in July to house arrest\nThen that wasn't enough President Trump was not happy about it and in August he imposed sanctions on turkey to try to force the release a Bronx and um that released came on friday a and he arrived at joint base Andrews earlier today\nDoes this mean anything for the relationship between the U.S and turkey\nYou know these are two countries that are part of NATO I'm there has seemed to be a pretty good report between President Trump and president air to one uh though Trump set it on a number of occasions that this situation with pastor Brunson was hurting their relationship I'm\nIn the oval office today and also on Twitter President Trump insisted that there was no deal involved here are insecure and grandsons release a but he did say that it would likely improve the relationship between the two nations you know it comes at a time when the U.S and turkey\nAre trying to figure out how to navigate the disappearance and suspected murder of journalists from all the show he\nUm he wrote for the Washington Post and was last seen walking into the Saudi consulate in his stumble up almost two weeks ago\nAnd we're going to talk more about that later in the program but first what are the domestic political implications of the brands and release\nPastor Brunson case was really important to evangelical Christians who took a keen interest in securing his release\nA and evangelicals are a key part of President Trump's base and one other thing about this that stands out is that President Trump has really put a priority on freeing Americans who are held overseas it's an aspect of international relations that he's put a real emphasis on\nI don't\nSupport for NPR comes from this station

grabbing headlines and the tight race for governor their Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running against Stacey Abrams a Democrat who is elected could become the state's first black female governor\nActivists they're suing cans because about fifty three thousand voter registration applications has been put on hold the majority of those applications belonged to black residents we wanted to learn more about this uh we call that mark nice he he's a government reporter for the Atlanta Journal constitution mark welcome to the program thanks for having me\nAll right so why were these voter applications put on hold\nGeorgia passed a law last year that's known as the exact max law and if your name or voter registration information doesn't exactly match or pretty closely exactly match your driver's license or Social Security information your voter registration won't be\nCompleted until you verify that you are who you say you are and this delays these potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia\nWhere did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to\nUm put voters on pending list until they could be ... come fully registered and then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law that resulted in a settlement in February of last\nWith the state the Georgia legislature passed it into state law and so now we're in round two where the civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp\nAgain but this time they're suing over something that's already passed into law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way of federal court upheld the law\nAnd activists are saying that this lies disproportionately affecting minority voters how have they made that case you\nWell it is true um if you look at the list of these fifty three thousand pending voters Seventy percent of them are African American if you add in other minority groups in particular which he knows and Asians you get up to about eighty percent minorities that are pending\nBrain chance running for governor he's also the sitting secretary of state whose office overseas the voting system does she have a history of getting involved with this kind of issue\nIt depends which side you talk to um be his opponents say that Brian ... is\nPart of this process that secretary of state he's in charge of elections and we have seen precincts close we have seen that there are these floaters on pending lists\nAnd we have seen Georgia passed a photo ID law before you can vote however in Georgia the way our elections work as the secretary of state while he is responsible for overseeing ...\nElections and enforcing state laws regarding the elections most of election processes are local decisions and so secretary of state Brian Kemp says look I'm doing everything I can to make it easy to vote and follow Georgia's law\nAnd in fact this week we reported that Georgia has a record number of registered voters six point nine million including well over two hundred thousand new voters just in the may primary election\nWhat's the mood in Georgia right now so close to the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this particular case is motivating Democrats who feel that Republicans are cracking down on\nVoting rights and Republicans are saying that it's a manufactured controversy with I Believe the words that Brian Kemp use\nThat with my ... of the Atlanta Journal constitution mark thanks so much\nFor thank thank you\nNow it's time for the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds and today we're going to talk about a couple of celebrities who got political this week\nYou know I Love your love everyone right but the calf\nMaking these other guys they didn't get my dad all the time like\nThat way it was something about\nOff and they feel like Superman\nYou probably heard those comments from Kanye West in the oval office\nAnd the firestorm of reaction after but it wasn't the only celebrity catching heat this week\nTaylor Swift was to for her Instagram endorsement of two Democrats running for office in Tennessee her home state and we got a few people joining us to talk about this\nTest is Stewart is a politics reporter at Rolling Stone she's in Hudson New York Julie a craven the have posted on the line from Washington D. C. and last but not least Rodney Carmichael from NPR Music is joining us via Skype from Atlanta [noise] habit that he\nWas ... and he has a gun right now I'm going to start with you because I Know at some point you were\nA big ... fan maybe you still are um and we know he's always been provocative he's always been unpredictable but this was on another level and it was in the oval office what was your reaction to what went down on Thursday\nIt was so surreal is like um denouncing fan from get out or something I don't know I was saying once upon a time you noticed downward spiral we're going to have been happening for a couple of years so what happened this week especially after the past year was not that much of a surprise\nBut as easy as it is to kind of laugh about it and imagine it as some kind of entertaining thing I think we've got to take this seriously I think it's really dangerous\nThe kind of ... that he is now and I feel like in a lot of ways he is a reflection of Trump as a candidate in twenty ... thing and it was really easy to laugh about 'em into election night you know\n... ... what do you think I mean is now the time to be taking ... seriously\nIf you haven't been taking ... seriously you should start taking him seriously now um I agree with everything right and he just said this is not performing\nHe's not doing this to sell albums it's\nVery clear at least to me that this is how he feels he\nEven said that racism wasn't a deal breaker for him and as a former ... myself that's really sad coming from the guy who said that George Bush doesn't care about black people after the fallout from Hurricane Katrina so I completely agree with Rodney we need to take this seriously this is a man who has reached\nYes fans his fans follow him they're influenced by him and he is supporting a president that is arguably just blatantly races\nBecause I'm going to throw this next question to you Taylor Swift also got some heated reaction to her backing to Democrats in Tennessee for people who haven't heard tests that can you can you tell us what happened what she did on Sunday night she posted a photograph of herself Instagram and and the caption\nShe talked about the fact that she was coming out for the first time\nAnd vocalizing her political beliefs she endorsed two candidates in Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen who is a candidate for the Senate he's the former governor of Tennessee\nAnd Jim Cooper who's a sitting congressman up for re election in November but the main thrust of her Instagram post was about why she's not voting for Marsha Blackburn who's a female candidate in the race she said she likes to support women who are running for office\nBut she couldn't support Marsha Blackburn because a lot of the policies that black and has supported in Congress\nUm she said they're not hurt Tennessee values\nAnd high profile Republicans were not happy with her right Mike Huckabee tweeted something about her fans being too young to vote so oh well so what but I mean there was a lot of like negative reaction from high profile Republicans there wasn't negative reactions but it wasn't\nAs strong as for instance Trump has been to criticism in the past he said I liked Taylor's music twenty five percent less now um which is really like not that damning of a of a combination\nAnd Mike Huckabee said you know she's entitled to her political beliefs but it's not going to matter unless Thirteen year old girls are voting in which was very dismissive of um Taylor's reach which is a lot broader than just Thirteen year old girls at this point\nBut what about her ... her fans who are Republicans just regular fans not high profile\nLearn what the sun can do for you at some bugs solar dot com\nAnd historic New England enjoy autumn in New England with

what having sex as well but you'll remember from the reading what white males scold ... they were called ...\nThat they're Jones she's the Tony Award winning playwright and started the show sell by

E. u.s oh my God are they go candies in my purse\nAnd Sarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program\nThank you for having me and us we are moving out of here [laughter]\nI Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most\nWith all of these characters have some element of me in that weather I'd like to admit that or not there's a ...\nYou know there's a a man who's objectify women who is a former cop who admits to using you know prosecuted women or as he said never on the clock though you know never ... actually on the clock but yeah and\nYou know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's object to find when I have to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worst in value are determined by my parents and my marketability\nI'm kind of engaging in one form of this same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places and in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in Kew NA or with social media\nAnd I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags you know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have these wild on this side and\nYou know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... to serve Bryn Mawr but who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what did it look like to trade on my appearance and\nBeing a woman in a context that was obviously just as sex as as the rest of the culture but in hip hop\nThere was definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well\nSo looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who\nNegotiating their relationship to sex and power in a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show\nTo talk about these characters that human body whether they say to you oh my gosh it's only saw myself in that person or whether they say to you maybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accident which is my accent which was my real accent [noise]\nCan you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nYeah I Would say for whatever reason the gods goddesses and trends gods of the theater and of accent and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my of these characters as just having an accent you\nKnow there's a woman in the show she's from Dominican Republic ... what are we can have the money and all proud and it's very important to me that people understand that I\nHave a direct connection to them and the republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with our accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself because actually there's no indignities of having accented English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide them my name is probably more so individual ... went to the United nations schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places one for so long but then when she came to India she was kind of walking off some of ...\n... the different places are that are lots of conversations about sex ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and he said but he bought cracking good job\nOr she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite a bit so you know I really try to ... my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says\nI feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this all say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with ... with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture I come from a mixed upbringing experience my family was black and white I'm On my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family\nAs a my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interface skilled [laughter] but you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with the cost\nAnd to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what what is it which is that you talk white you busy that now I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much thank you ... it's my pleasure our pleasure\nAnd finally today we're going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called codes which is all about race and identity in America and in our most recent episode we talked about adoption specifically trans racial adoption\nMost adoptive parents in the U. S. are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't as according to the Institute on family studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know how did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of self and here's what you told us\nHe spent the first twelve years of my life thinking that I was a little white girl and when I found out that it wasn't it wasn't just revelation it was an identity crisis\nSo really I think it's kind of a lack of identity that ties transnational adopt these together\nThe narrative about my adoption was really centered around my mom being a savior\nMy language my mannerisms my experiences are all informed by the white family I grew up with\nYou told us you feel alone and want to know if there are other people like you out there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "13"}
