know I Can't really say it's a surprise ever since he was indicted in June it seemed as if things were moving in the direction of a plea deal\nProsecutors had copies of his electronic messages with

point of saying it wants to crack down on leaks and on leakers does this case represent that in fact happening on are they doing more beyond this case\nYou know this effort is a little ironic because

university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica ... found that women are punished disproportionately for minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states in all but two women give this window higher rates than men which most striking is that women get punished for more for minor violations of prison rules at rates we estimated often two to three times higher for what prisons classified as smaller infractions\nPetty stuff you can get written up for a not closing your doors you get written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just fix your room up nice in just takes inflating die you appeal the case you get written up for that\nThat Victoria Williams and it made up the central California women's facility charge short of California you get\nWritten up for going out of bounds in somebody else's room are out of bounds in the hallway is just basically everything you get written up for\nShow that new California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying an order and more than twice as many for what's called disrespect in Vermont Weibo women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments\nIn Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets were just ...\nConsequences women ... good conduct credits the kind of time at it to their stay in prison or lose phoning visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement for disobedience\n[noise] prisons were built for men and the rules for discipline were set up to control those man the and ... says those rules don't work very well with women\nYou walk through a women's prison and it's a profoundly different experience we\nMet Benno sunny day she was visiting Logan Correctional Center a women's prison Illinois several years ago this was a top official in the Illinois department of corrections now she works with prisons as a consultant she helps them address that problem of why women in prison get discipline more\nWomen are more can you ... when you walk to a prison they are more emotional they want to talk to you they want to talk about their children don't want to talk about their experiences\nTwo years ago they notice helped conduct an audit of that women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were just went almost twice as often as men for all offenses big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor influence\nAnd they also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix the problem\n... told us she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say they hate it\nAnd the first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women push back that's where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in\nTo women we met in Illinois told us they'd been written up some years ago for an infraction called reckless I bowling\nWhile women get more tickets than men certain women get the most tickets of all women with mental illness those who are lesbian bisexual or transgender African American women especially for those lesser non violent offenses\nLike Christian or a guard out because they say it's not that to me that I like or yeah stuff like that\nTitanic Williams was Nineteen

lost privileges\nOne time she says she got in trouble for cursing at a guard when her soul mate who had diabetes passed now we've solved the officer was too slow to help\nWilliams says the hardest thing was when she lost her phone privileges and she couldn't call her son he was a baby when she went to prison and he was growing up without her\nIt was sad because I miss the we're right on this one who ...\nHe's nine now but ... Williams says that time separated often not even able to talk to them on the phone makes it hard to be a parent now\nEven today they are or what the consequences are and they said our ... year on this it is hard right now 'cause I didn't know other than my family all back door and my family our family life could encourage you guys are\nMore than half of women in prison or the mothers of children under the age of Eighteen one common punishment that Illinois prison was that women last good conduct credits in one year alone twenty Fifteen women most Ninety three years of those credits that's twenty extra days or prison time for each woman\nThat's an average many women had no days at it but some ended up with months even a year or more of extra time\nThe small number of states including Illinois or trying to change this they're praying was called gender response of corrections practices it's built around the idea that women are in prison for different reasons than men that they respond differently in prison\nAnd that prison rules need to recognize those differences in the last ...\nGot in trouble and found out that he had no phone\nHave that prison in Illinois the trainer at the front of a classroom hell's corrections officers to think through the different pressures in a woman's life and\nShe needs to see what's going on with their son she just found out he asked\nMe how to deal with this\nPhone privileges revoked all she can do is write a letter home or to her son school it's a reminder to the corrections officers that tickets even ones\nOfficers that that training they didn't want to give their names they set the agenda response of approach makes sense to them but that many of their co workers are much more skeptical\nI was I heard a lot of things but which has been\nWorthless we're going to work as a hobby though he\nHugged a thug massive derogatory way of saying letting the inmates run the prison we wrote letters to some of the women that that Illinois prison\nOne woman who wrote back said that since the training started she's not seen much difference she said corrections officers both the men and the women are disrespectful and cruel and this is a quote the run a power trip they cause bitches hose they tried to provoke you if\nYou see anything back they send you the segregation for threats and intimidation\nThe number of women in prison is rising but still they're only about seven percent of the prison population nationwide so it's hard to get a prison officials to make their problems are priority like the heavy punishment of women for those lesser violations of prison rules Joseph Shapiro NPR News\n[noise] [noise]\nTomorrow we had to Iowa State that's made a real commitment changing discipline for winning prisoners this is NPR News listeners had the chance you can't open meetings that deli be ... account for the next open meetings going to be Monday morning October twenty second at eight thirty\nFor more information ... six one seven three five three one one nine seven or you can email us at GM at W.

Elizabeth Warren has released the results of a DNA test that says there is quote\nStrong evidence she has Native American ancestry dating back six to ten generations this was an attempt to quiet a controversy that has dogged Warren for years\nAnd it comes as a Massachusetts Democrat moles a run for president in twenty twenty NPR's Asma Khalid is on the story and she is in the studio now either hey [noise]\nStart with exactly what did Elizabeth Warren released today\nShoot she released the results of a DNA Analysis conducted by to Stanford University researcher his name is Carlos was to mind day and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry\nBut he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestry\n... you know in addition to this DNA Analysis warning also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking heart mocking her claims of Native American ancestry and sending yet from her family history she had this one scene in particular where she called the ... the DNA researcher and puts him on the line\nYou did five five segments with Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less than one of 'em\nNow the president like to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts of what we have a Native American ancestry your bedroom [noise]\nSo you you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history it's it's a history that she says has been passed down for generations\nCan also here at least who one of members of the intended audience video is the president himself a lady responded to all that he\nHad and no one really need it but kind of a point that he had to respond to she tweeted at him about a promise that he made a sort of daycare at a rally this summer he suggested that if he were debate to debate hurting twenty twenty he would give her one of these take home DNA kits and then he said\nI won't give you a million dollars for your favorite charity\nFor trouble if you take the test of the shows your your [noise]\n\n[noise]\nSo merely this morning we're in the ass that he'd pay I Want the million dollars he or she wants this money to go she says to the national indigenous women's resource center that's at charity ever choice you know Trump was asked by reporters about this challenge he denies\nYou all heard we just heard or the late ... and the war went after him again on Twitter saying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with ah the aspirations we mentioned that she is I I run for president herself and twenty twenty\nI think that's a really realistic eyes at this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this is really about what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms\nAnd she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they had been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve\nAt that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her her past and you know President Trump of course had his taken to calling her Pocahontas so this is really an attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty twenty races going to kick off pretty much just in his mid term\nVery briefly has quieted all of those ...\n... no not at all I mean I just can tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test revealed only a miniscule percentage of Native American ancestry that still leaves a lot of unanswered question All right so that is NPR's political correspondent Asma Khalid thanks very much You're
