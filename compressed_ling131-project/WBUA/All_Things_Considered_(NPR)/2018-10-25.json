here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nOr can say with certainty that we will identify interested person or people responsible for these acts\nOkay and their national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson is here Hi Kerry hey Mary Louise so many moving parts that seems like today it catches up on where the investigation stands\nThe FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and sent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nMay include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor and prominent Trump critic Robert De Niro had received one of the packages at an address link to him in New York another common denominator is that these all our people that President Trump himself has called out in campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation\nAuthorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded\nA air had the potential to explode and ... are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA for insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI is assistant director William Sweeney says the powder and at least some of these aren't elopes does not\nAppear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives who was reviewed some images of these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people in intimidate them and did that with that\nHappening for political or personal reasons all of that is a big focus of this investigation or if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nInvestigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida\nRemember these packages had to return address in Florida specifically to the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz shelters not actually linked to these packages she didn't send them\nBut whoever did made her part of the story and there's another reason why authorities are focused on

chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee and we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you will merely we've already doing I Am All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nIs certainly troubling that we have created incentives in our immigration system I mean she was partly because we built a reward illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration\nI Want to get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so called caravan makes its way north\nAnd Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people that they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\n[noise] but I have nobody to call it a national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from Central America\nIs unaccompanied children and that was found me units incentivized by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get your our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interests of sorting fact from fiction ... a couple of questions to your knowledge senator are unknown middle Easterners part of this caravan and marching toward the U.S border\nI don't know about this caravan but I Know when I Tour de be building ... countries with them southern command General Kelly I heard a new term I'd never heard before SRAs special interest aliens when was that that were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen I'd never heard the term\nSpecial interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican open Central American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truth boy it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with\nTens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty times so I I\nI'm definitely a very fact based individual apps\nWho of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I felt I\nI Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nFact checking up a second claim with you as President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this current event might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats want caravan they liked the care of as a lot of people say I wonder what started the caravan\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change laws so we can MDs incentives I mean let's face it some of them there's Lucian is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people from this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from the ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan as a manufacturing controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison Rand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I've heard read news reports\n[laughter] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix that are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my proudest German homeland security most of these\nLaws aren't under my major's diction we've got it on my commute stirs diction because that is just sheer he was able to move forward and and working with my colleagues I got there agree with that I could start handling this so I'm trying to go through this\nAs a business person would a problem solver gather the information finding ... agreement in our community we you know we all agree once you're the border that we have to have\nLaws and then we don't separate families do try to go through the problem solving process very transparent very open very detailed and see if we just can't fix one aspect to this and that may be successful breed success\n[noise] sooner thanks so much for your time everyday Wisconsin Republican Ron Johnson we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin\nMany of the migrants now traveling north originated in Honduras and journeys like that happen every year but this group is far larger than most and its fuels competing narratives about how it was organized\nNPR's

Vasquez in their sister was seven kids between them stop to grab some free coffee and bread\nHands out by local residents in southern Mexico and they've been walking for days they heard about the

explosive devices and were sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump\nThe FBI is saying it can't rule out that there may be more suspicious packages moving through the mail now and this story has put the U.S postal service in the spotlight joining us to talk about that is NPR's Miles parks he's been looking into postal service policies walked into the city of miles either\nWe don't know anything yet about who delivered these packages what's known so far but how they were delivered\nSo the FBI and the federal investigation arm for the postal service both declined to comment when I asked that exact question a earlier today but we can sort of piece it together based on what we know about where the packages were actually intercepted\nAt this point we know that at least seven to ten packages were handled by the postal service or the packages address for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for instance were flags\nTo the packages addressed of Joe Biden were also found in postal facilities in Delaware obviously that's important because us PS had screening procedures specifically in place to try to catch incidents and dangerous items like\nThis when it comes to nail entering the U.S postal system what are those screening\nProcedures so it's really different based on a number of different factors you know the size of the package for instance maybe most importantly is who that package is going to if you want to send mail to the White House or to Capitol Hill or another major federal building for instance\nUh it's automatically going to go to a separate offsite screening facilities check for suspicious looking items so these suspicious items that we are talking about a period of ... up and sent using excessive stamps which is something experts say is one of the first kind of red flag items to look for during the screening process\nOr at the end of the day though the postal service does admit that they the because of the crazy volume that the that they deal with they can't screen every single item that enters the system so they have a system of best practices that they asked companies and even private citizens to use a when going through their own male\nAnd the reports are that these appear to be homemade pipe bombs it's not clear what kind of damage they could have cars can you give us some context like how um I guess random is this like how often are explosives mail\nYeah it's maybe not as rare as one would expect they that the U.S postal service says it's about sixteen averages out to about sixteen bombs per year ah which which might seem like a lot\nBut if you consider in the context of more than a hundred and fifty billion pieces of mail get processed by the postal service every year I\nKind of puts it into perspective a specifically when it comes to investigations um they open Nineteen investigations into\nA hazardous material that could be bombs that could be chemical weapons that were being I'm uh trying to be delivered it could even be hoax a bombs are hoax chemical weapons\nAs well and they were able to gain a twenty convictions in those investigations but mostly when it comes to the investigations were talking about a male staffed and mailing of narcotics or is a much higher percentage of what they're looking at\nOr they're going to be any policy changes as a result\nOr not at this point it it doesn't seem that way I'm obviously everyone involved in the postal service is going to be on much higher alert right now I talked with somebody at the American postal workers union\nWho made an interesting point basically saying that we've been focused a lot about on the government officials in the media members in the case of CNN who seemed to have been targeted by these packages but there's also postal workers who are putting danger who were carrying packs pointed to point B were also in danger in these situations\nOr if you remember back to two thousand one in the anthrax attacks there were two postal workers who died back then um so there's no indication that any policies are going to be changed but we are definitely seeing how people on higher alert\nThat's NPR's

and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\n\nMichele I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment\nBy NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David have you already so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our ... she was having a chat a couple of days ago with several panels about Halloween costumes and talks about how she's not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody but different race here's what she had to say [laughter]\nIt's really you get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on or a black person a facade of why we like that was okay as long as you were dressed up like a character\nAnd that of course at tapping into a rich being a pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by ...\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this pretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was the significant coverage that was given to the story a boost by a on the NBC nightly news uh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks\nHer own show a two for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from our broker a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe owes a bigger apology to folks have color around the country because this is a history going back to the Eighteen thirties minstrel shows to do to me and denigrate uh a race wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin uh depressed the newest co hosted today show he waited as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line that this was political correctness run a month um that's silly and it's nice and juniors and it's it's it's just as ignorant and racist as a statement itself\nOr NBC News Germany Andy lack at a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well this isn't the first time that can carry a face criticism while at NBC um why do people think this was the last straw [noise]\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to her own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge parks and he's hosted she insisted that both Santa Claus and Jesus quite Christ were white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show has been ailing a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings are and she had her relationship it cooled with executives that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who retain says that ties to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this a source would direct knowledge of the matter says ah it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC as she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd a ... at that nine AM our and her ratings didn't do a heck of a lot for it in a dish and she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for a uh for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office that's\nNPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nMegan Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject seems to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hey Jean Louis ... why do we have this conversation year after\nYear around here really um we do every year in quotes which in fact we joke\nThat October is black with Avon and following advice Halloween is likely Christmas at all companies on this one day of the year when all the races costume and comes out maybe these annual conversations should be less about whether black faces bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well walk us\nThrough some of the history of this when did we first start seeing blacks in America\nWe first start seeing these in the early Eighteen hundreds it becomes central to missile shows on which why people would dress up like black people by talking in this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course he's missile shows depicted black people with lazy as animal lipstick play caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad human decision that allows slavery to happen at the time um and so these characters linger in the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ... Olsen\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing it's loosely and black for\n\nMe [noise] my language\nSo there's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow face portrayals of Asian American pie or anything of Mickey Rooney is character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it's those mocking depictions of people of color that these Halloween controversy set against that\nAnd to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWell the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people in missile shows who are not wearing black race because that was so much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... to ... back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about this history [noise] what do you make of that [noise]\nI mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense none of this history is particularly deeply hidden and Kelly when she was talking about this and this panel is all white and I went to the port and she seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocence of people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the time of these conversations about race in history in power\nAnd not about sort of brought a conflict we always start in a historical vacuuming\nDoes intent matter since you raise it more is this something we should just degree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nI'm Glad you bring up the N. word because we're a good example of the ways in which the concepts of things change depending on who you're delivering something who's receiving it so what do you controversy tend to happen it's usually when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party dressed in blackface usually there is not a black person independence and no one at that party made bad an eyelash\nBut then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook exactly and men that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship to that imagery a different relationship to the consequences of that imagery as well maybe these conversations\nWill be better served if we spent less time parsing out what's going on in people's souls and whether they're good people were not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences NPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than kitchen thank you so much by Louis Phoenix looks over [laughter]\nI Hope not [noise]\n\n\nThis is NPR News this is not even nine W.

dozens and dozens of different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs\nHelping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nHere if I hear you write your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave\nYes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S I mean I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at their radios right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs in Central America violence prevention programs from Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador their governments are responsible in the end\nBut if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our\nHemisphere nearby and with lots of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other

we're talking\nSeveral hundred million dollars ... billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should've knowledge I guess which is that the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries and bringing of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back\nTo Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not justice aids the United states was a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contras were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now ... national and nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here\nIn our prisons and in our communities and so those linkages are not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled

have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to reduce violence improve governance approved the way\nKennedy but when I ask him to hold these governments

test\nIt helps you do things like walking a straight line or stand on one leg if you're sober but researchers at Washington University in St Louis thought there was more to the cerebellum so they used a special type of MRI to study the brain wiring of ten people and Dr Nico dozen boxes they found some surprising connections\nAbout twenty percent of the cerebellum is dedicated to motion that eighty percent is dedicated to higher order cognitive functions\nWhat kind of cognitive functions Scott America post doc and doesn't bucks lab offers some examples\nAbstract thinking forward planning even holding something in memory producing the words that you're saying it's important for all of his day to day functions that you really take for granted and that seemed effort less\nMerrick says the cerebellum doesn't carry out these tasks directly just as it doesn't directly control movement instead he says it appears to monitor the brain areas that are doing the work can make them perform better\nThan we think that the cerebellum is acting as the brains ultimate quality control unit\nThat still speculation but doesn't bug says the findings published in the journal neuron adds to the evidence that this ancient part of the brain plays a critical role in modern life\nAlready thought that the cerebellum is cruel than most people thought but these results were re more exciting and clear then I could have ever dreamt\nDoesn't bug says most researchers haven't paid much attention to the cerebellum perhaps because it's most obvious function involve something pretty mundane physical movement\nBut really it's much more about editing your thoughts and your internal life it's just much farther noticed that I think that's the way scientists the neurologist had been missing

the bad ideas people have when they're drunk they're lacking ... brother editing are your thoughts\nOne scientist who's not surprised by the new studies results is Jeremy Schmahmann a professor at Harvard Medical school he's been arguing for decades that the cerebellum is involved in both human behavior and disorders like schizophrenia Rahman says the cerebellum has changed dramatically since it appeared and fish and lizards hundreds of millions of years ago\nWhat's happened to all the time is that the cerebellum has expanded enormously and the parts are better off talking to the parts of the brain upstairs I don't vote and cognition means at cerebellum is involved in those process to use as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum is performing more or less the same function it always has but instead of just making a physical movement smoother and more accurate each smoothing out our emotional responses or improving our ability to make good decisions and focus on a task\nWhat we now understand is that what cerebellum does to motor control it does to cook mission and emotion as well\nSchmahmann says the cerebellum does all this automatically so we're unaware of its contribution but when it stops working he says the result may be a brain disorder there is increasing\nEvidence from a variety of fields now that psychiatric diseases from autism spectrum schizophrenia depression
