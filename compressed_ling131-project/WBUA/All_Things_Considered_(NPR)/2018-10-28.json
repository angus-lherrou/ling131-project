and trying to make sense of what happened here threw out this program we will be sharing what we know about the attack\nAnd we will be hearing from members of the community who were directly affected by the tragedy and we'll hear from people who were far away but still felt the need to respond that we're going to start the program with Pittsburgh Mayor Bill but you know Mr Mann thank you so much for talking with\nIt's my pleasure and of course I Want to offer my deepest condolences to you and ... members of the city and the community and you just lost eleven people and how are you holding up and how is the city holding up\nUm it's difficult uh our hearts are broken collectively in Pittsburgh is a community is small a ditch versus a small city in what happens to one part of it affects all of us\nWe'd have to number of people to describe the community to us and I'm like you described it to us what is what a squirrel hell all about\nWell it's um I live five blocks from where the event took place um it's the most diverse neighborhood and all of western Pennsylvania\nAnd it's I'm a very tight knit community that is the historic a base of Pittsburgh Jewish community for over one hundred years\nUnfortunately um events like this are no longer rare in American Life and I wondered when you have seen other community faith or something like that has it been running through your mind like what what I Do in the situation I mean as you first got the call this the first calls were coming in that this was this\nEvent was taking place I find myself wondering like what were you thinking and how'd you how'd you thought to yourself what you would have to face something like that\nSo I have a um strategy with my chief of staff on weekends or if he calls I I'm may not pick up on the first time but if he ever calls back\nTwo times I'll note that it is something that is a crisis it was the first time he's ever had to do that\nAnd during that period I realize that something was very very wrong\nOf within five minutes she was at my house and we were on the scene I'm within five minutes of that so I'm looking at different cities of course there's always try to learn from other cities and uh one of the examples and they\nHad the opportunity to talk to them era Walsh today was Boston in the Boston Marathon and I'm trying to realize how to get not only\nThe strategy of the police in public safety but also communications\n\nNo I don't\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from battle a European made language learning program Bible teaches practical conversation in

I get it on our soldiers\nAnd I heard you ran into an aunt who was visiting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I I talked to Lisa flasher Jackson enter nice Eli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child I don't even know what to think I mean I\nMy grandmother is no longer with us but I mean I I spent a lot of time in the Senate guy this is where I went through my family belongs [noise] I'm just horrified with what happened and I hope that we could make them since changed as a tack on just people that have been hacked on\nOn everybody in the community and market are strong and I'm not going to make it through\nAnd I said she was with her knees to sixteen alley they both just as many generations of the family have ties to this neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials\nWhile I Would\nAdd tree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and get support for the families that\nSo so what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime well I just heard so much sadness so much shock as you always hear in these situations and and we study the aunt\nShe mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun law\nI think it's not about me definitely need to have guidelines but we definitely don't need to have you know security guards on at our schools at our temples at our church as\nPushing too I mean some are we supposed to go like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers are to that but where we go to pray it's not even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here right now\nWhat fair you also getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much yeah I think ...\nAnd ... other Pittsburgh faith communities took time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life synagogue the ... United Methodist church across town open their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nIn the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor Russell ... said he that he held a special ... to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nAre intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed on to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our voice you know we often shoe that we offer our prayers and thoughts\nAnd that is fine but we must do more we must put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our boys and with our actions we can ensure that this hatred is not the new American way you cannot be\nDo you have a sense that there were some people who might have been afraid to come out today because yeah\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back if\nI open and affirming you mean that hasn't been every once in a while because everyone is welcome to factual word right everyone is welcome and and knowing welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple of\nOh\nFolks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer the words of Thanksgiving they do not speak to worship but they do to call them and to say thank you for doing this so it makes a difference\nIf I ask you don't seem rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter turned into four roses in on\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events because he was a police officer in white hall nuts were the ... a perpetrator lives\nTo it was very frightening for us personally um but I I Try to a log charge the urge to give me the bull ...\nThat I Need I I Do not fear for my show I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my children my grandchildren but yet I can allow hatred ... me\nWe also met lore has she is the nursery attendant at the church responsible for caring for the congregations littlest members during worship and for her yesterday's attacks on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony was ... was being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell this church has recently kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of the situation like that and of course it's the nursery attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind to start here because I'm responsible for\nEight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating to join the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSo I was running through my head kind of playing so I come up for years\nReally and is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened where you're thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so I'd the child\nEven back then and what to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school and constantly hearing about stuff like that Sandy Hook happened when I was in high school or things like that it's always kind of was in the back of my mind is kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking of how\nWe also met a father and son Otis and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today and Otis said his own life experiences allowed him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nAnd African American beer and ... and there were you really know about how these things are for the wrong people reserve neighborhood of people look at your front of\nThermometer field are you should be there because her view of your color\nMassey what about you I get the sense that this resonated with you even though it wasn't this particular attack wasn't directed at a fair and I guess if I can you just described why that is because I remember I was\nLooking at the news yesterday and I are in front of our lander says I'm gay and Orlando resident ended with me\nI'm also walk in the south Carolina shooting resume because it was people who are religious and they got killed because their their religious and this resonates with me because it's it's ... American right to worship\nHow we want to worship when we want to worship in peace and for someone to come in and just murders and for for ... for loving the same God that they love is is it's just unbelievable to me\nDid it help being here today that are helping a judge today\nWe're altogether morning and in really allowed me to lift up my English and say you know just put it on God's hands\nI'm Janine hurts to these headlines security has been stepped up synagogues around the country after eleven people died at a Pittsburgh synagogue yesterday the names of the victims were released today including a married couple and two brothers\nWe will President Trump ordered flags at federal buildings flown at half staff in honor of those who died in the mass shooting he also condemned what he called an evil anti Semitic act\nThe leaders of Russia Germany France and turkey are calling for a complete cease fire in Syria\nAs well as the creation of a committee to draft a new constitution by the end of the year the leaders met in Istanbul this weekend discussing the conflict in Syria that killed an estimated four hundred thousand people over the past seven years I'm Janine hurts NPR News in Washington\n\nNo I don't\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Elijah Craig family owned makers of small batch Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey he lies you Craig barge town Kentucky forty seven percent alcohol by volume ... promotes responsible drinking\nFrom Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff a new series from the creator of Mad Men starring Diane Lane Noah Wiley Christina Hendricks and Andrew rentals a new episode every Friday on prime video and from the sustaining members of this NPR station\n\nThat is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin we are here at W. E. S. A. in Pittsburgh and not far from here thousands are gathering to remember the eleven people who were shot to death at a local synagogue\nThe Jewish community center is leading the community gathering held at soldiers and sailors memorial hall and open Pennsylvania faith leaders and politicians from ... from throughout Pennsylvania and beyond have gathered in a packed auditorium NPR's Quil Lawrence is outside of the community service now and he's been talking to members of the Pittsburgh community all day Quil welcome thank you so much for talking to us\nThank you it sounds like a huge gathering there today what is it like at this event\nYeah there's a beautiful hall and saw the auditorium and in the backdrop is ... Abraham Lincoln's entire Gettysburg Address\nUm I I just stepped away at the beginning there was a a Baptist choir and African American Baptist choir singing and I mean this is an event hosted by the Jewish community but it was a clear symbol of the\nOf the whole Pittsburgh community standing in solidarity and the music was beautiful and really soothing to many in the crowd there were people weeping including reporters\nAre say they're maybe three thousand people inside and as I left to come out and speak with you I had to pass through another three thousand people sitting outside in what's now very ...\nSame service over over speakers\nLovely now um you also spent some time in squirrel held a neighborhood with this attack occurred what was the mood there\nYeah I mean people were out and scroll hill trying to kind of have their normal life in a way of farmers markets are people going through Sunday services and you can see the diversity of the communities notably Jewish but it's really a bit of everything\nThey were trying to be normal but they're also trying to explain this I spoke to a woman coming out of the six president Presbyterian Church Brittany story and she's in eighth grade English teacher she just friday took her students to the Holocaust museum in Washington DC here's what she says\nI came today they're\nWaiting patient and now that they I think I'm going to let them read the articles and news articles that I Want to talk of the class and just give them a space [laughter] kind of process\nAnd what they thought they were really moved by family even if they know how it for weeks\nAnd people were saying that you know a little town like this you never think can happen but in today's America they realized it can happen anywhere\nAnd to that point this is a a a a smallish city and the victims of the shooting were identified this morning and people are probably just finding out that they may known someone who was affected how are people absorbing this\nYeah it's another wave of shocked to hear the names I rented to Dan Franco he's the he's the state represented Pennsylvania state representative from this district he went to Hebrew school with the tree of life when he was eleven years old and he knew or two the two brothers who were killed David in Cecil Rosenthal he's really should\n... we've learned a known for many years whenever I go\nTo a tree of life for a mixture of wedding or some sort of ... two of them are always the sanctuary\nHe talked about you know centuries of anti Semitism but more recently an object of hate speech in this country\n... and now finally Quil what what is next what what are people saying is next\nI felt like people run the sorrow this sort of cycle of sorrow and then pride in the solidarity of the community showing and then there's rage that a man could come here with an assault rifle and massacre eleven people in twenty minutes while they were praying most of these people were old enough to be grandparents\nThe community is trying to take action they say they want to do something they said he talk about guns they talk about trying to tone down the rhetoric in this country and many of them talked about upcoming elections in and wanting to be active\nThat is NPR's Quil Lawrence Cole thank you thank you and as you just heard we've been talking quite a bit today about how people are mourning and how they're trying to make sense of this tragedy but it's not just adults who are trying to make sense of yesterday's shooting and tragedies like this that are unfortunately all too common a lot of people are thinking about their children\nAnd how to talk to them about tragedies like this NPR's Sarah McCammon has been reporting on that story and she's back with us in the studio Sarah thanks so much for coming back and doing this sort of thing and I understand you've actually covered a lot of these shootings and this is something that is really on people's minds\nAnd fortunately I've covered several of these now and my career as a journalist and you know anytime there isn't a senseless act of violence especially especially these mass shootings it's it's hard to explain it to children especially for people in the area and the community affected\nI it's impossible for kids not to hear about it right in the news and their friends and neighbors are talking about it even if they're not directly involved in a tragedy I found a lot of people struggle with how to talk to their children how to explain things and not terrified that\nThough you did we mentioned earlier that you went to the synagogue neighborhood outside the synagogue you also with other places tell us about that\nActually went over to the children's museum here and Pittsburgh it's a pretty famous really really great when actually and\nAh they have opened it up to the public for free this week Monday through friday or they want a place for families to go and feel safe and comfortable they say\nAnd today was a pretty normal busy day at the museum and and that suffers we're thinking about ways to to reach out to families today too I met a woman named Jesse live and she was hanging out with her family and she said something I've been hearing repeatedly and talking to people in Pittsburgh today\nJust so you hear it happening everywhere but you never really think it's happening here\nShe says she's not sure how to broach the subject with her two kids ages for insects we're from Canada\nWe just we don't see these\nHearing you sweat living here for last year to start seeing more highly\nAcross the room Alisa Hoffman was also unsure what to tell her two kids ages six and three about what they're seeing in the news\nIt's hard to [noise]\nI put it into a time where they understand um [noise]\nWe haven't really talked about it yeah I have\nHow we well husband grew up in the Pittsburgh area and was back here to visit family and like so many here she has ties to the Senate\nHad that environment let's see if I if I hadn't I tend to focus my best friend growing up was Jewish and that's where he went so it's just really [noise]\nRising setting disappointing that that people get these signs in their head and and do it [noise]\nYou know and I think that they [noise]\nThey can't actually hand\nDevin deal runs the make shop a plate and craft area for the kids she says the museum staff has been grappling with how to help children and their parents during this scary time [noise]\nSo today it's hard to be at work hard to um know that we are the helpers here and we are the ones offering support for those families and children while we are also struggling with our own feeling\nBut the way that I'm looking at it\nYou know we are part of a community together\nPaul and I'm being with the community right now deals are important and powerful for me to still says today's plant originally focused on Halloween\nBut after the shooting she switched things up and encourage the kids to build models and houses and buildings and other familiar places they care about places that make Pittsburgh home Sarah McCammon NPR News Pittsburgh\n[noise] sorry thank you for that and finally today I reached out to an old friend to give us one more perspective on yesterday's shooting David trip and we used to work together in Washington DC now he is executive
