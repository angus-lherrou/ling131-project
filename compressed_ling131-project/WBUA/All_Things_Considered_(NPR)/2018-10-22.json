are now among those at high risk for overdose so some schools aren't taking chances NPR's Tovia Smith reports on the new effort to keep students safe\nOne of the first things colleges are doing is teaching students to recognize an opioid overdose and what to do\nAnything you know the feeling [laughter] Ohio University is using this video dramatization ... can that drug known generically as a

out one at sixty to tip or later boxes on\nIs opioid overdose skits and all free for the taking\nWe felt that it was on the university to provide these because it's a life saving drugs and we're in the midst of an epidemic affects everybody\nShortly after a student died of an overdose in two thousand sixteen police put nor can in every dorm and parking lot and trained more than a thousand people to administer it\nAll you would do you feel those facts you can hold it like this put the tip into the patients Marshall\nAbout regarding down if the nasal passage ways given once ray ... and then you're done that and junior Isaiah rose men one of the resident advisors who've been trained yeah I did read I read it and I think personally I feel like it's my moral obligation to help someone who was overdose good I have another person's life\nStudents like Nick ... say it's comforting not just for the small number of people who maybe heroin users but also everyone using other street drugs like cocaine which is sometimes lays split opioids like sentinel unbeknownst to users\nHonestly I thought a lot of kids are where it goes that's when problems can definitely happens and then overdose can definitely be reality\nI think it's good to make and arcane available but it's really tricky situation\nThis student from a different university says he spent about ten years battling addiction he has not to be identified do avoid harming future job prospects\nDuring his college years he says he overdosed twice and kept failing classes but he says that was before schools were set up to recognize or support students with drug addictions\nThey didn't want to acknowledge the problem like everything's fine at our school but I mean you probably blatantly obvious on his way as it was pretty bad\nNow one and a half years sober he's back in a new school and works in a campus recovery center the likes of which barely existed even a few years ago\nHis school is also just started giving free ... students but only if they ask for it he worries many users or their friends would be too afraid to do that but he says he also sees the downside to just leaving it out for people to take anonymously\nThe concept that is ... you have no way of offering them further help the only way that we can help them as if we know who it is\nAs colleges struggle to workout best practices some say parents can't afford to just stand by in weight\nUnfortunately our colleges haven't really caught up and I think parents need to take it into their own hands\nJillian Bauer reached teaches at Temple University where two students died of overdoses last year she says when kids head off to college parents should send them with nor can as well as fentanyl testing strict\nJump like they would send them our with condom do you encourage them to have the first act um they can create like a C for drug use ... for them and here\nShe dismisses concerns that it may actually encourage more drug use\nLike I don't think that if you're a student was planning on studying for their exam that having had an old tactic strips and their drawer is going to be calling their name to go out and buy drugs and tried\nBut others question such broad based strategies especially for schools with scarce resources even with school discounts and arcane runs about Seventy five dollars for two doses emergency kits contain to just in case at Bridgewater State University none of the kids put out last year had been taken yet\nAnd into two years since the University of Texas at Austin launched a similar initiatives several kids placed off campus have been successfully used the program director Lucas hills says all those on campus remain untouched\nThis is at least one data point that says that may not be cost effective and so we'll see a movie on campus is not the hot spot\nHills now considering placing kids instead at convenience stores in bars but he cautions not lock sewn alone is not the answer colleges also need to beef up treatment in recovery programs preventing overdose death he says is not the same thing as curing addiction Tovia Smith NPR News [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]
