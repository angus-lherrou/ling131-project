I think the response which had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position\nWhere he was damned if he did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has announced standing judicial temperament and he will Supreme Court justices well\nPeople wing and then continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice while I foreign\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not base he leaves based on any political or personal beliefs and he is not about to sacrifice that well deserved reputation for integrity by throwing it all the way on the Supreme Court\nI wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remarketing he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nThat some of the members of the Democratic senators on the editor to Sherry a committee to be appropriate but when it comes to ruling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respecting the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker had his Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there are some things I shouldn't have said what things should not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to centered ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the colic but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's strengths and the solar hitting gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know he I think there is no question that the Democrats and you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I like not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer of Brett Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're hearing on this story throughout the program [noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.

following today the U.S Senate voting to cut off debate on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and moved to a final vote\nDespite allegations of sexual assault in his past\nAnd one year ago today with a New York times broke a bombshell story\nThe times headline on October fifth twenty Seventeen read Harvey Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades or one of the two reporters who broke that Weinstein story was Jodi Kantor and she joins me now hey there\nHi how are you I'm well thank you I'm Sorry to hear you just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer in the New York Times' newsroom about to hit send on the Weinstein story and you write none of us knew what was going to happen on me some thought out into the world we\nDid in my partner Megan too and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because of the times was doing bigger investigation sexual harassment we knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we're we're reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were reporting on Fort factory workers\nBut you never know what's gonna happen to an investigation wet it's when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt party\nLike to say as we were working on it he said hurting aligns dean is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA andme ... really was not a household name 'em\nAnd and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was founded years ago by trying to bark\nTakeoff globally but it just kept going and going\nAnd going there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that this was going to burn out or you know the women were all than him or ... or the news was finally going to stop and it never did and what's happening with judge happened I I think is representative of that there's a feeling that this reckoning only continues and grows bigger\nLet me ask you this if if Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a setback to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which probably have some validity I'll give you the ... the obvious one is that people will say that has a set back he was confirmed anyway\nUh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um\nWomen were ... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of ... to hell\nThe other argument however is that what especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country she put high school on the table right she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective youth\nWe also ... some moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they were able literally stop the national conversation for a second and say listen to these stories\nOne footnote to this conversation before I let you go Jody ... we just heard there from our reporter ... hardy Nelson that today also marks the award of the Nobel Peace prize that prize that is often seen as sending a political message\nUm and they weren't went to people working to stop sexual violence as a weapon of war I Wonder if that's one more book and if you like to the global scope of this me to\nMoment that you helped set in motion a year ago\nI look up to the same news and have the same time I think it's very minor and all I think it's a reminder of a global reach out and also media reminder prospect at at a moment when we're all so immersed in the cap and I needed me to this as a reminder that this topic is in even bigger than that in a way\n[noise] Jodi Kantor she broke the Harvey Weinstein story for the New York times one year ago today ... thank you

while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen happen in Chicago for decades so I think are those activists dealing like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course\nI'm happy with this verdict and concerned for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually\nTook the stand this week in his defense during the trial what did he say\nWell he described ... chronic Donald as

you can shape looking at the Baskin video of districts that act so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of that get match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this verdict to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nI think that's hard to say that because I think that the tension here had been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that\nIn addition to this trial there than other trial laid it to the shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of aquatic Donald presented that night in their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was a a problem that the community field but also that feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'll be watching closely what happens in that trial and have a C react to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is rare exception what do you think made a different well\nI think the number of shots six soon made a big difference in this case I also think the fact that there were multiple other officers on scene that night who encountered the chronic Donald and chose not to shoot I think that that was important to a lot of folks that that I noticed\nThe w._b. easy reporter
