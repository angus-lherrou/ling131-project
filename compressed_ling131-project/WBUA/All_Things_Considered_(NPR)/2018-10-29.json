still reeling from the Pittsburgh attack and from the arrest of a Trump supporter believed to have sent pipe bombs to Democrats and critics of the president\nAnd fears I used to Roscoe is at the White House and she joins us now to talk through all this hey there hello [laughter] so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how\nAre they responding not surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership or here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did was condemned the attack on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative\nMedia beers responsibility for the divisions in the country and she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week oh what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language whether you have the president's language he has been consistent with who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvents happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console or in chief or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is\nOr when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign\nEvent where he went back to making personal attacks the called out Elizabeth Warren using just belittling nickname for her\nDrive [noise] I just do what she does or not but he did was I have more than she does and I have no\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he's once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people and calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum called him with the without evidence\nIn many ways like you said this is what his supporters like we expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the midterm what difference might the president's rhetoric Mac\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nIt will you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents to get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next week\nThat's NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe reporting from the White House thinks Asia

Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nThat follows an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central American moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general parents are ... who's in charge of northern command\nWe know border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom ... says something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border rate is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those existing two thousand\nThis goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty such as transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing\nAnd the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities in these additional five thousand or so active duty army troops will also be at a support role you know law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still do do what's called heartening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas ... barriers more razor wire fencing you're crossing points\nAnd they'll also transport border agents used more remote locations by cargo aircraft and helicopters to go through a surge by the way of hundreds of additional border agents so these soldiers were also built camps provide housing\nFor these additional border agents as well\nAnd I presume this is all week oh there's a law called ... which prohibits military forces from acting as law enforcement inside the borders of the U.S this is this is all legit\nIt well that that's where the visual say they made clear these troops will not take part in any law enforcement duties or their own leaders support role again\nAnd the plus we come into this law dates for the post civil war era in the eighties seventies and that was a reaction to federal troops being used in former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\n[noise] um you mentioned that these troops are not going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWell some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms uh as far as which others would be carrying arms or any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay what's the precedent for this time for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border [noise] uh I don't recall\nThe president for sending active duty troops have been some sits in the past and again in a support role in this case you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who were doing everything you'd get it from constructing camps flying border patrol agents\nSoviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks even the lawyers in public or fears staff\nYou know a good general showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq right maybe not as many as in Syria and he basically brushed that all aside and again he said\nA border security is national security\n[noise] All right That's
