[noise]\nFrom NPR News this is all things considered ... Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly President Trump and rapper Kanye West meant for lunch today\nOne topic on their agenda was gun violence in Chicago and what to do about it the president's ideas on this are very different from what reformers at local leaders are trying to do it different that was on full display this week as NPR's Martin Kaste reports\nChicago's had a rough few years in twenty sixteen murders jumped to the highest rates in two decades something Trump talked about a lot during his campaign to bend the murder rate there has fallen some but gun crime remains a stubborn problem and this week the president said he wants to help\n... director the attorney general's office to immediately go to the great city of Chicago to help straighten out the terrible shooting wave to straighten it out or to straighten it out fast is no reason for what's going on there [noise]\nBut what that means it turns out opposition\nThe administrators should just filing a brief for the federal court saying it opposes a package of police reforms in Chicago that is known as a consent decree the decree aims to improve police training and rebuild trust between cops and the public Trump does not like consent decrees he says the real cure for Chicago is more intense of policing\nStop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems\nLike Chicago [noise] it was meant for stop and frisk Trump\nThe widespread stopping and frisky potential criminals reduce crime that conclusion contentious though and stop and frisk can also turn into racial profiling under twenty\nHad to fill out extensive forums justifying their stops which has led to fewer stops the administration believes the sort of court ordered limitation on policing can make crime words and that this new consent decree is more of the same But Lisa Madigan says it's a little late for them to be weighing in only really\nHaven't had any keep from them and count now\nMadigan as the Illinois attorney general last year in an unusual move she sued the city for a consent decree doing the job that the Trump Administration would not\nOr if they wanted to have a role or they had that opportunity they decided that they are getting out and therefore chose to do nothing\nShe regards the consent decree as necessary reform but that word is not reassuring to former cop Peter Moskos\nYou know reform as a word as justice William loses Duncan frisk\nHe's a professor at the John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and host of a podcast called quality policing it galls him to agree with the Trump Administration on something but he says the evidence from places such as Baltimore\nIs that federal consent decrees can sometimes make crime worse by limiting the intensity of policing in the places where young men carry guns and shoot each other\nIf we're going to reduce murders we have to go to places where murders happen there's going to be racial disparity but that is separate from racial bias and racial bias has to be attacked but certain neighborhoods need more policing\nMany policing experts these days lament what they see as a false choice between the strictures of Obama era consent decrees and Trump's unquestioning support for tens of policing\nIn Chicago's city leaders are digging in against Trump's rhetoric asked about it yesterday Mayor Rahm Emanuel lashed out at reporters for taking the administration's opposition seriously\nYou guys even in the stories acknowledge it has only symbolic value you guys got to stop acting like have loving little mice chasing Everytime Donald Trump said something it doesn't have any value\nTrump's opposition to Chicago's consent decree probably is symbolic the administration's brief is not likely to stop its approval in court but on Monday when Trump called for stop and frisk the applause from the police audience was very real\nHighlighting the ongoing tension between them and the reformers Martin ... NPR News\nThank God the crew is alive and those were the words from it in for Russian President Vladimir ... after a Russian Soyuz rocket carrying two astronaut to the international space station failed during and today\nThat lift off had proceeded and it was late for about two minutes then came in real life drama\n[noise] of how I Want to hear\nHim and it's like five and we have it on my family out of the [noise]\nThe crew American the tank and Russian Alexei option in our space after an emergency landing in context on three other astronauts are currently on board the space station and now they're returned home might be delayed\nFor more on all of that we are joined by Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield he served as commander of the international space station and twenty Thirteen and flew up there and back any Russian Soyuz capsule welcome\nThank you nice to be talking with you also\nFeel this was going to the American they have the first time into the the second for like the ocean and what kind of training would they have had to handle a situation like that\nBoth of them in training for decades Alexei as a cause went on for quite a while as you say with space flight experience nip prior to being an astronaut was a test pilot in the U.S air force so that's an extremely risky complex job so they've been getting ready for this for many many years and then specifically for this launched\nThey went working together for a couple of years we've ran out every last thing that could possibly go wrong\nAnd the way that crew behave there were so Chris and professional right on top of their game you would never know the vehicle was behaving so badly if you listen to all Alexei ... which dealing with things bringing them both safely after\nWhen would be the next chance you could go on a mission like that again I mean I Can't imagine that psychological blow\nYeah you're you're right you know the crew at first will be super focused and professional and doing their job but afterwards they're just going to be kind of mad because they didn't get to go to an based today you know kind of\nLike gosh all that preparation and at that but neither of them got hurt and there are back in the game and they'll have a chance to fly again but I don't know who will fly next it's way too soon to tell it's going to be a long time to figure out what went wrong and then we'll have to start thinking about who should fly next what's skill sets should we need one is that going to be\nAll of the repercussions that come from an event like today\nTell me what it will take what kind of conversations are going to have to happen to figure out how to move forward\nThe first thing we need to do is find out what went wrong what failed in this rocket there's a lot of information people be able to sift through video of it but also the sensors on board then we need to see how can we fix it was it a design\nAnd then once you know that you could fix it then you can set a timeline is that in three months from now then no big deal but if it's going to take a year or two years\nThen we need other plans Boeing is building a rocket that can take people to the space station or ... or a spaceship SpaceX is building a ship that can take people to the space station maybe they could be accelerated maybe they could fly before the Russians are going to be ready to fly again and window we bring the crew back from the space station all of those questions need to be analyzed\nThe way I understand they were expecting to return home and now that return could be delayed correct\nThey flew up in a different show years that's docked to the space station and sort of like a lifeboat or their their their ride home if they're\nThey can come home anytime they want ah okay but\nIf they ... come home and they are basically abandoning ship the space station would be empty and it's a big enough and complicated enough ship that after a little wild things start to go wrong and there'd be nobody there to fix them so it really causes a lot of risk for the space station to leave it on man\nSo people will be looking really hard at all of the limits and have to decide what the right trade offs are we don't know the answers yet but it's going to be a really complicated decision making process coming up\nChris Hadfield went the first Canadian commander at the international space station thank you very much for joining us today nice to talk with you also argue [noise]\nThat is NPR News\nThis is Ninety point nine WB you are coming up on all things considered
