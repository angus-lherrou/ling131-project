Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone and that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida we stir industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today well\nYou know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove in today my producer Becky solving and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it\nHere in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're\nAll kinds of businesses were just in rubble um someone already taken a hit economically but uh there's not as many there as it were there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's the section that runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged it in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckled under washed them and a half an hour yeah yeah I watched it out\nThere is also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now and just a single lane but that said there is now a pathway through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others\nAnd the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but they they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in Appalachia go no power no very limited cell service and no outside help yeah\nWell and and I mentioned these two towns are the hardest waster industry they've got fishing going on there a lot of fishing and they were struggling before the storm how might this affect\nThem right I mean ... all the mainstay there but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their votes upriver to a secluded area Heidi hold they call it to keep it out of harm's way and so most boats escaped major damage that is good but some of the seafood restaurants and and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage and working to rebuild and be back in business as soon as they can\nAs NPR's Greg Allen reporting for us from Florida Today and all this week Greg thanks so much you walk them\nRight

American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there and\nI'm Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell he's pastor around a small church and is mayor in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were based list but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses to adjust to fight against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that incident a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence\nRemoved restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why release him and why release him now\nWell in some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course jerky wanted the extradition of this cleric or to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you and yours this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly drunk thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they love each sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that's his that's his church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering at thirty five fighter just to turkey will lay re raise this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia here and just tumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... case that we've been tracking all of us this week\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue off the table\n[laughter] thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon

you just have to know how to look Geoff Brumfiel NPR News Washington rainy rainy goals and\n[noise] some\nAnd you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWhen the new NBA season kicks off next week a relative newcomer is going to be hitting the court\nNot a player as you write the athletic ran who is stepping back into the basketball shoe business with an updated version of its Nineteen Seventy three classic Clyde\nAnd it was a shoo them meet famous by New York Knicks great won't Clyde Frasier and to hear all about this come back we're going to go to ESPN's Nick DiPaolo who covers the athletics you industry he joined us from Portland, Oregon hey hey how's it going there good so why\nDon't want to get back into the basketball market now I mean it's been what Twenty years since there last basketball she wouldn't\nYeah so they had it for a in Ninety eight and it was very short lived they sign just one clear and been quarter\nAnd you'll go broke her after two years and so they've been out the game for about Twenty years now\nBut when I think when you look at basketball basketball's always had these elements of culture style and music that no other American Sport really hasn't so I'm going with a big part of the appeal\nWith typing in with the players are today that are young and trend setting and exciting and also I think a big thing for them as as a branded as they look on to China and how they can make their mark their\nBasketball's really a big gateway in terms of being a global brand as well\nBut how much do they have now to get a big name behind him because I'm thinking like Nike and Adidas they were able to attract people like Michael Jordan and LeBron James is who may even in a position to be going after a name like that right now\nSo signing players is definitely one of the biggest hurdle for any newcomer yeah um you know I did a lot of research last year and like you had about ... percent of the week wearing their shoes less model okay step in combat that is pretty common bond okay you have that you have a huge budget and allowing from the standpoint and they signed\nThis year along with loans are in the end or doesn't so you know in terms of offers there's been extremely aggressive and that's that's a big part of how they are looking to make their imprint back\nHow big of a gamble is this for a company like you said the market already pretty saturated is is a long shot to get back into the basketball she business\nIt's incredibly aggressive um the bigger the bigger hurdle and I guess the biggest thing that the detractors have been\nNot as high on his you know when you're signing a lot of rookies which they have\nIt's really tough to say how these guys will pan out and there's so many cases the guys that were drafted high that\nYou know or bus that didn't pan out and so I think one thing they're really doing is is relying on social media she's gotten a chance to check out who who are Instagram they are unlike any other brands and it's kind of wild wild west and they'll post whatever and it's very on corporate life but I think people if they could see that in mid may kind of fun\nYou see the wild wild west is it more important in some ways how these players act off the court on social media when it comes to promoting issue banned in what they do on the court\nYeah that's a huge component of it I think you know as you look at all the stuff in terms of high school kids they're watching less and less of a full through our game and they're really kind of immersing more than what these guys are doing away from the game and and there's the methods of highlights on everything like that but I looked up the other day and out of the nine guys up 'til the sun\nThey have six and a half million combined followers on Instagram so that's why this huge me as the brand is starting out you know I think the random itself has only had a couple of hundred thousand followers and so\nThey're really winning in on their players counts and ethical big part of their strategy with their new is that they don't want that look just like a standard basketball shoe they're trying to create stuff that maybe has a little more lifestyle to it that guys can be showcasing in different ways on their own pages and so that's going to be a huge push for sure\n... covers the athletic she industry for ESPN takes so much

from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse want the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nUrge state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually second his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's ...\nThe Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop roles role in it\nNow I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think that the people in Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations view you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the last ... change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who's living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence Chris stale did any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that\nWe couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your offices report laid bare is how a large institution in this instance the Catholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes revising the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nWill you hit the nail on the heads so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution\nIn the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there is our reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how\nMuch we are willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on but the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and\nLaw enforcement plays a unique and critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania and\nJoshua

Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigates the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled a critical moment in that probe\nMoron laws when they succeeded which was first in history to get the courts to let the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because they couldn't let it would have had real difficulty and doing its work of the wave of high hadn't gotten off the ground\nLeon Jaworski told an interviewer in Nineteen Seventy seven the document contained in detail list of the evidence of Watergate prosecution team had gathered\nWe called the road map in our office because last just that\nFor forty four years that road map remained a secret under seal by the federal district court in Washington on orders of the judge who presided over the Watergate cases\nThat secrecy persisted to protect the grand jury's work but not for lack of trying in Nineteen Ninety seven Stephen ... was working for the\nClinton base was looking for a precedent for how is national prosecutor might send an impeachment

they\nSaid no beats tried again years later that the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry shortstop\nIt's relevant historians it's relevant to the infringe that ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map\nOn to the public record urgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign in one of the big questions and at the end of Robert Mueller's

how innovation succeeds best through collaboration\nMatter with President Trump has stepped up his attacks on the Federal Reserve\nThis week after stock prices plunge Trump ripped into the fed for raising interest rates which it's been doing for the last few years I think the fed\nHas gone crazy I think the fed is out of control I think what they're doing is wrong or right for some perspective on this we're joined by someone who worked at the fed for forty years until twenty ten ... was vice chairman of the Fed's board of governors thank you so much for coming in today\nThank you for having me here also so how usual is it for the president to be attacking the Federal Reserve like this\nIt's been very unusual since the early Nineteen nineties before that and particularly under George W Bush the president and its ministry shouldn't often voice displeasure with the Federal Reserve's\nA monetary policy and maybe didn't call the fed crazy no I don't know that doesn't sound like his rhetoric does it but since uh the Clinton Administration came in\nThey decided that it was best for the Federal Reserve and for the country not to be constantly harping on monetary policy so they could make their views known private lead to the chair and other members other decision makers but not with this public pressure\nOkay so up until now fed officials had been defending the fed is from the president's attacks but then today the president of the Chicago fad Charlie Evans he was quoted as saying it's fair to question the rate hikes so does Evans have a point putting aside the president's rhetoric is it fair to question these rate hikes\nI think it's always fair to question whether the Federal Reserve is doing the right thing in a democratic society the Federal Reserve has to be able to defend itself\nOr with the elected representatives and the public I think it brings all the information to bear but it's a legitimate question always and the fed needs to be able to answer why is it doing what it's doing do\nYou think that at the president's comments pose any risk at all on how the fed manages the economy could the president somehow sway the fed to slow down the rate hike\nNo I don't think the president's words will affect what the fed is doing and I would note that the president has made some very high quality appointments to the Federal Reserve which makes me even more confident\nThat it will continue to do the right thing based on economic analysis using them from using the institutions well insulated from the political wins the president's attacks could be sending or\nI think is very well insulated I Do get concerned that if the president keeps up his attacks\nAnd others drawing him and so far there really hasn't been that he's putting the Federal Reserve into the middle of a very difficult polarized political situation so I don't see\nAn economic riskier given who the decision makers are but I see a political risk and I think at some point\nConfidence of the people of the United states that it is doing the right thing but it is a deliberate\nInstitution that's acting in their best interests but\nYou're a little concerned that maybe Trump's rhetoric could be affecting that trust among the man I could overtime German power she\nSays has worn out the carpets on Capitol Hill trying to explain to the legislators who are the Federal Reserve's oversight group why they're doing what they're doing and I think that's as well as explaining to the American people I think that's the basic insulation for the Federal Reserve\nFrom political pressure is understanding\nThat's Donald come the former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve board of governors thank you so much for coming in today your walk 'em out so thank you for having me are\nYou listening to all things considered from NPR News\nMad Men creator Matthew Weiner is back with a new series for Amazon called the Romanoff it is an anthology series different cast

us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise said tell me what these two towns look like today well\nYou know these air this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center of places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe so we drove into day my producer Becky solving and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the\nTrees they're mostly stayed standing which shows that they didn't receive the same high winds you know the there I think it was tropical storm force winds and the trees were stood at\nA here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're\nAll kinds of businesses were just in rubble I'm somewhat already taken a hit economically but uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete
