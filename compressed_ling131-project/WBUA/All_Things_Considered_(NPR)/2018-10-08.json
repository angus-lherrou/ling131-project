Liasson NPR News\nWe may not know what's going to happen in the November midterms but we do one thing Taylor Swift is voting Democrats in a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate\nAnd Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's an algae beats he writes\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is to see Taylor Swift makes some political endorsement\nHonestly and an era where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore and really a surprise me why the shock yeah than I think it surprised me and a lot\nThen the steady drumbeat you get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment\nAnd she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops of Instagram posed with really linked the almost like scorched earth of post about how she really feels about the upcoming mid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people don't really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything so\nThey kind of had read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well\nYou tell us with did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now still does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left leaning political positions now\nI think it did in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry in our dogs are being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have the trapped her a little bit in the way that\nBecause she still has this country than she did still want you to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably did feel more free overalls to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what the Y. jumped into politics now what'd you think is going on with her\nAnd that's what I've been trying isn't the mystery of the day\nAnd I always said I had her mind from Italy\nBeckley Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after that she kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nUnless you didn't say but those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most with her sexual assault trial when a country music DJ due to her after he lost his job because she said he groped her in a meet and greet line\nWhen she counters sued him for assault and battery and she ended up winning and I think that experience really really left a mark on her\n[noise] Emily

clear\nThey say is getting people like ray off the streets\nAnd into a medical facility means defying the Trump Administration so be it\nFor NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise] it's time now for all tech considered\n[noise]\nThis month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to the show recognition technology it's in our phones in some airport security systems on social media\nBut how good and and how secure is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she's a facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition\nPop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but in airport security systems for example law enforcement has also experimented with it\nWas there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed white or use of this software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would do really quite well with well controlled facial images the when the elimination as good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that you know changing age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou know one recurring issue though we\nKeep seeing is facial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it missed identifies white people are there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as ...\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images for particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there just a lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how did you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically it's quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race bias that's\nOh even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use this technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is\nToday how do you think about this um is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you [noise]\nWould for all tech considered comes from

had\nThis rising tide of really dangerous food additives there was no safety regulation how do I make a case that perhaps this is not a good idea I'll just tested on people and so he did\nNo one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde or snack or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response so look you've ... you've poison people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments in Nineteen oh to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with congressman to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling\nAnd as he does these experiments and ads they catch national attention which they did they were a front page news there were\nSongs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad stuff in their food there's just a lot of bad stuff in their food\nAnd so there's this in media push back\nRight in which suddenly congressmen or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizes they create a food Manufacturers Association and and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen\nAnd they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights expand decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes once this\nFirst food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his famous poison squad experiments once that law went into a place\nWe started pulling stuff out formaldehyde lent out cell of silicon said went out bore acts went out we are cynical it out right you really see government stepping up for some of these outlook extremely dangerous compounds\nIs this book just one big argument in favor of government regulation\nIn part because it certainly should be a reminder\nOf that before government regulation food was a constant unknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk\nBut it's also I Hope just a good story it's a story of something that I Love I Love these kinds of stories it's a story I'm a single person who changes the conversation right and
