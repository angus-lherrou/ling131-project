a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down an individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWorking see okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting timing here\nThe timing is indeed curious yeah the ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist your individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV uh which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty surrounding ... a a theory that has since been debunked some of the news organizations that covered it have actually were attracted their stores\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what ... is the first of Mueller's a sexual assault victims it's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead right he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against motor very\nWeird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you thank you\nEbola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months more than two hundred and forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend more than thirty per week NPR's ... eyes and men explains why this outbreak is proving difficult to end\nLast month ... found himself in a town near the epicenter of the outbreak surrounded by an angry crowd\nReykjavik appear young I was on the rocks are somehow empty bottles\nIdea is with the international federation of the red cross and coordinator of these safe burial teams they sent into the community when someone has died of Ebola at home on this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child enough I'm just stepped on\nA boy is seven I just as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the teen arrived at first people were just watching as the team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as a team was about to put the boy into a body bag\nAnd the other long shot the boy's father rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son taken this way\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nOn going on to some Vermont to be your motor mouth just fear the worst you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showing fear will provoke the ground and people that you're also trying to get out before someone throws the first row because you know once that happens everyone will start throwing\nOut yeah and his team did manage to drive off in time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week [noise]\nPartly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it who they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people and scary plastic suits but there's another issue she's put on is a senior analyst with the international Crisis Group\nThe local population is very distrustful of the government\nEven to this part of the DNC has a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor and they believe the ruling authorities only care about exploiting the wealth for themselves\nWe haven't seen anything from the government\nPerhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area and not of the central government nor United Nations peacekeeping force that is thousands strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so says put on winning authority figure be from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even real I mean whether they're ulterior motives that the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city had been staging street protests during which he bought the responders are forced to hunker down\nAnd includes health workers who would normally be tracing anyone he was had contact with an infected person the contact can be vaccinated and monitored Arthur is one of the officials tracking people epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time this happens you're things don't go out they don't see the contacts\nAnd the disease spreads the world Health Organization has\nThe production of international crisis group

December making sure the government actually holds them doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fear of that the un has had to shift its pieces around the chessboard\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country have workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people within twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's white despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling\nBut the longer this goes on we may get to the point where the dampening effect that we have using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission

brought to trial\nThen us attorney for Massachusetts Carmen or teens oversaw Bulger's prosecution for Nineteen murders racketeering money laundering and other charges he was convicted for his role in London at the killings\nWe spoke with her teeth today about the death of the Boston crime boss\nWhen whenever I hear the name of Whitey Bolger think about Whitey Bolger I always focus on um his victims victims and and the families that I I was really privileged to deal with and interact with and\nQuite frankly I think about all their pain and suffering and uh the loss that they have endured in their lifetime and and once again I I had that feeling of of ah gratification that I felt that the time\nWhen he was finally captured and brought to justice and you know I'm I'm hoping that with his death that his notoriety will not completely consume\nEveryone and and at that the attention and focus will be drawn away from the victims and their families help that are quite frankly this will be set this I think at the sentencing but I think it's more true now that this will be the end of a very very sad chapter in Boston's history\nIndeed some of the family members are speaking out today um it's gonna be hard for the name Bolger to recede I'm In Boston certainly probably across the country too\nSo in terms of your own dealings with him I Wonder where he stands in your mind there aren't many people whose crimes rise to the level of those committed by Whitey Bolger how did his trial stand apart from others that have tried\nYou know it's hard because to distinguish in in the sense that I was dealing I dealt with in the Boston Marathon bombing and the Gary Simpson case dealing with\nVictims of crimes and families that endured so much pain and suffering and loss but in the Whitey Bolger there was a degree of tremendous satisfaction and I felt really honored that I was in my position at the time when we were fortunate enough to capture him because this was a man who had\nAlluded injustice and had denied justice to many victims in families and so there was that added benefit that after being on the lam for so long sixteen years we were finally to catch up with him
