phone and heard the news that she was one of the twenty five people given as six hundred and twenty five thousand dollar genius grant\nHer brain refuse to believe it\nI don't know I I'm kind of a pessimist I start thinking like how did I earned this what did I deserve this\nWell she published a critically acclaimed poetry collection and twenty twelve called when my brother was an asthma attack the poems are intimate and personal and address problems indigenous communities facing this country poverty addiction and deep family trauma did you bring any pawns with you\nYou on the spot but now I Do one okay I'll just read this one this is appointed called ah these hands if not cause a lot of my Newark is love points um these hands if not gods\nHaven't they moved like rivers like glory like light over the seven days of your body that wasn't that good then that's your hips isn't this what gods\nThe first beloved everything\nFever vapor men pulses find any I don't think America expects round women queer women you know to speak about desire to to consider the autonomy of desire um you know and God for God Forbid a word like pleasure\nAnd so for me these poems feel really important um to to give myself a voice in a place where I'm I'm more possible and one of the ways I'm more possible is that I allow myself you know these types of tenderness is in love\nThese hands if not God then why when you have come to me and I have returned to to that from which you came bright mud mineral salt why then do you whisper oh my ... my send the money\nMy hundred handed one\n... in that poll um

into your work or do you feel some times where you have to choose one or the other\nIs lucky I have this freedom freedom or I don't have to worry about my audience a lot of the way I've come to poetry as has been the way that I existed in basketball\nAnd we didn't say that you were a former professional basketball player\nYeah there was like my first job and so for me it's you know like I don't know that there's a place where I've been more possible than on a basketball court mhm I could be everything I was and\nAnd it was also a place beyond what I was you know basketball's a game of future to use one of the ways I think about it you're always two steps ahead you're always you know moving with this kind of momentum are are pushing back against a momentum and\nAnd poetry to me feels a lot

Know best and I trust least\nYou can't hide from language like in every word the violence that that language has carried or the violence that language has an activist carried and that word that is one of the powers of poetry is that\nI can use Spanish when that's the word I feel in my in my body I can use Mojave language here when I feel it you know to be able to call myself\nWho I Am in Mojave is for me to call myself into existence in a way whereas for me to say Native American you know which we all say for clarity sake but for me to say Native American in a way I'm I'm already racing myself you know because\nWhat I Am is something that is yes part of this America but also something else something more on something that America hasn't quite been able to consume fully\nYeah that was poet
