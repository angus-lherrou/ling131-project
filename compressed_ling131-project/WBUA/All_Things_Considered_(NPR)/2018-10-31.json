they were trying to do is to get vehicles on shore\nTo support thousands of troops in war games of south of here tomorrow\nNow yesterday we saw jets ship's tanks from Germany the U.S Britain in Norway all and lots of other countries all coordinating a mock assault on the shoreline here\nWhy is NATO mobilizing in such a big way right now\nYou can't ignore the context NATO spent many years is is we all know focused on counter insurgency in Afghanistan but after Russia invaded crime you're in two thousand and fourteen NATO seems to be refocusing more in its roots back here in Europe\nNow the war games that they are staging right now has a NATO forces defend the country that's been attacked by an unnamed invader\nWhich they're really trying to emphasize here is a pillar of NATO which is if one country as a tactic seen as as an attack on all NATO members now a most assume it's fictitious invader is Russia an earlier this fall Russia had massive word games in the east and and now it seems to be NATO's during\nThese huge military maneuvers by NATO and the Russians makes it sound like we're returning to something like the Cold War is there talk of that they're in Norway where you are\nActually already they're very careful to say this is not a new Cold War but they also admit you know the global landscape has changed and NATO's showing strength I was on the ship today speaking with us Admiral James logo he's head of NATO joint forces command in Naples, Italy and she said this is one of the messages\nWe can no longer expect to operate in the area of the north Atlantic was it so we may be challenged and so uh if we're challenged or we will respond to that challenge\nSo whatever all so ago saying is you know anybody's thinking of challenging NATO they need they frankly they need to think twice\nAnd of course President Trump has not been for him about the U.S commitment to NATO as some of his predecessors I mean he's publicly berated some NATO member countries for not spending enough on defense is that tension playing out as these exercises unfold\nNo certainly not on the surface and there's a real emphasis on unity here in the United states heavy commitment we have Seventy five hundred Marines here I was talking to you and Stoltenberg he's the NATO secretary general he says there's a difference between the political rhetoric you here and actually the troops on the ground\nWhat we see is stuck to the United states is increasing its presence military presence in Europe would more forces more exercises more pre positioned equipment for the first time those of US Marines headed Norway\nIsn't the message here is the United states is still very very engaged in NATO\nThat's NPR's Frank Langfitt joining us from Norway thanks very happy to do it All

projects that a total of five point two billion dollars will be spent during the entire election cycle\nThe group's executive director Sheila Krumholz joins us now to talk about how all of that money is being spent welcome thank you glad to be here okay it's a five point two billion some compare to previous midterm elections spending\nThis is way up from the two thousand fourteen mid term elections so five point to this cycle versus just three point eight million in two thousand fourteen that's a thirty five percent jump and a record\nAnd how is this money getting spent TV radio Internet social media like where would you see most of the money going right now\nIs still tops in the most competitive races and overall kind of pulling back we see that a almost a billion dollars has been sent already this cycle on media way up from two thousand fourteen at this point in the sun\nMedia uh advertising on TV for the competitive races I digital advertising across the board for all races yeah especially on Facebook yeah here it's through the roof this year Facebook spending a yes why not you think well\nIt was certainly successful in the two thousand sixteen or election cycle for a lot of victors are so far I think as of today face because now to two hundred and Ninety six million dollars and uh as in terms of FCC report it digital ad spending a\nIt's one hundred and five million a with a almost ten million of that going to the presidential race so that that raises already taken off\nAnd as we said the vast bulk of the spending is coming out of democratic candidates and you know I'm curious when you see one side vastly outspending the other side is that a sign that that side has a good shot at winning or is it more than a sign of some insecurities and lack of confidence I think both\nCome into play on the one hand the Democrats are thrilled to see big numbers are in their columnist cycle and that is an asset they these candidates need money to get their message out\nOn both sides so uh that's a positive sign for the Democrats on the other hand to the degree that this money is coming from voters in other states that is not so helpful and election day so a there is a lot can backfire it can it can be viewed as outside meddling\nAh by voters in other states that have nothing to do at the interests of the district or the state they represent the people who may be energized about a candidate but are unable to help them on election day when it\nReally counts so that's one way a lot of money can backfire are there other ways for instance could spending a lot of money on ads actually annoy voters because I talked to a lot of voters who hate getting bombarded by ads could that environment the press voter turnout\nCertainly some of the advertising is designed to suppress voter turnout if they are in opposition to a candidate as opposed to a supporting a candidate so those are going to be a especially\nTiresome for the voters so more money does not necessarily mean more votes\nMore money does not necessarily mean more votes on election day the candidates who has spent the most typically wins however will see this ... this year whether a the Democratic a fundraising advantage\nWill help to drive down the reelection rate which has been impervious to change especially in the house races Sheila Krumholz is the executive director of the center for Responsive Politics thanks very much my pleasure thank you\nThe U.S has had three alarming incidents in a matter of days the shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh another

on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is undercutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is Mr President so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy but the sizzling economy\nAlso means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China in the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten you six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim an economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're on falls it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buying dollars\n... says there are several answers for one thing\nInvestments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy puts a stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe Congress I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't even hardly counteracted\nTrump has so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much in the spring which launched the impact Lim says the falling you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and below project\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy\nJim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the U.S China scores use financial information\nBut

list from the cart\nBloodline was confused why couldn't he broke the string ticket he started looking into this situation and he quickly realized why this was happening loved one has landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nDo one thing that comes along with the black lists the unprecedented live that uh you're fired from the\nHigh end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train you can fly\nChina started the blacklist about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust into its banking and financial system and part of this has involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near what it had been and he had all these loans you couldn't pay back\nAnd the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank he found out that all of his accounts and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town he discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face just like up on a big building\nAnother more than be electric ... by the side of the plaza\nThere are like huge grants and they're very eye catching you can't really say them from afar visit and I saw my my pictures and that's why it's like a picture of on my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is untrustworthy ... says these billboards are all over town\nShe says whenever you went out whenever he'd see the billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that you saw the face of someone he knew for\nA lot of money ... ... oh my God this or ... in a semi industry as I did get a now up their\nLoved one started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist you started calling him saying hey I'm On the list to you started getting ...\nDid he can really be relaxed around so much about\nIt and it was actually an ID the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant people will think why are you you're being happy widely used to have time to be happy or why do you not to go out and make money to pay back\nYour loan so far loud one says you've paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars that he originally owed\nSo still about one point two million to go but even when loud one does manage to pay off his debts getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked wars and trying to deal with this by all accounts getting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt\nWell it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment loud one says she will keep paying off his debts has to believe there's a way off this list Cardiff Garcia Stacey Vanek Smith NPR News\nSupport for Planet
