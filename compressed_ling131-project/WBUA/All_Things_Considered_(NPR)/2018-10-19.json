we didn't give any audio recordings to pump pale or any other American officials were waiting for the outcome of the investigation that was launched by our Istanbul prosecutor's office as\nCritics day from the beginning Turkey's attempt to present this as a straightforward criminal investigation was undermined by its invitation to the Saudis to join in\nSaudi investigators have been in on every major search so far sometimes arriving well ahead of the Turkish team us base turkey analyst Soner trapped I told the al Jazeera networks English Channel the Turkish president Recep Tayyip air to one needs to see this late at the doorstep of someone very senior in Riyadh\nI think at this stage a Turkish president on can take nothing less than not just a complete apology but ah someone pretty

likely to be overshadowed by what could play out between Riyad in Washington the U.S has counted on the house is out as a key Gulf ally especially with Trump about to reimpose sanctions on Iran aimed at removing Iranian oil and gas exports from the market\nInterest and says that move could now be coming at an awkward moment\nNovember fool whose when sanctions on Iran or increase the game and the the premise is that Saudi Arabia makes up the difference continuing stability in the world oil market about the moment that question might be being reopened\nThe Saudi ability to drive up world oil prices is just one factor that makes ... fate something more than an ordinary criminal case Peter Kenyon NPR News Istanbul\nWe're going to speak next to someone that skeptical of those Saudi and Turkish efforts to investigate ... death skeptical that the Saudis are likely to carry out a thorough and transparent investigation of themselves\nHe's David Cay he's the United nations special ... on freedom of opinion and expression\nWhich means he's tasked with protecting those rights around the world David Cay wants the UN to launch an independent international investigation and he joins me now to talk about it David Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her walk me through how this would work\nCourt kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate could showcased disappearance and perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different examples of how the un has done this before\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts maybe led by a former prosecutor and they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the conflict they should get access to whatever\nTurkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it pretty quickly I think and we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically theoretically maximum five people\nCurious about some of the practicalities of how this would work ... she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago he said\nKey it's out the Saudi consulate are you confident you would get access to the police as you need to go the people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation it's I mean it's a great\nQuestion of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general the Saudi consul general's\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access\nTo the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leaking to the press or on the information from intelligence agencies\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the church to hand over everything they say well if\nThe Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen\nAnd then what happens at the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find of\nCourse they could ignore it I think that would be something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think is a credible independent investigation something that\nThe Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S evidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting a the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible you'd be independent and then it would be up to the states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with a simply reports in the press and ideas of\nThe Saudis blaming somebody in in the government and it seems that\nThe U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not that's not a credible investigation\n[laughter] so you say you can do this you say you want to do those why isn't happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around this the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution\nThat was advocating for the safety of journalists and it was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by a number of states those included\nStates like France um those are the states that I Would look to first uh to to move this kind of thing forward\nDavid

Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way they do have paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nThough one way you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised ... from Mexico and um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws\nBut I think this is a country and opportunity I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans are smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them I ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a really sick um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize as the people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration switching\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my position in that position is\nFrom the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republicans were trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked use the if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican are you in the reelection are struggling to see on the ballot and its diagnoses agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as you approach juicy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies that the national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic if Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party when the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations that deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nSee what's going on there see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you get ... votes and they said that we were ready to go over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be sealed for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party\nGovernor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with President Trump\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News build it\nAnd they will come in this case a little wooden box on a post demand credited with building the first little library died yesterday Todd Bowles was sixty two and had pancreatic cancer\nNine years ago he used words from his old garage door to build the first little library at his home in Hudson, Wisconsin now there are tens of thousands of little libraries in eighty five countries\nAuthor Miranda Paul got to note Todd bowl and has written a children's book due out next year called little libraries big heroes she joins me now from her home in Green Bay welcome thank you gave Todd Bowles this idea to build a little library and the first place\nWell Todd mother passed away and his mother had been a schoolteacher and when he was growing up as a student who very much struggled\nHis mother had always been encouraging so he built the first little free library as a one room schoolhouse to honor her and was it a hit right from the start actually know very little passed by\nThat he talked with his friend Rick rocks and so they built a whole bunch of them sort of planting unlike seeds from Minneapolis to Madison to Chicago and it was only after that that it started to catch on\nWe had him on this program six years ago and he was talking about the effect just a little libraries once people did start catching on and start using them\nOne of the things that always amazes me the only people hugged them when we actually put them in we constantly get emails that say I've met more people have in Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch read a book and watch people open the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd really looked out reading and sharing stories as a doorway conforming relationship usually when I spoke with Todd in person or on the phone he expressed how energized wise about projects especially those that had to do with news or people who didn't normally\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now our tuition to the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free libraries have come up this sort of a little spring of hope along the U.S Mexico border there is a hundred and fifty of them um in prisons in Wisconsin and other states and the king while the refugee settlement in western Uganda\nA hospital in Ireland near a schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have popped up and brought communities together\nPeople of course check books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to see that's what I Love about it I Love if I've got a book and I really loved it\nSometimes going and sticking it in there and then I'll you know when I'm Out jogging whenever the next day seeing if somebody's taken it and if they have I feel this little sense of pleasure that somebody else is going to get to read this book that I just love\nI Love that idea to I'm constantly having a few bucks in my car so that when I'm going somewhere if I see a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd bowl when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he stood out to do\nWell I mean there's so much more to what he's doing thing being a champion from book or for reading he was being a champion for communities new friendships new ideas new projects bringing to life as a result of an idea that's what he wanted\nWell ... thank you for talking to us thank you for having me she's author of the forthcoming book little libraries big heroes

there's energy among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced uh within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law

Lisa Mullen's an obituary for a thirty year old Vermont woman is generating a big response the woman was addicted to opioids\nThe obituary went viral on social media then it got picked up by national and local news outlets and then the police chief and the woman's hometown Burlington, Vermont responded to it\nThe woman was ... she was known as Matty she died earlier this month the obituary was written for her by her sister Kato Neal O'Neill told the story of Matty talent as a singer her love for her family especially her young son\nAnd how hard she tried to stop using drugs after the obituary went viral the police chief in Burlington, Vermont Brandon do pose a wrote a provocative response to it on social media\nEarlier today we spoke with O'Neill and chief do pose a heat O'Neill spoke about one particular passage of the story that she wrote it said to some Matty was just a junkie when they saw her addiction they stopped seeing her\nI remember being hospitalized at one point and a specialist coming in and asking a question about her health history and when I told him that she with it you know an IV drug use or the look that packet face I mean it was openly disdain full and he clearly was\nMaking a judgment in that moment at actually in that same moment there was a photograph on the wall that my mom and hung up I'm not even she's healthy and the attending physician pointed to that photograph and that that's her right there that beautiful girl right there is the person in that bed so they're both sides of it but\nThe lack of compassion and the judgment for people with this disease is palpable\nAnd so the shame around it is incredible and that shame and that stigma are huge barriers to getting help\nAchieve you wrote a Facebook post that was for rocket is in the east or is it by saying I have a problem with the ... the one that the Cape road\nSo that grab people's attention but your frustration was particularly was\nWhen I should have had a problem with ... it was precisely that ironically it had gone viral because it was a beautiful and well written obituary the told the truth about a human life and if it was in fact what it took for places like people magazine to\nHave difficult discussions and pay attention to this I wrote that we need to honor feelings are pretty compassionate inspired in us because we should have had them years ago\nThere's one part where he said if you don't mind if I quote from it or in your Facebook posts she meaning that he died just like my wife's cousin Meredith died in ... says to herself a young mother\nBut if not he was a black guy from the Bronx found dead in his bathroom of an overdose it wouldn't matter if the guy's a bridge or a writer and one of the Booker Prize there wouldn't be we'd be article and people magazine about it\nWas the bigger picture here why not\nI think the message I got from ... about Matty was ... was\nA beautiful person in a human being but that she wasn't special she was one of countless human beings who suffered this way and we haven't taken these ... responses for and they are not just beautiful women with small children from Vermont they're\nPeople that look like every type of human being that come from every type of background and uh we need to pay attention to matter who ... who need Josh\n... I have a feeling that that actually you have kind of a melting of the mind with with people like the chief because\nYou said the do you want those people who see addicts to see the whole person and you say also that the system and it says cheaply use it as well the system has failed him I Want to hear both of your points of view on this but Kate first how do you think the system failed her sister\nI think in humorous way then I think that it she outlined any of those in his article I think it's very difficult for people to get medication assisted treatment which is the kind of treatment that has been shown through evidence\nOver there and just addiction related deaths and it's incredibly hard to get them not he had a lot of difficulty getting those treatments making people stand in line at a methadone clinic everyday makes it very hard for them to have jobs and go about their normal lives of raising children and doing all that\nAnd I think we are failing people way before that this shouldn't be a law enforcement issue this is a public health issue you know in terms of access to good treatment in terms of preventing the flooding of opiate painkiller is on the market you know not eating at sixteen year old\nSixteen year old inject heroin she took a pill at a party again I appreciate the work that's being done at the law enforcement level and I think Burlington at a very special and progressive place\nBut even there is there's no doubt Matty\nChief do you say the same thing just and failed her when I look at the opioid\nCrisis I think that they choose to police handled crime as an effectively as our society has handled the opioid crisis we'd be run out of town and fired and that will probably be the faith that we deserve because there are so many clear\nEvidence based strategies that show her medicine an access to medicine whether you're in prison or the needle exchange or in an emergency department or just walking into your\nPrimary care physician shaves lives introduces overdoses and it doesn't fix your life and it doesn't mean that you'll completely recover but it will reduce fatalities in that they will you to get back to your family\nAnd your work more readily and as a government in as medical institutions we've just sort of ignored that\nAnd let me ask you if it's his trumpet ministry has talked about making this a priority of fighting the opioid crisis in Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker has made it a priority of his as well you know Vermont has done an awful lot so where is the push back I mean where is it lack of action like those money lack of will\nWe have the incredibly complex institutions that work in silos and interacted very traditional ways and the whole point behind an epidemic\nIs a new challenge is facing you and you have to change the way you interact in the way you work when Jeff Sessions talks about his response to the opioid crisis he talks a lot about arresting high level dealers I don't think that that's a bad thing to do I think you should but if he's not talking about taking people who\nEnd up in jail for example and giving them treatment\nThan he's failing to see what science shows will save American lives and then we say why would we give you a medication that you become dependent on when you're already dependent on a medication um dependent on caffeine I needed to function no one calls me addicted to caffeine is a big difference between being addicted to heroin\nOr ... and being dependent on something that people don't often or methadone and living a normal life we've got to get over that stigma\nHe didn't want to get back to you in one second but just one more thing chief what are you doing that work\nOne of the things that we did and it's taken over a year is we just started a pilot in the emergency department here in Berlin and where were you committed addicted person and say I need\nBuprenorphine and you'll get it when you go to prison we passed a law that took effect July first if you need medication assisted therapy in prison by law he's supposed to be entitled to it and get it\nOn YouTube exchanges no staff with a doctor who lost her son to an opioid overdose and if you walk into the needle exchange to get clean needles so you don't get an infection but you say you know what I could really try some medicine right now and see if I'm ready to commit to a treatment you'll get it and if you have some of that medication in your pocket you don't have a prescription for it I have no interest interesting you know\nI have a tremendous amount of discretion as do all American cops\nAs to what laws to enforce\nThey're not going to get arrested for it they need to take that stuff and tried to get better\nHave I Know that uh your sister Maddy\nHad a son eight in maybe if you could tell us a little bit about her hopes for him he's a toddler I think right now and when ... died she was lucky that she had the support of her family she was in the hospital or she wasn't on the sidewalk somewhere but what do you hope for\nYou know her legacy and in her son's life\nI mean I Hope in terms of her legacy that the fact that the\nObituary has been read by and affected so many people will affect actual positive change in terms of eight and nine he loved her sons so they're very much and I know she would want for him to live in a world where he\nIf he does get in trouble or develop an addiction that he will be able to get adequate how when he needs to go into treatment he doesn't have to wait a week and a half or that the ... medication to help them with a ... he doesn't have to\nStand in line for two hours to get it or can't find a doctor who get that for him and my other sister more who's had custody of aid
