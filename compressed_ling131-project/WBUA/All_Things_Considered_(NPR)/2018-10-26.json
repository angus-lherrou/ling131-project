percent\nThat's a huge turned around here in Michigan the rate was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company's declared bankruptcy we wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their has through this recovery\nSo we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside of Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI met Don Skidmore in a big empty parking lot at the place where he went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM's shut it down in two thousand ten it's odd standing here\nSee most ... yeah I'm sure it is it's crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear it today\nA sick I get sick sickening just the word or to see it on the freeway on the way here and yeah it was a lot it was everything\nWhen he started work here in the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed down Skidmore was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third it was Christmas but uh yeah it was a\nDark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way which are\nLike losing somebody like losing your life you know\nAt the time Skidmore lived with his wife and steps on the ... that each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall and took a buyout\nNow at age sixty helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here yeah very elevated you ride the lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen holes and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry days are over them good old days are over ...\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did it the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy still not happy still miss the people still miss my job representing people in all these great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck\nWorkplace policies that eighty so you're getting\nToday John Green is a nurse an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed scribes\nLittle bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year the\n... after she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflects a bigger shift in this economy as auto industry jobs went away the health care field group\nAnd was there any part of you that thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and\nOn about yes very much so I noticed one side was in the actual classes how different it was

anything to do with all the people that was going on in your professional life [noise]\nYeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent he used to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self\nAnd wants that wasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independents again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the work family that you had at willow run how many of them would you say\nAre in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled in on their feet [noise]\nI'm not going to solve the percentage of them in and it gets kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when he retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that but I Do see around town people that\nI worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago\nPeyton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was hitting and many of them have never found their footing Peyton started working as a cleaner on the midnight shift\nAt willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a cheese really you know I felt I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and do all that you can just work hard here and you know\nTwenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but that was not the case

Gjelten NPR News Washington\n\nThe U.S economy continues to grow at a strong paste thanks to healthy spending by consumers and the government the Commerce Department said today that the growth rate was three point five percent during the quarter but NPR's Jim Zarroli reports there were signs of potential trouble including weak business spending\nAs he often does President Trump painted today's numbers that historic and unprecedented\nThey just announced an estimate of three point five and these are numbers that we're not even thought about\nIn fact the growth rate was only a bit better than most economists expected and it was a drop from the four point two percent growth rate and the second quarter still the numbers were impressive former White House economist Jared Bernstein says the strong showing reflects the fact that so many people are in the job market\nLots of people are working in drawing paychecks even if those paychecks are growing fast might like that's going to fuel economic growth and in this report in fact the strongest sector was consumer spending\nAmericans spent at an especially fast rate during the quarter they took more trips and ate out and restaurants

signs\nBusiness investment spending grew at an annual rate of just eight ten ... percentage point a meager number despite the big cut in business taxes there was little evidence in today's report that it has led to more investment spending by companies Gregory ... is chief us economist at Oxford economics\nWhen you take a look outside of the consumer real you're starting to see some headwinds appearing for the U.S economy in particular when it comes to business activity\nThose headwinds include a Federal Reserve that is steadily raising interest rates higher rates tend to dampen business and consumer spending over time\nAnd they're already signs of weakness in the housing in car markets deco also cites a gradual slowing and the global economy in Europe and Asia meanwhile the stimulus
