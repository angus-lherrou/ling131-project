know about you but I have not even bother to buying a ticket because I'm a total pessimist about the lottery I don't even try any more\nAdmit I'm actually risk averse to any like does anyone think they're really going to win\nMathematically speaking the odds are ridiculously against us how ever our next story is about a guy who flipped those odds over and over again here's Alex school's mark and from our planet money podcast\nIt's Nineteen Ninety two in Virginia the pot was twenty seven million dollars big for the time\nAnd when winter comes forward it seems like something is unusual that someone managed to buy every single combination of tickets to guarantee a win and this totally perplexed as the people who run the lottery system like Ken ... that had him on TV shortly after the very idea\nOf starting over seven million dollars while the sharing the largest seems preposterous\nThe man behind the plane was defined Monday I tracked him down a couple of years ago the last time there was a big lottery jackpot [noise]\nHe was living on an island in the south Pacific ... hello hello Hi this is defined Mondo yeah\nHe says that Virginia sing it took decades to get to that level the story starts in Romania in the late Nineteen fifty ... has a young family and he wants to get out of the country\nI mean you know I uh I mean like in ... which was good shoes\nHe decides the lottery is his way out he's a pretty natural ... so he goes to the library and he starts reading math paper aftermath paper and he realizes something about the lottery there that if he buys certain blocks of tickets in certain combination he can guarantee himself at least a second prize sweet pool says money with three friends and he buys the tickets\nWe want Seventy two towns and shoving on that and they ... which was about a TV is a\nGreat big score that was on your first try yeah he takes the money and he leaves Romania for Australia he finds more investors he raises more money enough to buy all the combinations of numbers for the bigger Australian lottery and he turns lottery winning into a business for a while\nYou know I Want will\nEventually Australia passes a law that block them from buying up all the tickets so we set their sights on the big prizes in America he decides Virginia is the place at the time there were seven point one million combinations of lottery tickets\nHe waits until the jackpot is twenty five million or above to make sure that he's still turn a profit even if there's a split time\nThe biggest problem with buying all the tickets though isn't money it's logistics filling out millions of tickets each one different keeping track of where they are so you can find the winning tickets and then turning them all in so\nHis secret was get the tickets ready ahead of time back then it was legal to print your own tickets already filled out so we set up printers going for over a month making the millions of tickets\nThen negotiated with stores across the state to let him turn in stacks of ten thousand tickets at a time and waited\nArgued that would we want right six second Brian I'm going to the un thousands mind like\nHe says he couldn't do it again lotteries have now added extra numbers and there are just too many combinations so the great lottery play of Nineteen Ninety two will likely state the last great lottery playing Alex go mark\nNPR no\nSupport

thousand Eighteen\nSo was it was back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart broke in this case of that is kind of torn out\nAnd there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven games that went back for changing lanes extra innings I've met with the team in spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world theory but really when you look at the team is different because they went and got many without a I mean this is Ben they're often said ... he's at shortstop they lost her during the season and now they have a child and then really in their ... I don't not Clinton ...\nIt's ... who adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honest and one of the best picture that we've seen in the national lean they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what do they have going into this\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and\nEven though the Dodgers haven't won a World Series and Thirty years in the red Sox have had\nThat Boston is that a lot of reasons and it's All right but I mean the Patriot and the red Sox but this is an argument one of the ... regular season teams we have ever seen okay so they went and it was without\nA doubt they were the best team in baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when it all no one cares about hey you want a hundred and eight games yeah you get an award you get a crowd\nYou don't get anything oh you get it you want a hundred and Eighteen yeah they ... they are so good out of it as well you know and the post season the vaccines and always when you got to go out and play\nAll right I Want your crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you think is going to win Dodgers\nAnd that's going to shock a lot of people because the Boston Red Sox are the best team on paper there is nobody better but what I Love about the postseason transcend all of that talent pitching hitting I don't care throw the numbers out\nYet is redemption it's passion it's it's this prior to the Dodgers happy they locked in game seven last year and I believe that's going to kill them to victory this year\nRight now is ESPN baseball analyst Jessica Mendoza she'll be on sports center covering the world series thanks so much Jessica thank you out there [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from W.

U. dot edu slashed potential\nThough he is likely to get a fairly warm welcome here in Boston but the match up with the pitchers what can you tell us about that\nWell forget one you've got two of the greatest pitchers really of this generation the Dodgers will be throwing Clayton Chris Shaw who has the lowest earned run average of any starting pitcher in baseball history\nEver to throw at least a thousand endings the opponent for the red Sox for sale that started the last three all star games for the American league so it should be a terrific match up\nYeah and not like her show the highest paid pitcher in the major league looking at the bullpen a Sox have been pretty spotty is you know Craig kimbrell has struggled somewhat in the play offs how about the ...\nMost of the season there Bolton was not that great a Kennedy Jansen their clothes are gone off to a slow start got better then at some heart issues which fortunately he's been able to deal with and\nThey patched together a bullpen with a couple of guys they took out of their starting rotation a guy that I picked up late in August ... rookies and in the national league championship series one of the guys died just put it in their bullpen was a twenty two year old left hander named ...\nWho was once considered their most promising young player and blew out his shoulder spent most of the two years coming back\nDidn't even make it back this year till the last couple of weeks of the season and the Dodgers gamble gave them a shot and he ended up pitching pretty well\nSo what do you build gonna be looking for tonight I mean aside from like everything is there anything you're particularly going to have your eye on during the game\nI think you're going to want to watch how the Dodgers pitch to J. D. Martinez and Mickey bad too we all know are the best to hitters that the red Sox have the Dodgers certainly have a pretty good off and they don't really have the relentless kind of off sense that the red Sox have\nSo if the Dodgers can find a way to control JD Martinez in Mickey bats then I think I'll have a pretty good chance if not it could be a pretty quick series\nBill shaken national baseball

us more about that is it a welcome Craig payout so what is hospitals we're all here\nWell she's got a very significant role in not only with her title is head of the CIA [noise] this is a place she knows really well\nRare speech recently she said is simple along with London or two of her favorite cities in the world\nTo see I never says exactly where somebody spent their undercover days but she clearly knows this place she's a player she knows how the\nThe things to take place there\nUm and remember the U.S turkey and the Saudis are allies and they are conducting these sort of separate investigations but there's also negotiations going on and this is probably not likely to end so much in a court room as a as a political agreement and some sort of negotiation so that's the key thing I think to keep watching\nSo what is the White House hoping to accomplish by sending hassle there\nWell the president clearly wants to stay in very quickly he's been very close to the Saudis he wants to resume these close ties and have\nBusiness go on a pretty much as usual but he's been very inconsistent in his responses he's talked about a a credible investigation and then he's talked about thinks he's not so sure of severe punishment but then he talks about the value of arms deals so he's been all over the place so here's what he said just today\nSomebody really messed up and they had the worst cover up ever and where should have stopped is at the deal standpoint whether they thought about it because while the thought of that idea I think is in big trouble\n[noise] so I think the president is looking for Haspel and and Mike Pompeo to give him a clear picture of actually what happened who is responsible so that there can be some sort of a clear policy uh put in place\nIn the meantime turkey has been revealing more and more information each day about what they say happened inside the Saudi conflict do we have a better sense about what they want to happen next\nYou know I think we saw today president or the wine gave this big speech and he talked about this being a premeditated murder so he's clearly still playing hardball with the Saudis and and they've got some real issues turkey and Saudi Arabia are rivals turkey wants to be seen as the preeminent Sunni Muslim country\nUm turkey has a very bad economy they would like investment from Saudi Arabia Saudi a contract so the Turks are likely to keep playing this out drawing it out where where's the Americans and the Saudis would would probably like to to finish it up pretty quickly\nUm the ... the Turks have or we believe the audiotapes um there's still a question where the body is so I talked to to Bruce ... of the Brookings Institution and here's what he had to say about the the Turkish thinking\nI think her to want to enjoy watching NBS twist and the wind and I think he's probably going to play that game for some time to come\nIn the meantime you mentioned the Saudis wanting to move on quickly how have they responded\nTo all this wealth today was the beginning of this big business conference or in the capital Riyadh the so called Davos in the desert\nAnd Mohammed bin some on the crown prince NBS of backed out but then he made a surprise cameo appearance and and got a standing ovation so this is clearly the Saudi playbook to a\nTo a business as usual let's find a way out of this and move on the
