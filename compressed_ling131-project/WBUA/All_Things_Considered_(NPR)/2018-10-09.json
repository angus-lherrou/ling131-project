Bernstein is Boston's advisor to the mayor for the initiative to end chronic homelessness she says until city leaders started tracking it they did not anticipate the scale of the flood of people becoming chronically homeless on average four hundred fifty five people a year\nWhereas now we have a database that allows us to see that and we see more\nChaos really in the flow of the population than we sort of [noise]\nAt the beginning of\nTwenty sixteen city officials say there were six hundred twelve people known to be chronically homeless living in emergency shelters and on the streets\nSince that time six hundred one chronically homeless adults have been placed in permanent supportive housing only twenty three of them have returned to chronic homelessness but one thousand additional people have\nBecome phonetically homeless [noise]\nOne thing contributing to the crisis the opioid epidemic\nThe services administrator at the Southampton street shelter Corey Greer says there's a ripple effect when staffers intervened to reverse an overdose using the drug nor can which has happened to countless times where\nWe're all running out in the street and tried to clear and make sure the scene is safe and save their life get emergency personnel on the scene\nAfterwards address them by holding them up with your addiction services are case management here to get treatment\nThere would be ridiculous defended that does the whole necessary resources away from the rest of the population\nThere's another factor that's making it tough for Boston to get ahead of the curve on chronic homelessness fifty percent of people who are homeless and Boston came from outside the city\nI think it's like um seven years ago but frankly housing people like Seventy year old Nancy because like cats were not Kevin\nShe's petite with curly gray hair and a fully made up face but tired eyes we met Nancy in July pulling her belongings in a large suitcase on wheels outside St

[laughter] [noise]\nI used to have long hair before I have shows as I said I should everything is going to the rest of the swimming it's stress\nCity leaders say they've talked with some neighboring communities about partnering more on homelessness but that it's hard for any community to make much progress without more federal investment and affordable housing\nAdvocates say in Boston so tight expensive real estate market even people who've attained rental assistance vouchers have a hard time finding landlords who want to accept them\nOr units that are affordable with them do this Kerry and John ... from the city's department of neighborhood development says on the flip side some people just aren't ready to accept housing\n... manages the computerized system that matches people on the chronically homeless list with available housing units he says sometimes a building or a neighborhood isn't the right fit based on that person's history or disability or sometimes there are larger forces at work\nFor a lot of people especially if you've been in shelter for a long period of time\nYour social network is there and your support network is there and to be pulled away from that is a scary prospect and you could layer things on top of that mental health problems or substance abuse problems or things like that but you know the top of our listeners just chock full of people who aren't interested nosing Brian\nSilver is more of an interested\nIn reading your mail saying that that I was homeless are still valid within thirty days may copies\nOf housing options are limited but they just expand that have been because he got approved for Social Security disability benefits his income will go from about one hundred dollars a month which he was receiving from the state because of his disability to almost two thousand he has an extensive work history but says it became too difficult to hold down a job\nAnd like most people just silver became homeless somewhat by choice he had been living with his mother and she had the opportunity to get an apartment in a safe neighborhood but it was a one bedroom not to he told her to take it so how do you see your life when you get an apartment\nWhen I get an apartment thank you for same Wednesday when I get an apartment I Want to do something like take a course or something at your Web Web design or something bad that pays a living wage doesn't deal with a lot of social contact I can work on my own and be self sufficient\nA big vision for the future from someone who's thankful for all the help he has and getting there\nI'm not too proud to ask for help to receive help but I just want to do a temporary into you know I can be on my own two feet\nAs for city leaders tasked with the once unthinkable goal of ending chronic homelessness the mayor's advisor ... Bernstein says that they still have a big division to even though they won't reach the goal this year do you wish that the goal\nWasn't set or the timeline wasn't set at a time when it wasn't different or has it made you and the city and all the different partners work harder\nYou know not at all I I think to end homelessness you need 'em an ambitious goals and the school has driven us to make extreme changes in the way that we're responding to homelessness and are serving people better because of it\nThey'll keep pushing for new funding from the state and federal governments and even private donors to create affordable housing and permanent supportive housing and they hope they can eventually ... everyone who comes to a shelter with the goal of one day soon getting ahead of the tide on homelessness\nFor Ninety point nine W.

I also feel why now why is he is stepping down now\nWell that is a really good question we don't know exactly why now but we do know that she wrote a resignation letter six days ago which would have been just as President Trump was attacking Christine Blasey Ford that my down to look good if she'd resigned then\nShe says she's term limits on yourself she's going to go into the private sector we know that she and her husband are not wealthy people they have a lot of debt based on her financial disclosure forms\nSo for someone who does want to run for president maybe sometime in the future time to go make a lot of money she is staying on 'til the end of the year but it made sense for her to announce this now because in case the Republicans lose big in the mid term she doesn't want to be seen as\nKind of a rat deserting the sinking ship right when you go to hell yeah\nSo this is different about this departure compared to other exits we've seen from the Trump Administration is that he seems to be leaving on good terms with President Trump is that actually the case\nYes it sounds like it's the case she is the most adept political operator in the cabinet\nYou know she has been just a seller right away but somehow being out of Washington has allowed her to carve out this independent political persona as a loyal Trump cabinet member but not a sick event she's tougher on Russia than he is although that's true of\nMany relatives of his foreign policy team but she has been able to separate yourself from Trump when it suits are purposes\nRemember when she said there would be um sanctions on Russia than Larry Kudlow said no Nikki Haley is confused and she recorded very friendly and said I don't get confused for decades she also wrote an op ed piece saying on the one hand she wasn't anonymous the internal\nAnonymous resistor but also pointing out that she does from time to time different what the president but she brings\nThose differences are privately no some Republicans grumbled that was pretty self aggrandizing but once again she was able to burnish her own brand\nAs someone independent foreign policy hawk but not a total Trump is she actually could kind of had it both ways okay so yes she's actually managed to have it both ways which shows you that she is a really good politician so as we heard Haley just say she won't be running for president in twenty twenty but\nAre we assume that this is really the end of her political career we are certainly not and nobody does um she is not going to challenge the president in a primary in twenty twenty\nUm she hasn't ruled out not running for president a lot of people think she'll run and twenty twenty four or possibly she'll take a Senate seat in South Carolina one comes open\nBut her presidential ambitions are well established and it was really interesting people who are following her career and speculating about its future paid careful attention to what she said about Ivanka and Jared today she said that Jared was such a hidden genius that no one understands\nVon ... of course the president's talked about as a possible replacement for Nikki Haley so she is staying on good terms with all the members of the Trump\n\nFrom Boston University you're listening to Ninety point nine W.

year\nSince the New York times ran an expose a alleging sexual misconduct by Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein those allegations inspired other women to speak out which in turn led to the downfall of many leaders in business and in the media including here at NPR\nThe string of high profile allegations and the me too movement that came out of it transformed workplace culture and it led New York state and New York city to pass the country's most stringent workplace sexual harassment laws the key provisions take effect today as NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports\nThe city and state regulations require every employer to conduct animal training aimed at preventing sexual harassment they must also post their policies and highly visible places around the rules apply to all employers regardless the size\nOf this comes as new Peter shelf toner shelter deli in Brooklyn I haven't heard about it until you can call in Chelsea has six employees and says sexual harassment was never been an issue nor would it be tolerated but he says\nWe never really had a policy or even written down\nNow that it's on his radar he says he'll comply\nYou know one more bureaucratic hurdles that we're not used to

he's as prevention training can't be a simple check the box exercise the New York law requires more than just sitting employees in front of an online video\nThe training has to somehow comedy questions including trader made available during the truth I should answer those questions\nAnd then requires feedback from clues about the training and the materials presented\nMany small businesses may lack the resources to pull this off employers large enough to have a human resources person usually have policies and procedures already on the books but even there Kenya says companies could easily run afoul of the rules\nSo you're an employer outside of New York city you have an employee who comes into New York he was just one good that employee needs to be trained as well\nJason had been skiing is a New York attorney helping his employer clients understand labor laws he says the last year has shifted how employers think about sexual harassment it certainly has changed the landscape he says the high profile cases have highlighted the business risk for employers\nThe willingness of workers to talk about it openly and the potential liability of not properly\nThat goes well beyond sexual harassment you want it to recover discrimination and harassment based upon any protector category not just sexual harassment\nThe law does not require the state to monitor for compliance or for businesses to show that they've completed the employee training but ... says that does not mean employers won't face consequences if they don't follow through\nIf they don't the state can certainly audit them or investigate them and very often the way that happens is if an employer knock during this unemployed and report it this was something that is very public that is on people's minds that people are going to read about and people are going to do something about\nUnder the new laws existing employees in New York state must undergo training by October of next year ...

Bernstein is Boston's advisor to the mayor for the initiative to end chronic homelessness she says until city leaders started tracking it they did not anticipate the scale of the flood of people becoming chronically homeless on average four hundred and fifty five people a year\nWhereas now we have a database that allows us to see that and we see more chaos really in the flow of the population than we would have [noise]\n\nAt the beginning of twenty sixteen city officials say there were six hundred twelve people known to be chronically homeless living in emergency shelters and on the streets since that time six hundred one chronically homeless adults have been placed in permanent supportive housing only twenty three of them have returned to chronic homelessness but one thousand\nAdditional people have become chronically homeless [noise]\nOne thing contributing to the crisis the opioid epidemic and it's not just that addiction is leading some people to lose their homes the services administrator at the Southampton street sheltered Corey Greer says there's a ripple effect when staffers intervened to reverse an overdose using the ... which has happened countless times where\nWe're all let her know in the street and tried to clear and make sure the scene as they can save their life get emergency personnel on the scene\nAfterwards address them by holding them up with your addiction services are case management here to get treatment\nThere would be ridiculous different or does the whole necessary resources away from the rest of the population\nThere's another factor that's making it tougher Boston to get ahead of the curve on chronic homelessness fifty percent of people who are homeless and Boston came from outside the city\nI think it's like a seven years ago ... housing people like Seventy year old Nancy because my cats would not tethered\nShe's petite with curly gray hair and a fully made up face but tired eyes we met Nancy in July pulling her belongings and a large suitcase on wheels outside St Francis house did they shelter\nShe didn't want to use her last name for fear of hurting her housing prospects she says she lived with a family member for several years after her addiction she became homeless last November So did you come to Boston because we knew there were sheltered here yeah\nThe thing is I really have to move it device in because I really hate all this congestion id peace [noise]\nI used to have long hair before I became shows and I said I should everything is going to address assuming it's stress\nLeaders say they've talked with some neighboring communities about partnering more on homelessness but that it's hard for any community to make much progress without more federal investment and affordable housing\nAdvocates say in Boston so tight expensive real estate market even people who've obtained rental assistance vouchers have a hard time finding landlords who want to accept them or units that are affordable with them\nDepartment of neighborhood development says on the flip side some people just aren't ready to accept housing\n... manages the computerized system that matches people on the chronically homeless list with available housing units he says sometimes of building our neighborhood isn't the right fit based on that person's history or disability or sometimes there are larger forces at work\nFor a lot of people especially if you've been in shelter for a long period of time\nYour social network is there and your support network is there and to be pulled away from that is a scary prospect and you could layer things on top of that mental health problems or substance abuse problems or things like that but you know the top of our list this is talk of all people who aren't interested thousand Brian\nSilver is more than interested\nAnd then you mail saying that that I was homeless there were still valid within thirty days I make copies\nOf housing options are limited but they just expand that have been because he got approved for Social Security disability benefits his income will go from about one hundred dollars a month which he was receiving from the state because of his disability to almost two thousand he has an extensive work history but says it became too difficult to hold down and chomp\nUnlike most people just silver became homeless somewhat by choice he had been living with his mother and she had the opportunity to get an apartment in a safer neighborhood but it was a one bedroom not to he told her to take it so how do you see your life when you get an apartment\nWhen I get an apartment thank you for same Wednesday F when I get an apartment I Want to do something like take a course or something at you like Web design or something that that pays a living wage doesn't deal with a lot of social contact I can work on my own and be self sufficient in\nA big vision for the future from someone who is thankful for all the help you have in getting there\nI'm not too proud to ask for help and to receive helps but I just want to do a temporary into you know to be on my own two feet\nAs for city leaders tasked with the once unthinkable goal of ending chronic homelessness the mayor's advisor ... Bernstein says they still have a big vision to even though they won't reach the goal this year do you wish that the goal\nWasn't that at the time why wasn't that are the timeline wasn't different or has it made you and the city and all the different partners worth that much harder\nYeah not at all I I think to end homelessness you need an ambitious goals and the school has driven estimate extreme changes in the way that we're responding to homelessness and are serving people better because of it\nThey'll keep pushing for new funding from the state and federal governments and even private donors to create affordable housing and permanent supportive housing and they hope they can eventually ... everyone who comes to a shelter with a goal of one day soon\nGetting ahead of the tide on homelessness for Ninety point nine W.
