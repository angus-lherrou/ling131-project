California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times this Kobe later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby it's Facebook's public policy director for Africa and she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story\nAnd she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me\nNow I have to ask do you think that race was a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this it absolutely\nWas I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds and it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular black men um I think that it has been shown that he's officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean you think of the classic example is um Dylann Roof\nWent into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to to arrest him without harming him and it it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests from black men in particular versus Iraq for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described as six foot three and three hundred pounds and some of those ... those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were to rabbits someone wouldn't you describe those things you\nMight not have been sampled you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as there is so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nMhm it's been reported that your brother's struggled with some mental health issues is that is that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police are they are often just proportionately the target of police encounters in part because police people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that has mental health issues or a factor in this as well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact that intersection nowadays so he is at the intersection of being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health disability and I think statistics and I think I noticed that the show and kind of the police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person as a black man so I definitely think mental health has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who is clearly the mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who is just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where the privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be bubbles that aren't as connected um to issues of poverty that aren't as connected to issue the mental health in certain areas and connect it she says race\nIn terms of how people reacted I have been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result of colleagues and Facebook who thought this was an important story and who um shouted by the root causes and story they needed to be told that\nAs a Kobe she's the sister of ... to uh Kobe who died earlier this month after being chased by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy chief the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct towards civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she took it for her home and of course amplifying this is that the officer is white and the deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone at Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just going into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nMe you know I don't like that\nWhy are you\nKnow obviously had no rain here over\nRice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring the video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us\nMark ... how did you come up with this idea\n... we have an overt edition of African Americans and Latinos it up and volatile confrontations with law enforcement or traffic stops here I guess for ... kind of tipping iceberg for me\nIt's still end up to a steel he was an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nAnd I wanted to see whether I could do something about it in order to at least to fire behavior traditions and police officers ship which last year\nAs a people charging the legislation shift focus on should have sons were dumped showed it doesn't just focus on video cameras page for additional core Chicago tip for ... should have shown and also pollution ...\nWhat will be expected of the police officers at the academy what we've done is to be objective of what we want to lose officers to Europe while they're in the academy and practice\nTwo hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students to fix to appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally about Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video\nIs as a primer Europe we need to go back and Richard Richard up that's why we can do it but the purpose is to make certain we defied behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the citizens you know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and get who was cast in yoga is right I Can't\nForgive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that used to have sparked your concern here is an African American man and I can and encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tension why would you what level that we're\nLiving as this question you can pick it up and that's fine because anything that do should be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was the front of a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I started getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put their behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens you know what their rights are thought put it in schools and making it mandatory\nWas a great place to put it also also driver's license courses and also the police department of pollution and by doing that you have a great deal of repetition and hopefully that repetition will ultimately save lives\nWell but the question I think some people might have is the question the conduct of the drivers or is the question the unconscious bias of the officers\nOthers combination of both how do we make certain that there is\nContent that deals with that biased piece how do we make certain that and police departments that they have psychological examinations that Fred out that unconscious bias or an edge to just try to erase as best possible the buys a I'm not sitting there saying that this is\nPaycheck every bar code is coming out of our code isn't\nSatisfied with Saudi Arabia is response to the death of

E. L. dot com\nAnd from the listeners to support this NPR station\n\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin\nWe want to turn now to the conservative effort to remake the federal courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd what you've probably heard about the federalist society is rolling during that that's the conservative legal group who's lists of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project\nAnd that groups tactics are now raising ethical questions we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group targeting recent law school graduates who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and the all expense paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and sign something of a loyalty of\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now I don't think so much for joining us from school to be here so what was the stated purpose of this program how was it advertised\nTo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these protests\nYou go concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut she spoke with some legal scholars who said that this raised ethical concerns about what the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar there may even be nothing wrong with it all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learned secrets probably even from the judges that they were going to serve and something deeply problematic about having to make a promise\nThat whatever they learn will be used for and I'm going to quote now from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd just dig into that like the the ethical concern here is what do you get to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts are kind of indoctrination a law clerk is a an employee of the federal government and the judicial system the law clerks loyalties ought to run through the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nIs a concern here that they were indoctrinated people just sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nAll kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC is to create\nPipelines fraternities sororities they all kind of create pipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at this they'd been particularly intentional at this\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program has been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools to professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal\nSo they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far in trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system\nInto judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably find but also to make to make these pledges of secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not fine\nAnd what does heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on online Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending that's program what else did they say\nThey had been very close now it's about it a try them repeatedly before and after the article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to say who was paying for it\nYou know their materials say the generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who their donors were they said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges where\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February they just issued a brief blend statements saying they were reevaluating it\nWhich takes us to perhaps they may try to reconstituted in a different form\nIt's entirely possible use\nThat sat on the tacky covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be her\nFinally today we are going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked to interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood it's putting the opioid crisis front and center on the networks plus the shows\nAnd let me just say that we realize at the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day I cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne ... this week\nThan you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular nineties show after star Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which mere this week and ... we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office ah autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and I was just ibuprofen it's got to be wrong we when I could talk about so we called Sam ...\nOf America's opioid opiate epidemic and he's joining us from Los Angeles via Skype Sam thanks much for joining us\nPleasure to be here myself and also joining us from NPR West in Culver City California is Jeff Yankees uh CNN contributor and columnist for the wall Street Journal online chef will come back to you as well always welcome to be back and we're going to start with you because critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people try to avoid it some of the kind of tough\nSocial commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you say\nYou know it's really interesting because anytime a sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black and dark and\nA looming and a lot of waste in our society there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the the harshest the real world circumstances or that provide be inside right in this case one of the things that was really strange to me is that\nOne of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of racist tweets that got her fired was\nThat she was on Ambien at the time that that you know medication and essentially led to this behavioral change so there was a weird tension in some ways uh in in terms of what's on the screen and the reality of her behavior Medicaid or not in the real world says our\nCulture guide though what did you think of the episode just as briefly\nAs yeah I I you know it was it was actually I thought really fascinating I thought they did a really good job of a touching on the ways that people use humor sometimes to push back against the darkness and the presence of the absence of resent was was powerful [laughter] so uh I I thought they did a pretty good job actually of addressing it very difficult topic",
