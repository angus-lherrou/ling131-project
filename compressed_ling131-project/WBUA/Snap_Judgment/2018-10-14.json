Johnson the pro rock climbing pro free use of the breed the brightest brave [noise] to keep paying\nTravel the world and climbed the hardest in most exotic\nRock\nIn two thousand north bay sponsored the for them to climb in the mountains of Kurdistan to scale the famous yellow\n\nThis location and terrorists and has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year so how are you using an ... guy that destination yes\n[noise] the climbers we're used to massive peaks and dangerous faces but still as their helicopter descended into the ... valley and the yellow wall came into view they were blown away probably what\nImpact of this and the most that we weren't ready for with the [noise] the scale of the Himalayas just how much bigger than mountains are then everything we have over here and at first it was a little bit difficult to wrap our heads around\nAnd came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab his hand employment with Iraq and he was terrified and his rocking log\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if he didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nEnded up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle\nI was like well that's even better [noise]\nAnd so I took his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said here John do you mind\nHolding this for a minute and I think\nTo shift and I grabbed up to his hand and I pulled him up and he was just so happy and smiling from Erie and his patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like having among the sub shoulder and they're like ... will die like soldier like they're like you you want to help our cars and\nThe dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cars and we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to do all asking what the story was here and I've tried to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story was that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goes and they ... they might not our business but there's this guy in their country that's been charged with a really bad guy you like to insult president for\nLife and they're not allowed to release study their religion and\nThe men were from is Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time\nThere was a communist leaning dictator\nType figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of Muslim splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplained that John that we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss was in and get on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this out and then we're all going to go home\nTheir captors plan was to focus international attention on the hostages and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believes that they could not count on ransom rescue their best shot at living with to skate by any means necessary\nUm I mentioned the job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and I'm from my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember best and myself are pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try to wait it out Jason and John wanted to take matters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody\nAnd and in some ways we we\nWe didn't see our chapters as as evil as you might think even though we're seeing them murders somebody I very much a\nNumbers and the victims of circumstances whether specially the guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired\nMercenaries like a can look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but you would strategize about how we would pick up Iraq's bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to be for dinner if you're\nTalking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like as if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats and jump on this guy and just by his throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker rock and um yeah I was in many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nMm\nAs they marched onto the rocky train one of the characters are ... split on now is only two characters with guns to for climate they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and\nThey did this for three days starving\nAnd I came up with just really good game to play to pass the time um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and\nYou start imagining and exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and where you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again and then finally one of his\nBroken asks what time it was when we take guesses and it turns out it had been five minutes and I I think that's probably one time he changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend ... we're starving to death we were always shivering on your teeth were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nDid have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountainous trained much better than it does hungry sleep deprived men\nThey're openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive and do seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal and he said here's the\nDeal I'm going to go back up to your Base Camp and I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climbers to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men as gardening and that one guard was to the Nineteen year old\nHe kind of weird way we're like we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet us and then we were all going to go together it's summer there was safe and and obviously mess that he had bought the story that I spent a week selling to us and bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm and begged him to not only served pleading with him not to go\nIn dangerous out there they're soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was had parents off away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out the he has this look like he's like no I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up do tracking down towards the Base Camp well Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it was four to one\nTime I felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nThere's just as ball of excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just want to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun one guy's got to guns and a hand grenade a knife and you remove like all of that and you leave like one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate they basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified and on the sort of trend especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately ...\n\nCommunicated with each other that it was game on and this was going to happen and we all started kind of moving up the mountain together and I'm always trying to find [noise] uh I'm trying to always\nKind of direct sue away that looks like the easiest way but also puts him in the most danger if he falls off it gets pushed off\nAnd you can tell that they were there like this was the moment I should I should push 'em right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't I stopped on a small ledge went back\nAnd the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something\nAnd I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still didn't believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this was this is our chance to survive\nTommy just kind of came flying over the top of me in racing up to class\nAnd it just so scrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all Mm but as I was reaching out to grab his guns drop the sense what was going to happen\nAnd he turned towards me ... I got up close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping not pulled harder than I could and he just toppled over backwards or\nHe just kind of what the sparks through them in like an eternity looked at me and he looked at me we made eye contact the whole way down\nIn several he hit the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let us really horrible uh cracking sound is really loud and then he tumbled off of the darkness and\nI sat down and I just started falling um [noise]\nAnd then best showed up you know right after that and she sort of sat behind me\nI liked it I can just go out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to really like look ahead crunch revolving just felt like one two more into something like that you kinda you know you had the cause of joy and you're just like wind down there\nAnd spend you would always happy and healthy do\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old Spencer started getting headaches to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with and now formation in his brain [noise]\nYou know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain mal promotions\nBecause he was crazy Spencer ... brain now formations had nothing to do with one another but vendors brain situation didn't seem like it needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would resolve\nAnd this was about the time when you became very adamant with one request\nCan remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer\nHave surgery no matter what I didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without his input\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the scale of one to end how strongly did you feel this way I Would say it's like I said it was about eight and do you remember what you might have been scared\nOr just knock that coming out of surgery I totally different person I think is when I was scared of\nA different person since he was scared his personality which which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes people experience\nLots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change is enormous like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture\nFor is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and it's been too was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer he's worried that if you change to the green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything wants them all met her from it\nMade him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection ginger\nEven if they help you know\nThere was a conversation I had with him at some point [noise]\nOoh expressing from my regrets about my own stern dreams because I still to have symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every\nTime\nMade it clear to him that one of my biggest regrets with the surgeries and not in my surgeries on it's made me a ... somewhat better person at times [noise] um [noise] so\nAnd I get a little so senseless optical with you\nThere's like ... [laughter] okay um so in like ... story with Amy and the first\nQuestion who we are so things like our nature are character or so and I'm Wondering if that's the term entire brain or something less physical and I wonder your thoughts on\nMy only problem in line the intersection of all of those things somewhere there [laughter]\nAnd then one day these questions move very suddenly from either set a goal to their Spencer with having severe headaches again and he ended up in the ER and from there he was helicopter to Harvard Medical center in Seattle\nWhen we first arrived at the hospital my husband and I and Spencer was just talking butter chip British and\nShortly after we arrived he began thrashing around I was at that sort of his bed holding his feet down while the nurses tried to restart as ivy and there for a few minutes as I watched him try to\nCatch his breath I I thought we would lose them\nIt was really hard when I first arrived from Los Angeles and got to spend ... hospital room\nIn the ice you [noise] to see them\nIn a coma and condition than I Am home only I Would have to have dealt with and\nI Wish I could have been union [noise]\n\n\nGoing to take a short break\nAnd when we return we'll Spencers family as they make the decision but no family should never have to make one step judgment override episode continues stay [noise]\nMm\nThis is now you point nine W.
