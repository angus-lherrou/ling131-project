{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WBUA", "content": "Like five months we combine about way he was in the creation of print that make light of the season three small find videos from across the last ... fell to think if you remember with showers ... has seen happening\nInside rally wrapped up one round of testing and I'm so far we've got basically the entire year of the game developed so it's like having a first draft of a novel we'd all the chapters in place and our refining that and trying to make it better and better sense it's a big sense of relief\nBecause we know what the ending is and now it's just about making it better\nSo that will be a story for all the time scale of the yeah that's right so each game and saw a month so sort of like building chapters out as you're writing a novel and now that we've got the whole arc of the game figure it out we can just go back and knowing what the end is like we can try to make all the game kind of reinforce and ending\nThis whole with tens of thousands of people and it will qualities and some railway will begin offers tonight\nTonight the very important part of our developing process we're going to a meeting up with some ... in a conference room in a hotel at some secret location or playing through season three and I'll be watching it with no pattern hand really seeing how the out of the box various were how their first game where [noise]\nAnd I'll be done that for about twelve hours over the weekend I'm half the night it's going to be too also a former player game I'll be recruited them off the Internet or using Twitter\nI'm supposed to be but I Do not know I'd never met\nA lot of emissions we're very fortunate in that regard\nSo you're kind of feel like I'm tired of all I Know I don't know what I'm saying is what\nI Would say I'm not an empire I'm more like an anthropologist because I I Want to be observing but not influencing as much as possible [laughter] part of the reason why we do video as well because I'm not in the room whenever I'm In the room there's an effect\nI just try to be applying the wall and try not to interfere as much as possible there's almost a scientific discipline that you go back the results of your experiment that's very true yeah I mean I basically tell them right from the beginning I'm not going to answer their questions unless they get really soccer you know\nI don't want to interfere 'cause they can't ship me in the box I have to rely on the real fat and that's where we find out where the holes in the rules are [noise]\nAnd the creation of those rules is an international business world W I came all bullshit code is only a little late to like a ... pen dynamic [noise]\nRules are always tough because when you learn a game you want to get into the game right away so you don't want a lot of rules and then you get stuck in the middle and you need something very precisely you're trying to write a remote gets full casual and breezy but oddly specific at the same time\nOne of the things that helps us is\nA this game is translated into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book who will send a doctor translation and we will get dozens of questions from the German translator about where English has been incredibly sloppy or how\nTo meanings if we have time we always go back to the English rules rewrite them based on all of these questions and really get that precision\nThat only comes from having someone have to word by word translated into a more precise language\nLanguage is from other countries so turned back in the whole game design\nYeah in their culture and the language of other countries all if you're doing is going to be globally all affected in some way I mean you're like in Germany can't put a tank on the cover of a game\nIf not if it might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon put that on the cover you just won't sell it in Germany so it you think of the culture you have to think of a language that we think of how people played\nSo it's a kind of postal German fatigue with combat games and things like that did not feed it to the creation of cooperative games like that [noise] it fit into\nWhat were called German games in the nineties and then Europe games which was the interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of a version to direct conflict\nThey had to design games where you really didn't take anything from anyone else who said you sort of passively aggressively got in a place where they wanted to be so if there's one space and we can only you can have your person there I can and I get there first technically haven't taken anything from you know I just prevented you from getting something\nWhich on the surface is is both the same in very different but it led to a whole other way of thinking about board games like what if we were all just racing to do better\nAnd there's been this blossoming of game design over the past Twenty years just from the host more aversion to direct conflict\nThere ah probably around five hundred games develop their general pony selling gangs of everything you could imagine how it was about ... you know ... ... creations of supernatural steam punk and it is tempting to think that in a world of PlayStation as acts books\n... to ... if a wreck trade current set [noise] speaking to him about his career\nOut that the work that he said it's still having a massive influence on the way that we live now\nBy I moved out to Silicon Valley Nineteen Ninety seven I got a job at a glamorous or British started apple so it was like this exciting sexy job as they happen to leave the Midwest and and make my way out to California\nI think they're all four months before I got laid off and really got you got a sense of what it's all really lifestyle as I don't know much security yeah exactly there's a lot of turnover but you just kinda got adept at at switching jobs and you maintain a big network of people and it was really exciting\nAnd the right in saying that you were working on what was called the personalization of the way\nWhen I was working we were just starting to do what was social networking those apps are just kind of coming out of the scene that was working on Yahoo and it was the lead interaction designer working a lot of their social I guess what now you'd call social networking applications say something that no it was rainy defining culture you kind of stuff\nYeah I mean back when I was working on that that people didn't want to put their photo album mind because I thought that was being too public a set that we take for granted now or was it was really on the edge when I was working on it and we're just beginning to understand what they like to like making up data that you'd share with people and now you know it's ubiquitous you see it on various you know basically ... everywhere\nBut it back into time we were just kind of learning with us interaction patterns where it starts happening to document those and share those events wise that's across the opposite sides of the defining still for coach now isn't it yeah I mean it's like I said if you've taken it to see it everywhere I mean people are checking and I found hundreds of times a day\nWhich really struck me the the two days it's that you know work in an old ... failed he's kind of on plugged from something that society is awash with now social media to his about face\nContact yeah it's one thing I'd really like about tabletop gaming it's very different from a electronic gaming and not you know you're playing with people across the table here making eye contact it's like this medium for connecting across your dining room table because people an excuse to to be with each other\nWhat's the importance of this time away from screens that games while you're alive\nBut I think the devices are really isolating you know when you're on your eye patter your honor X. box or whatever and they said they forget to connect with people in those games off of this great way specially popular game to offer a great way to really communicate with people and connect reconnect [noise]\nYou're listening to in the studio from the BBC Wilson if I'm Kevin ... and I'm In Indianapolis in the United states I Jang tone one of the world's biggest fool's game convention to meet ... called the designer of pandemic [noise]\nJim told the guy you know leads to a few blocks away to a\nT exclusive looking out here that the full players chosen from the influx up in the past when do they like to see see straight\nWas really thinking about the excitement with which people on the floor of the convention center will meet Sima stopping in an insult to grow up [noise]\nA golden ticket so they gave him a conflict entering the chocolate factory [noise]\nThey will be among the safest place to get the humble home they gain [noise]\nHi great to be\nOut in front of me being a page and we are heading into this week's\nShow are doing this I'm going to try and say well\nIt's possible that there there are more like an anthropologist I guess we all sit\nRight now has ... ah the latest version he is presenting it now see the game test as as they sign some non disclosure agreement that they are not going to talk about the content of the game\nBy the Trump\nKathleen internal ... to ... this kind of gained the ... absolutely\nAs working together on cleaning out are turned somebody might have a great idea at this time but maybe the next turn Greg has it's amazing idea this plant cell funding able to work together and kind of play off of each other your\nIs this wonderful game that were already familiar with but then a layered on top of that is is uh is is intriguing story that unfolds as you play and twist you know towards cheer approach and you have to constantly be adapting\nWell good luck good luck when he said my way in the middle of the testing process now how is it going really well they just finished up the prologue game gone through all the rules they won the prologue and getting into the January games so how do they feel that they won't
