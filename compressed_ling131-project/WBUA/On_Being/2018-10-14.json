the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally cone who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News she just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate\nSally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson he was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation the two of them have been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before but I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event was to twelve year old girls who waited in a long line\nAnd they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThey weren't instead exhilarated in the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagine that this was possible\nA true back and forth mark at once by bedrock difference and goodwill and humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our arguments our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening Mm\nI'm Christian ticket and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the Denison theater in Missoula, Montana and was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nSo you know as as I uh moved through two thousand sixteen um what started being clear to me kind of midway through the air is who ever won\nUm\nDeep work that we were going to have to do as a society was about was human work about repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that had suddenly become on you know we can no longer not see it\nAnd that somehow that was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum taking some kind of stocks in terms of how we got to\nUm you know Sally you ah you know you you mean you know as I say you're a liberal like your credentials are from\nUm thank you and I don't think [laughter]\nI've worked really hard I yeah I'm\nWay that you tell a story that I found very you know and you're you know how you\nYou grew up as a community organizer and even if you said that you know right wing or is more than my enemies and I hated them\nAnd you even grow up in a kind of ... up with a philosophy of community organizing that formed a lot of people that you're political enemies or devils\n'em and you you've worked to not be that way but in this election that all re service for you um you tell the story and I think also something that you both have in common is you're both parents are right in the thick of parenting and that's influencing how this reckoning are doing and you tell a story of being and your\nLovely leafy neighborhood block party in Brooklyn in the summer of two dozen sixteen and and there was a penny out of Donald Trump's head\nUm one was um [noise] no one thinks they're mean no one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just ... talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\n... and these trolls didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil war or cruel or unconscious um and and in fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of\nBeing called things I Can't repeat on public radio online um and they're going through real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate you know a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\nUm no one thinks they're mean no one thinks their hateful no one wants to be hateful\nOkay how do we do with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're ... well\nThe only thing I was just saying that this is I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right now but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and read forgotten it's\nOr it could hurt you that they make you feel the way you were feeling and\nI thought they had the opportunity a lot of them apologized ... thanks but why did you then do it right and the sort of it has something to\nDo with a lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet\nComes to exist within our own heads and so I mean there are studies that when people have to uh you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to\nWe behave more kindly so there's this ... of technology that allows us to fuel the dehumanization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurture and amplify\nIt yeah yeah yeah I'm ... so I mean part of what I think we do is start to understand that we all have a problem right and I don't\nLook I don't I don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about ah I'm actually an honest what I really think I'm curious do you agree with Eric is I I've come to think that ah that the left\nBy and large uh is nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity and job [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly\nSo that's really interesting and and if we can somehow figure\nOut a way to say okay you know what like let's try to do books um but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have\nA habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other ... and we all think we are justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people\nMy liberal to say oh they're games from supporters me that there are so racist and they're so as long as they can I hate them [laughter] 'cause they're so hateful I hate it out and I you know and\nWe blame the people for than expressing these use as though not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's\nIntention to be good and\nAssume I Try very hard in this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I tried very hard to assume I Try very hard to assume that you like me in spite of some of the flight of some of the things I Know you've read and and and there and it's written and said about gay people I still don't assume you mean\nMe uh well I don't\nCan and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the pension but it's also I I I Want to believe the best in people and I seems to me that's the gift I have to give others if I Want them to believe the best of me you\nThat said yes that's it you know or I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught and one of them are related dynamics of this\nWhich is that the culture we have created that dynamic as that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like fan so I didn't have been a very particular instance are you said something\nI mean you said a lot of us here in ... but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret you said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes and um and the word goat was in it and yes and\nI've had to talk to much will that are all about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was I talked to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed them saga yet that if\nSomebody came through and you know and it shouldn't be on ... ask Erick Erickson what are you know saying this has to do with repairing\nCivil discourse you know if you'll support so we made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine and ... it was just I didn't know anybody but\nA couple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it was someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership over though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bring it up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see there's about the right actually our route several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly be okay with dictatorship\nAs long as it goes their way ... and the common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing point of this country where as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like worker record all this but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious to the people in our city blocks\nTo the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics from Washington is the be all end all everything everything's obstruct because none of us are in Washington\nI'm you know look I think it's very ... two points it's it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... it could be the solution right because we have\nTo remember that before the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things\nWe had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\nPrevention was um that that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have\nBeen shaped led to a lot of my opium so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is that I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to have less and I think progressive should lead the way\n[laughter] to go first to like look to the points that were making here or if there was a sign that says that professes\nUm that people can change and grow and in fact that is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been\nAs a country in the divisiveness of racial segregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not\nWe don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that that demands it invites change in the country and an individual's\nAnd so if you if if your vision involves people changing and growing then\nYou have to be able to literally practice what you preach and create space for people to change in ...\nWhen you see this because I said something somewhere on the right that you know we we've gotta we've got to improve we can improve the others are we going to reverse I and I get a lot these days will that unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna and there's just this it absolutely is those who\nOf faith to believes the other side is capable of growing\nYeah I um I get it to 'em I still have friends and you know activists and organizers who feel like hate and and ... says one of the strongest tools in their toolbox\nUm you know look I just I always returned to I'm One of my favorite quotes Martin Luther king quote and he says darkness cannot dry\nI hate is not the answer to hate and he said hey is too great a burden to bear correct yeah and it and you can't hate your way out of ... yeah\nI don't know what I Want to say liberals and I love\nThat definition of progressive\nBut I don't think progressive have you know a corner on the market of believing in human gross and change right and and you are at a devout evangelical Christian and conversion is an important value and belief in Christianity\nAlso that if you want to persuade someone else you have to be open to being persuaded yourself\nThese are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else to say [noise]\nUm I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological or it's also racial economic\nUm and you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time\nAnd then suddenly surprise I'm gay\nAnd they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we have a quick progress on gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims you know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out as Mexican so [laughter]\nBut are there are studies that\nLook kids who go to racially integrated elementary schools ... grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated\nAnd after school programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other that then\nHas a much more positive effect more broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually that actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask as we um [noise] as we wind down which is\nIf the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree right and that in fact ah we really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a proposition\nIs that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called ... in life\nThat if it is about also just learning to disagree better when more integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been in Europe both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally\nHave said I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric ... yeah you said some of them not what your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been in\nCan still be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all centers um what is the experience you have of what does shift which is what becomes possible what difference does it make [noise]\nI um\nHave had the experience myself\nOf being unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel on line or off\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself in for Neal better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do\n'em try it [laughter]\nBut it in them as well mhm ah people write back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like like a\nI\nHad the privilege of finding example after example I mean\nThere are in credibly powerful stories of people who\nWere you know professional hate mongers or kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things and who the targets of that hate showed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed those dynamics on Twitter people who left entire hate movements because\nThe people who they had been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness\nAnd I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden that in a way\nThis suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at\nThe receiving end of more of the heat should have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I get that there are times where it feels ... Adam and in some cases it's too much to ask for long enough to ask it up and the other hand this is ...\nA privileged can in fact step up yeah and also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road\nI Believe in treating people like they are all extraordinary and beautiful and equal and so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work\nAnd I I Am blown away by the difference it makes\nYou ... I'm always struck um ... ... if it just ... to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture but what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not keen enable and it's not the full district but in the apple is actually in the garden of Eden before evil even ears world\nGod says it's not good for men to be alone that's the first bad loneliness\nAnd so many of us to cocked relationships in communities on line\nAnd we're still a loan\nAnd then we get in our tribes a Republican conservatives liberal progressive Democrats will that try then becomes alone insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more and more to to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people you know we were with a wife\nWho has cancer and I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line or\nAnd not there are more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to have actual real friends\nAnd I I don't think there's a coincidence that all related Lee that we both began having these internal conversations\nUm with having kids um that level of local and I don't mean to keep our being a local here there's not a digital just community physical real break bread community ... in my book I Am a firm believer that everyone should learn to cook\nBecause you should open your home and bring people in who you want to be your friend that you don't know\nUm there's a there's a great Christian ... Butterfield who was a lesbian scholar at Syracuse\nAnd she writes to the Christian Community a lot that you and there is no better community in America\nThan the gay community where an unlocked door in a warm meal could be the difference between drugs depression suicide and that if we want real community it needs to be radical community we need to recognize that our blessings our blessings to be shared with other fish\nFree Jesus of how\nIt is [noise]\nWe under value in the twenty first century real community and real meals and if we get back to that I think lots of the world's problems can be solved around the dinner table with the war meal with strangers getting to know them\n[noise]\nTo ... this is on being today with Eric Ericson and Sally [noise] okay we could\nFinish one minute early which would please something deep in my radio bonds but I'd really like can we just keep going for five more minutes you're better at\nThat lower the attack\nAnd I don't know if this is a slim\nRan for the two of you and then this from the very much in my mind is so happy we haven't talked about the White House tonight right just because we're so fixated\nRead from ...\nReally because there's more to life and there's more to politics has more to us in politics\nAnd um some puzzles me am curious with the two of you because you are in that world is that some of these things on which were so divided in which a lot of hate gets thrown around baby extremes which we allowed to define and frame of our important discussions\nThere's this middle ground this vast middle ground where people aren't the same but you know for example I mean you know\nFor a long time it's been true that on abortion you know something like sixty sixty five percent of Americans across party lines", "show_name": "On Being", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "14"}
