word and [laughter] wait a minute the L Word was love and it's really when someone's heart opens that things really change\nI had been more and more willing to take the risk to offer those practices even in just very secular working situations recently than I used\nTo be because people really want to look for it turns out [laughter] and um it always edges\nOn sounding like a hallmark card but I have found it to be very powerful if you can find the right way to do it\nI'm ... and this is on being nearby Bush's co founder and former director of the center for contemplative mind in society and she's just written a new book together with\nRomney off walking each other ... conversations on loving and dying we spoke into that I'm Fifteen so I Wonder how would\nYou start to describe the spiritual background of your childhood of your life your early life\nWell my early life [noise] I was brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and this is right after the war said the second world [laughter]\nAnd um [noise] there wasn't daycare so my mother would drop me off at the church and I'd go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning\nFor my whole childhood\nAnd um I think you know that conflict children are\nPart of the way morals and ethics are taught is through the models of the lives of the same right so there were a lot of really pretty extraordinary and some preposterous stories of saints [laughter] but I really loved I'm Joan of arc\nThat an interesting idea that Joan of and so I'm just really know how it is Joan of arc and by the aspirations of a girl in Madison New Jersey\n[laughter] well ruined her life is a lot more interesting than mine [laughter] I I I liked that but you did start out as a kind of ordinary little girl and then\nMeditation we still had the model of it being monastic\nAnd so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just knowing that imagine [laughter] right [laughter] [laughter]\nSo but I was just just committed as everybody else\nTo finding a way to bring this into um our lives in the west so first I started a\nBusiness with my then husband John Bush and I was I eliminated and and yeah yeah but when I was most interested in women nations was integrating this sense not just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate\nBut we integrated and ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice how do\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know\nIt's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate [laughter] yeah so I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood now where what you're making\nIs wholesome and contributes to now way which I you know sustainability of the planet and the species and [noise] and at the same time the way in which you're doing\nIs helping everyone who's involved to wake up interestingly we did so many things that when I many years later\nArrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there were there engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that have recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole self into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person [noise]\nRight [noise] that is a chef that is still a\nStill has a long way to go oh for sure in terms of American corporate culture and ideals and practicality yeah this story of searching sites are self\nFirst of all like I I Love the story of how you that you had to find that language I mean isn't it right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take yeah\nUh actually my friend man who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemplative mind and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google\nThat or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was an engineer and number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to\nUm [noise] that they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide whether it was so men decided it was going to be bringing meditation and he said I posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help so I went out there and we talk to and we looked around and\nWhat we identified was that people are employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um had been\nSo I'm after talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there I suggested that we could offer the same practices but emphasize the practices that\nThat more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way and so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they're the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle was mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny Goldman who also is in bug guy or with us back all the right guy\nI'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about ... intelligence to important in the workplace and on the relationship between meditation and emotional intelligence he did that and then we post the course\nAnd in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand lawyers around the world have taken the course and\nThere's a lot of talk now about bringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it\nHelps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question anything it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing\nBut this is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down can calm quiet stable you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes\nYou know really disturbing emotions arise but it needs to be taken\nTo the next kind of level of depths in order for people to begin to question right wire\nBut this course actually offers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that\nI mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing to name that if you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] I mean this can be superficial and it can be abused like any\nLike any spiritual practice like yeah political correctness um [noise] but you know nearby something that really so intrigues me in um in your work and in some of your writing is how you\nKnow like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise] that what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has\nYou know has this very noble lineage um [noise] you know it's what is um that is the tradition that has focused on that for ... years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back I'm Wondering attention over and over again it's a very root of judgment character and well\nYeah I mean I don't know I don't think he was with us but that is the intention right have yeah that is and that's just quite amazing and then in the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClellan\nIn William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to just yell Ritchie David than Daniel ...\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that he was Quaker and they knew something in your work they just read you pull through in seeing that this contemplative\nImpulse is a kind of human tradition as much as it yeah it's in their religious traditions I'm In ... center Owen cs Lewis and the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that forward for me and it's really critical handyman\nSo much [laughter] I'm honored [laughter] yeah but\nIt's true when we started the center for contempt of mind we uh we're looking\nFor ways in which these practices might be helpful and sectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it had started\nAnd um we interviewed eighty people we identified this was in Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew\nA number of people in different fields who were beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we Andrew you're eighty people and we ask them for\nWhat practices they were there's and that they were teaching or [noise] and um we\nI don't know hundred practices from all the different traditions it I mean all the religious and spiritual and of course psychological traditions to\nThey are human practices they really about waking up to who we are appreciating and we are opening our\nPhones during the day [laughter] but at least ... son did shovel us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done a yoga class you know not such like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know [laughter]\nAs soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brass thin\nAnd I saw these arm's reach out\n[laughter] for their phones and about lying down [laughter] for far right [laughter] they brought their phones in front of their [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little ... girl and ... what's sacrilegious right [laughter]\nRight well but okay so and you did I get off work has Google and Google is part of the problem here to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about ...\nIt's very practical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing when you talk about that yeah that's really ... yeah\nYeah um we devised that at Google [laughter] loves that she put it in her magazine um I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices [laughter] it's so simple and we don't do it um [noise] you just type\nOut your email either a response or an initiating email and then you stop takes ... de Presse follow your brass\nIn and out in and out and in and out and then you read the email\nAnd you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be agitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion\nOr maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not in the sand\nAnd the first time we we did it there was a week in between classes and so a week later they came back and I said how did it go and um\nThey all said that was radical you know ... and then one guy said I did something really radical I said what is that\nI picked up the phone [laughter] right [laughter]\nSo yeah I mean there we all are emailing to the people on the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful really helpful I wanted to go back for a minute because I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really house yeah I got off on the leaf but yeah\nOne theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger will I lose my motivation right\nAnd it's my anger that keeps me working for this change yeah but we're mindfulness compassion practices others help with\nIs the understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and then notice what your anger is see it and recognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time\nHolds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because you're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it causes in mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate acronym Andy and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to both see interesting ways to resolve it\nAnd to be able to act on it and communicate it\nWe did a lot of work with lawyers and judges and\nSee how that last time the training about that I Want to ask you about that is so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter] it's I mean we we laugh but it has\nYou know it's a date with lawyers worry that can they be a zealous advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes\nWhat that means and what those judges men is not limited\nEliminating pre judgment so that day judges are unbelievably overworked they have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know\nSome young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking that this is probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not have that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff\nBut they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so just being there and really listening to what's actually being said\nThat can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it is about two to three seconds long [laughter] kind of interesting\nGreat like physically like what we experienced as a press about why that is true yeah and also that you can that it can feel longer right which is all you meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there [laughter] you can do it all over the the uh [noise]\nI'm ... and this is on being today with what his teacher nearby Bush who works at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practice\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise] it's so obvious and\nIn some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I should say like for myself I have um I've had many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise]\nEven a kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously gratifying right it can be out just transformative and now there's an all this science about how good it is for us on the ferry later like biological levels and stress and all of that\nBut it's very hard\nTo create this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my teeth states which just seems so pathetic but yeah it it it's our time yeah\nAnd I wonder um everyone SUB she worked with so many different practices I mean are there is this something where you really do have to find their way that works for you yeah well\nAt the center we we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered you know we've had a Buddhist teacher\nAnd a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices brother David teaching Christian practices um someone doing to be chanting we've done it that way and then invite people\nTo find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um mindfulness of breads and walking meditation right and my vote listening and so on\nAs an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate the began to reshape the inner life\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean it's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels yeah after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation\nOr that once people begin to experience that that they will find what works for them the other thing I wanted to say is that\nThere's so much work being done with mindfulness and that is a great introductory\nPractice but when I have found in the beginning you couldn't ever say\nWhat the uh environmental leaders would called the L Word and they didn't mean lesbian meant [laughter] limit the L Word was love and there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "28"}
