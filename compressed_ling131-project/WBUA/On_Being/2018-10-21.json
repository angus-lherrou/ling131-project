I mean people work in the plants and I talked to a woman who said\nYou know I asked you do talk to your neighbors about on the environment she said you know our neighbors working the plants and\nUh I don't want to hurt their feelings I don't want them to feel accused yeah you know as if\nThe people working the plants would take on the guilt right along with it and you know it's not their personal guilt a it's a company policy and it's a the absence of\nA regulation here their rules here right you're right like California's very strict rules we enjoy it cleaner environments result it's at that level to guilt it's not a personal one right so that was very poignant and sweet of her\nTo be mindful that you know an operator might feel ...

write a letter to a friend on the liberal left you write a letter to\nLouisiana friends on ours you say ... you know if if you imagine if Iraq if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to a liberal friend I mean\nThere is a sentence and in your letter to your friends on the liberal left I just kind of humanizing and its provocative and human way consider the possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own experience\nWhat if you grew up in the family um to me said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know\nI'm OK would've been your experience and what if your dad's job and how much you heard was the central fact of your life you know [laughter]\nAnd what if it was a blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job no I think\nThat there's something actually missing in the entire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or two people with different political\nClass and there is a lot of smearing on the left\nOr at the blue collar class that that lived there serious said look we're the daily workers we're climbing the telephone pole to repair or telephone wire re paving roads where [noise]\nWho are you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year and a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of\nLittle cocoon I've long been here as I Am and the kind of you know it's not only a a contempt that really bothers me whenever I hear it or see it\nUm and that is buried to some degree but there's the kind of a reluctance to to reach out says is\nOn the left\nThere's a lot of good political will but it's gotten curled up in on ... and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong on\nInstead of reaching out to build coalitions 'cause we're a big country not ruins like us I was like them what we need our sturdy coalitions and I think\nLabor unions when the labor movement was much larger him in a you know there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors and classes got together and when you had a compulsory draft right right live different colors yeah\nIn in classes got together natural way they're going to be theory on each other they we're you know public school system is um but we're down on those [noise]\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year acquired of every one\nOf every one where have you yeah yeah of everyone and you go to a different reach and get to know people get first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen to actively be immediate everybody should learn new skills and then go cross\nA to see if we can rebuild those\nThat connective tissue\nYeah I'm I'm sure people have said to you and I I I can into this conversation myself that um [noise] this critique that there are all kinds of groups of people including like
