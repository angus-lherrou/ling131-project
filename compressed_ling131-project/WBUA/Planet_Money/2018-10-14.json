Christina Hendricks and he's about to pair a new episode every Friday on prime video [noise]\nYou're listening to Planet Money\nThe other day I had an early morning interview and I ran downstairs to get a cup of coffee and ran into the guest so I turned on my recorder\nAnd I kind of bar did her with my my maybe we should say uh where are you [noise]\nAh this is Cathy I'm Sorry I don't know mine you wanting to get my names yeah [laughter] [noise] that's probably the easy vices I I'm Catherine Rampell him at home watching him\nThe typically captured writes about the economy for Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop is the perfect place to show this thing that he was furious [noise] All right\nSo you're looking at an icy what size you looking for\nAnd I can see now I see [noise]\nHow much they were\nOn the board to eighty nine [noise]\nAre a little misleading\nOkay so maybe that sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay tax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it which Catherine sees here is one price on the board and then this extra hidden thing that she has to pay for it\nAnd it's not just taxes sometimes it's bees and service charges that seemed to appear out of thin air at check out and drive us all crazy looking rental cars buying concert tickets\nFor like have you looked at a hotel room recently some times there's an Internet fee sometimes there's a parking fee sometimes there is something called a resort the even though you're staying in a place that is not a resort it's by the way\nAnyway Catherine brought her iced tea into the studio to explain why these fees and service charges or not just annoying they are bad for the economy\nCompanies should be competing based on price and quality and not opposition uh and the fact that companies do compete on application did not create a better economy does not create or got better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for consumers that they're buying stuff that they don't want\nIt's like everyone has a used car salesman [laughter]\nI have a very good friend of the you know I I don't want to denigrate that profession specifically\nSo what is your one tiny tweak that would change the world\nMy my one tiny tweak is that we should require more all inclusive upfront pricing including taxes fees particularly in common types of consumer purchases where people like to comparison shop the\nPrice should be the price [noise]\nThat is how Catherine Rampell would make the world better with one simple tweak [noise] hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Nick fountain Ben I'm Kenny Malone and\nSometimes on Planet Money we tackled the world's big questions but today on the show we look for small answers yeah this is something we've done here before we called the smartest people we know and we asked him what teeny thing would you change about the world\nTo make our lives better than we have a suggestion for how you can get more money from your boss how to make the most boring sport little less boring and\nHow to take down the wedding industrial\nComplex\nBaseball it works is father who's a that if you are the team ahead in an inning and you're a bat then you get only two outs rather than three out in that ending\nIn other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your opponent who is losing gets more chances\nSteve and a colleague tested this out using historic baseball data\nWe looked at a hundred thousand games now many a hundred thousand\nWe went back to Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyze a each pitch for over a hundred thousand games and asked if the catch ... been in place how would things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan how much shorter with these games than the average game which now about three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost a half an hour from a game a half an hour of the game yes\nAnd not only were the games shorter say we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with it's declining attendance\nSo how have fans reacted to this\nWell critically I Would say [laughter] let's just\nSay a there has been a lot of angry\nBaseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest in fact he tells us he's also got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for downs to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nOh yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd be able to motivate Eighteen seconds at the end of a game home\nLike wow you are a true iconoclast well [laughter] we'll see what happens we don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in yeah thank you professor thanks very much and don't go to any baseball games anytime soon you might get\nBetter yeah Lourdes thrown at you [noise]\n\nIs there a tweak that you would like to see in the world\nYou can email it to us we're Planet
