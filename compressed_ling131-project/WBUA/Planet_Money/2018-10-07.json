hand\nOh yeah oh yeah you know anti tobacco spent his summers as a kid working on his grandparents dairy farm in Wisconsin\nAnd do you still in the dairy world he is now a theory economist at Cornell University and and what percentage of economists would you say are able to milk the cow by hand\nUh we'll probably or you know close to a hundred percent are able to Ninety nine point nine percent wouldn't have before we get started\nIn the pantheon of milk related economic disasters there is one that rises above the rats and Andy had a ringside seats you it\nThis is one of those slow moving train wrecks that you can see coming from a mile away\nIt was Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter was running for president and he started floating this idea\nAlthough I Am a bomb bomb bomb on them\nBut I haven't given bombers are way one\nOf the wave Carter proposed giving farmers in equal break was to raise the price of milk by about six cents per gallon which was kind of a lot of the time\nYou know it certainly was on the edge of that it was a big enough number that it sounded like one of these campaign promises that you really didn't expect they would actually fulfill\nSo a campaign promise that's what we call those you know there you go this was\nNot just political pandering there is an argument that our country has to be able to produce its own food 'cause if our farmers to go out of business and we become reliant on other countries for food then that is a kind of national security risk\nAnd it's our country has a tradition of programs to help farmers but what do you need to talk of its new does it it's one thing to provide stability is another step into the market in a big way maybe the wrong time because playing with price controls he's playing with fire\nNevertheless when Carter got elected he goes all in\nThe retail price of milk is going up more than six cents a gallon to just going up because the government does\nAnd you you hear of it and he likes back your forehead oh boy here we go\nIt was pretty hard to predict that it would just as bad as God but every instinct I had said ooh this ... this was going to work out so well [noise]\nHello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Karen Duffin and I'm Kenny Malone today on the show the story of what happened when the president of the United states decided he was going to help America's farmers wipe buying milk lots of them is a case study in what happens when price controls\nRuns both feet into the reality of the market there will be a cave in Kansas City a van down by the river and the touching exchange between Martha Stewart\nAnd dogs are probably pretty by governments she don't why you've got to be on a special Maryland\n\nSupport for NPR comes from discretion and from Charles Schwab who believes the modern approach to wealth management starts with asking questions and providing straightforward answers Charles Schwab owned your tomorrow\nThe idea was that if you give this food to people who suffer from food insecurity then maybe it is going to go to somebody who wasn't going to buy cheese anyway so you're not hurting the market as much but the problem\nAndy says was that a lot of this was not\nPound block than five hundred pound barrels\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrels down a seventh avenue in New\nYork City and say anybody wants to choose which one you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was processed that helps that keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like bricks\nAnd this is what people will remember as government cheese because when the government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nThe great change give away began today in California San Francisco was one of three cities in which needy people lined up to get the surplus this\nFootage is amazing style massive crowds of people being handed bricks that or she is in a town that's the most of the government packaging you will ever see just like round cardboard some black\nUSDA stamps on it and he's a state official estimated three hundred thousand people will get a taste of today's to\nIt is this moment that government she's truly enters the American bloodstream as we unloaded the caves full of that stuff government she started to show up everywhere food bank and schools military mess halls\nFor a lot of people who grew up in the Nineteen seventies and eighties you cannot overstate how influential government cheese became [noise] back we're ready for you many listeners may remember Saturday Night live Matt fully has played by Chris Farley the world's worst motivational speaker\nFarm here I Am not getting any government cheese and\nGovernments she starts to show up in all kinds of popular culture\nA short story by Junot Diaz clear the government cheese from the refrigerator if the girl's government she's also shows up in tons of\nSongs and government we bought we we get we get like a lot of them was something she\nMay be government cheese that most surreal moment came on a television show where Martha Stewart cook stuff with you [noise]\nGovernment she became a symbol of a crappy government handout and to be fair it was processed cheese kind of like a brick um Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nIt was ten times better than belt I hate the bell vetoes okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to them but I'm not ... but I'll tell you the the government process loaf was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat board trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it\nAt one point Donny Walberg of the new kids on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger there is nothing better [noise]\nKen's doing the dance carrying doing dance strain but here is like government cheese has become a kind of terrible of how government intervention in markets can have this like butterfly effect in Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter got on stage and said something seemingly innocuous\nBut I haven't given mama's boy\nAnd then within five years the government was spending billions of dollars filling caves with cheese that they could not get rid of fast enough\nWell I think there's there's a two basic lessons\nAgain economists Indian evocative which\nOne is it's really hard to balance what you want to do socially or politically with what you can get away with economically the sucking the lesson is you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you and budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese\n[laughter] when I mean that was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike game in terms of how much it cost for that I've directed very very expensive she's been to\nThe government cheese caves started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen but that does not mean the government had fix the problem\nThe thing about price controls is that once you start then they are really really hard to unwind\nSo we have a you know the cement surplus and now you have the political problem how do we how do we can this cat out of the tree\nThe government asks economists including ... to figure out how it could get out of the cheese buying business without devastating the farmers they were trying to help in the first place\nIs a basic supply and demand problem the government was\nAnd so farmers were supplying an unnatural\nAmount of milk one part of the solutions and was two jet Li get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally paid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk like he people of America wouldn't you like to drink more milk\nWe took a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every ... years old and we created the national dairy board but this is what it was a you know the got milk and the ... mustache and all those kind of iconic programs that we remember\nThat is right Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in Nineteen Seventy six not only gave US government cheese but also milk mustaches\nWith a few other programs and sometimes things eventually got under control and the government put the milk support program on a kind of permanent suspension so these days if the government wants to help farmers what you'll generally here about our direct subsidies as opposed to buying cheese yes the government has\nTended to stay away from buying cheese of solution that is until last July\nThe White House is coming to the eight of farmers hurt by its own hardline trade policies that Trump Administration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available\nThe Trump Administration announced that in order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs the government may be making some food purchases again and then in August we learn some of the details there's currently about eighty five million dollars earmarked to buy dairy and distributed to places like schools and food banks\nThat'd be fair that's probably not enough to start filling caves which\nAgain but they're given a chance that the government maybe in the business of government you [noise]\nTo the cheesecake [noise]\nToday's episode was produced by a left before we got the big mountain and
