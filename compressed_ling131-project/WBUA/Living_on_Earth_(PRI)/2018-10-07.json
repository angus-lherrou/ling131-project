with you thank you Dr ruth at so it's been placed on administrative leave at the environmental protection agency's office of children's health protection what can we expect now that she's been placed on leave\nWell she's a a deeply knowledgeable person who brings an enormously deep skill set to this position\nI'm afraid that um the decision to place or an on going to try to believe may signal a decision by the environmental protection agency and the president administration to de emphasize the protection of children's health\nOften in a bureaucracy when some executive is put on administrative leave it to signal that they're concerned about wrongdoing what's being said about Dr ESL in this case\nNothing has been said about wrongdoing she was placed on administrative leave and no reason and has been given\nRecently the EPA announced that he wants to loosen restrictions on the amount of mercury that can come out of coal fire power plants has me wondering if Dr ... being pushed to the side of the same time they made this decision\nWell in recent weeks the office of children's health protection id PA has been arguing against the rollback of mercury emissions standards so\nThe story here is that we're all cold can change a little bit should mercury and when you burn coal\nThat mercury they prizes and if you burn a lot of coal the little bit of mercury that send each time adds up to a lot that very clear he goes out into the air it comes down in rivers and lakes and the oceans that gets into fish\nAnd then when a pregnant woman or a young child each that fish there is contaminated with mercury that mercury goes right through into the baby and has been well documented cause brain damage it reduces the child's IQ it can disrupt the child's behavior\nThis can be lasting injury that\nThat is with the child for years and decades to come over the last decade\nAPA worked very hard to put rules in place to reduce emissions of mercury from power plants the

on Earth I'm Steve Gerber the death toll keeps rising from the nominee there recently struck sue the waste\nAll of water was generated by seven point five magnitude earthquake offshore\nThe Indonesian government installed a system of twenty two boys to help detect pressure changes are related to the formation of a tsunami but\nThey haven't been functional in years and the new system to be anchored to the ocean floor and less vulnerable to vandalism was awaiting the green light for deployment when it was rejected for lack of funding just days before the most recent disaster struck\nUniversity of Pittsburgh political science professor Luis comfort worked with teams of researchers in the U.S and and then they show to develop and under the sensor network to detect so nominees professor comfort joins us now welcome to living on her thank you for having me\nSo what are the challenges of Indonesia has faced in preparing for extreme events like Saddam is\nIndonesia is in a very risk prone environment Seventeen thousand islands and counting it has a major earthquake over seven point\nMagnitude on the Richter scale every year at least every year it's vulnerable also to send nominees and volcanic eruptions so this is a major challenge for the country\nAnd of course I'm what little more than a decade ago there was a huge catastrophic tsunami event there and Indonesia\nYes two thousand for a sit down I mean at the tip of northern ... and ... literally one in three people in that city were killed I was there\nTwo and a half months after the tsunami not seeing the devastation and still it was the stench of dead bodies two and a half months it's just\nSobering and it's this kind of experience that has made me so intent on trying to do what is possible to support decision making for the public managers that these these horrifying situations\nSo I understand that the proposal to get these sensors installed in western Sumatra stalled in fact just a few days before this latest tsunami hit a I guess it was due to funding concerns how did you react when you heard the news\nI was profoundly disappointed profoundly disappointed\nToo there were two parts to this project one is the undersea network that provides the initial near real time warning and then the second is the network of electronic devices essentially a cell phones handheld\nCell phones that enable people in the community to communicate as they evacuate or move to safer ground\nWe had planned to do the deployment this long September October\nThe Indonesian agency the ... was very interested in this\nProposal you know unfortunately the project is currently on hold until more funding comes in\nSo it's like that everybody agreed that people should wear seatbelts but that wasn't enough money for everyone to have one unfortunately that's exactly the case because I understand that there was a system of bullies there to warn people about Saddam is what happened to them\nThat's one of the painful parts of this project um Indonesia\nSupported by the U.S in Germany had twenty two movies that were operating and designed actually to provide a similar data from the ocean floor a change in the water pressure in the water column\nBut those do is actually had been vandalized and\nWe're not functioning and as a matter of fact the Marines survey agency BP T\nThat manage the movies actually cancelled that program because they were not able to keep them operational so the movies had not been operating since two thousand sixteen\nNow what are the advantages of the system that you helped to develop over this now defunct system of bullies\nThe major difference is it is anchored to the ocean floor so it cannot be vandalized and it uses a very interesting scientific phenomenon\nOf these ceremonies kind of warm equatorial waters to enable who's the communication that is underwater communication where the data is transmitted from the sensors to another communication center\nTo another communication sensor and then picked up in transmitted via cable to land station\nThat transmits data via satellite\nAnd of course the Quds to communication and the water is what the whales ...\nExactly that's exactly right\nSo what it's done has the prospect of now the Indonesian government changed given this recent disaster\nWell I Hope it does change right now I'm\nIs on the immediate recovery died you know I Do hope that the agencies will reconsider is is very important part of their overall sitting on the early warning system\nLouis comfort is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh thank you

the ocean called in such a strong way\nI'm a southern Massachusetts or they're good coastal all of his sons and daughters we are\nBlessed to be people to see here in the state of Massachusetts and we love Cape Cod we love the islands\nAnd I learned as a kid I was raised out on the you know ... and I used to just clam and fish and play in the water run out of sale do all these wonderful things but I learned about under the water and I was a big Philippe Cousteau fan\nAnd you're stuck to it and my mother was an enormous conservationist environmentalist and I grew up with a sense of response\nIs fragile it's not impervious to the things we humans do it\nAnd it is I recall from your book in you're fortunate childhood Iran when they listen in highlands you on the ... yeah you come out of Woods Hole and you can see it on your way to Martha's Vineyard if you like ... it's a great place to have your toes in the sand is yeah\nIt's uh but I mean it's a it's a gift beyond description and it was wonderful to be able to be there but I think that\nEverywhere on arcades uh people that get to experience the beauty of our sand dunes of our low tides of the enormous beaches and the remarkable\nVision that President Kennedy had ... the Cape cod seashore national monuments so we're we're very lucky people and uh our history goes way back obviously made everybody during the Arab Seventeen hundreds Eighteen hundreds or at least sixteen hundreds came here on a boat\nAnd we have always had a tie our history to the sea and in our merchants efforts or the China trade the caught on top of the state huh cod wailing a and you know we don't have God though I mean this ought to be a message to everybody it's Cape Cod that they're no cod\nWhere he's a very very few and precious few and it's a it's a tragedy if we don't start paying attention to how we manage these kinds of things we could see an economic impact on our state\nSo what do we need to do to day to take care of our oceans I think there are three primary challenges a number\nOne climate change which is caused by greenhouse gases which fall in the ocean and the ... the ocean which has a negative impact on the growth of clams crustaceans shells and bleachers out spawning grounds and coral reefs and so forth around the world\nAre we don't know all the impacts we know it has an impact we don't know the rate if in fact we don't know where you could have a precipitous catastrophic impact and so that's why we all at particular respect and concern\nThe second grade impact is pollution general pollution people build that village near the ocean there is what we call non source point pollution view I've run off the of gasoline runoff from stations you have oil run off you have pesticide runoff you have\nHigh nitrate runoff which affects the level of oxygen in the water and therefore the fashion plants or fauna and the ocean\nAnd we have five hundred dead zones around the world and the ocean's today ... nothing grows because of what has happened with this overload\nAnd also pollution generally it affects the fish you have plastic getting in the marine mammals are into birds I've seen film of a shark send or ... or whales dragging net surrounding dragging plastic around it's crazy\nAnd then finally we have over fishing we have too much money chasing too few fish\nAnd that's one of the reasons we don't have any cod anymore here eight of the top fisheries of the world are now over fished out of this sort of Eighteen or so fisheries principal ones\nAnd the others or at or near max so with four hundred and fifty million Chinese who've come out of poverty into the middle class who now have discovered blue tuna and sushi a with four hundred million Indians likewise and people around the world gaining in income and then\nTherefore appetite we have a huge challenge and already about Trump's protein that people get in the world comes from fish\nSo there's a huge demand for fishes food stock and increasingly we're going to say pressure on that so those are the biggies but the pollution is just stunning I mean if we continue at the rate we're going there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean and twenty Thirty years\nNow of course you've had a storied career most recently as a diplomat and your background I think he spent some time in France and Switzerland as a kid and your dad was a diplomat\nBut when it comes to the ocean you've had some special concerns and I just want to quickly ask you about ... not to\nOne there's something called the law the sea treaty was something that the United states and folks from Massachusetts like Eliot Richardson worked on years ago which we never ratified and now there's talk of having some sort of a high seas treaty um that would govern what half of the world is not in any just\nTo correct It's called the high seas and the high seas do not belong to any particular nation but they get egregiously overfished by renegade fishers pirate fisherman and years ago Senator Ted Stevens and I went to the United nations to try to ban the drifting that fishing\nWe succeeded it was banned but today you have pirates fishermen renegade fishermen who\nOut with addressing that addressed net is literally thousands of miles of model filament that ... that they dropped behind the boat drag allowing it kind of strip mines the ocean\nCatch certainly fifty percent is called ... they just throw it overboard so it's changing the ecology of the ocean by imagine if the vision of a UC a strip mining coal or in the land you see it just ravaging everything around that this is what addressing that will do\nAnd then sometimes it breaks off\nAnd it becomes what we call the ghost in it\nBecause it just fishes on its own mind it's weighted down with carcasses it sinks to the bottom scavengers clean it off it rises to the topic and an till it gets tangled in a way or tangled in the propellers of some boat [noise]\nIt's a scourge and we have no enforcement on those high seas or very little enforcement I should say occasionally someone's military ship goes through it and you can check on who's who and what's happening and you can certainly mark wood chips or their fishing\nSo we're over fishing talked to me about the climate and your concerns about climate change\nWe face in massive challenge of dealing with climate refugees the prime minister of the Fiji Islands I I just met with them the other day or an event in California where he pointed out that they're literally taking refugees from other islands\nAnd they themselves are now planning how to move where can they go to be safe\nThey lose their nation state which is these islands increased fires increased floods more moisture in the air because of the warming of the ocean more intensity and the storms because of that moisture we're seeing it in a hurricane's we've seen last year\nJust three hurricanes Harvey Irma and Maria\nCost the taxpayer two hundred and sixty five billion dollars one third of Defense Department budget for you think of that three storms and it's going to get worse so people who sit there and say well we can't afford to do something or we can't it's crazy it is far more expensive to do nothing or to do very little\nThen to actually step up and try to deal with the problem with climate change and why because the answer to the problem with climate change is energy energy policy we have the solutions solar today is less expensive than coal\nBut people are still using coal if we shouldn't be we can't be using coal because it's the dirtiest fuel there is and we got to move off of coal onto the alternative renewables they're there and we need the leadership that does it and regrettably this president and his administration are not only not dealing with climate", "show_name": "Living on Earth (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "07"}
