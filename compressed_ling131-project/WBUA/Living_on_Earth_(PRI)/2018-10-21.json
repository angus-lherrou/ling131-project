turn to political senior reporter Michael Grunwald welcome to living on her thanks for having me\nSo briefly for our listeners who just may not be up to speed on this issue what are these red and green toxic algae blooms and why are they impacting Florida's coastline and the first place\nWell as you mentioned we have two different types of algae blooms one is this kind of neon green walk moldy ...\nThat it's toxic and has been linked to cancer and various stickler problems and then you have these sort of rust colored red tide and that's where you've probably seen on TV the millions of fish\nAre rolling up dead on the white sand beaches up the west coast and essentially a you know you're talking about microorganisms that as a Rick Scott administration is always pointing out they are\nNaturally occurring but they feed on nutrients the crud that human beings put into the water\nAnd that's what really super charges them and make them bloom\nAnd right now we've got a real nutrient problem and that's why you've seen it really you know taking off and destroying the tourist economy on both coasts\nHow important is the health and safety of Florida's waterways to its citizens [laughter]\nWell you know it's that generally bad when the the water that's all around us is kind of destroying our health and I don't remember I mean most of us came down here because it's night Florida environment really is it's kind of me and that's the reason you have twenty million people living here and a hundred million annual tourists visiting here\nIs because it's it's a really

covered with the blanket of\nFoul smelling green gum that's not really popular\n[laughter] no I I I don't think so so a governor Rick Scott is the Republican Senate candidate this year why is he bearing the brunt of the blame over these red tide bloom\nYeah this is a is a rough time for Governor Scott or is he now becoming known on on social media they're calling him red tide wreck\nI didn't look I think it's partly because she's the heat sitting in the chair right he's been governor for eight years and suddenly there was an ecological meltdown happening on his watch he's also he's a Tea

on Earth I'm Steve her what when hurricane Michael came ashore in the panhandle of Florida on October tenth\nIt shredded buildings with the sheer force of its category for wins and swept away entire neighborhoods with an eight to twelve foot storm surge\nMichael is the third strongest hurricane ever to make landfall in the continental United States it pass through quickly though and dropped less rain than other recent major hurricane such as Laurence Harvey Irma and Maria\nOnly the Labor Day hurricane of Nineteen thirty five and hurricane Camille in Nineteen sixty nine had lower barometric pressure is a key measure of hurricane strength\nAnd even some storm experts were surprised by how hurricane Michael intensified from a category one to the category for interest twenty four hours\nHere to talk about this unprecedented storm and it's possible Climate Connections we welcome another Michael back to the show Michael Mann is a climate expert at Penn State University Welcome back to living on earth Michael\nThank Steve it's good to be with you so why does hurricane Michael intensify so quickly\nSo it it didn't count or warm a sea surface temperatures I'm In the low eighties in the region where it intensified and became a major hurricane those temperatures are between two to three degrees Celsius\nAbove pre industrial temperatures\nWhy is that why was the water so warm there there's just a fluke or we're looking at a trend\nSo there's been a degree Celsius of warming globally the oceans have warmed up and it's an ocean heat waves and the notion heat wave just like a normal heat wave is made much more likely with even a modest warming of the planet\nNow hurricane Michael brought some pretty intense storm surges eight twelve feet at some of the coastal areas there how much the sea level rise factor into the storm surge these days\nWell you know sea level rise depending on where you are in the Gulf Coast or the U.S east coast or has been somewhere between half a foot in the foot and that's the warming of the planet the melting of the ice that's us sea level rise adds to the storm surge of every single storm that makes landfall in the case of Sandy a Superstorm Sandy twenty twelve at at at a ... foot\nTwo that are Thirteen foot storm surge might sound like a modest amount a one foot well it meant twenty five more square miles of a coastal flooding it meant several\nBillion dollars worth of additional damage um same thing with Florence making landfall in North Carolina again about a foot of sea level rise added to that storm surge\nHow much more frequent will these storms be particularly the hurricane Michael type this sort of intense quick pop up\nOne of the things that we're seeing with warming warmer ocean temperatures you're more likely to see what we call rapid intensification and we we've seen this now so many times where a storm balloons\nFrom a minor tropical storm to a major hurricane over the course of a day or two and that only happens over very warm sees it\nIt's very intense storms these categories you know three four five storms and that's where the science is actually the strongest in fact there's a relationship for\nA category five storm you get an increase of roughly seven percent\nIn the maximum wind speeds for each degree Fahrenheit warming of the ocean now that seven percent increase in wind speed might sound modest but the destructive potential of a storm\nGoes as the third power of the wind speed so it was seven percent increase in wind speed is it Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential of the storm and that's for one degree Fahrenheit well with Michael those temperatures were two to three degrees Celsius\nAbove pre industrial temperatures if you do the math\nThat means it was probably twice as destructive as it would've been in the absence of human caused warming\nNow the latest in a governmental panel on climate change report\nIs saying that the the world faces perhaps more severe climate impacts of\nGlobal ever surface temperatures rise more than one and a half degrees Celsius both the pre industrial temperatures what do we know now about how hurricanes could behave with the world it's more than one and a half degrees warmer than before the industrial age\nYeah so for each you know half a degree Celsius the better part of one degree Fahrenheit\nRight there that's the Twenty one percent increase in the destructive potential the storms\nThat means noticeably more damage it also means for each half a degree Celsius\nYou have a about four percent more moisture in the atmosphere so you're going to increase the potential for those flooding rains and of course it's impacting uh lots of other weather extremes and global sea level rise and all of these other attributes of climate that we are sensitive to\nIn the past the PCC has been the conservative that when the data comes into the projections have been uh been lower than the actual numbers how do you think this report will fare or when the actual data comes in\nYeah so I I've criticized this latest report for once again being overly conservative and its portrayal of the science and and I'll tell you it has to do with a very specific criticism in this case it's the way that they measured the warming that has happened and the PCC has chosen\nTo measure the overall warming that's taken place\nUsing a baseline that starts in the late Eighteen hundreds and and the reason for that is well that's how far back to your mom and her measurements go here's the problem human caused warming began back in the Seventeen hundreds when you know industrialization began so every tenth of a degree Celsius\nOf warming that's happened makes it that much more difficult to stabilize below one point five maybe it's impossible now one point five\nTwo point oh or there's still a clear path toward stabilizing warming below two degrees Celsius but it turns out that if you look at our budget how much carbon do we have left that we can burn and avoid two degrees Celsius if you take in what might sound like a small\nFactor the use of an earlier more appropriate baseline for measuring the warming relative to the pre industrial you have about half as much carbon that you can burn so it was for that specific reason that um that that I criticized uh this report is being overly conservative again\nIt made some choices that in my view understate the amount of warming that's already happened in in the U.S over states the amount of carbon we still\nAnd Blue Cross Blue

joins us now welcome back to living on her\nHi thanks for having me\nBarbara Kingsolver this is your first novel and what six years so I brought you the idea of writing what became on shelter now\nIt's one of those ... that took a while to ... I spent several years thinking about\nHow to write about paradigm shift that's what I think we're doing right now I think we're in the moment\nWhen so many things that we've always\nBelieved in as truth unquestionable are suddenly starting to feel not true anymore it's a moment that feels like Christ like the end of the world as we know it and when they permanent truth things like\nWell like there will always be a job at the end of the college degree\nTrack or or a a pension at the end of a career or good health care or even things like ice on the polls that will stay frozen or that there will always be more efficient the see we're reaching a moment in history when all those shelters are failing us\nSo your device if I could use that word of course is to have to families yeah living more than a century apart yeah in the same house\nRight and of course it's falling down [laughter] you literally is literally falling down and that's another thing\nThat is in question these days where is it safe to live you know the ... hurricane or maybe there's gonna be a huge forest fire or or whatever but you yourself you move from the southwest back to Virginia because you could see that they're going to be too much water there is egg\nSac lay exactly that it was already functioning kind of like a spaceship that everything people use their needed to be brought in from the outside and in fact we are kind of living on a spaceship and we've been\nLiving on it for so long well I mean not in terms of you know human evolution but in terms of president civilization we've been just operating on the presumption that our\nCulture and our economy can grow infinitely just the presumption of infinite gross I'm\n... and um where and we just keep throwing more more of the same old\nRequest that the world of give me more give me more or less grow more or less um growth in consumption are are the answer a seems to be the answer to our prayers so what happens when it seems like you're praying the wrong prayer\nSo if I were to go through the various issues that are confronting people to the side from the fact that it does seem kind of falling apart just sort of randomly you address parenting romance among grownups women and science of evolution climate\nFeral cats bought me fresh local food suicide tenure oh and then I leave out Trump\n[laughter] I Hope [laughter] I Know\nHe's not he's not mentioned by name any resemblance to people living or dead is a pure coincidence\nOh so you're a lawyer told you to say [laughter] I don't want to get those tweets [laughter]\nNo without giving too much away let's talk let's talk more about the historical aspects of this book [noise] the next door neighbor married treat is very much a a real scientist what lured you to include Mary Treat in the store\nThe twenty first century story these are all characters of my invention living through very real uncertainty however the characters living sort of at the corner of six street and disaster in Eighteen Seventy five\nAre real they're mostly real people so Mary Treat the naturalists who is the next door neighbor who becomes a kind of a larger than life\nFigure she was real she's a real person who I found it fascinating to research she really was the lightning rod for this novel but it took me to find land\nI and I said I was thinking for a couple of years about how to get into this big question about how people behave in times of crisis\nAnd I had chosen I knew that I wanted to set it in two different countries and my historical story around the time of the release of Darwin's two bucks which just pretty much blue everybody's mind not\nGenerally in a good way mostly for the worse\nIt was really unsettling powerfully disorienting for people to encounter the proposition that possibly humans were not put here to rule the earth that we actually are part of the earth\nIt was really hard for people to accept that in fact it's hard for people that now so I wanted I wanted to set the earlier part of the novel in the middle of that\nThat moment when Darwin had released his books and I wanted to find a champion of Darwin who lived in the U.S [noise] and I looked\nI looked at Darwin himself I read a lot about his correspondents in the U. S. I read a lot about a fifth grade I ran across the name Mary Treat a woman I'd never\nHeard mentioned before she's not very well known I looked\nA little deeper and discovered she had a really interesting life and she lives in Vineland this utopian communities\nAnd so I went there I read her archive I walked around by\nExactly the place I wanted to have this book\nNot to mention the she was a woman and science yeah we did a great job the ... um recognize she has a personal correspondence with Charles Darwin\nNobody knows about her she wrote a lot about nature for people who are not scientists a lot of her work was published in the Atlantic monthly and Harper's so she was ... she was really interesting woman who could\nTalk to people at every level from Charles Darwin's to the ladies botany clubs that she founded in her town so she had that I like to think of as a particularly wall mentally\nCapacity to be accessible to really make her science comprehensible\nYou know what the way into her story reminds me of the story Barbara McClintock Rhodes\nShe gives them a Nobel Prize in physiology and yet she wasn't taken seriously for what you do them with genes and corn and all that if you had to stop publishing at one point um so I have a question for you along these lines about how women are\nBoth ignored and the work that they do but also in education how different do you think the American discussion about climate change climate disruption to the would be if in fact women over time have been well integrated into science and technology and such\nWell that's a fascinating theoretical question and I can't really imagine how I Would\nAnswer it and in a scientific way because there's no control group there's no alternate\nUniverse where women were allowed to be scientists freely but I think so much about Rachel Carson she's the person I\nI really admire the first person in the United states to speak to\nTo speak beyond scientific circles to everyday people if you look at Silent Spring\nIt's amazing document it was a best selling work of nonfiction it was very readable very accessible and the years of its publication and if you look in that book it has chemical formulas in it in his drawings of carbon Adam and I think\nWho would do this this woman is brilliant woman who had the moxie to say yeah I understand science and I think everybody else can understand this too I just have to take the time to respect\nThe leg reader to respect everyday people and and yeah we need more Rachel Carson's\nOr Mary trees are married treat or Barbara\nMcClintock or Barbara Kingsolver\nYou can do it in science do it in a novel and I'm lucky because I was trained as a scientist I ...
