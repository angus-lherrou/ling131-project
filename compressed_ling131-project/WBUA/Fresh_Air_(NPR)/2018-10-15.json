being single again and then being in a relationship again\nAnd what it's been like as a black woman to be an interracial relationship Phoebe rather than saying welcome to fresh air it is a pleasure to have you on our show\nSo you started in comedy about eight years ago ten years ... oh okay okay what was the gender race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you and then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys some women and some people of color a few queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want me to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think he can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like that\nYou know men and the audience [noise] yeah I mean I think it just I just want to be clear that went anyone started doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really sort of posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I finally got into a place where I can acres is I I don't have to believe it's oh so why bother I don't want to do that yet I don't want it I don't want to do it I'm not alone Wayne okay I'm not going to [laughter]\nI'm Sorry I just really got to place you know I think honestly the place I got to happened when I went on tour last fall with a lot of ... we did our why why tore across America\nAnd we were both kind of being like oh we're funny we've been doubting ourselves this whole freaking time\nAt a law that has been informed by the fact that we have different energy that a lot of the male comics we care yourselves different maybe tell a joke in a different way or different style\nWhenever we talk about like representation like diversity I don't think sometimes people fully understand\nHow hard it is to not see yourself especially if you're living in society or culture where you are so reflected at every possible turn\nI think it's hard to like um imagine what it's like to not have laughed and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a two to queens that would've been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm thirty four but I'm like\nHey young black women [laughter]\nBut you know to hear to like young black women talking about\nOh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair like totally like mess it up I couldn't talk about my black hair ... and high school with like Laura she doesn't know she doesn't she just wakes up and she has ... ... ...\nLike straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK with being out numbered in a way and not letting that make me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or\nYou know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows\nWhere you can still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like ... or Kim Fields and be like oh okay cool so I could kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman you write about\nBody image in your book and you say yeah as you were fourteen your brain has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning for not attractive to straight do than for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even age thirty four was a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how have you tried to overcome that 'cause it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place\nThan you are just kind of visceral like I gained too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's body or you know I'm a writer with no other an analogies\nGreat moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean there's always that that thing that it's like that you know you mentally you know better but conditioning\nStill make that self dot com and so I think what I\nHave done is I have chosen to refocus that energy like I'm getting back into exercising\nBut not like I don't have a skill in the house is not about a number if you're just going like I Need

all those I Lived among not only our lives but also our deaths and that pleased him too much\nReaders will naturally anticipate that a tale of brutalities small moments of grace and for did escape attempts will follow\nExcept that's not quite what happens in short order to escape attempts here are successful wash breaks away from that plantation the hot air balloon no less\nAnd se ... also breaks away in her case leaving behind the confines of the conventional historical novel\nAnd transporting readers into the get the realms of romantic era travelogue and scientific exploration\nIn Washington Black ... has created a wonder of an adventure story powered by the helium a fantasy\nBut also by the tender sensibility of its aspiring young hero wash black\nLet's backtrack a second to that opening scene at the plantation\nThe new master is not the only white men who steps down from that carriage\nHis younger brother Christopher wild nicknames pitch also all lights he turns out to be a rather decent man of science who's brought along the materials to assemble what he calls a cloud cutter a hot air balloon attached to a boat like gone to law\nPitch in lists wash as his assistant teaching him to read and in the process discovering that washed possesses a skill for executing detailed scientific drawings\nAcross the color line the to strike up a kind of friendship\nSo much so that when it seems likely that wash will be killed in wrongful retaliation for the death of a white visitor to the plantation\nTeach fires up the gas canister cuts the ropes that tether the cloud cover ... earth and together the to ascend into attempt pest you as nighttime sky\nI began to cry recalls wash thinking of this extraordinary moment\nThe air group colder crept in webs of cross my skin well was shadow red light storm fire and frenzy and we went into the eye of it untouched miraculous\nIf only that escape or the soaring conclusion to wash his adventures not just the beginning\nBut inevitably the friends that attempt to float above the consequences of race springs elite and their balloon comes crashing down too hard historical realities\nA multitude of plot twists in Sioux taking first washing pitch and then wash alone to the Arctic Nova Scotia London and even to the bottom of the sea\nCertainly much of the pleasure of reading Washington Black derives from ... ingenious storytelling gifts but her novel is more than just a boy and vulnerable\nWashes weighted down throughout his travels by the burden some question of identity for one thing he can never predict how other characters whether they be black or white will see him\nThe prize scientific education he received from pitch elevates wash but also makes him a curiosity much like the solitary little orange octopus he captures on his underwater dive to leader exhibit\nWash resolutely places his faith in science to advance human enlightenment but midway through the novel he experiences a harsh awakening\nI had long seen science is the great equalizer washed says no matter one's race or sex or faith there were facts in the world waiting to be discovered how little thought I'd give in to the ways in which it might be corrupted by human beings\nWashington Black is an unconventional and often touching novel about the search for transcendence above categories as she tries to do for her hero watch and see huge and clearly aims to carry her readers up up and away\nMarine card and teaches literature at Georgetown University she reviewed Washington Black by se a judge and now they're going to hear an interview with ... and she's a first generation Canadian his parents emigrated from Guyana her last novel half blood blues was about black jazz music\nIt was also short listed for the man Booker Prize and one Canada's prestigious literary ward the dealer prize she spoke with fresh air producer Sam brother has your decision welcome to fresh air [noise]\nHi I'm really pleased to be here\nUm the plantation of your novels in Barbados I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\n[noise] you know I'm not I'm not a full blown historian but you know given my readings I from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more it's much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers a you know there were expendable so the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher\nThe are the conditions and circumstances of slaves lives for much more dire and I'm ... you know quite ... to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like [noise]\nThe main character booked a is George Washington blood who goes by the nickname wash and he's a field worker on the plantation but one day he gets a call to go serve the that the main house for dinner which is a terrifying prospect\nUm but the masters brother is there his name is Christopher wild it goes by church there's a lot of nicknames and uh she's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he requested wash be his assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon [noise]\nUm and it's a moment to changes washes led forever because a bond forms between him and this was white men touch 'em and pitch will eventually help wash a scape but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in the end this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever Hans wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nBeing helpful to his experiments in that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand his arrows stat or which is you know kind of a cruelty and itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really um surprises him\nWith his natural gets sick he has no\nNo idea you know that this this young man it's just completely you'd have some naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a good sense for 'em or an article methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under pitch [noise]\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore a ... character\nIs you know although he's an extremely liberal minded men for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways till tethered by a certain ideas and notions a\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very\nGeneral belief in the rights of man it's kind of were prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nRight has argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow white people to get to heaven if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this is central to his a philosophy a about life but you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to the great affection for Washington and so\nThere's that dichotomy and his personality that so interesting to me\nSo they'll washes scrapes from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how few of the people complicit in ... the slave economy\n[noise] yeah exactly I think that son teach for instance\nLikes to believe that because he has these in light and ideas that he is and because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know I think he has a sense of himself as being quite a moral person and [noise]\nAnd he goes into the world's with that feeling about himself and feeling quite good about his
