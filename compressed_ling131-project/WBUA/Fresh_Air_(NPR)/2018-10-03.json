snap on your smartphone if you're listening there don't to lay on just do it now [noise]\nThis is fresh air and Terry Gross let's get back to my interview a journalist Michael ... author of the best sellers money ball and the big short which were adapted into film and the undoing project\nHis new book the fifth risk looks at the federal government under President Trump it seems to me are you in your book you're basically saying you could predict similar problems at the federal government was going to have under President Trump by looking at the transition\n'em and looking at the Trump candidacy so let's let's go to there the first chapter is about the transition before Trump wasn't even elected because the transition process is supposed to start with each candidate each candidate is supposed to be preparing\nAt some point as if they were trying to become president so that they were briefed and they're up to speed if they do become president [noise] so the first sentence in your book is Christina Chris Christie noticed at peace in the New York times that's how it all started what was the article Christie notice and what did this article start [noise]\nSo there was a piece in the times to describe the meeting that occurred between the Obama administration\nAnd all of the remaining presidential campaign so it was Hillary Clinton's campaign Trump's campaign this was still with the before the Republican primary was over there were four or five of the campaigns and had sent representatives and the reason is that happened was\nBy law the outgoing administration is required to prepare for the transition and by law anybody who's likely to get elected the candidate for the two major parties are required to prepare to receive the the briefings\nAnd Christie saw this and he saw that the person that Trump's campaign said nothing about government and so he called Corey Lewandowski was running a campaign said look I'll go do it if no one else will because we really need someone someone who understands government to get involved\nIt surprised me that after learning that the Trump Administration had nobody who could fill this role in didn't seem to care very much about filling us role that Christie was still sell and supportive Trump and wanted to run their transition\nI think there are a couple of things going on at once one is as Christie makes quite clear but as other people have pointed out\nTrump didn't run into when he he didn't have an acceptance speech on the on the ... election he was running for ... as an exercise in brand building\nAnd so his whole attitude towards preparing to be president was why bother and when people told him he had to spend money either his money or campaign money to build a transition team had become furious and when you heard it was millions of dollars you'd scream at one point he said the Christie you know\nIf we win you and I can leave the victory party two hours early and figure out everything we need to figure out about the government\nSo that they were above that smart yeah well that's if that's right so this is another theme that underlines all of this and that in the Trump operation\nThe presence of rich people Trump and especially in Jared Kushner is the sense that\nThey both say that because they're rich they must be smart but the combination of not wanting to spend the money not actually thinking he's going to win and not being really interested in the subject it all leads Trump's to neglect the transition effort\nBut this is where it gets curious Christie does wrangle a few may raise a few million dollars to abide by the federal law and he builds actually\nI think are quite good transition add hundreds of people who were really qualified to go into the various departments and receive the government for their ... the Obama administration so the bomb and Mr ... has has built this great course and how the government works it's it's you know hundreds of briefing books have been compiled over the past year\nAnd it's not an ideological briefings you give the same briefing whether the Democrat or Republican wins\nAnd it it really is just explaining how they dealt with problems\nAnd so you understood so this is how we dealt with the Zika virus so if you have another pandemic or through a threat of pandemic here's how you might do it you might disagree with how we did it but but this is how we did it in an awful lot of what's supposed to go on there is just that this is these are the problems\nThis is what this department does ... this is how you do it\nAnd Trump took all those people who are meant to receive those briefings and fired them the day after the election so we had nobody to go into these places to receive the briefings why did he fire them", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "03"}
