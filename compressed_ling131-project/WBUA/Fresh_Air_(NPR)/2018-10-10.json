D screens so it's kind of like being in a simulator ride you sort of sit inside them and everything you can't see often that you look out the window you see space imagery instead of you know film equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had a kind of big light that was sort of on a on a crane that would rotate around the capsule are simulating the sun so you get this kind of strobe you know meats sort of a rocking back and forth meet sort of inter vibrations meets kind of everything going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors in for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know was kind of feeling if we can feel it on that if the cameras really immediately getting a sense of the the visceral reality and we're not having to rely on digital post production effects to a to give that sense than\nThan the audience is gonna feel at the actors are gonna be that much more in it you know the the sweat you see on screen will be real the shaking will be real even some of the terrible the real the knowledge that will be real and by extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are in that capsule to\nLet me get this straight till uh Ryan ... isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the uh ... Haitian and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and ... you know or are we a ride and I both wanted to try and make this physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody for lap and question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to\nSay that what did we ain't getting ... from where we had to take\nA we had to take a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second or his rise the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of himself as as you can [laughter] so I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and uh you know\nHave you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to ride that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting\n... another thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off in hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and\nSaid can you tackle the bat that sound design for seems like the one we've been talking about [noise]\nWell I mean I think one of the great opportunities was put in space in film is is actually how you can play with sound or you can play with the silence of space itself that kind of you know soul sucking void now that that that is a space um injustice position with ah just the praised the\nKind of noise making machinery that these capsules were again these weren't the kind of clean a\nSort of you know this is an hyper speed kind of beam me up Scotty space this is a this is freaking machinery kind of are making its way up there so something like a\nLike the spin sequence we were talking about you know certainly we wanted to kind of a try to hit an emotional reality for that uh in the sense that we sort of way to augment the sounds you would actually here with with you know sounds that were kind of hopefully help the audience really immerse themselves in the experience you know you want to go that extra mile\nBut uh but I also think kind of trying to continually reminded audiences whether it's just with subtle things like little creeks a little drones and bones of of of the of the hardware to too much louder things like things really going haywire just whenever possible remind them that this is\nThis is a piece by piece a hand built machine this is not something that uh you know these spacecrafts are something that are just delivered from the future\nAnd often they would sound like that\n[noise] you know I'm I'm a moment that stands out in my mind from the film is right before the moon flight\nMasha put together a press state meant about the ... of the men on the flight\nBecause they're planning for a possible catastrophe mhm um and so you know they basically sending these astronaut off into space hoping that land on the moon but if they don't ask don't guess they don't national preparing you know basically a eulogy and press release eulogy\nUm get get that actually happened\nYeah yeah I mean you could find the uh ... you know ... you can search it on line in a band of moon disaster um and ah what sort of the you know the the sort of had it on the copy a\nAnd so the sheet of paper you see a you see a a gear and Heinz who plays ... movie hold it is is a pretty closely modeled after you know the actual uh uh uh the actual sort of format in paper um or that you can uh again but you can find a line and and the wording as is word for word um and it's really I mean it's it's a\nI actually really love that that speech because uh you know thank thank God it was never given\nBut in a way to calculate in such a poetic beautiful way the willingness to sacrifice and and this kind of a reminder of the greater goals of all of it um you know that there's a line in the in the speech says basically a from now on anyone who looks up at the er at the moon will know that there's some part of another world that is forever mankind\nAnd there's just a a a you know obviously a combination of tragedy and in reading that knowing what the intended that speech was\nBut yet also at the same time this incredible kind of hope and that sort of a unifying kind of outlook on what space travel could do you know and what these sort of a risky costly brave ventures could maybe do for for the country and for humanity\nI was wondering if the astronaut Neil Armstrong knew that NASA was riding his obituary just in case [noise]\nYou know I I um I don't know that for sure I think you know one fascinating thing about Neal and and his colleagues was just how close to death they\nAre live their lives and and seemed willing to live their lives and it's also not a conversation that's unique to test pilots are astronauts you know it's something that families are all over the country and all over the world\nConversations that they sometimes have to have or any sort of service for country often involves you know at least that risk and it's it's something I think it's helpful to to remind people up\nAnd I guess just ... he directed the new film first man and

[noise]\nI Want to ask you about the music that Neil Armstrong plays on the moon and I think there's any music he actually brought with him to play after the space landing in my right about that\nThis is music he plays on the way to the moon I think is what you're referring yeah and the way to the moon yes yeah yeah that and yet so it's\nIt's a ... piece called lunar Rhapsody yup and when I find really interesting about that is that you know this comes into that category about of of China that's been described as exotic uh\nBut you know this track has it has like if I may describe it this way with all due respect he Neil Armstrong like like Hollywood style celestial voices ... incredibly like Florida piano\nIf it's like in my opinion and again with all due respect it's pretty ... and having\nKind of transcendent experience of like being on your point of the moon and plane was like really corny [laughter]\nCorny version of what you know lunar might be it just strikes me as so it just so strange and I asked somebody in the I Know how interested you are in music and how like you play music so how did it strike you\nI was fascinated by it you know it was another surprise among many you know that I serve learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually in the rye himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is a\nSo Florida or you know are so little known there were also more famous ... music that ah that Neal and so the other astronauts play during the course of their mission they played a piece from by divorce shock and awe\nAnd whatnot but it's you know strange little less Baxter to uh was something that was actually a Neal and Janet listens to together that they loved together when they were young and love and in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nOr in space and as I learned someone who was you know ah who is having a you know going through a tough time on a family level in a marriage level um would kind of unexpectedly play distracted really no one\nListening no Mitch control certainly known in the world overhearing would have any real connection too\nHe loved except for Janet I'm that actually I found really moving and felt like another way of of tying earth to the moon you know time space and and the sort of cause most to uh you know those intimate behind closed doors moments between husband and wife\nI said well why don't we hear a a little bit of the record that we've been talking about which is called RNA Rhapsody\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nOh [laughter] oh\n[noise]\n\n\nWell\nThat's an interesting which Neil Armstrong played on the way to the moon and teased and and then when the first man which has directed by ... who also directed a lot of land and ready to and also wrote and directed whiplash\nOn and they found remarkable was that you were working on land before first man but a lot of land wasn't turnaround sound like you hadn't really began shooting it right\nYeah I I first met Ryan or to talk to him about first man ah and ah so you know that that was you know a few years until ... kind of languishing you know life it was sort of you know just\nA a you know\nI've been trying to get a made for a while and with no success in and a thrill out of stops and starts and and uh and during that time I er I made whiplash and then during and after that I was given this book a first manned by Jim Hansen and a\nFell in love with that and and and went to Ryan and said hey would you be interested in playing Neil Armstrong and he said oh that sounds really interesting and oh by the way also here a year into musicals you have a musical script and I said oh yeah you like musicals so the I Love Gene Kelly and\nWe talked about she jelly for a few hours and are suddenly the next year and a half of our life was not first man but a lot of land\nBut as soon as Laaleen was done you know this project had been kind of simmering in the background and and uh we jumped right into the\n[noise] so I'm finally what brings you the most joined the most anxiety and doing a movie like first man which they so much technical stuff you had to deal you know it's like sound effects and reproducing I'm a space capsules in space flight and creating like\nReplicating real ... miniatures it's it's it's\nYou know ... is a complex film but that's like the choreography in a camera work and the dreamy sequences this is like really difficult in a in a whole other level\nYeah I mean I I think everything you describe gave me a lot of a lot of anxiety a lot of sleepless nights I'm I think even more than that you know it was it was a little bit the responsibility the weight of history and I think particularly knowing\nThat I'm a ... and Ryan has said something very similar to a knowing that Neal's kids were going to see this film you know they've been very helpful with us\nA all through the making of it and and helping us get it right up and knowing that at the end of the day this was a film that they were are going to see and they weren't going to see a store called figure on screen they were going to see their mom and their dad or they wouldn't see themselves they're going to see their family life\nIt it was just a kind of responsibility that certainly I hadn't felt before as a filmmaker um and I think it was a it was a good fire you know sort of lit a fire under my self and all of us to just go that that much further work that much harder to you know really get it right in pay proper tribute to ah to these people\nYou mentioned that thank you so much for talking with us it's been great to have you back on ... congratulations\nAnd thank
