hundred nine four seven auto\nThis this year and now we had the rare opportunity last week to speak with Alan Greenspan the man who led the Federal Reserve from Nineteen eighty seven to two thousand six he served through booms and recessions he's now Ninety two we asked him about the recent volatility in the stock market\nWell I think it's basically the combination of not what the fed is doing which remember short term interest rates and it's what the market itself is doing for the ten year treasury note and say the thirty year treasury bond very moved up significantly\nWe also asked him whether the tax cuts had already had their impact on the economy or whether there was more to come\nThe impact has been really quite significant but it's already completed\nHe did say the impact of the tax cuts on the deficit is concerning and could lead to inflation we also talked with him about the economy more generally he writes about it in his new book capitalism in America a history which he co authored with Adrian will drudge I asked Alan Greenspan if there are two economies in America\nWho have more than two it's more directly related to a\nStructure new for me for example the so called rust belt is populated largely by industries which are very old\nSilicon Valley for example is a classic case of who've already knew\nThey were very different pockets of economic growth and various degrees of stagnation\nThrew out the country and it depends obviously whether you Gregory in areas where we're sort of being prices mean something or whether you're on the west coast or where the issue of high tech stock prices a little one everyone talks about\nSo the only thing about this country is very diverse depends where you are\nYou right in your book that the growth surge of this country experience from Nineteen Ninety eight to two thousand for it increasingly looks like a brief interruption of a much longer term decline rather than the dawn of a new era of tech driven growth why do you say that\nWell when you look out into the future or we're slowing down our rate of growth and productivity why well basically because fear you know\nWhen to deal with fear it is very difficult to classify budget can you can look at the consequences of it on the consequence is basically a suppressed level of innovation and therefore of capital investment\nAnd uh this inclination to take risks\nIn the book insulin I might add discussing whether the law of the long term outlook is all about you know we say that the issue the aging of the population and its consequences on entitlements and so having a significant negative deterioration over the long run\nThe reason for that is what the data on a critically show\nHis or her in title ... which are mandated by law\nOf gradually hundred inexorably driving out gross domestic savings in the economy\nDollar for dollar on so long as that happens we have to borrow from abroad which is a columnist chump deficit and uh we're not built up in a trillion dollar debt to foreigners\nBut what this is causing this\nIs largely the demographic issue the fact that the population is aging\nRight now the official actuaries of their Social Security system so in order\nRetirement funds and balance they'd have to cut benefits by twenty five percent and definitely into the future to do you think they should do that [laughter]\nFor civil rights like it's going to happen I don't know but this is one of the reasons why inflation is the major problem out there\nSo long as you don't do it because the debt overall total government that low over a rise indefinitely and that is an unstable situation where\nYou say inflation it it it's a big problem out there who we've been talking about this for years that inflation is actually remain very low for the last many years\nThat's correct and in fact it's been at the lowest in American history and that's all the more reason to be concerned about for example interest rates in fifth century bc Greece when not terribly different from where they are today\nSo the presumption is that interest rates will rise if for no other reason that they're below the long term human nature to determine stability\nWhat do you say to people who say that you kept interest rates to low or during the dot com boom or or right afterwards and that that helped lead to what we saw back in two thousand eight\nRecent we should've rates low as you point employment rates so what's the fact that productivity was rising at a very rapid pace the dot com boom was no moving through the economy the latter part of the nineties\nSo the reason we did move is that we didn't see that the signals were there and indeed the unemployment rate kept falling oh well below the usual expectation of like four percent\nBut with productivity rising as rapidly as it did it change the numbers and indeed uh the unemployment rate kept falling below four percent with no impact on inflation\nSo if does low interest rates were not a a cause of the financial crisis in your view what was what do you think led to that in two thousand\nI think that what we specifically learn strangely for the first time in two thousand and it\nIs there a two conditions are hired for a crisis\nOne is a toxic assets like a secure dies two mortgages but the critical issue is how those mortgages financed and what may or finance or by leverage that that's the dangerous signal\nYou see anything like that right now no not in any area\nWell either one of the general now that that was a very extraordinary period in court narrowly it would've been wholly inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to keep rates down during that period of very low unemployment that was what the period was\nI was having a conversation with somebody in the banking industry recently who said that one of their concerns was that unemployment is so low right now I'm that they're going to be a lot of people who are hired\nFor jobs and paid more than they should be paid and they're not actually qualified because it's a job seekers market right now that that the people that want to hire are having a difficult time in many cases hiring people and that that is going to lead to lower productivity and potentially inflation what do you think about that\nWell basically it's it's not lower part of it but it's an issue when you get the sort of tight labor market wage rates president arrives often assessment of\nAn extra wage rate rises which affect the cost of production and hence induced corporations to start raising prices basically because their costs are going up\nThat's where the problem is that has a really big on that\nI Want to ask you about one more big thing that you talk about in your book or an as the issue of creative destruction um first of all explain what that means\nMore creative destruction is the process by which people do two things they continuously invest but the investment is displacing older equipment but more importantly it engenders unemployment\nAnd uh it's to process which unfortunately is a necessary condition for growth and standards of living\nYou have to let bad things happen in order for the overall picture to be better in the future\nWell because the very nature of progress economically of reports\nJoke of creative destruction which means essentially for example when a boot open heart ...

Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh that's where Rogers\nWas born a he moved to scroll hill when he got married Roberta thank you for joining us and you knew Fred Rogers what can you tell us first of all about his time in squirrel hill\nWell that this is really sad day in the neighborhood [laughter] um I Know that John infringe on I ... the community that diverse than the diversity in the community of squirrel hell\nAnd um he loved walking down the streets and\nI'm noticing the trees and then the various temples and synagogues and churches um that all made him feel at home um the bakeries that delicatessens and he often commented that you could hear yet he said he'd better than a dozen other languages spoken\nAnd walk down the street that community\nHe actually learned uber didn't he get gas well do you think that part of the Mr Roger's neighborhood that we saw on television was based on scroll hill\nI'm In the neighborhood I think I'm certainly had\nSome of the philosophy of the squirrel hell neighborhood um you know I think that it it was a fantasy name for it and they make to leave but I think what came through with the way people cared for one another which certainly I think what's reflected to him is through the ... community\nAnd probably I'll second electro community where he grew up\nDuring the time he made his show there were not mass shootings are in the news the way there are today but there was certainly violence\nOr we're reminded of Nineteen sixty eight after Robert Kennedy's assassination that word assassination came up in a special that Mr Rogers I did and the puppet Daniel tiger I had this question for lady ...\nWhat does this fascination me [noise]\n\nYou've heard that a lot today\nDidn't know what it meant [noise]\n[noise] oh somebody getting killed in\nSort of surprised to lay what's happened you know stand men killed that other men I Know and\nA lot of people talking about it right now too many people are talking about it a lot of people are sad scared about it you know [noise] they talk about some other day he like [noise]\nSound a courtesy of the Fred Rogers company late ... lady Evelyn goes on to change\nThe subject to a picnic but Daniel tigers says he doesn't feel like a picnic a she says that's okay what do you think Fred Rogers talked kids about how to handle difficult emotions like the ones that I'm sure many are experiencing right now after what we just saw\nWell I think one of the things that he taught us all is that it's All right to have these feelings to feel sad and to feel angry and to be afraid that there's nothing wrong with those feelings but that it does help if we can talk to someone so for children the message was that\nA grown ups are there to listen and I think that the message to grown ups were\nListening to the children is very important and letting them tell us what they understand about it and helping them to learn to make sense of what they see and one of the things that Fred often said was that his mother always told him in times of crisis\nOr to look for the helpers and I think certainly in the Pittsburgh area of what we saw where all the helpers the emergency response team the police officers the firefighters the ambulances the doctors the nurses everyone\nUm has surrounded this community with caring and that's one of the things I think we can help children recognize and identify with so that they identify with\nThe helpers than not those who who uh cause destruction\nI've seen a line a lot on Twitter in the last couple of days look for the helpers yes as part of that same special that aired in Nineteen sixty eight Fred Rogers actually address parent's directly about violence will just and\nI've been terribly concerned about the graphic display of violence which the media has been showing recently\nAnd\nI played for your protection and support of your young children\nThere is just so much that a very young child can say with out of me overwhelming\n[noise] what do you think Fred Rogers would be telling parents um right now to do with their kids\nWell I I think one of the things that it probably is helpful is for all of that is to find time and space to be together away from media where we can talk\nAnd share um are comforting of each other so I think that's an important thing but I also think one of the messages that Fred Rogers gave was that we have to figure out how to make ... attractive [laughter]\nI think that um dwelling on on the violence of course undermines that message\nSo looking for the helpers helps the see the good that is still around us\nFor grabs you said that we have one life to live on this earth and we can spend that time encouraging people to demean this life and be hateful or we can spend that time creating a encouragement and spaces where children it and and others can use this life\nI'm In very meaningful and creative ways\nTo were British ... what do you think Fred Rogers and you knew Fred Rogers before he died in two thousand three what do you think that you would think of what happened in his neighborhood over the weekend\nWhile I think he would be horrified by what happened and and he would he would be concerned about the children she would be concerned\nThat they may be afraid and they may be angry and they may see these reactions in the adults\nAnd so it's important for us to help children learn that the feelings are normal and manageable but find ways to talk about it and find ways to express anger and find ways to express sadness I'm In ways that are not harmful to other people\nUm and I you know I think that that comforting if neighborhoods [noise] um I think he would also say we need to turn to our neighbors and neighbor in the greatest sense of the world and everyone who lives on this planet is a neighbor\nUm and reach out and and to provide support to our neighbors to people of all backgrounds of all faiths of all races I'm so that we can live together on this earth and very productive ways\nWhat's this been like for you living right there outside Pittsburgh\nUh it's um [noise]\nWell it's been very hard I've been I'm meeting and talking with some of the teachers um in early childhood programs my my own background that child development in early childhood\nAnd so I've been talking to some of the teachers and the directors of programs um some of the the the Jewish preschool programs about what we can do we're actually going to be having a conference next week", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city":
