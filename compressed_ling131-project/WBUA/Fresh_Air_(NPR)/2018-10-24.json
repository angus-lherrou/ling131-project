collection of short stories and I went to the bookstore in Brooklyn called book court which is which is now closed looking for any other book of his\nOpened up wildlife and honestly from the first sentence or even the first paragraph remains probably one of my favorite in any book ever so I was sort of immediately in just as a reader I mean not not I'm going to make a film but while this book is for me\nAnd honestly one of the hard things for me was that I didn't have any long time 'cause I'm quite used about somebody's always asking a question from here you have to make a million decision today but I loved that feeling of collaboration with every little bit of the crew\nAnd sort of just helping to create like a space where we could all kind of go to work together and you're almost like

of the twentieth century\nUm during the early days when they are discovering that there's oil there and\nUm there's an oil man played by Daniel Day Lewis is a bit of a con man and also incredible capitalistic comes to town and wants to\nGet as much of the oil there as possible you want some money from oil and you and have become antagonists and in in one scene in Oregon here he's basically told by one landowner that he'll sign over the oil rights\nTo Daniel Day Lewis if Daniel Day Lewis agreed to be baptized by you\nAnd your makeshift church mhm so this is a scene where you're baptize ing him and I should just say parent that ugly\nThat the Daniel Day Lewis character earlier in the film he's taken in a boy whose father was in was killed in a mining accident\nAnd then when the boy goes deaf as a result of another ah oil accident I'm Daniel Day Lewis sense him away to school okay so here's the scene with my guest Paul day now and I know they let us\nWe still with us here what

film that that is seen as almost like this incredible operatic do wet\nDid you think of it that way when you're making it [noise]\nIt was sort of intense just to hear that you know that it's time for me\nI I'm I was sort of cast the last minute and this and I started about four days after I was cast in this part\nYou were initially cast as the preachers brother\nYeah and then they moved to be yeah the the teen preacher is that why those two characters became became twins were they not twins we're there were just brother they're just brothers but now that you were playing both of us so they saw something in you where they wanted you to play the bigger\nPart yes I suppose so but you know ... so I mean sort of sort of why it was going back there is just listening that quick you know gave me I'm a feeling which was I just remember the the two days before I started\nSpending set up to sun down in that church alone um you know he lives church and\nThat was a really sort of um beautiful couple of days just sort of trying to learn the script and make contact with the ... the character and in an image empty church or I don't know why that's when I went back to\nIt was your idea to to
