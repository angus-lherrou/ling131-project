know that\nThey might not actually get a lot of evidence because there's very rarely good evidence and many of these cases particularly those that happened thirty six years ago so they have to look at the credibility of each person\nLast Tuesday while the FBI investigation we're still going on into Brett Kavanaugh President Trump spoke to reporters on the south lawn of the White House before boarding a flight this was October second\nAnd so this this was before the Senate voted on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court before they confirmed him so this is President Trump\nWhile I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America what is your ... or ... you may not be guilty of which is a very very very difficult time [noise]\nWere funded by you our listeners and but

noted rugs tribal village pieces last contemporary in coastal garbage regarding rugs dot com [noise]\nThis is fresh air\nLet's get back to my interview with Vanessa ... is author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what what was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses there was a huge shift\nIn the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um many students said to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault maybe it had to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of the three years that idea was completely blown up water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people the way you a grass on people in speech and make them feel like justice or like dirty like a sexual object I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually\nTake this [noise] so um it is there are no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now I don't\nThink that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in line at about this issue I understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but I think that\nPart of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition [noise]\nSo um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes well there's a huge difference\nSomething I guess means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now\nA yes you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable in their meaning which I suppose means I mowed our ground are pulling off clothes that are and from looking at this and researching it I\nDidn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is a\nReally good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's in a workplace you might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask that question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time\nSo why were you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind well I'm an adult\nKnow I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens in sex is something that ... broken that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people nuts part is a\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm In China acts we had the question you know should I get a condom which was\nA a question about protection but it was really a permission question um they really have to be an extra question ...\nYou read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is that it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness when he me\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me and pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until band up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to\nFix this problem is about girls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the ... before anything actually happens because people understand once they're in the room it's really hard to get out well\nYou know the thing about yes means yes as a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like\nRules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge you like you know take off my shirt or whatever [noise] um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person and having the full burden of the awkwardness exactly so this is a little dorky\nOkay fight it it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance it may\nRecently you know guys tried to come up and downs of you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I mean his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent and I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked\nWas that the first time that happened here that was definitely the first time in fact it up for duty\nI mean I ... yeah I I didn't\nThink that that men intended me harm but I didn't want his arm around me I had no interest in him I married um I was just there with my girlfriends having a good night and dancing so\nI think that's a great thing to how that happened and to have young girls who truly a\nYou know art in night clubs
