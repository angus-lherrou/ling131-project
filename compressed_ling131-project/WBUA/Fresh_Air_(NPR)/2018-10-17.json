Bob Blacksburg who's also the show runner seasons five is now a net flicks Comedy Central as national and the first season\nThe series satirized has Hollywood and deals with issues like access and failure ego power addiction relationships and sexism\nSeason five is set in the era of the me too movement\nBow jak horsemen takes advantage of the kind of characters that you can pull off in an animated series it's a world that is a mix of people and talking animals with human characteristics bow jak is a horse who became famous as the star of the nineties sitcom horsing around\nBut one season one of those jak horsemen begins they'll jak is washed up his celebrity has faded and\nHe spends a lot of time drinking feeling sorry for himself and watching old reruns of his sitcom horsing around and Myron how great he was on the show back then let's start with a clip from the very first episode of Bo jak horsemen when Bo jak as a guest on the Charlie Rose show\n[noise] the Nineteen Ninety seven situation comedy horsing around me or don't ABC Show which young bachelor horses forced to reevaluate its priorities we agrees trace three human children was initially dismissed by critics is wrong and suffering and not good\nBut the family comedy struggled with America Alone to air for nine seasons star of horses around ... or ... ...\nIt is good to be here Charlie [laughter]\nOkay Raphael by Blacksburg welcome to fresh air time changes how we see things doesn't it [laughter]\nYou know we were you when you did that Charlie Rose opening you probably had no idea that he would be accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and that would lead to the loss of his job [laughter]\nSo let's just start with the surprise of that for you did you think of that opening episode when the women's step forward\nIt really dates the show doesn't it have Charlie Rose be the the voice of sober wrist\nWho is such a mess and all of sorry oh and unprofessional and Charlie Rose up played in in this clip by ... is our our straight person in the scene and uh yeah when the allegations against Charlie Rose came out I don't want to say my first thought was oh no my show\nBecause there wasn't it was truly oh no Charlie Rose ... and and all the women that he allegedly targeted a that's terrible but it it it is interesting now to go back to that first episode and look at it and think about how times have changed\nSo how did you come up with the idea of starting a series with a horse that can talk and walk on two legs and dress and be bitter like a human being and haven't beat the washed up star of the family sitcom\n[noise] well the idea for the show really started from my friendship with Lisa ... who was a brilliant illustrator and cartoonist and I'd have been friends with her since high school I mean when I was you know ... in Los Angeles pitching shows around\nJack is in such despair afterwards and feels responsible he's driving any closes his eyes and nearly guys off the road but then opens his eyes just in time to save himself and I think that's a suicide attempt as opposed to him falling asleep at the wheel\nWell let's say it's a lazy suicide attempt right it's a suicide attempt a plausible deniability well he's not actively killing himself but he's allowing the universe to take its course you know what I mean\nI always felt like in a port and but maybe minor distinction to us that he is so distorted and despairing that he's willing to do this but not so much that he was going to actively do it himself\nOne of the episodes that you have in the current season season five what you wrote is um an unusual episode because it's one long monologue ... mother has died she was never a nice mother she was always mean to him\nAnd during the last period of her life she had really bad dementia and low jak does not feel warmly toward her so this episode is all his eulogy for her so he's at a podium at 'em like her coffins at the side\nAnd he's not trying to paper over what their relationship with like he's talking about all these horrible things that happened in the family and how he was mistreated by his parents and how his father was means and his mother and they were both Maine to bow jak [noise]\nI I Want to play a brief part of\nHis eulogy and this is well or not as low jak horsemen\nI used to be on the TV show called horsing around fiercely they'll hold your applause will held\nIt was written by my friend her because as who's also dead now and it started this little girl named Sarah limb\nAnd it was about these orphans in early on the network has no maybe don't mention their orphan so much because audiences tend to fight orphans sad and not related at all but I never thought the orphans were said I I always thought they were lucky because they could imagine their parents to be anything they wanted something to long for\nAny way we did this one season finale where Olivia's birth mother comes to town and she was a junkie but she's got her so cleaned up and she was to be to live your life again and of course she's like a perfect grownup version of Libya or they go to the mall together and get her ears pierced like she's always wanted in any way that we're supposed to water\nBe careful moms have a way of letting you do but Olivia just thinks the horses jealous\nWhen the mom says she's moving to California Olivia decides to go with her the network really juiced\nBecause they're ... Olivia gone for good reporters because it's a TV show should not gone for good of course because it's a TV show Olivia's mother had a relapse and had to go back to rehab facility had hitchhiked all the way home getting rides from Mr T. alpha because of stop\nOf course that's what happened because what are you going to do just not how to live you on the show you shouldn't have happy endings sitcoms not really because\nIf everyone's happy the show would be over and above all else the show has to keep going there's always more show and you can call horse in a round dumb or bad or unrealistic but there is nothing more realistic than that you never get a happy ending 'cause there's always more\nShow I guess until there is\nAn assay saying until there isn't he's looking at his mother's cough and you know his mother had told him earlier you were born broken your bow jak horsemen there's no cure for that\nI'm so he he really had a bad relationship with her and when you said early in that clip that um he ended our our fans because they could imagine their parents anyway they wanted to [noise] um what made you think about that\nWell you know I I I think the big part of this episode at a big part of the larger story of his relationship with his mother ... and his relationship with his parents is about\nThis idea of can you forgive people who have done nothing to earn your forgiveness and and can you find peace with this woman who was so damaging to you but it's gone now and will never hurt you again and even in the last years of her life was a frail scared woman\nIdea and that that question of you know what do we owe the people in our lives as far as forgiveness goes and I think\nWhat's really interesting for me is the tension between that and to easy forgiveness of public figures right and and I want to believe on a personal level level that nobody is era deem Abul or so far gone that they can't find a way to be better\nAnd be forgiven and how does that track with me where I also think some of these you know famous Garbage Men who've hurts so many people in them so many terrible things\nShould just go away forever and not be allowed any sort of redemption and I don't know how I reconcile those two ideas and and that tension for me has been at least are really interesting to explore over the course of this last season but also the show in general\nSo in this era of the me too movement was so many men have so much to apologize for [laughter]\nI'm One of the funny things that you've come up with for the the richer you you and the writers is do we forgive you awards you created a whole awards ceremony for people who need to apologize for saying would you describe the freebies that we can watch\nThe we forgive you awards as presented on the show are awards that celebrities gets when the industry has decided to forgive them so we have a a character we made up called Vance Wagner who who's gotten into some trouble in the past and he's being presented a we forgive you award from\nI think for time forgive the recipient Arnold Schwarzenegger and it one of the sad slash funny things about this comedy slash drama and the making of it is when we first started writing the season\nLast year or last summer we were talking about how sad it is that our industry so quick to forgive these you're really terrible men who do awful things and the rate was kind of likes linked back into the limelight and we wanted to satirized that\nAnd then over the course of the last year it started to feel like oh wait a second maybe there's been like a huge sea change in our industry all of a sudden it feels like we're holding them accountable and we're we're kicking them out of the industry\nAnd then just in the last month or so it started to feel like oh no wait maybe more forgiving\nI don't know maybe this is sadly irrelevant a new um so it feels like oh we're really you know on top of the last month of pop culture news when in fact we were describing this thing that's been happening for years and years\nWhat makes you think that people are being forgiving again\nWell uh it was announced that Mel Gibson is co writing and directing a new movie for Warner Brothers\nAnd I I don't know if we have we forgotten his anti Semitic remarks is homophobic remarks his threats against his domestic partner the allegations that he beat her is use of of racial slurs\nIn mystified me in this era that we're in we're we're claiming to hold men accountable that it still feels like we are not you know Louis CK a stand up set a little ways back and got a standing ovation\nAre there are reports that Garrison Keillor and Matt Lauer are planning their comebacks I think that there is\nWork is if those men can be doing to better themselves and I would personally love to hear about it I Would be happy if they want to do come back and do an interview and reflect on their misdeeds and talk about what they've learned and then I think from there maybe we can you know we think about that are professional development and I feel like\nWe're going about this backwards and it I find it tremendously upsetting\nMy guess is ... Blacksburg the creator and show runner of the Netflix animated series jak horsemen after a break he'll tell us why he had second thoughts about some of the jokes from season one\nAnd marine car again will review a new collection of Eleanor Roosevelt advice columns and Terry Gross and this is fresh air [noise]\nAnd you've our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation\nSupport for NPR comes from this station from Amazon Prime video with the Romanoff new series from the creator of Mad Men starring John flattery Amanda ... whole riser and Catherine ... a new episode every Friday on prime video\nAnd from Rhodes Scholar and not for profit offering learning adventurous for adults and natural settings across the country learn more at our oh eighty scholar dot org slash\nRetreats this used WB you are coming up at three o'clock on radio Boston to look at Boston mayor Marty Walsh his plan for the city to counter the effects of climate change in the forecast mostly sunny today highs around sixty degrees\nShould be partly cloudy tonight chance of the snow shower in the hills closely right around the freezing mark partly sunny and colder tomorrow night only in the mid forties\nThis is W.

on reruns on Comedy Central so watching the series especially like after the eulogy episode\nI would've thought that you were a bitter mental at a very troubled childhood\nReading about you a little bit my impression is that was not sell your parents were involved with a Jewish culture your mother ran a Jewish bookstore your father helped Russian Jewish immigrants in the last um tell us about the book store your mother used to have like what kind of what kind of books were there and did you read any of them\nAre so my mother owned a a Jewish gift and book store called Bob and Bob and it was kind of a hub of Jewish life in the um bay area or at least you know my section of the bay area Palo Alto in the surrounding area\nAnd so I really you know what I Would go and visit the store and I sit in the kids' section or sit at her desk and and and and leaf through the books\nAnd and I was surrounded by Jews all the time I went to a Jewish day school um you know I even after a high school I went to college at bard where there are plenty of Jews I went down to New York where there are plenty of Jews it never felt\nA extraordinary or special to be Jewish I never\nOnce felt like a minority and the communities that I was in\nUm she would always bring home stuff from the store off and it was defective stuff that she couldn't sell so we had a lot of men that were chips um we have we have a banner that we put up every Hanukkah just as\nHappy Halloween because it's missing an end to the misfit toys Hanukkah um it it just felt very normal that to have a Jewish life um and to be kind of a swimming in this stuff\nWas there a disconnect me between being told about anti Sam ... senators and living in this culture that was a majority Jewish culture\nA hundred percent it felt like a thing of the past it felt like oh the Holocaust happened uh and that was terrible but now we live and sophisticated [laughter] now you know now it's it's okay to be a Jew and you know there are people who still have this like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes\nUm and\nIt's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country and they're they have a lot of power\nAnd there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me\nUm but also scary how little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening um especially big some for someone who you know as a Jew you hear the story of a Holocaust over and over and over growing up\nAnd the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing right there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who are shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know officially one of the Jews control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kinda feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nNow the Senate because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years ago to be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was a difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books um yes\nOr sometimes you know I I can always read books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there was something that really interested in me I I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school\nYou have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in and there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience and I love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't nobody was actually\nYou know like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy you're watching the boundaries I did because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified that oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me being sent to the principal's office and that this was\nAn outrageous action to to take\n'em you know or just\nA shouting out stuff in the middle class divide a funny joke I Would just say it's a ... you know whether or not it was disruptive or not because I I have I Want to see this thing so I'm going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and say this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least I'm ... I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not\nOh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this precisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I a comedian because I have ADHD or do I have\nYou know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps in what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat was TV like a safe space where are you where you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable elected you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the natural world and the reason why I ask that is that like that so many pop culture references\nAnd bill jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them [noise]\nUm so it made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when you were growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation\nThere definitely was a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate if I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this scene that I was living in\nFeel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now\nIf I Am in a situation I think if the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and I'll have a character say it later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment for if I think it was a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or if someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this moment I'll I'll get paid for by putting it in a story later\nSo having those outlets has been tremendously helpful for me\nYou know I'm thinking now the comedy central as his running low jak witches Netflix series now that Comedy Central it's raining it's starting with season one\nUm what's that like for you because you in retrospect feel like some of the jokes and season one were misguided and now it's getting like a brand new life [laughter] cable\nYeah you know it's it's been interesting because we're we're actually editing some of the episodes down to you know add commercial breaks\nAnd making under the right time for Comedy Central\nAnd you know obviously want them to keep their dignity as an upset of television not edited out anything too important but as we are looking for cuts one of things I'm looking at is is this joke still funny to me or would this scene work without this moment and if it does sometimes we'll take those moments out\nUm but I also think look this is the show and it has to do exist on its own terms and hopefully people you know as they have embraced the show Netflix will embrace the show on Comedy Central and if there are\nFlaws with it they will see those flaws for what they are and you know we'll see what happens\nWhen it's been great to talk with you thank you so much\nIt is my pleasure thank you so much\n...
