choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this problems I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples otherwise it takes a kind of ... stone that I think she would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his sons are read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading of homes yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time\nAnd that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which you talked about the solitude has the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that has a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have that that have his work as a life outside of his mouth\nAnd and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems so\nI've always wanted to I Want to get on record as say what I\nKnow and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift\nWas existed I just mean that there's something about reading poetry\nThat I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book and observing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are imbedded in every line to their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice since you've declined to read more post like her father I'm going to fight about being ... content groups are in transit you\nKnow it's a it's a it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading another another problem with his\nFrom the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and there's a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title port and maybe I was one for a while also the title singer was currently recorded me even though I could barely carrier tune\nFor many years I was known as among a sheep my head's in war robes and got up very early ages everyone but I actor generously and no one

little but we were talking about the connection of your father writing in solitude and the reader ... reading alone in as entering his [laughter] yeah and during his solitude yeah\nAs you noted also a kind of of humor you know half of the river a loved one who's lens where he says uh feel so good enough to love you like I did it's like the tour away my blindfold and said we're going to let this

when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought\nAbout songs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what's the sun and who's singing at ... um but but you were you at your father was a song writer scene must have had an awareness that song writing was a craft that something people actually did\nAnd you must have been like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them and you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a foreign looking out into the looking at the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older [noise] there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] then you grow older and then you then you sort of see I don't remember um I remember I myself I was making a record at the time and that's scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know maybe maybe I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain\nYou know we were sitting on the corner will shirt and ... and I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record\nAnd was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining\nBut instead he turned to me and said you screw up your record that's an amateur move to the amateur move he says yeah it's not about\nHow you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel and\nAt that moment I realized that um\nThe love I had always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but was also brought their intention out he was holding up this baton that he'd been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and do something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that ah that baton off the ground [noise]\nHow old were you and your parents separated [noise] um five six from the government so how much did you get to see your father after that [noise]\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people you should have been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some uh was remarkable is remarkable to me\nMother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow our own whims and my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he's always been part of our lives\nVeto he's he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\nCaravan has like a mobile home [noise] oh yeah the liquid he called it was like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm\nYeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we lived\nIn the long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things it put it to the tea where the road and met the dirt road and he just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh [noise] you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of in\nThat far\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my own entire life and and as I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate ... which he\nContorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nThere's something really terrible that happens you and then it and its own way as maybe responsible\nFor the revival of his career and for for um his reconnection to people um I I around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like\nDrain your father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing so we'll just sell other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like\nSuch a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know [noise]\nYeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry I'm In ... incredible [laughter]\nThat with the canon of his work with his devotion to black and white pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experienced this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compelling back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who knew\nYou'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and others you know would quote him and [noise] um but it
