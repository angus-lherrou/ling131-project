Trump\nRequested proposals from an Israeli company to create fake online identities and use social media manipulation to help defeat Trump's rivals for the Republican nomination in the primary and Hillary Clinton in the general election\nThe proposals were apparently never acted on but we know that Russian operatives made effective use of Facebook and Twitter and seeking to influence the twenty sixteen presidential campaign\nOur country is hardly the only one in which political opinions have been manipulated by millions of fake social media accounts promoting messages that are slanted or even made up our guest today pi Wu singer and Emerson Brookings say that social media has also been weaponized in ways that most of us remain unaware of\nLike feeling popular uprisings and affecting the course of military campaigns\nFor instance when the Israeli Army moved into Gaza and twenty twelve the operation was supported by a viral marketing campaign\nBWI singer as a strategist at New America a consultant for the U.S military and intelligence community and the author of several books Emerson ... writes about conflict and social media and it was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations\n... shares Dave Davies spoke to them about their new book like war the weaponization of social media\nWell Peter Singer and Emerson broken welcome to fresh air\nYou know we we all know that social media have become a big tool in politics but you write in his book that it can affect not just opinions and reputations but the course of war and you cite a fascinating example\nA new rapid communications medium transforming a military sense of this was the German invasion of France without [noise]\nSo you have this new technology but a conducted everything from tanks to airplanes or to the broader population was wireless communications and radio proved to be the secret sauce so to speak for everything from the political\nGoals are said that it wouldn't have been possible what they did without the radio but it also Hodge strategic tactical military impact or when the Germans invades France and invasion that most people didn't at the time I didn't think would work\nIt not only allows them to connect all their military units in a new manner allow him to coordinate and move faster than ever before but it also connected back into the enemy population and it's sporadic contagion of fear\nAnd it's one of these things that the contemporaries described as this this strange defeat um they couldn't express what happened until they figure it out really radio was what a cause all cause the world to change\nAnd we saw many of the same things play out in the rise of ISIS at a broader level but also it's a military operation it's surprise invasion of Iraq\nThat's right and it is a very large army I started out in the tens of thousands moved to the hundreds of thousands and now one estimate has it as high as three million of these are folks who are known as part of the the fifty cent army\nAnd their job uh and it it has its own training programs in a credit station systems their job is to monitor and infiltrate political conversations on we chat another Chinese platforms and basically cede positive things about the Chinese government\nEmerson broken writes about conflict and social media he was recently a research fellow at the council on Foreign Relations VW singer is a strategist at New America at a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nWill continue our conversation in just a moment this is fresh air\nWe're funded by you our listeners and by Nelly free range eggs whose eggs come from hands raised in an environment and allows them to Rome

gallery dot com [noise]\nThis is fresh air and we're speaking with the W. singer a strategist at New America and a consultant to the U.S military and intelligence community also with Emmerson broken he writes about conflict and social media their new book is called like war the weaponization of social media\nYou look at the Israeli incursions into the Gaza Strip and its battles with Hamas and you write that the Israeli military efforts were accompanied by a viral online marketing campaign they were hip to the importance of this what did they do\nSo it was actually a twenty twelve pillar of defense operation a eight days of Israeli airstrikes that drew Peter myself to this subject originally and got us researching it ever since [noise]\nUm [noise] this military campaign was accompanied by a remarkable online viral marketing campaign the campaign to twenty twelve opens with the assassination of a high level Amoss militant\nAnd that's not particularly unusual but is it what is unusual isn't the drone strikes video was up within a few hours and the official Twitter account of the Israeli defense forces was broadcasting it out again and again\nIn time a Hamas Twitter proxies respond threatening war and how far\nAnd is the operation commenced has Israel would strike particular targets it would\nPut out information about what had been done about the the weapons caches that had been recovered\nThen I must would respond in a similarly taunting manner\nAnd what's important is that this wasn't just the social media operatives if these two sides\nBut also millions and millions of Twitter messages exchanged back and forth by the the proxies of one side or another ten million and all and the first twenty twelve conflict Ninety percent of which were outside the region and this was an example of a limited military campaign that nonetheless was a global war for public opinion\nAnd this set a model that we're starting to see a you know future conflicts\nAnd two things stand out about it the first is that we could all participate it was people outside the region or deciding whose message went viral who's a side of the story was winning out\nBut importantly it was not just winning out on line when it was also affecting the real battlefield decisions when you go back and map out\nThe ah targeting by Israeli airstrikes in the pace of them\nActually they changed by almost half dependent on which side was winning out on line so it was happening is that the politicians and the generals were making battlefield decisions while watching what was playing out on their smartphones reflecting what you and I were clicking on\nKnow you make the point again that scale matters if you ...\nA book or Instagram that's one thing if you have an army of people organized to re tweeted and magnify its effect that's all the more important ... did the Israelis anticipate this and have their own Qadri of social media users ready to to give their their message more residents\nSo originally the Israeli military is not ready for this whole space and they're quite taken aback by a\nHow they're losing this bottle of narrative but with very real physical and political effects\nAnd like any other military they learn they reorganized and they reorganized and everything from uh creating new military units\nAre in fact one of the fund a images you can see a line is how they've changed their recruiting to let young Israelis know that you can do your military service by serving in one of these new units that tries to affect the online battle a sort of you know carrying a gun you can be using Internet means in the like\nBut it's also woven into the broader population for example they create a organizations within a Israeli universities where not only Israeli students but students from around the world\nCan participate in this battle a narrative to they have created apps that allow you and I to download them and serve the cause and you know gain badges and the like\nAnd in many ways what Israel is done has created a model for other militaries around the world that are looking at this and saying maybe we need to engage in that kind of reorganization too and you see it everywhere from ah Europe to some discussion within the U.S military\nSo so you can in enlist and an online army and get you know what badges promotions\nThe same way that you can enlist in\nTaylor Swift or army of swift these\nYou can enlist in the Israeli defense forces on line army the uh cause may not be the same but the tactics are and by contrast with the Israeli approach which is fairly centralized you're giving you a mission giving a set of messages to push\nThe Amoss one poll from the world at crowd sources so to speak\nAnd one of the other tools of the trade what are the tricks that used in these but also in political campaigns to marketing is basically to find out what's trending elsewhere and try and try and layer onto it\nSo for example or you had the ice bucket challenge a couple of years ago where we were all you know drawing attention to ourselves the way to fundraise\nFor a disease research this was woven into the battlefield where people were doing the ice bucket challenge but using rubble after Israeli airstrikes\nYou would put rubble on your head\nYou would port rubble on your head and then the image would go viral and it was a way of kind of\nHijacking one discussion to drive it to your own ends\nThe same way that ISIS for example would hijacked discussion about a hash tag World Cup and jump into it to the same way that Trump's online army would try and hijack discussion that was trending for Hillary or the like\nWe're listening to the interview fresh air is Dave Davies recorded with the W. singer and Emerson breaking\nOf the new

networks can be used or like any other technology for both good and bad or so for example they can um create a\nWonderful imagery and scenes or images of a volcano that doesn't exist in the real world\nUm and it's very powerful and use of uh for example or the future of marketing a it's going to move into areas ah like customer service um the company see this also is a way to save money or for example if you're interacting with a machine rather than someone behind a help desk\nBut like everything else it's also going to be weaponized and so those very same a chat box for example that might be trying to persuade you to buy a product might be trying to persuade you to vote in a certain way or I'm a and convince someone to take a certain position on a war\nA certain way to challenge also moves into visual imagery there was an area known as deep fakes these are hyper realistic images um videos for example of speeches that politicians never made it seems that never happened and so\nWith humans finding it harder and harder to figure out what is real or not the companies and turn are looking to artificial intelligence to help find it to help police their networks\nAnd so you get this strange but yet I'm kind of a wonderfully appropriate outcome the origin of social networks online we're a bunch of scientists talking about science fiction that's where this all came from\nAnd now we have the science fiction like outcome emerging where you have to say I battling back and forth with us humans caught in the middle\nSo so so these neural networks like would be good at subtly detecting what a robotic Twitter account might be in a way that would be hard for humans but they can also produce a picture of you know name somebody Joe Biden offering some you know profane of committed something\nTo give real world examples of this there have already been creations of speeches that a rock Obama never gave or there's other ones where you can lay are real and fake imagery together\nWhere for example it can be your facial expressions but you're controlling an online image of everything from an examples Arnold Schwarzenegger\nTo uh George W. Bush basically anyone that you have enough data points on what their face looks like\nWhich oh by the way you can get off of Facebook\nYou can take that to meld together to allow you to a in essence create a fake seen of them saying or doing something and so just like everything else in the space it's\nGoing to be used for good for jokes for laughs it's going to be monetize for for profit and it's also going to be weaponized\nNumbers in Brooklyn ...
