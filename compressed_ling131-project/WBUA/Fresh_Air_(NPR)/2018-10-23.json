perhaps the most important midterm election of our time\nThe outcome will determine who controls the house and the Senate in this very divisive era as well as who governs key battleground states the results could be determined by who has the right to vote\nSince the ... election over twenty states have adopted new restrictions on voting such a strict voter ID laws cut back to early voting and aggressive purging voters\nSays twenty fourteen hundreds of thousands of people were purged from the rolls in states that have a so called use it or lose it policy which you lose people from the rolls if they haven't voted frequently enough\nIn Georgia alone that policy purged an estimated a hundred seven thousand voters according to a new investigation by American Public Media's investigative unit\nAnd twenty Thirteen the Supreme Court struck down the heart of the voting rights act\nBut current ballot initiatives in several states could make it easier in the future to register to vote in those states and to crack down on gerrymandering and I guess Ari Berman has been covering developments in voting rights and voting restrictions he's the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America\nHe's a senior writer for Mother Jones are reporting fellow of the nation Institute and there's also written about voting issues with the New York times magazine and Rolling Stone\nAri Berman welcome back to fresh air before we talk state by state and get into specifics is it a coincidence that there are voters being perjure asked for IDs ideas that many citizens don't have in several states\nIt's not a coincidence and let me just give you the big picture of what's happening with voting rights right now\nSo since the twenty ten election twenty four states have implemented new restrictions on voting so nearly half the states and the country have tightened their voting laws\nTo do things like require strict forms of photo ID to cast a ballot or make it more difficult to register to vote or to cut back on early voting periods or to close polling\nRoles and many of these restrictions on voting are playing out now in the ... elections in critical states like Georgia North Dakota Kansas et cetera where there are very close elections\nSo is it a coincidence that all this is happening\nIt's not a coincidence this has really been a major strategy within the Republican Party\nAfter the two thousand eight election when Republicans gained control of a number of really important states in twenty ten\nThey began to introduce a wave of new restrictions to tighten access to the ballot than those efforts were basically given a green light by the Supreme Court when it removed a critical part of the voting rights act in twenty Thirteen and the Shelby County versus hold her decision\nInstead of those states with the longest histories of discrimination no longer had to improve their voting changes with the federal government that allowed states in the south\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Ari Berman we're talking about voter rights and voter suppression he is the author of the book give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America and he's a senior reporter for Mother Jones\nWho we've talked about the current election in Georgia where Brian Kemp\nThe secretary of state is also running for office\nSo let's take a look at Kansas where the secretary of state is also running for office in this instance it's Kris Kobach who's running for governor what are some of the ways in which he's restricted voting rights in Kansas\nAnd not just any secretary of State Kerry I Would say that Kris Kobach is the most high profile secretary of state in the country and he has really been a leader\nIn the Republican Party when it comes to restricting voting rights this is the guy who was named vice chair of Donald Trump's election integrity commission which was formed in a very high profile way in and shut down before it actually did anything but it requested voter data\nFrom all fifty states which set off a huge fire storm last year Kobach was the guy who told Donald Trump that three million people voted illegally in the twenty sixteen election no legitimate evidence has been put forward by Trump or Kobach to support this than the less Kobach is really the guy who was formed intellectual case for restricting voting and what he's done\nIn Kansas is a few things he\nWrote a law that was passed by the Kansas Legislature called the safe act\nThat did a few concrete things when it came to restricting voting the first thing it did is that it required proof of citizenship to register to vote meaning that you had to have a a passport or birth certificate or naturalization papers to register to vote\nThis law blocked one in seven cans ... almost thirty five thousand people from registering to vote in that state's the federal court actually struck that law down earlier this year and said that there was almost no evidence of voter fraud in Kansas\nTo justify the potential disenfranchisement\nOf tens of thousands of voters so so that part of the law has been struck down but another part of the law of voter id law where you have to show government issued id to be able to vote\nThat part of the law remains in effect and I've looked at the numbers in Kansas and over twelve hundred ballots have been tossed since Kobach was secretary of state of Kansas because voters showed up at the polls without having the right id\nBut Kobus only won his primary his Republican primary by three hundred and fifty one votes and now he's locked in a very close election with Democrat Laura Kelly who's a member of the state Senate an independent candidate Greg Orman\nAnd even the smallest reduction in turn out to shift the race in Kobach favor\nAnd the government Accountability Office did a study of Kansas voter ID laws\nAnd they found that Kansas voter id law in twenty twelve and it was first in effect reduce turnout by two percent in that state with the largest drop off among black voters young voters and first time voters and these are all people that are going to be less likely to support Kobach than the traditional Republican base\nYou say that Kris Kobach was actually the source of President Trump's false claim that millions of people voted illegally and twenty sixteen and if you compensate for all of those illegal votes Trump would have won the popular vote and not Hillary so what is called that do to plant that idea\nKris Kobach met with Donald Trump after the election basically Kobach was a disappointing for a cabinet position he was under consideration to be head of the department of homeland security\nAnd Kobach had to study not a very legitimate study but nonetheless it was a study that he gave Donald Trump that purported to show that three million people had voted illegally in the twenties sixteen a lecture then shortly after this meeting with Kobach\nTrump tweeted that millions of people voted legally and when I interviewed Kobach for the New York times magazine last year he told me that he was the source of Trump's claim and showed me this study that purport to show this\nHowever when the author of that study who was a professor at Old Dominion university testified in a federal lawsuit challenging Kansas proof of citizenship law\nOh that study and basically said it didn't show anywhere near that three million people voted to legally\nCritical back has also been an advocate for a new question to be added to the census and the census might not seem like it's actually a voting issue but it is voting issue Kodak advocated for adding a question about citizenship argue a citizen [noise] um how does that\nApply to voting rights\nIt's a huge issue because census data is used to draw voting districts it used to draw districts for state legislatures it used to draw district for the U.S house it's used to determine\nHow many electoral votes each state has so the census was instrumental when it comes to voting and what happened according to court documents is that Steve Bannon at the time of the chief strategist to Donald Trump\nCalled commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who's in charge of running the census and says I Want you to talk to Kris Kobach about adding this question about us citizenship to the census and what Kris Kobach told Ross is he suggested wording for the citizenship question and then he said\nIt's needed because right now in his words the illegals or being counted\nWhen it comes to representation I I don't want to get to technical here cherry but the the way that districts are drawn is they're based on total population so everyone in a given area is counted when it comes to drawn a district in deciding what level representation in areas should have\nWhat Kobach wants to do is restrict those\nDistricts to only counting people who are citizens if you did that\nAreas with lots of non citizens places like Texas and New York and California\nWould have much less representation than places where there's a lot more citizens if Kobach has his way districts are going to be drawn only based on citizenship what that will mean is that will be a major power shift\nTo Republicans because generally speaking airs lots of immigrants tend to vote democratic if you exclude them from counting than despite the massive demographic change we're seeing\nIs that the districts are going to become more conservative and this question about us citizenship hasn't been asked on the census since Nineteen fifty and there's a tremendous fear that if it is asked\nLatinos Asian Americans other minorities whether documented or undocumented are going to be afraid to respond to the senses the areas where these people live will get fewer political seeds less money less political representation than they otherwise what an affair and after it senses\nSo where does that stand now there's question\nRight now there are six different federal lawsuits challenging this question the most high profile lawsuits is being led by New York and sixteen other states and basically what they're saying is that this question is going to have a major league suppressive effect\nOn people responding to the question that you're going to see how many people are afraid to give their citizenship on the census because they're worried about Donald Trump's immigration policies and they don't want to tell\nDonald Trump what their legal status is and that's going to affect the entire senses and so if the Senate is unfair that says this is an accurate than so many things to the census does is going to be unfair and an accurate as well\nMy guest is Ari Berman author of give us the ballot the modern struggle for voting rights in America\nAnd senior reporter at Mother Jones after a break we'll talk more about voting restrictions and ballot measures that may expand voting rights and look at the Supreme Court with Brett Kavanaugh on the bench and how it would likely respond to cases pertaining to voter suppression and voting rights I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh

A. and ate the events design of production of corporate nonprofit event celebrations and\nYou have to wait five to seven years in Florida\nTo appeal to have your voting rights restored by the governor and his executive clemency board and this current governor Rick Scott in Florida has restored voting rights to almost nobody you have a situation in Florida where one point six million\nEx felons ... that's a staggering number what that means is that one in ten people in Florida including one in five African Americans in the state can't vote because they have a felony convictions so ten percent of people in the most important swing state in the country that has routinely decided presidential elections\nAren't able to participate in aren't able to vote in twenty Eighteen and this ballot initiative would restore voting rights to up to one point four million people in Florida\nThat would be the largest in franchise meant of new voters since the passage of the voting rights act of Nineteen sixty five so despite all the suppression we're seeing in Georgia North Dakota and Kansas in other states\nFlorida has a chance to give the right to vote\nBack to more people than at any time since the Nineteen sixties and and that's the good news that help doesn't get drowned out by all the bad news\nSo Rick Scott the governor of Florida who you described as the chief enforcer of the felon disenfranchisement law he's running for Senate against the term incumbent amounts than\nHe is and so here you have a situation where the architect of a policy that has disenfranchised one point six million ex felons in Florida\nIs running for office and the people disenfranchised by Rick Scott aren't able to vote against him and previous governors and Florida have restored voting rights to many more people than Scott has Jeb Bush\nThe governor of Florida restored voting rights to Seventy seven thousand ex felons Charlie Crist Jeb Bush's successor restored voting rights to a hundred and fifty five thousand ex felons in Florida\nRick Scott has only restored voting rights to three thousand people in Florida\nDuring his eight years as governor so he has emphasized this felon disenfranchisement law in the most restrictive way possible\nAnd it's not just his race Florida could also elect the first black governor in their states history Andrew Gillum but you have a situation where five hundred thousand half a million disenfranchised African Americans\nAren't able to vote potentially to elect the state's first black governor\nSo in the past have certainly been a lot of voting related court decisions that have been appealed as high as a Supreme Court\nThe Supreme Court now has added Kevin on the bench what's his position on voting rights [noise] he\nHas from the cases we've seen a pretty alarming record\nOn voting rights he upheld a voter id law from South Carolina in twenty twelve that the Obama administration had opposed and said could disenfranchise tens of thousands of minority voters in that state but cabin I wrote the majority opinion upholding this law\nAnd he basically said that even if there was no evidence of voter fraud that states could enact new restrictions on voting and that sets a very broad precedent for Republican controlled states like Georgia like North Dakota light Kansas to enact\nNew restrictions on voting and even if there is no evidence\nOf the kind of fraud that they are purporting to crack down on they can uphold these measures as legal ... even if they just say that they are intended to in ... words or promote the integrity of the election and so he is going to be joining\nA very conservative court already this was the same Supreme Court remember and Terry and twenty Thirteen that got at the heart of the voting rights act\nAnd he is going to be less open to potentially striking down these restrictions than his predecessor Anthony Kennedy who was already pretty conservative on these issues was and so now we're facing\nThe most conservative court on civil rights issues since the Jim Crow era and there is a tremendous amount of fear that Brett Kavanaugh is going to give a green light to the kind of voter suppression efforts that we're seeing playing out in the ... election right now\nThe chief justice John Roberts is now considered to be the swing vote in the court with his record on voting rights\nIt's amazing to me that Roberts is now considered the swing vote on the court when he has really been the most aggressive advocate on the court\nFor limiting voting rights and this goes back many years when John Roberts was a young lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department all the way back in the Nineteen eighties he led efforts\nTo weaken the voting rights act that was a key part of his portfolio and then when he joined the Supreme Court he authored the twenty Thirteen decision that got the heart of the voting rights act and ruled that those states the longest histories of discrimination no longer needed to prove their voting changes with the federal government Roberts mocks the ice", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "23"}
