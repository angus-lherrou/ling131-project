something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting 'cause they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go on to another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic\nAnd my grandfather he sent me down on the couch and he says it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she was a drug addict and that's that's that's why she's been gone all this time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I I trust them one friend my friend Patrick my best friend like\nSupport for WVU ours live stream comes from the New England Honda dealers the Honda summer spectacular event is on now with the best clearance prices of the year featuring the all new twenty Eighteen accord and all wheel drive see RV\nVisit Honda dealership New England duck come around here we Honda\nI delivered what I call an accidental Ted Talk in two thousand twelve that I share the story more widely\nPeople must have asked you kids must have asked you all the time like how can we grandparents are raising your as your parents\n[noise] they would and I would just make up stories on my my father he he travels a lot for business or um you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say uh I mean maybe that's my story building skills began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nMerely a mother lives in jail and halfway houses your father you didn't even know who he was\nThis had come home from school and somebody wrongs me and I tell the story about how this kid wrong me she would take the cigarette out of her mouth and say just tell them to go on their hat [laughter]\nNo\nAt the time I was in third grade and it sounds like such this like Great Depression World War two put down and here I Am in the eighties\n[laughter] am I going to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crass though you know they'd curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we're okay if you Kurds but if you ever curse at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know [noise] um they\nSmoke two packs a day each nah her and my grandfather just be moans this movement of ah having places be non smoking\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like to put an inconvenience it to the point where she said Jesus Christ by the time I die I'm going to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer that yeah you die from well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's often a heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and that unfortunately she died ah she got on a friday on my wedding story was that Sunday\nWhen in the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time Gina now my wife she'd be over and and um my ... my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and you know like you know she's smoking right with the oxygen around her\nAnd oh it's oh gosh that's David ... and we're so lucky the house didn't explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people and they were raising you then when they were raising your mother\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along\nAnd and I think a part of it was a ... my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother still is that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had from my mother Leslie because that took Joe's attention away I'm\nJoe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front ah surely was also drinking to a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit when I was young but she was never really drunk on weekdays and she was drunk on weekdays quite a bit when my mother was young [noise]\nYou know had recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe the nightmare [noise]\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force and these tall lanky\nMonsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I I vividly remember those dreams and yes there in there in the book and and those were difficult to drop because um you know you writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again [noise]\nWhen did they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout\nElementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years\nHow would you then they'd often open up the bedroom door and find your sleeping right outside of it [noise] um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly weren't the kind of people who thought you should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help the ... are you seeing someone was talking to somebody\nOr on a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes when you were in high school at the list or art museum and your your grandfather paid for these classes because he knew how absorbed you are with your with your drawing\nYou were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected let did your teachers say\nHe was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just add like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive woman slips this is how you have to draw muscles this is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally and in that moment uh and and back then this was now the early nineties the thought\nOf being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character so that advice by by Marc Lynch really put me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAnd he tells you you had your own style a nation develop that he did last night and what did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comic books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics with that that was actually useful for is\nCertainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know the the punches like really real back or the pensions been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style and I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to be you know [laughter] real one is just have your own style [laughter] donating you ignore everything about [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hate kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with
