Donald's father\nFunnel to him and his other siblings and\nHow they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to using the tax schemes we talked about um ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollars on from his father and help parlayed that into his\nInto his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws\n[noise] we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars ... two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is on top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars in direct welfare we saw\nTransferred to do what we what we also saw what is important also is that in many cases of these were loans that were never repaid him and he would take her out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month he's going back to that in his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks a million dollars it was just like a monthly run to\nDo for a Trump to get more money we saw especially the the flow of loans increase\nThose Donald Trump took on big new projects or the increase\nWhen she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from God and then getting off the race [noise]\nThese are loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nIf you use the money for many of his ventures the how Trump Tower um money that he got for for a Trump was used to support Dodd was used to support his ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars um indebtedness of the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars um he was in\nAre these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ended up in debt in a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from his own investments\nIt also see that when he's so and then when he would fall down on the ... was there for Trump safety was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this was a time\nIn the you know the back of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his companies are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump's had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos they're facing a debt payment\nInfrared Trump has a lawyer I'm going to the casino and by casinos trips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money disappearing million dollars' worth of it was three and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd it just period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see\nAnd Donald Trump at this period has a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and knew well and it was caught a soldier the wheel is taken to Fred Trump's house in December Nineteen Ninety\nAnd Fred Trump immediately sees this caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire into potentially put at risk and Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in a lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor from Trump's will inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well is dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him but he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scoring to the family what he did\n[laughter] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life or toward the end of ... life\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bailing himself out and Fred tromp Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had help with so much money for so many are\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump perceived to this is an attempt by his um to Jane complete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe ... the empire that Fred Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that as far as I'm potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nAnd I guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne ... after a break we'll talk about another skiing used to transfer of wealth from ... real estate empire to

paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nAnd then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why does Donald Trump make that decision\n[noise] so the interesting thing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I think what we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe saw that in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family meetings after for Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a check and then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell\nAnd quickly assembled a private sale to develop or in New York for almost all of it and it was sold you know give or take a few buildings in one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSo so that the the uh buildings that were selling all of those buildings ... Frank ... own at this time of his death out there last include all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both the buildings that had been transferred down the one city owned it was it was pretty much all empire and it sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer and ... and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the the the documents that we went through the thought sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars and what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that that empire was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much less\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that down as Donald Trump made it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion skiing how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with it so it's true that or else actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe're describing the story and in fact they are as ours did push back some and especially on the low valuations that have placed on buildings and made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this return from a million more bucks on that return\nBut the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got an agency that is pretty over match\nOverworked an auditor who can walk into a session and to extract a few million dollars that's a really good day's work for that order but in the meantime\nMost families who you know wealthy families are\nThe most expensive legal and tells me helping who engage\nIn these very sophisticated maneuvers to avoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more of the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of simply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard but budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking are just going to state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art of the deal the art of the comeback or The Apprentice\nAnd tell us what was actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals on public\nTo choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or another comeback [laughter] go for it [noise]\nAh well for your publishers are coming back in Nineteen Ninety seven minutes of this story of a sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse\nAnd through shows grit and determination and while we may go shaving skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the store it\nSo at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually cause it's perfectly with the moment when he's just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way\nNot a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money that happen in two thousand and four\nI'm right is the sale had gone through the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from ... and yet when you watch not opening scene it's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane as there\nThat the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump belt and paid for [noise] I'm Wondering\nHow you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured\nMath of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and has great negotiating deal making abilities [noise] and so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting forward in that\nIt's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stock\nAnd I think that we've ... I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think that how careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up\nI think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and and a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves um but I think it will take time for this just sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and\nAnd um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times says basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access knew were locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who is allowed to go [laughter] you know [laughter] we\nUh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in one day with a with a little documents and [laughter]\n[laughter] but we uh yeah it was uh just the three of us for a year um with a yeah it's a pretty messy but a little writes in their ...\nAnd that'll cost her father to either magic and [laughter] and then other people now are you were locked up in this room [noise] um actually people knew our\nOur editors new but I think there was a lot of sort of a mystery mystery surrounding we are kind of kept to ourselves and uh yeah it was it was difficult everybody you know the people keep asking you what you're up to and [noise] um but we uh we tried to keep a lid on it as best we could well\nThank you for your reporting and thank you for telling us about it Suzanne ...
