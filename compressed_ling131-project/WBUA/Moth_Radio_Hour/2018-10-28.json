driven down to to see him um but I also brought along ten thousand dollars in cash with me because you never know\nAnd uh I saw those cars you know on the way a gamble a little bit and then went to Portland hung out with him spent the night and I was back in the casino and I was hung over\nAnd ill in part because I was in a casino and just you know there are a little bit sad and small casinos in impoverished rural areas are a little bit extra set [noise] and I was also concerned about my own\nGambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that\nMoment I used to play a blackjack for a living I was a card counter\nUm which is card counting as a a legitimate um mathematically valid method for winning at the casino game blackjack and I I used to do that for a living and then uh and then my life took an unexpected\nCourse since I'm sitting at this table thinking about these things and suddenly the man next to me has dealt a hand he gets a twenty as his hand a but it's not an ordinary twenties made up of two greens apart screen of hearts on top of another green of hearts and as soon as I saw that hand hit the table I thought maybe\nUm everything's going to be All right now I used to go carts for a living and I was taught to do that by a group of friends mentors or who were some extraordinary people very brilliant very poised prosperous\nAnd sort of beautiful in a way and they are incorporated me into a blackjack team that they had been operating for some time and taught me how to go into casinos and when my\nAnd my job was to go in and when a and take the money out of the casino which you take in cash you take it a new stuff it into your pockets you stuff it into money belts you put it into your breast pocket of your shirt or a jacket and you walk out with it and you feel physically enhanced with that happens\nIt's almost like a part of your body and you bring it back to your teammates we share our winnings and so you distribute five thousand dollar

paid the Kashmir [noise]\nI took away I took every hundred dollar bills that they had in that casinos a small place I also took every fifty dollar bill [laughter]\nAnd a lot of the twenties [noise]\nI took this flawed and just stuff that down my pants that I was physically expanded in this weird for cheaper in a way sort of like in the old days but I turned around\n... this small place where there were twenty five or thirty people all staring at me customers or the casino\nPeople who work there weren't going around and everybody there knew exactly\nWhat I had just one and they see me as a cashier they knew I was getting paid in cash and so I moved briskly for the ...\nAnd a risk flee across the parking lot and I started the engine of my car drove out made a series of strategic you try to ensure I wasn't being followed and then got on the interstate five north towards Seattle through the woods in the dark of night it was five PM but at the Pacific northwest so [noise]\nExpanded in this way as I said but also I felt this team linguist sense of\nParanoia verging on terror and I kept looking back in the rearview mirror examining\nThe headlights of distance tried to into it if any

want them off to be and he has to come do this at the players got it in front of two hundred fifty people instead of twenty five and then blasted the bless your heart you did agree to do that and get it and were brilliant\nWell I think part of part of the whatever might happen with with card counting story specifically in a room has a lot to do with the nature of the stories themselves because people when they're hearing them are I think struck with the possibility that they just can't decide if the person is in fact\nA lunatic who thinks that he goes around winning uh casinos and has paranoid delusions of being chased by casino personnel or or in fact a deft um you know genuine professional\nSo you say you had been telling stories like this to groups of friends at dinner parties for years and years clearly but what was it like the first time you actually stepped on stage with the purpose of telling a story to a crowd the stranger as\nIt was heroin it's like a different body

casinos he was appearing on them off stage ongoing assumed name Lee Aaron Blair\nOr did it a under a pseudonym\nI'm In part because my name at that time still has some value\nTo sort of value of a card counters real name tends to deteriorate overtime as you just become increasingly aware of it\nUm but also because it's long been obvious to me that a card counter reviewed legally changes his name should change it to three or more first names [laughter] presents a piece of ID to a person the casino he can claim that any one of the names is actually the first name\nAnd you know depending on how familiar the casino personalities with that particular form of id they're often you know they see ideas from all over the country there are often confused I'm so that you can create from one legal name multiple aliases based on a genuine id\nYou're the rest of this interview and for the longest material related to all the stories you hand them off trading our vote them off dot org [noise]\n\nIn

English proper English but the language they spoke the spoken language was French ... uh the lead to um [noise] uh I never knew what the court\nWas about because when they we received a letter in English they received each other's letters in English\nThey then would respond to their latches verbally in French ... so I couldn't understand French ... and I was never shown the letters but only I knew a certainly from my mother's side the reaction of the letters um this was incredibly uh\nInteresting to me ah everything my mother did was interesting to me I\nI'm adored her but mostly what I adored the vouchers that she adored me [noise] uh so I liked to see her angry or it was interesting to me to see her angry in speaking in this language which I had no interest in learning at all\nUm because in any case it wasn't a proper language was just a broken language or so we were told\n'em even ... a\n... as I say I was very I adored this person a eventually when I was around nine years of age I should say I'm a my mother became pregnant and I don't know how this happened [noise] um\nOur next and final story is told by Sebastian younger\nBashing had been a war reporter for more than Twenty years but this was his first time on stage at the mob mob stories are personal in fact stories told on them off stage are most times the most important most defining stories from my personal life\nHere Sebastian on crafting this story [noise]\nYou know I Do a lot of public speaking and I'm used to sort of talking and explaining how things work\nAnd then I started to understand that this was the boss is\nYou're really doing is telling a story\nTo understand something more deeply [noise]\nThe story that you're about to hear includes images of war and it's not suitable for children\nHe was told him off night called I witnessed stories from the front line here [noise]\n[laughter]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy suburb I spend my twenties or writing short stories and drawing away stables and I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was men do\nUh exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way um and\nSo I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pans and a few\nThousand dollars and I went to Bosnia during the civil war society of all to try to learn to be a war reporter Ben war it was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not this point but it's also way more than you bargained\nFor um for example this the first time I saw a dead body it wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people dying words of civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war it was a girl's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken by surprise military forces\nAre and ...\nThey took her up to a field above a town called ... and they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summers hot and ... the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human\nOr was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails and that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm [noise]\nI remember the first time I got ready to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines that it was a goat getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a\nJeep with a few a ceremony and soldiers who really were good for much and then\nAnother couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown and these rebel ... stepped out of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\n... and ...\nI tried to get ready I was ...\nI was ... I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I can see the little black hole that the bullet comes out of\nYou know one point a guy\n... his gun and started to shoot in another guy grab the barrel and jerked it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes\nWell all these little black holes are staring at us and I thought what is it turning inside those holes and there are so small the thickness of a pencil\nAnd eternity is in there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look at them for some reason they didn't kill us\nAnd we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something something I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back\nI remember the first time I froze in combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave ... have you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes our brave but then other times you or not\nAnd\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and I'm for this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against some sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd when you have to understand about voices that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoots at you so much that you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you ask yourself am I getting shot at it gives us out of the bullets make when they go past your is pretty subtle and then the gunfire arrives in a moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe bullet a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt what's the angles deviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right now what's the math on that angle\nYou don't even want to think about it um\nAnd then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed bullets were coming in here\nAnd did everything I was paralyzed those behind some sandbags our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bulletproof vest\nWe're getting a tax on three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there he finally jumps across that gap any grab stuff he throws my\nCamera to me it shows like bullet proof vest the grass itself is throwing a mode of soldiers to the soldiers are pinned down too and he gets back and I have my camera in my hand\nAnd I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared any more ... Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously\nVery very brave a love braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men are free\nTo love each other on reserve is Lee without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary\nAbout this little outpost we were going to call every struggle and we're going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot\nOn this rich in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I and I asked for my ... on this trip so I had to go home to cut to heal up So Tim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot\nVery bad seeing a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American physicians got overrun they drag off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight they got him back but it was bad out there way worse than anyone back home really knew you know\nAnd in the middle of all that seemed broke his leg you get ten thousand feet up on the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long and the medic examines his foot\nAnd says well it's broken and we can't get a matter of fact we have to be off this mountain bike daughter were going to get hammered here's two Advil\nAnd Tim new Jim knew that if you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there and he did it I don't know how but he did it he got down off the mountain\n\nSo we finished up our deployment and\nUm that's how we started to think of it are deployment\nI'm and I'm not you know the rest of it was okay the worst was in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um\n[noise]\nAnd if the the film did really well and started it started with this scene\nUm that was very\nTook me a long time to be able to watch it actually I Would always close my eyes when it came um the scene where I riding in a Humvee 'cause I took the next trip after Tim broke his leg", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "28"}
