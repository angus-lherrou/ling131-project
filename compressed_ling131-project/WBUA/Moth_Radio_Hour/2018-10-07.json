thousand two as you remember what the wild west days of the Internet or there was no Twitter there was no you two very few people were on Facebook so it was really really hard to go viral back then uh and I see that so you'll be impressed [noise]\nSo and you have to do I was a college student at the University of Maryland and um\nIt was a really hard time in my life I was sad all the time uh and I was tired all the time and I didn't really make any friends on campus I just went to class and I didn't join the activities I just occasionally we're right on movie reviews for the college newspaper

live at the [noise]\n\nMy mom has a nickname for me uh bought in Cantonese it means busy body curious\nAlways asking questions kind of guy negative connotation and I had to suppress\nThat curiosity asking all of those questions because when you're born a kid of immigrants you're taught a guiding set of principles on which to live on keep your head down learn English\nGo to school get good grades go to college Mary yourself a nice Chinese husband have kids by a big house for yourself\nAnd keep quiet\nAnd so these are all the things I learned and everyone around me believe them because I was born and raised\nIn Manhattan's Chinatown which was bustling with a Chinese immigrants and kids of immigrants like me my mom worked odd jobs and sweat shops and uh in Chinese bakeries my dad worked six days a week as a construction worker and when he'd come back on Sundays me and my brothers would take turns massaging his back\nWhile I'm doing all of this I'm also trying to grapple with being both Chinese and America American [noise] and so I'm In fifth grade watching a soccer match with my parents and if the U.S\nVersus China and I asked my dad\nWho are rooting for [noise]\nI don't go well of course China\nBut we're here in America I thought I couldn't ask\nThat question though because when you're a growing up here you know that in that tiny Chinatown apartment you're not supposed to speak up because you're just going to cause of Rochester right but I found my way to figure out\nDoes identity issue when I was Thirteen I was\nExcited to watch a PBS documentary becoming American the experience\n[noise] people that\nSeen three people who ever looked\nLike me Jackie Chan trainee the yellow power ranger [noise]\nHand moon line a cartoon character [noise] so I'm so excited to watch\nThese last twenty minutes which talks about people marching and protesting people who looked like me they're holding clever signs in English they're chanting in English I never even seen anyone in Chinatown march before for anything\nSo big that all these people will go on the street and risk their identities their life they were marching for this\nMany Vincent Chin Vincent Chin in Nineteen eighty two was a Chinese American man who was being said that\nHe was being to death by two white laid off auto workers who assumed he was Japanese during the auto workers prices in Detroit where Japanese companies were booming and people thought the Japanese were stealing their job they fought\nThe guys chased Vincent Chin and beat him to death with a baseball bat on his bachelor party\n\nInstead of going to um his wedding his wedding guest wants his funeral and said the next week the two guys who killed Vincent Chin never served a day in jail and paid three thousand dollars for this man's death\nAnd so all of these groups of people Chinese people Korean people Japanese people Philippine X people\nAre now saying if this to happen to this guy Vincent Chin this could happen to any of us and so they began to rally together and for the first time for many of them they came together under the term Asian American\nAsian American\nI never heard that term before and Vincent Chin must have been so important if he had brought all of these groups together so my mom happens to walk into the room as I'm watching\nThe documentary and I'm thinking she's about to yell at me for being lazy on the couch and she points to screen she looked seventh and ... and says\nThat your family what\nHave all these questions who is he how is he related ... like a cousin of a cousin of the cousin have I ever met him no I haven't met them because I wasn't\nBut I'm Wondering like what happened I look up at my mom's face and there's just pain and anguish and her eyes\nThat she didn't look like she had wanted to tell me this much I think she felt she had to tell me how could I ask all these questions how could I ask about a murdered man in our family I had nothing to say at that moment and I just decided I'm not going to come from my mother about this I don't want to hurt her\nSo I decide to do research like I've done since I was a kid I start looking at articles on line I find out there's a documentary called who killed Vincent Chin I look at all the New York public library branches and they can't find a single copy but\nLuckily when I was a freshman in college the Asian American alliance between the movie the movie featured heavily Vincent ... mother ... ... all over the nation on the Phil Donahue show crying out I Want justice for my son\nShe's featured at her house in the suburbs of Detroit feeding her relatives or making fun of the relatives and making jokes trying to set up the filmmakers boyfriends\nAnd she was speaking in my native tongue toy Sonny's\nAt some moments during the documentary you could see little each and trying to hold back her tears because at the site of the cameras she was always reminded of her dead son Vincent Chin and I couldn't help but crime myself because this woman looks so much and sounded so much like my grandmother my maternal grandmother\nAnd she was rally and she was protesting she was nothing like any of the Chinese woman I'd ever seen before and I thought to myself I have to find out who\nWill each in is because if legion is indeed my family and she's related to me than high I have an example in my family a someone who spoke up to be a pot again to be a busy body curious and be\nProud of that you know so now I'm like I have to find out\nWho will each in and and I have to find out who Vincent Chin is so I go to the only place\nWhere I think I'll get a full answer the city where ... lived and died Detroit and I take an eight hour mega bus to Detroit my friend picked me up and I asked her if we can go to forest lawn cemetery to see even sanctions grave\nWe she drives us\nAnd we find Vincent ... name on a tombstone lowly chains name on the tombstone ... husband's name on a tombstone\nThey're no longer goals\nThey are right below my feet and I'm finally going to know how these people are related to me and why this means so much to me\nI go the next day to my relatives house we're eating swelled dishes of meals I'm looking through thirty photo albums of my family I see pictures of my mom and dad with matching terms in the Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd so I asked my relatives can you help me make a family tree I Want to know more about my family so we start with my grandmother's\nLine my grandmother\nHad a brother and nine sisters the second\nSister on this list is Long Beach and so now I Know the legion is my grandmother's sister ... is my mother's first chance and Vincent Chin is my mother first cousin so I asked my eighth grade ...\nWho what happens to lowly after Vincent Chin died she tells me well when Vince inside lowly was all alone in Detroit\nSo your grandmother and I literally sisters flew to America from China to support her your mom and dad had married in China so your dad came soon after they all found work in New York and that's how your family ended up in Manhattan's Chinatown\nName is Elaine ...
