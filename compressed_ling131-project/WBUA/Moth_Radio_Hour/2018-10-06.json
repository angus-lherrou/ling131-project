I don't I was very concerned about that because you ... the last thing you want to do is treat is a subject as as very serious as the one\nOn that can meet the the the torture that she has undergone you don't want to treat that in any way lightly because there's nothing about it but you have to deal with it because of that stuff happens in the world so I think it is so much of it isn't a writing so the writers take care of Ninety nine percent of the work for us and\nI think if it's about um in the show I I Do think there are sharp turns where you'll be making a joke about something and then\nAnd then Ninety degree turn and you're you know back to talking about the bunker and I think that's just\nI don't know I think that that that's how life is something can be a you know ... ... fine and sunny one moment and then horrible and a kind of hellish the next and and you have to navigate those times so that it was that I went abroad and so I'm like well it reflects life but it does\nWill so you're just obviously show created by Tina Fey was done initially for NBC Weaver was as a Robert Greenwald who's the head of entertainment and she was like this is great I Love it I Love your team wonderful let's sell this to Netflix and not put this on NBC like there were questions about this right now\nI Do and I I think really don't know the conversations that took place so I I get to plead ignorance but um yes it was originally slated to be on NBC and again a you know I I think it\nSpeaks to the discomfort of hey we're doing a comedy about a girl who's been underground and so you know in that clip that you heard were Titus was sending her off school can she didn't get to complete high school friend there's something very adolescent or immature about her I mean what where would you be if you'd been held up a young age of twelve or something\nYou know I'm alarmed because sometimes when McCain he doesn't understand pop culture reference or doesn't understand you know the way people and she's as an Eighteen to have I'm like oh I didn't know that either and I'm I'm worried because I was not only was not in a bunker for Fifteen Years I think I'm just a little out of it\nBut I don't know what I was doing when I have gotten on Instagram before you honestly honestly where she's [laughter] I'm I'm just like like trailing behind but um yeah I think that she is necessarily naive because about certain things because she has been her her adolescence stunted it's it's Arrested Development and she's coming out\nUm as a [noise] twenty nine year old even though I'm thirty eight in real life never really done I think you are but she is she's you know I she she missed out on a lot of stuff that she's only seen for the first time now\nIn a lot of ways you guys sort of\nI I wouldn't say that you had on address but you certainly come into contact with a lot of issues that people are are working through in thinking about\nA couple of episodes I'm thinking about in particular here's a clip from season for of unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and you can hear it can be arguing with friends he's the leader of a men's rights group called the Innocence Project played by Bobby ...\nFemales have it's so easy ... oh please flick I'll come when your body makes milk it's beautiful well as a woman\nEasy breezy beautiful cover girl born tall [laughter]\nIt was sort of trickery castle I've been a junior salesman uh Darryl bridal for Fifteen Years I've seen with females truly are fall you care about is the ring and dress and not\nOnly will go with me because the women who come in here are engaged\nIn on their mom matchmaking there he's making a very good point or his mother episode of\nCoworkers accuse your character a of sexual harassment can be Schmidt sexual harassment in the workplace in this scene you'll hear can be attempting to soften the blow of firing an employee named ... beer she touches his shoulders and then I could you not she dropped ... in an attempt to demonstrate\nHer own humiliation in the moments\nLike you to be here I like seeing you every day since that maybe weren't isn't the best place for that [noise] maybe our friendship belongs in the night\nYou get when I'm ... [noise] I don't you feel embarrassed and there's stuff\nCan happen to anyone says\nWould you look at that ... would you look at her pants dropped her cancer except for why are you guys dealing with me too I Know outweigh right\nI think it sort of turns it on its head I think that um [noise] Kimmy is\nA a a a lovable Ruben Ruben I N in her attempts to make this employee feel better and you know the only thing I think you can imagine as well they always said you know if you feel nervous imagine the audience and their underpants and so I'm going to bring I'm going to humanize myself by driving my pants in front of him\nThat is sexual harassment and came to get in trouble for it and it's so well intentioned um and so miss understood that um I I felt sorry for her it than it had happened to her but I think this rage that she field and in the first thing you played I'm against the how funniest body and that seems very he's fantastic\nGenuinely outrage out but now they got him into bridal show he has such a tough\nCool stuff because the Republicans are by sneakers just like Democrats or basketball fans to or is it that you actually that's not where do you want to speak publicly you just want to be sort of apart from from from\nThat stuff to things yes I Am the Michael Jordan a comedy yes I think that's very your eye on them the logo [laughter]\nThank you for recognizing that sure and second yeah I mean it it does seem like a a cop out I mean if you you can't not be involved in politics now I mean I I don't you have you can't not be political now it's too crazy and\nA momentous a time so I think you can't just say oh I'm not going to get involved\nBut I also think that a lot of people are talking to and with people who already agree with him so I I don't know how much um I don't know how much to weigh in on that because\nThere are out in some ways like the last question on this I Want to ask is you know do you think that can be Schmidt ultimately in the way it handled this in addition to getting laugh in addition to making sure that he was pointed out can be a you know advance certain understanding of certain issues on this stuff or do you think that it's hey we're here to make people laugh even if it's in a funny circumstance and that's what we're here to do\nI think there was definitely a feminist I'm a ... an intention when when especially when writing this season for and again I'm not in the writers and so I don't want to speak for them but I\nKnow I don't think it was just about trying to me I mean that's what's so insane to me and why these guys are magicians is because they're able to make these points um both political and some of the points\nWhile also keeping like jokes that are pristine and just so sharp and funny in in the show at the same time but I ... I Would no I I think it's too crazy a time to avoid that\nWe played a little bit earlier a clip from bridesmaids itself was\nReally funny at times quite raunchy yeah and it\n... ... ah apparently you said you shared a questions about women in comedy you gave a talk in St Louis arch way text talk and yet when he fourteen you took on the question that you said that you'd been asked not just by fence by reporters and the question was are women funny\nFunny yes some women are funny\nAren't funny right [noise] it's it's hard to have some women are tall [noise]\nAnd you sell him in our shorts it's like to ride the train well others prefer to take the we are different [laughter]\nThey are the apparently the women are different from one another's what you're saying as well as from from the\nRight I think\nThat women are different from one in that in that I ... I Am talking about women are all sorts of different things and and no not one group of of people is always going to be funny or not funny\n[noise] so but I mean you you actually were inspired to give a talk on the basis of you know him you a question from reporters ... you know on these tours I assume you have to have a lot of questions right so hopefully some of them was muted than others\nBut I I think that is that when bridesmaids came out I think okay well that is I don't know for reporters have a conference of what happens but everyone does that it was like okay we're going to talk about the fact that they made a movie that was successful and yet it's still just women and I think that was so that was the question that was in the water okay are so\nWomen can be funny but I have to be honest I never had a thought that women were funny I ... I think it was\nBased on the box office success and bridesmaids that that a demonstrated studios that you can make\nA very funny comedy starting all women and they don't make money so on that side of course it's great that that was successful financially but this idea and it's and it's asked by men and women that um you know are women funny is so stupid because it what are you talking about yeah they've always been funny\nWhen you went after a delay Christopher Hitchens who I you know the noted British an intentional controversial as he actually wrote this thing for Vanity Fair saying essentially obviously women are not fun and they don't need to be a was that something that you encountered when you were trying now for for things I mean in two thousand so that's still a thing\nNever encountered that and I know some women have an ... in improv I think and I said it didn't last of our citizens forget theater and the people's improv theater I never ever encountered any unfairness or hostility because I was a woman I think that a lot of that stuff comes from when I have encountered it it's from um [noise]\nListen it's the white guys in other industries [laughter] who are seen support like I got a lot of emails from uh some people I went to college with who\nWho work maybe in the financial sector who who were impressed at the movie was funny and I thought get out of my inbox because what's funny and they were the fact that they were surprised many furious because but I I you know ... to ... but it also reminded me that not everyone\nThinks the way my my uh comedy friends and I think which is that there\nScratch or is in a movie or is in a TV show because they're either funny or they're not\nToo far north backs and congrats on the fact that apparently white guys can sometimes make money [laughter] ... yes [laughter] sometimes you work with some real giants here as we mentioned you work with Tina Fey Monday killing a Christian wig\nOr or what did you what did you learn what do you take from working with somebody like Tina Fey who really has sort of think publicly tried to articulate how she's tried to model things for women comedians would be like you know you got to be tough to stand up for what you believe what did you take from working with her\nThat what you just said which is on most of my um most of the I guess I Would say lessons I learned from Tina Fey or just by watching her because that woman lead by example and she doesn't complain and she works tirelessly and and and she treats everyone fairly and kindly\nAnd she's very grounded so I think that there is on\nShe empowers women by doing she just she she's she talks about it but she also just does it and so\nLike when you walk us through what that means a little bit for listeners who may not a folder as closely see that well\nI guess it means that it's not it's not a constant thing like I mean she was I'd read bossy pants Fifteen times I mean it's it's really not selling her best selling book which is just\nBrilliant and she talks about this in her book being the boss and I there's\nThere's something in her introduction where she says\nThat she gets asked a lot like what's it like being in charge of all those people and she compares it to she says oh it's like it must be like when people ask Donald Trump hey how's it feel to be in charge of this is before Donald Trump was president by the way and her point being that nobody is asking Donald Trump that although", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "06"}
