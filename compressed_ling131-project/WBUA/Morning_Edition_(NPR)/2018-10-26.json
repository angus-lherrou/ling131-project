about Halloween costumes\nAnd the controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and I felt like a long day she wants to look like they interrupt her one day I I don't know how like that got raped hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup\nAnd that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ...\nOkay so this is not the first time that making Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News for all your kids watching at home than it just is white and she says it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWell these aren't uh the only examples um their number I remember back in twenty at the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claim that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group black hate group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period focusing on that just do it was a threat to the Republican\nIndeed as one of her former colleagues were counted basically yelled at a white liberal strategist for about ten minutes to she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously or one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA a homicide detective mark ... on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about uh the question of are African American relations with police officer she of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial many people saw that as a as discredited thing she\nHistory played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah what she thought was the acceptability a blackface\nNBC's a nightly news with Lester Holt through the whole thing about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something about making Kelly's colleagues and their attitude toward her\nWill for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor yeah uh uh of any of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was and we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces in t._v. news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network is handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\n[noise] well it's hard not to look at this in light of ah you know direction at times very slow of major news organizations to me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer and also think you can't divorce it from the fact that Megan Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News she just play some popular collies\nAnd that whole ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she'd been discussing with a network another role there uh because uh she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone
