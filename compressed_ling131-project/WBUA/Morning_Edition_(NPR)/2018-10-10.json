year old retired minister who lives with his mother in east Nashville, Tennessee he says his medical saga began a decade ago\nIn two thousand eight I went in because I was playing tennis with the un ab fab euro and uh he\nBeat mob but [laughter] and so I wanted fresh nice to help me sleep better\nBut after that routine knee surgery Lankford developed a lung infection which sent him to the intensive care unit he had developed sepsis a life threatening condition sometimes called blood poisoning\nAnd all he remembers from his delirious weeks in the hospital was he near death experience asked song drinker I asked us how\nOne of the other side of a river it looks like the original lodge a larger profit who's miracles included resurrection of the dead [noise]\nHis mother leader says at one point hospital staff were so sure he would die overnight they didn't even bother to pass on his medical chart to the ...\nThe thing that's amazing is his talking to us and his like being aware of what we were saying and yet then not knowing and not remembering any of that but I Would say it what we were at the rehab how bad for weeks\nNow a decade later Richard Langford says he's still struggling to work its way out of a ticket that's physical emotional and cognitive though he's still reached the New Yorker and remains active in politics he says sometimes he feels like he's lost in

putting another one in\nThe lame for are grateful to get support from a clinic\nAt nearby Vanderbilt University which has pioneered efforts to understand and treat patients like him this is a huge problem Dr ... usually an intensive care specialist heads that effort he says post ICU syndrome effects thirty to fifty percent of all patients who are in the ice you do to a medical emergency even younger people\nI mean you have somebody coming into the ICU with a previously ... very well working brain and they leave critical care not being able to\nHave a good conversation they can't balance a checkbook they can't find the names of people at a party and they get very embarrassed or they are socially secluded in themselves are patients tell us what a misery this form of dementia is is it per minute\nIt's permanent in some we've been following people for over ten years now from the brain ICU study which we did here at Vanderbilt and many of them a decade out still have elements of the dementia\nOverall he estimates that a third improve a third stay the same and the third end up on a slow decline for many the mental damages akin to a traumatic brain injury re Alzheimer or even sometimes are farmers that solve\nThese problems are linked to the degree of leery um people experience well in the ICU ... says\nEvery day you're delirious you have about thirty five percent increased risk of this dimension so if you do the math on that three days of delivery him you got a almost a sure thing that you're going to have some elements of the dementia\nHe can't say exactly why delivery of leads to dementia but elite has develop strategies to sharply reduce delivery him in his ICU we have a separate story about that later today on all things considered and available

environment\nWe're operating in what amounts to a game of regulatory thing on which you have one administration developing rules only to have the next roll them back\nAnother important reason Exxon

threaten the future of economic stability for many city residents\nThese are among the conclusions in a new report out this morning by Boston indicators the research center of the Boston foundation\nWith us that was Luke Schuster he's one of the authors of this report which is titled Boston's booming but for whom building shared prosperity in a time of growth good morning Lukas thanks for\nComing into ... you are good morning thanks for having me so it's a little hard to figure out whether it'd be encouraged discouraged by the synthesis of several economic research projects the good news\nAppears to be that Massachusetts in the Boston economy appears stronger than the nation overall\nYeah that's right I think a lot of places have a rising income inequality declining economic mobility\nBut an economy that stinks and that's not the case here we're starting from a position of strength and just the challenge for us is that we need to do a much better job of ensuring that are booming economy has actually delivering for everybody\nWill tell us about the economic stress for some people who live in greater Boston at the report found\nYes so for example even though our economy has continued to grow incomes for most folks throughout the distribution especially at the lower and middle ends of the distribution haven't increased hardly at all while the economy continues to grow\nThe report finds Boston has his seventh highest rate of income inequality of all American cities in Massachusetts as this six tires rate of all the states highways that\nPart of it is just that we have a a high wage high skill economy so we are attracting workers at the top end of the distribution and we're not doing enough to help uh folks without a college degree move up the income ladder and and earn more of a family sustaining wage in ... in live more of a middle class existence\nIs it at least partly due to the fact that we have booming centers like the seaport in Boston like Kendall Square in Cambridge but that boom is not necessarily pushed out or to help employee people in in a lower income neighborhoods\nI'd say one specific example that's playing out on exactly this domain is we're not providing enough housing to meet the demand for folks to live here so that like you said booming Kendall Square and the seaport\nUm we've built some new housing but the housing we're building is nowhere near meetings that demands a overtime and it's wicked expensive [laughter] it's wicked expensive yeah and and again\nI'm part of why a costs are rising is because the economy's humming along in the challenges just wages for most people throughout the distribution aren't rising alongside that economic growth one of the other things that's concerning us is Boston's middle class has really been ...\nOh has grown since Nineteen Ninety and yet the share of middle income households in the city has declined by Fifteen thousand so\nThese costs pressures are are really squeezing out folks in the middle Boston households burning at the media and have to spend more than fifty percent of their income to afford the median rents for units currently listed on the market\nOkay you hope to start a discussion with some of your recommendations action areas to try and fix this give me a couple\nYes there's a lot we can do locally to help build more broadly shared prosperity on we can expand basic labor force protections this is an area where we've actually made some real progress in Massachusetts we\nPassed a earn paid sick time recently on the ballot providing a a guaranteed paid sick time for employers above a certain size um\nWe have a a relatively high state minimum wage um but there's more we can do on the spot for example\nGuaranteeing predictable scheduling for part time workers so that\nParents are able to plan for you know doctors visits for their kids and not jeopardize their career while doing that\nUm there's a whole lot we need to do to make education more affordable especially early education in higher education because we know education is so central to the long term economic opportunities young people have\nSo I have to ask as we conclude are you optimistic or not so in terms of trying to fix this in the short or long term\n[noise] I really am optimistic I think we have so many pressing longstanding challenges that I don't think we should be Pollyanna about this but we're fortunate to have a strong economy and that really gives us a position of strength in addressing these challenges moving forward\n...
