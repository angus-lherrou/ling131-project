S. much of the country's retirement plans\nAre invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edits weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nBut what's interesting here is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing years ago China used to weaken its currency to make experts cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger and this was putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nChina is doing a China doesn't want it\nLead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and\nChina are these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a columnist I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chain to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war\nAnd that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost NPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out text\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency is like bitcoin is the latest solution coming from big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science was talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in all sorts\nOf agriculture perfect oils frustration\nOur sometime in ... the climate change ... he came to the conference to spread awareness about ... [noise] so what is it\nA chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology\nOkay think of it like ... ... is like an accounting\nBook everyone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut it said on the computers of everyone on the block chain transparency is the main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency blocked Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to ending human trafficking now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nBall gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he still makes the grand tech world pitches he's a CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... the black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credits distance the total number of carbon possible to MIT is kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more economists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use ... to verify the accounting and go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nAnd then the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause he's a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it's just there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars the pollute\nBecause it before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data with the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees a company is planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agrees but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially Ken kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem something that's how people\nWith a clock ticking on climate change ... there's no time to waste sorting facts from high\nFor NPR News I'm Sam Harnett\nThis is NPR News on that point nine

recorded the final out in game two of the world series last night at Fenway that call was from Fox capping off the socks for to win over the Dodgers\nThe Sox now lead the best of seven series two games to none that will you be you are as boards and society reporter Shira Springer was at Fenway last night for the game and joins us again this morning as you did yesterday\nThat talked about a good morning Sheera good morning not so start with the pitching pretty impressive no one was sure before the game which David Price was going to show up last night the one who through\nSix scoreless innings against the Astros last week for his first ever playoff when as a starter a or the pitcher who struggled in the playoffs his entire career and fortunately the good price showed\nUp basically the good price show that he wasn't as dominant in game to you that he was in his first path went as a starter\nBut he got three six ... and all that only two rounds on three had can I say only because it could have been much worse at he found himself in serious trouble in the fourth inning it with the bases loaded jam now allow and of course\nI look good um but the you know there was action out in the bullpen and was it was it was that nerve wracking but he pitched his way out of it and you know Red Sox manager Alex course said that was an absolutely crucial moment in the game\nWhere you didn't Houston and what he did too and I we needed is when you get six seven years Sanders sleeves dumped luminous these effects everything falls into place when I was six he was going to be tough to me\nAnd I have to say overall price seems like a more confident looser happier player after the game I saw him in the clubhouse playing with his young son before he went out for his press conference so it does seem like he has truly turned a corner I'm this postseason\nAll right let's talk about the hitting now in some timely hitting the socks went ahead for good last night in the fifth inning on a single by JD Martinez the slugger whether you have to say about the big it being a single\nWell he was almost proud of it um you know is that it was a single and and not a home run he says it shows that he's a complete hitter and also he says that showcases the red Sox approach to hitting where they grind out at that\nWhich they certainly were last night\nYes I mean it's amazing how many hits they have that come with two outs I mean they are such clutch hitters\nAny unexpected heroes last night in game to see\nI think we should start having an unexpected hero award considering you know there was a ... game one and for game too I Would nominate joke Kelly reliever Joe Kelly let's not forget this is a guy who struggles mightily during the regular season and that's probably kind\nLast night he pitched a score the seventh inning more than that he got three quick ads on eleven pitches eight of them for strikes\nAnd after the game Kelly talked about turning around his pitching and the role Cora played in giving him confidence\nIs one of those guys who\nKnows how counted guys are even when they're struggling and uh\nYou know and the and he works as bought off you know he just doesn't sit there in his office watches video he tries to get all those guys firing on all cylinders\nI Know I keep saying it but ... really is a manager who seems to be pushing all the right buttons at all the right time and I think that was also evident in the atmosphere I saw in the club has that it wasn't celebrate tore in any way they weren't you know excited about the fact that they were up to well on the Dodgers it was more businesslike and you\nKnow I felt like they were taking it all in stride and they recognize that there was more work to do\nAnd more work comes tomorrow night as the scene shifts to Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles it's game three uh know designated hitter of course at National League ballparks in the world series is that a problem for the red Sox\nI don't know if

u._s. stock market looks ready to recover some of yesterday's\nDramatic losses when Wall Street opens this morning most Asian markets were down overnight the Nikkei hang saying that the Shanghai stock exchange was stable which was unexpected because China stock market has fallen thirty percent since January and its currency is falling to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years\nNPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob the morning I spent thirty percent drop for China stock market sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\nWhich I kind of me has been lagging for the last few years the government's dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble and through all of this Beijing's making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from\nAn economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in China stock market this year reflects that\nBut it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have as big an impact on the economy like if the ... the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China and it's still relatively young market and it isn't\nA great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is editor weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\n[noise] well it's interesting hearing well is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make experts cheaper but that's not what's happening out what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nTrying to doing a child doesn't want its currency to be depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nAre these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chain to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming for big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in all\nSorts of agriculture\nCarpets oils frustration\nSometime in ... climate change coalition he came to the conferences spread awareness about ... [noise] so what is it\nBlocked chain or distributed electric technology really references a larger system of technology\nOkay think of it like ... ... is like an accounting book\nEveryone can see a distributed ledger it's a record of transactions that isn't held by a central authority like a bank\nBut instead on the computers of everyone on the block chain transparency is its main advantage tons of new companies are springing up saying that they will use the transparency block Jane to solve all sorts of problems everything from curing cancer to endings human trafficking now even climate change\nIts it's our intention to build the infrastructure to make it possible to reverse climate change\nWell gamble used to be a software product manager he's working on climate change now but he still makes the grand tech world pitches he's a CEO of a new Silicon Valley company called ...\n... the black chain based marketplace that makes it easier for people to pay for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere\nRight now California parts of the U.S and Canada the European Union and the number of other countries are participating in cap and trade carbon credit systems the total number of carbon possible to admit it kept and then companies can buy carbon credits that let them in more economists love this market based solution but there's a problem when it comes to counting the carbon\nCarbon markets in the past have been plagued with issues of fraud and double counting\nNobody wants to use ... to verify the accounting end to go one step further to create a market for people taking carbon out of the environment\nNow the company has been launched yet but that isn't limiting the ambition of the sales pitch you want to make the whole climate change problem just go away so do scientists like Douglass McCauley yeah I Wish it was that easy\nBecause a researcher at UC Santa Barbara you said the danger of Silicon Valley is big promise disrupt everything eat those is that it suggests there's a quick and easy solution that things that fix climate change are going to be really hard like getting countries to cut emissions or people to stop driving cars to pollute\nBecause I said before it was blocked Jane artificial intelligence in big data were the hot new things and these are proven to be valuable tools for climate research but in each case it took scientists a few years to cut through all the hype\nWe need to look past the shiny thing and start talking about exactly how to apply it usefully\nBecause it could help with things like counting carbon credits or keeping track of say how many trees the company has planting to suck carbon out of the air Katherine mocking a climate scientist at Stanford agree but she says it's dangerous to believe block Jane will be some kind of a miracle cure\nIt's essentially can kicking ethics where we won't be putting into place the solutions that are actually more important to make the entirety of the problem from the Neshoba ...\nWith a clock ticking on climate change max that there's no time to waste sorting facts from high\nRent PR News I'm Sam Harnett [noise]\nThis is NPR News\nThis is not a point nine you be you are coming up guns and immigration at issue in a feisty debate when the candidates for state attorney general the time is eight twenty nine\n[noise]\nThe aftermath of two hurricanes continues to have devastating consequences in Puerto Rico particularly in hard to reach areas in the central mountains\nThough the Puerto Rican government says the electric grid is in working order some infrastructure has yet to be repaired the lack of electricity is leaving some communities looking for new ways to get water W.
