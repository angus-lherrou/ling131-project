Daniels a nurse she knows she sections have sky rocketed she also knows lots of diseases like asthma allergies obesity have spiked maybe partly because babies aren't getting their moms microbes during their birth when\nA baby is born through the canal and they get that first introduction of bacteria and it starts their immune system the C sections very sterile procedure\nYou know they're not getting that first kicked in their immune system and it just made sense that it's a possibility that you know this spike in these actions is linked to possible health issues with our kids\nDanielle heard about other moms trying bacterial baptisms on their own she'll she thought I Am a nurse my husband teaches high school biology\nI even told me maybe I might well nobody has to know my husband would help me out\nBut it's a you know again I Try not to take a necessary read\nDanielle knows it could be dangerous babies could catch nasty infections by mistake so she was thrilled when she found out you could be part of a study the first study the food and Drug Administration is allowing to test whether this is safe and helps\nBabies any who knows what's gonna happen with the results but as it does show something positive I just think that would be great for kids and parents\nDoctors Sochi Horgan is with us She's leading the study half the babies will get their moms microbes half will

feeling good today was the issue is Daniella Nick are still trying to design a name and they don't actually know their new daughter got Daniels microbes were sterile\nSolution but they have their fingers crossed she was walk with the microbes\nI really hope that she was and that you know she won't have any health issues I I think if during the decreased chance of her having a health issue that would be\nAwesome her husband Nick agrees were not terribly religious so we won't baptized with water holy water but he liked the idea of\nA bacterial baptism instead of holy baptism because now she's been initiated with a bacteria friendly bacteria that should protect her down the road and I think that things\nDr Horgan will do this with fifty babies to make sure it's safe and then hopefully
