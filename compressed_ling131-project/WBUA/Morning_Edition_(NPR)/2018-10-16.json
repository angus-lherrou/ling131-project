Lexis Broadway in Boston dot com\nGroup do you view ours carry young is part of our at a pie team covering this federal trial and was in court for a day one yesterday and she joins us now there's more to good morning Carrie good morning Bob so let's start by having you explained the role that this rating system plays in admissions decisions\nWell the personal ratings are are one of four scores that applicants get when they apply to Harvard and the plaintiffs the group known as students for fair admissions are are trying to show that not only is this the most important factor in admissions\nBut that Asian Americans like you mentioned routinely perform worse in this area than other ethnic groups so in court yesterday in opening statements their statistical analysis showed that among uh the top academic performers of the top death Silas they called it\nTwenty nine percent of a white applicants I'm also got a top personal scores they're forty six percent of African American applicants gotta top scorer in the personal rating\nHispanic applicants that was around thirty four percent but Asian Americans came in the lowest with about twenty two percent and this lower rating and personal scores this coming the plaintiffs say well Asian Americans perform the best in academics and other ratings\nAnd for this reason they say that's discriminatory\nRight they say they'll they'll first point to this pattern in general that this is discrimination\nBut they're also based on court documents and deposition records it seems like they'll likely be digging into how admissions officers\nDescribed Asian American applicants when giving them that personal score so how often they used stereotypical descriptions ah I think one example used was an officer said that a student was very bright but did they ever have any fun\nAnd then comparing that you know how often that that happened with other demographic groups\nSo Harvard acknowledges that race is considered but denies any discrimination and how do they work that\nWell the university says in admissions ... you know race is a factor of a factor so affirmative action law requires that that race is not a determinative factor that it can't be a reason that you would met someone but it can be weight and the decision and Harvard says they are following that rule\nBut they say that someone struggle with racism and then Brazilians through that struggle in high school perhaps it's something that they would look on positively in admissions than they've argued that you really can't ignore race in real life and then in order to achieve their diversity goals they say race really does need to be considered\nOn opening day yesterday there was only one witness right the harbor dean of admissions William fitzsimmons\nCorrect yes Williams a fitzsimmons did take the stand\nSo he was asked about recruiting practices and how Harvard decide who should receive an invitation to apply to us about the uh the arguments over that\nWell the practice that the the plaintiffs were getting at were regarded pie SAT an SAT scores and how that triggered a recruitment letter that would go out to this specific example dealt with white males in rural states and so\nThey say that ... for Asian American males it took a higher score so uh Thirteen eighty on that test to get a letter than than white males in those areas\nAnd the plaintiff's attorneys said that that is race discrimination but fitzsimmons came back and said no that practice as just recruitment and it's just reaching out to people all over the country\nBut what about the higher scores require did fitzsimmons explain that\nWell from what I gathered it seemed like recruitment is essentially marketing here so they are targeting people who might not otherwise think of going to Harvard so in rural states at least that's why white males get those letters with lower scores and Asian males\nSo Kerry dean fitzsimmons returns to the witness stand today\nHe does he'll be on the witness stand today and it's an early day in court ending about one o'clock so Harvard seems to think that he'll be on the stand again on Wednesday as well the trial in general is supposed to last about two to three weeks though\nWVU ours carry young and are at a fight team are covering the trial will hear from them again as this trial proceeds ...

MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep the story starts with a quiz here's your quiz master Noel King\nIt comes from political scientist John ... at the University of Nebraska he's going to describe two towns and you have to guess which one is liberal and which is conservative here's ten number one\nThe schools with stress you know patriotism and respect and it would be a very rules based on educational system the how this would be fairly similar the lawns would be a very nicely kept in a beautifully green and mowed the town of ... with lots of churches\nAll right and here is ten number two\nThe schools would be based more on experience are all kinds of things rather than than rote memory people would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those than churches\nThis quiz with probably pretty easy for you and to explain why we're joined now by NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam Hi center I Know so the first time I'm guessing was conservative and the second one was liberal right\nExactly not hitting is drawing on fairly traditional stereotypes about liberals and conservatives\nConservatives prefer author and rules liberals prefer experiential schools and community theaters now those are stereotypes which means that they're going to be liberals who hate community theaters and conservatives who despised churches but the question that hitting and others are asking is how come these stereotypes are so often accurate\nBeing liberal and conservative is all about our political views how can these labels describe all kinds of other things about us from the kinds of food we prefer to eat to the kinds of poetry we left\nTo where we want to hang out so he is arguing that our political views spring from something deeper than just our beliefs about the government or small government\nPrecisely he's arguing that political preferences at least in part\nCome from a psychological and biological predispositions\nThe most compelling evidence for this comes from studies involved in large numbers of twins some of whom identical and some of whom are fraternal\nIdentical twins share the same genes fraternal twins share fewer genes identical twins to not to have more political preferences in common than fraternal twins do even though each ... presumably share the same family and upbringing\nHeight for example turns out to be about eighty percent a heritable when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent\nThirty to forty percent so he's saying some part of our political beliefs come from biology yes and of course\nNot confusion upset a lot of people\nAnd they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that\nWhat he and his colleagues are saying is that biology and psychology play a role in our political preferences snow all liberals and conservatives in the United states often accused one another or stupidity or malice but it's hitting on his colleagues outright one reason we might not see the world the same way is because we simply not lie at the same way", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "16"}
