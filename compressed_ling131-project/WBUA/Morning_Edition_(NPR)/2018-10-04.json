epidemic swept across Brazil\nWe're born with microcephaly or I'd normally small had among other and parents that come with that around the same time BBC producer William Kramer had a child of his own who was also born with microcephaly although not because of the guy\nCramer wanted to know how Brazil's so called ... babies were developing so we went there and produced a radio documentary called seek a love story among the people he met there where her ... she's the head of a support group for parents called the United mothers' angels\nYou lost your mind about this on our singing talents to push through to get him out of whom I gave us two options either be a victim in don't do anything or become a protectionist and the lives of these kids\nI talked with a million Kramer about his reporting earlier this week can you introduce us to the women you met so you go to Brazil to try to follow up on the children who were born out of busy a crisis and you meet this network of mother\nYeah that's right I mean it was it was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds uneducated many of them very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I when I was that um they were very very they were very tight group loss of solidarity\nVery to time and women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us there was a ... a a degree of skepticism towards the press because they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about doctors as well which is kind of common for special needs parents\nSo they were quite a strong set of women I mean obviously very different ... the leader of this group which is called the ... mothers of angels [noise]\nUh this is a group in Penn on because states which is a sort of\nIts ... one of the states which was worst affected by the ...\nThe leader of that group is ...\nAnd she is you know really quite a powerful personality uh she doesn't mince words you know she's one of these people that just give you a look and you sort of just stopped talking\nA but also very charming and you know she's made a lot of friends with politicians sympathetic him pays ... people have started to try and campaign for the women\nWhat is the health status of these children who were born with the guy I mean you write that in the beginning these mothers were getting a horrible process that their children may not even survive beyond a year so I'm well how are they doing\nWell that's right and so around ten percent of them have died most of those and it's about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things up chest infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand um there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is\nThat there were very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there was some children who got what you can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind that he is you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achievements they're telling me that that much much more um you know disabled\nSome of the children who are more physically disabled or actually ... and some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around [noise] it's an incredibly mixed thing\nI'm not so much so that you actually tell the story of twins a girl who was born with a virus and her brother did not was matter of fact it yeah\nIt was you had this for a job that will go minutes of its or is she was cooled or she really couldn't move very much a tool she seemed very aware of what was going on around her but then she had her twin brother who was turned off him who he was acting just thought you would expect it to an offer a boy to act\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they didn't really understand they didn't know why it affected one twin and not another ... ... it's it's quite possible that it was because of genetic differences between them so that they now know that\nSome people seem to have a sort of genetic defense against the ...\nYou write that Zeke affected families are at a turning point why it's such an important moment in in their story\nIce or is that the families had a really thinking about the social aspect so what they're largely going to be like like [noise] what school are they going to go to ... and how would they be able to access to school um will moms be able to go back in and work again\nSo we're able to join and that the actual amount as far as as she went around some of the most deprived parts of northern Brazil and she's kind of giving talks to these women and giving them pep talks and just sort of saying you know you need to write to the magnates rights to help that she tell him to give you a bus to take a charter school you know just kind of thing\nAnd those are the kinds of social campaigning took the issues that they really start to do it now\n[noise] I Wonder because he has his personal connection because her own daughter has microcephaly how did you come back from his chats I did it did it change your alter the way you think about her condition in any way the\nChildren were very some some of the children ... the political you mentioned bill is at the twin she especially it was very similar to my gosh you reminded me so much my ... year ago\nAnd holding how it was just like holding my ... and\nHer mom was at that point when I was kind of Eighteen months ago when I was kind of despairing and in Eighteen months Katie my daughter has done so much and I really wanted to say the coffee on at least she's gotta worry she'll come you know\nBut you can't you know you just don't know where every child different ah I just felt like they were very like kind of\nJust as almost you know [noise]\nThe piece is called Zeke I Love stories it's on the BBC website and it\nWas written

California let's continue our series on how China is trying to influence the world this is being felt across the globe today in many ways but what China's leaders really want is to shape how the world perceives their country they're devoted massive resources to this and\nThe center of these efforts to shape perceptions is China Supreme leader himself teaching paying NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports from Beijing on cheese message and his media [noise]\nThe China Daily is the country's biggest English language newspaper by circulation\nI met with some of their young journalists recently at a cafe outside their headquarters they has to be identified only by their English first names as they weren't authorized to speak to foreign media one of them Gary said that no matter what's going on president Xi Jinping is always at the top of the news\nIn fact he says that's a rule that the government's mobile\nNews app which China Daily runs they go to sue sue ...\nUsing resident cheating paying always comes first he says and Premier League could always come second that's not to say that they make news every day\nBut even if they don't their new stays in the top two positions another journalist named Miranda says that news about she is edited with extreme caution\nShould get on his\nOwn mentally for the if we can possibly avoid using a name or do you get an error in an article related to she would have very serious consequences and\nState media to pick she is both a forceful visionary leader but also it down to earth man of the people\nOne minute they Trump the cheese achievements building China into an economic powerhouse the next they show him holding an umbrella for his wife ... meanwhile\nAnd he used it to broadcast simple earthy messages here he is delivering a characteristic line in a New Year's address in twenty Fifteen\nKids out with a Sharpie Mooney funding bull\nMeat pies don't just full of them in the sky observes the oh he adds we've all just kind of roll up our sleeves and get down to work\nMiranda says some of it seems to work on a domestic audience\nWas highly the town that\nGeneration of my family and my classmates all have pictures that she and hung on their walls from what I see there's a lot more a fourth on his family life compared to previous leaders but\nBehind the feel good coverage she's use of the media has helped him to consolidate his own political power to a degree not seen in China for decades\nParty controls the media and of course will control the message and basically she drinking or the message\nThat's University of Hong Kong media expert David Vander ski\nHe argues that the media is obsessive focus on Xi Jinping is displacing or racing other important news contributing to an information vacuum about China just when the world can least afford it but new show you know media scholar communication University of China in Beijing\nArgues that China needs to focus on a main character to tell a story effectively and she is ... character\n... yeah I mean the only person we call her leader promoter in chief of the nation's public image himself takes this very seriously\nChina began taking his image building very seriously before ... became president trace this back to the two thousand and eight Beijing Olympics he says that many Chinese felt that foreign media criticism of their pollution and human rights record spoil their moment in the world spotlight\n... down at the we felt or ability to transform interviews was inadequate we're unable to speak up\nSince then China has poured billions of dollars into its state run media hiring journalists and public relations firms for example the official new Chinese news agency or shouldn't why has expanded its overseas bureaus from a hundred to a hundred and eighty and less than a decade state broadcaster China radio international meanwhile\nHas expanded to allow it to put out twenty seven hundred hours of programming a day in sixty one languages\nThe message to his audiences is David ... is that China's rise is a boom all nations China portrays itself as a provider of public services and solutions to global problems\nAnd this is all about China's position in the world in a sense China's rightful position in the world economy will turn to southern ... for China will for all tied up with this ... including new foreign policy up the belt and road\nMore than Seventy countries have signed on to participate in ... signature policy aimed at building infrastructure ports in roads linking the world to China of course China is hardly alone and its focus on its leader and his policies Maria ... a media expert at Georgia State university\nSays Xi Jinping has a lot in common with other leaders\nFrom Russia's Vladimir Putin to Turkey's regiment type ear to want to even US President Donald Trump all of them she says use social media to portray themselves as political strongman and to put out nationalist and populist messages\nThat kind of the highlighting the leader I felt like he's bad but now it's humor and the communication to their channel is a kind of in addition to their communication system a large\nRabbinical the argues that China's story and its example of high speed economic growth is found more receptive audiences in many developing countries\nShould think about the broader picture that many other countries would still probably continue to see China as strong global actor and potential partner investor and all of those things\nBut independent analyst Wu ... says that China is having a harder time coming up with ideas that appeal to western audience says that's partly because ... says the Communist Party is publicly rejected universal values which hit argues don't fit China\nMothers who will resolve ways and means we'll see all the New England\nChina's leader publicly opposes everything from civil society to freedom and democracy that give some very little room to express themselves\nIf China has an alternative to what the west considers universal values it hasn't been clear about what those are despite this China appears to a foot influencing foreign perceptions high on its agenda [noise]\nOne of the young China Daily journalist named Bridget suggested this shift as a parent in her newspapers slogan\nYou can ensure young from for our model any laboratory and I'll go out into the world like the world in China\nNow its report on China and influenced the world\nThis model doesn't make it explicit but it's clear from China's media policies that

do it's been a great fundraiser by the way so far we've raised over a million dollars is Jeremy Hobson you pointed out a little earlier this morning but on the last day in order to have the money it takes to pay for the news and the months ahead\nWe still need to raise three hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars\nIt sounds like a lot of money it is a lot of money but already in the last half hour or so we've raised almost ten thousand dollars so we can do it\nIf you choose to get involved right now if you choose to get behind the news that you listen to all the time here on WB you are if you choose to play ... pledge right now and have your money go further thanks to the last match of this fundraiser\nLast match and it is not going to last very long because we are quickly running out of the matching money so\nThis is a fifty percent bump on top of your contribution whether you give ten dollars a month and the Mars Society members turn it into Fifteen a month for WB you are not just this month but for a whole year that's how it works when you give a monthly contribution it's matched for whole year\nIf you give a one time gift to say a hundred or five hundred or a thousand or five thousand that is also worth fifty percent more\nBut we are going to run out of the match you money very quickly this morning so jump on this while you still can all you have to do is take two or three minutes at the most right now and call one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven\nThree hundred and fourteen thousand dollars left to raise now you can also pledged W. B. U. R. dot org or you know there are a lot of organizations out there\nThere are a lot of enterprises that are really wonderful things were really proud of\nI'm an emotional like as\nIf he did commit an act of sexual misconduct assault or otherwise we was in high school or college do you believe it would be disqualifying\nShould be disqualified\nI think that would depend on um what I mean\nI guess essentially if the if it really depends there's so many degrees and I think now we're in a day where\nYou know times are a little bit different than they were back then and what those accusations work but um I think you have to look at the entire life of somebody not something they did as a teenager um you know back in those days are certainly a drinking a beer that's when you're doing these kinds of things and and stuff that\nUm [noise] you have to take it as an incident in high school it's kind of um\nHard to believe that at this level of of our federal government that that's what we're looking at to try and disqualify somebody from this position\nMe ask you as a result of the public debate over this we're seeing more women come from\nFormer CBS News anchor Connie Chung wrote an op ed about her own salt fifty years ago when she was a college student there have been numerous of these testimonials coming out [noise] what do you make of them as someone who defends Brett Kavanaugh who was at the center of all this\nWell I I think that\nSomeone one woman's experience or or because there are other experiences and certainly women have um had these assault experiences and we know that they go unreported and a lot of cases and things like that but that just sit on its own on its face doesn't make Brett Kavanaugh or any man\nGuilty of doing what they say they don't I mean in our country we have due process and you are supposed to be presumed innocent until proven guilty and this situation has been the complete opposite of that where he was presumed innocent based on a single accusation starting with it being anonymous\nThen it would be accusation had to face in the name to it\nThan there were four witnesses hall who could not corroborate that story\nBut have you ever had any friends who had this happen to them to have people in your life who have suffered a sexual assault I'm sure that I Do yeah and how many men do you know who've ever been falsely accused\nI don't they haven't told me that who they're accuser who they're accusing so I Know it's a very small percentage but that does it's about I think ten percent of the cases I think that the data shows it just doesn't mean\nThat Brett Kavanaugh is guilty because Ninety percent of the men who are accused are guilty ... there are men who are accused of things and they're not guilty and we can look at UVA can look at um a visit to Duke lacrosse\nYou know there are instances and frankly this one is a very public one um the timing of this was incredibly suspect um there's a lot of holes and the stories of I'm Dr Ford there's Ramirez is barely credible the New York times as you know do everything with operate any of it\nKnowing women who have endured this you know that there are eight is common to have holes in one's name right that you can't recount necessarily\nThe Elders holes are one thing but lies or other things I mean\nI'm you know fear of flying not true the second door on the house um again that the data they the history shows that was that you like indoor was put on for years before the therapy session that apparently was about this incident\nThere are a lot of things like I said in the testimony that Rachel Mitchell did not follow up on that ah you know now are coming out after the fact and the fact that we never holes in her story we\nWe do not know it is true that we don't have conclusive evidence either way may never we may never but I just wondering closing is there any part of you that wonders what if I'm wrong what if you did you\nKnow there actually isn't um and it's just not enough in our country to make an accusation against somebody anybody for any job any position um or just for their life\nWithout having some cooperation um you know maybe the lesson is that women if these things happen to you need to either report them could fight and somebody\nOr something like that so that you know you have a strong case but uh that's not the case here\nUm and and all three of these instances one who was much more salacious then the next there is no cooperation\nWe have to leave it there but we appreciate you sharing your thoughts ... missing a big old car from Brett Kavanaugh's thank you so much for your time thank you for having me and this is NPR News\nSupport for NPR comes from WB you are from Amazon Prime video presenting the return of the men and the
