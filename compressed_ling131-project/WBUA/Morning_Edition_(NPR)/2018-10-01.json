the patch need to keep the momentum going\nWe haven't played well last week saying you know we talked a lot about the things we need to do better and we need to care more from week to week show this game's great but you know you got to turn the page once you learn from it and you focus on next game\nYou're running us this morning for a recap of yesterday's when as he is most Mondays is ESPN dot coms Mike ... good morning Mike good morning by of everything is right again in New England [laughter]\nIt was almost like Dr Jekyll and Mr hyde we've had the evil Mr hyde for a couple of weeks and yesterday we got the smart or a doctor Jekyll patch really turned it around they were struggling on off into defense last week but shined on both sides of the ball yesterday why was well\nThey did and and one of the players Devon McCord he told the story after the game that Tom Brady was in the locker room and said it feels great to be two in two and and you'd never think the patriots would want to be too into but after they played so poorly\nThe last two weeks just to get back to that sort of level ground they felt really good about and and I would say if you want to highlight one thing they started faster so they were able to play the game more on their terms\nAll right let's talk about uh the defense right now are they allowed just one touched down very late in the game they didn't allow the dolphins within forty five yards of the end zone until the fourth quarter how they\nThat well one of the big things that they did was they played better on early down so they stopped the run they got back to fundamentals and when Miami had to get a first down they had a long way to go Bob I mean their first\nEight plays I think they needed ... yards or more to get a first down and when you put a team in that situation it really allows you to dictate the terms\nOf the play and they were able to pressure to them and really over matched them in the game defensive stand out for the parents will there were a few but I Would say Kyle's van noir linebacker and and there was one play in the second quarter\nThat really sort of reflected that and it was a bad snap by the Miami Dolphins and the ball was on the ground in the Miami Dolphins quarterbacks ... really looked like he had the ball in ... just never relented he came right in jumped on him and really took the ball away from Bob and that was ...\nIt a little bit more All right back to often so the patch made plays both throwing the ball in running the ball tells you about the improved running game and the performance of their rookie running backs Sony Michel\nSony Michel finished with one hundred twelve yards on twenty five carries with one touched down and really the story here is that you can't produce like that if you don't have good blocking up front it's not just the running back it's those big offensive linemen and they got back to playing\nUh the the way they know where they can play they blocked a lot better so he was a a standup with thirty three offensive snaps and then you had the old standby genes white\nWho had two touchdowns one rushing one passing it running back as well and that you know he played forty snaps and he's one of their best players in NATO\nAll right Tom Brady a pass for two hundred Seventy four yards but still struggled some on the receiving a with receivers he\nDid he still looking to get comfortable you know it doesn't seem like it's a Tom Brady you know from start to finish that were used to seeing but it certainly was good enough he finished twenty three of thirty five for two hundred and Seventy four yards with three touchdowns\nInto interceptions I'm One of the big storylines\nWas him getting comfortable with the new target Josh Gordon who played Eighteen snaps and he's going to really help the patriots he looked OK yesterday he he really did he he gave them a lot of energy at two catches for thirty two yards and and he just gave him another option you know that's one thing that has stood up to the first three games of the season prior to this one\nThey just seem limited they need more options to throw too on our fence and he sits right next to Tom Brady in the locker room and he said after the game that he really appreciate the support and love the Brady is given him if he tries to get his career and really his life back
