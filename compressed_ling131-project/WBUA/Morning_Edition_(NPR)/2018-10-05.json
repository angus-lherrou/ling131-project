morning thanks for having me so I have to say I watched a good chunk of the first half of the game last night Thursday\nGames are pretty challenging since both the colds are and the patriots play just a few days earlier last Sunday but the patriots seem\nVery well prepared yeah as a patriots fan you stop the part of the game that you wanted to see ah they were excellent and the first half opening up but twenty four to three lead at half time then they slipped a little bit in the third quarter but\nIf they can play like they did in the first half they're going to be just fine the rest of the season\nLet me ask you about Julian Edelman first came back with the season the patriots top wide receiver you served a four game suspension for use of a performance enhancing substance of fans in teammate said pretty much eagerly awaited his return and he was happy to see all of them here's what he said last night\nI haven't played football and ... I think it was excellent and five days or something like that so it was good to be out there in front of the crowd Iraq and they're often you know seeing all that was was amazing so it was just great to be back\nSo from your point of view was he good he was very good and he created a lot of energy for both the patriots and the fans\nUh one of the great visuals of last night was when the patriots were announced to come onto the field before the game Julian Edelman let them out of the tunnel and he just sprinted Bob from one end zone\nTo the other and sort of leaped up in the air and pumped his fist and the crowd really roared and then he ... the first half of the game they really wanted to get them involved early alright how about TV twelve a\nQuarterback Tom Brady he threw his five hundred career touchdown pass last\nNight he looked pretty good too he did a historic night just to third player in NFL history to throw for five hundred touchdown passes\nUm and and so that was impressive and also set another record by doing it to ... thrown a touchdown to Seventy one different players no one has ever thrown it to that many players at least one touchdown pass Seventy one different players touchdown pass it's in a while that's pretty\nBut he also talks about how that means you've played a long time [laughter] let me uh asked this question or as we pointed out the ... look really good in the first half they only gave up three points to the field goal by a Adam ... on the cold side but in the second half it was a little bit of a different story what happened then should concern us well\nWhat happened was at the patriots didn't have the ball security Tom Brady through a couple of nights passes one too wide receiver Chris Hogan and ... and Chris Hogan couldn't catch it sort of popped up in the air\nAnd the colds intercepted it and then later in the third quarter a similar situation a pass to Rob Gronkowski or that the big tighten normally would would bring in but instead it's sort of bad it up in the air and the Colts intercepted that one as well\nAnd it was a good reminder to the patriots that when they don't secure the ball they get a little bit sloppy or the other team gets turnovers those can be a great equalizer and keep the other team in the game and it is a concern because the patriots can't play like that against better teams if they expect to win All right next\nA next time they play which would be about a week and a half they play the chiefs are in their next game I ... out of the chief slogan and what's the long lay off a lot of the patriots to do well Bill Belichick\nGave the players three straight days off players were very happy about that so they get to rest up he'll up some of their injured players and the Kansas City chiefs Bob and one of the best teams in the NFL they're one of two undefeated teams heading into this weekend\nGreat offensive team they've they've scored more points than anyone in the NFL so that really has a chance to be a marquee matchup a week from Sunday so it's their biggest challenge yet disease and no question about it my\nEighty nine point one WB wage rooster and streaming W.

I think it was like four or five days or something like that so it was good to be out there in front of the crowd there rocking they're awesome you know seeing all of them was was amazing so great to be back\nSo from your point of view was he good he was very good\nWas the patriots and the fans uh one of the great visuals of last night was when the patriots were announced to come onto the field before the game Julian Edelman let them out of the tunnel and he just sprinted Bob from one end zone\nTo the other and sort of leaped up in the air and pumped his fist and the crowd really roared and then he ... the first half of the game they really wanted to get them involved early\nAlright how about TV twelve a quarterback Tom Brady he threw his five hundred career touchdown pass last night he looked pretty good too he did a historic\nNight just a third player in NFL history to throw for five hundred touchdown passes um and and so that was impressive and also set another record by doing it to ... thrown a touchdown to Seventy one different players no one has ever thrown it to that many players at least one\nTouchdown pass Seventy one different players touchdown passes in a while that's pretty ah that that's pretty significant helpless but he also talks about how that means you've played a long time [laughter]\nLet me uh asked this question or as we pointed out the patch look really good in the first half they only gave up three points the field goal by a ... on the cold side but in the second half it was a little bit of a different story what happened then should concern us well what happened\nWas that the patriots didn't have the ball security Tom Brady through a couple of nights passes one too wide receiver Chris Hogan and ... and Chris Hogan couldn't catch it sort of popped up in the air and the colds intercepted it and then later in the third quarter a similar situation a pass to Rob Gronkowski\nOr that the big tighten normally would would bring in but instead it's sort of battered up in the air and the colds intercepted that one as well\nAnd it was a good reminder to the patriots that when they don't secure the ball they get a little bit sloppy or the other team gets turnovers those can be a great equalizer and keep the other team in the game\nAnd it is a concern because the patriots can't play like that against better teams if they expect to win\nAll right next a next time they play which would be about a week and a half they play the chiefs are in their next game ... out of the chiefs looking at what's the long lay off the patriots to do well Bill Belichick\nGave the players three straight days off players were very happy about that so they get to rest up he'll up some of their injured players in the Kansas City chiefs Bob or one of the best teams in the NFL there wouldn't have two undefeated teams heading into this weekend\nGreat offensive team they scored more points than anyone in the NFL so that really has a chance to be a marquee matchup a week from Sunday so it's their biggest challenge yet the season no question about it\nMy Greece covers the New England patriots for ESPN dot com and provides regular analysis for WVU our news in a week and a half looking forward to it thanks so much [noise]\nThe home of Boston's largest radio news rum Ninety two point seven ... eighty nine point one WB wage Brewster and streaming at W.

all the way down to Ninety nine so we rent a space and now we got a hundred all the way up there one ... them to us and now we've got what one oh five\nAnd later came one is six ... seven and eight it's an impressive display the court doesn't dwell too long and the many highlights of the red Sox season throughout the summer course says he made one message clear\n... there's a bigger picture than just one day during the season\nTranslation you don't live and die with each regular season game and you build toward the play offs how did you get that message across he\nGave players days off to rest that happened as early as game six when he didn't start looking back ... also communicates regularly with his players he's as comfortable as they are texting and talking playing cards at forty to court isn't much older than some of his players\nAnd he'd rather be in the club ... with his players than alone and his office\nGood conversations when you're in a in a relaxed environment they don't know it but they know that sometimes you know it's better to talk baseball why we're playing cards you know or or talking about their families and where they are a lot of individuals when you're over there and they're on vitamin\nBut it takes more than great communication skills to get the best record in baseball there's also corps ability to balance is baseball instincts and analytics when asked if it's been hard to strike that balance with the red Sox players chorus says now\nYour baseball i._q. takes over a and one thing I learned right away\nOr during the off season just talking to them they're they're bright you know they were in the same page as far as like [noise] I'm taking advantage of sort of things that the game will give you and uh they pay attention to details and that's what I tried to do to\nYou can see the impact in defensive alliance and pitching strategy in line up construction ... also says that the organization is on the same page to and that contributes to the kind of chemistry necessary to be as consistent as the red Sox have been\nThey didn't have a losing streak longer than three games during the regular season and that happened only four times\nThe players they like to be GM's they like to be managers they liked the owners of the team but they they know what's going on and if they feel that there's now we're not in the same page\nUm they'll talk about it and is not good for for the environment so uh one thing I Want to make sure it's like they were in this together and when we talk about analytics or or base running or ... or medical staff you know that I Want to make sure they know that the seasons do we make their made it as a group\nLooking ahead to the playoff court and the red Sox could easily find themselves facing the Houston Astros last year the Astros won the world series with Cora as their bench coach so what does he think of possibly facing is former team in the postseason well since the Astros are the defending champions chorus sees them as the ones to beat\nWe're having a great season I Know everybody's talking about us but they're the ones you know so oh pressure on them\nStill some baseball pundits wonder how the red Sox will handle the weight of expectations especially since they haven't had any lengthy losing streak any late season worries about making the playoffs or any catastrophic injuries but don't tell the red Sox manager that his team hasn't been tested this season\nWe've been tested daily or that's the way we see a um a hundred and sixty two games are just very challenging regardless if you have success or not but I Know we haven't lost so many games in a row whatever blah blah blah but I think to stay focused and show up every day that's been a challenge for us\nAfter seeing what's happened on the field this season and talking with Cory and his office it's easy to understand why he sometimes called the next great baseball manager his response\nNah [laughter] I don't\nI don't consider myself a genius or a magician or whatever I just saw a baseball guy that surround them but my great people and then we have a lot of talent here\nThat talent will be on full display in game

to get to yes on Kavanaugh you know there's a lot of pressure from the left but there's also a lot of pressure from the right and she feels that so I've kind of felt like she's always been trying to get to yes now that was before\nThe sexual assault allegations and I think that's really through her for a loop and so it's really I really don't know at this point\nIf she does vote yes on Kavanaugh is she going to face backlash and the other direction\nAbsolutely I mean I think that especially with the sexual assault allegations which is sort of excavated a lot of really horrible experiences for a lot of women and they're angry they were already agreed just by virtue of the twenty sixteen election and you know now I think that's just intensified and she's going to have to face that\nThe
