in France\nWas a man named among Hong way he's from China but in a stunning move China's government detained mom put him under investigation and now he has resigned from Interpol I talked to NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz and ask them what do we know about my ... month\nAway is sixty four years old he served as the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are in twenty sixteen he became the first Chinese headed Interpol and there's an election was a big victory for China's government which under\nLeader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate and extradite Chinese officials at it deemed corrupt to escape China\nBut as it turns out among himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\n[noise] with China's government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded has come from his wife ... on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood even nights suggesting that he was in danger\nA week later she reported him missing to French police on Sunday she spoke to reporters and we own France were in trouble is headquartered and here's what she said\nWe had to go and you know when I'm speaking on behalf of anyone that children all the people in my hand on the\nWinds and children's husbands and fathers so that they may no longer disappear\nAnd as you can hear in that tape now while she's crying during this part of the video with their back turned to the camera because she's received threats and his under protection by French police well\nWhen she talks there about the husbands and fathers who disappeared in China what does she mean\nWell she's talking about the government anti corruption campaign was launched by she can paying immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and its neared hundreds of thousands of officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed Malone way to vice minister of public security was Julia Kong the highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the pull up your standing committee the group of seven men who rules China he was China security czar before he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nRob by removing them from the presidency of Interpol loses a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear what does this mean for ...\nWell even before this happened China's use of it are poll and amongst presidency was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China tempted issue in red notice that in the international alert\nWeaker activists readers are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how tried as messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob Dexter\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceedings this isn't an effort to save time and money that that happens some public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology from Illinois newsroom in Urbana league games reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that more than half of those appearances will not be in a courtroom in person the defendant will instead face a video camera from inside a jail\nSheriff just standard like stat system he's in Lewis ten in rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies used to have to do\nThey would have shackles on sort of stuff we're going to be half of war or taking and their belts are going to be trained together so you're walking down the line it's kinda like a three legged race\nStandard says the video system they now use freeze up more his officers for patrol and he argues that the convenience of the system is better\nFor everyone now we can take them friends of ours flew in from the video camera the judge has access to the video camera\nConversation just like we are now but it's just over a video screen\nBut Charles Davidson says it's just not the same Davidson is sixty eight years old and a recovering heroin user who is in and out of jails and prisons in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video process both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the video of course it just blew 'em up because it wasn't everybody get up and go in front of the screen and it is either yes or a nose or you know you couldn't Sunni today\nDavid ... says when you're in the same room as the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nOh trying to explain to the judge what happened and they told me to be quite\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison [noise]\nLayer Rosalie Joyce said she hear stories like David since all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concern that alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceedings began you already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd after a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom from my client\nUnless my clients and shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase Dale amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say it's a trade off that's unfair to defendants for NPR News I'm Lee gains in Urbana, Illinois [noise]\n\nWould also helping leaves the stand for salmon campaign for a ballot measure aimed at protecting the state's most iconic fish walking along the creek would says he thinks it's a long overdue change\nThe scale is fan tipped too far in favor of of development and industry and and we're just trying to pull it back towards the center\nAlaska has some of the most valuable salmon fisheries left in the world but wouldn't other ballot supporters say the state's laws protecting salmon are weak putting them at risk especially with a number of large new mines and oil developments in the works if it passes Alaska would enact a much tougher permitting process for big projects in salmon habitat\nAmong other things it would set strict standards for restoring Zaman streams if they're disturbed and the companies don't follow the rules they could face criminal penalties\nWould acknowledge is that in the states like Alaska it's a big ask\nWhen you start doing something like this it's really kind of some in your nose at the big guys you know\nDecades Alaska's economy has depended on industry dollars and oil and mining companies hate this initiative banded together under the name stand for Alaska they're backing a campaign to stop it running a blitz of that like this wire\nActually impose it brings a new regulations that slow or stop Alaska project\nCompanies have poured millions into the campaign against the ballot measure\nWith help from donors like BP and Exxon Mobil they've raised more money than all free of Alaska's gubernatorial candidates combined turned my size is with the council of Alaska producers the group that represents mining companies and she argues the state's salmon fisheries had so far ... existed with minds that oil developments just fine\nCompletely changing the way we regulate fish habitat at a time when we don't have a clear problem just seems crazy\nBecause I just thinks the initiative prioritizes standing at the expense of the state's biggest economic engines and taxpayers we couldn't\nHave the Alaska government that we have if it was only dependent on fisheries it just wouldn't be possible\nBut for many Alaskans similar more than just living or the occasional meal here they represent something deeper their vital food source in a traditional way of life in one of the
