I. D. G. would eventually you publish hundreds of by teen magazines around the world including computer world and PC World\nAuthor Glenn Redskin worked for a patent McGovern as an editor at computer world during the Nineteen eighties and has a new book out called future forward examining the legacy of McGovern work\nWe ask Glenn Redskin to start our conversation by describing his former boss\nThat in the govern what you saw was what you got he was a genuine person who didn't put on any airs for people he was genuinely kind he genuinely believed that if you treated employees and customers in in the proper manner in the right way that you would get back um rewards in spades and so\nThis guy was the real deal in in an industry in business which CEOs are often so cutthroat and so focused on the bottom line this was a guy who really was focused on making lives better in Massachusetts for example\nHe created the east stop the employee stock ownership plan that allowed a lot of employees including me to build a nest egg that we never would have gotten at another company he was among the first companies in Massachusetts to approve\nAnd partners of gay employees this was a guy who just saw the world differently\nI D G started or the now of course ubiquitous for dummies or how to series of books with a black and yellow covers the first for dummies book wasn't explainer on Microsoft's dos operating system he was interviewed by MIT back in two thousand nine\nAnd this is what he said about the Ford dummy series\nFrom sitting next to somebody in an airplane and they say now what ... oh the guy here that database that Bill Gates called me up and said [noise]\nOr we found that people are taking our manual out of the dust AH Software a package and tossing it away and then by your a manual because they can understand that so we should do is we'll put our code inside your book and they will sell the whole package which way this worked out very well\nDid that for dummies book fall into a pat governs of view making information accessible to everyone as much as possible was that the driving force behind it well\nIt certainly did fall into that category it was part of the mission which was to you know share information about information technology but in fact the for dummies book idea was presented to him by one of the employees are using patch famous let's try it attitude had actually was a little hesitant because he wondered and worried\nThat you would be insulting the readers by calling them dummies and when this young editor explain to him the purpose of it or he bought and right away and really the rest is history because that series just took off and there are now literally thousands of titles in that series\nTell us a little bit about the story in the book about how to govern in id gee we're able to convince Steve Jobs of apple to license the name mackintosh hard to imagine apple licensing mackintosh anyone\nYou have to understand in Nineteen eighty four\nSteve Jobs was just introducing the Mac and jobs was intent on making this ubiquitous platform and when McGovern showed up right away and he was you know the consummate salesman and said we can start a publication called Mack world on the day you release this computer\nAnd it will share with the world everything about Mac it will be the cheerleader for the brand\nAnd he convinced Steve Jobs that this would be really important for the brand jobs eventually and not long after decided that it was a bad idea to license the name and wish that he had never done it but McGovern managed to make the relationship work\nOr in a very positive way for decades\nWhat do you think that the government's biggest accomplishment was\nPat McGovern greatest accomplishment was building this global empire\nIn order to allow people all around the world to share information about information technology he also gave three hundred and fifty million dollars to MIT to found the McGovern Institute for brain research he built three of those in China so this guy left a legacy of\nConnecting people sharing information and making the world a better place because technology for all the the nay saying about it is in in his mind was an incredibly positive force\nGlenn Redskin author of the book future for worried about the legacy of ID\nGee founder and philanthropist pat McGovern thanks for coming

together and forming an office pool what about that\nOne in three hundred million is the famous twenty three hundred million um they're both astronomical so the odds are basically the same [laughter]\nJason Kirkland is lawyer who represents jackpot winters and he says if your office fooled does somehow when that is not necessarily good\nThere could be a lot of problems with office pools\nYeah sometimes not everybody knows who's and the girl for out which could lead to some awkward conversations if you were to win and that's not all\nI've been involved where people used to play in a group a long time ago and then somebody wanted a single and then the group went after them said no we're always playing together\nVery awkward but curling is not entirely against office pools\nWell you know I I understand why people do it 'cause ... you know you'll feel terrible if you're off his wife and you didn't contribute just because you didn't like those I Would never say not

manage patients based on training and experience not a set of numbers\nLaw would keep her from using her judgment\nData are just voters to color in the no ballot dot because passage would cost hospitals in the range of nine hundred million dollars a year Dayton says twenty five percent of the state hospitals are already behind on their bills\nThat would cause another twenty five percent off all half of the hospitals in Massachusetts would be running in the right it's not sustainable\nAnd if money is not well then I'd love to respond to the I mean the as you know this is twenty eight

I. D. G. would eventually you publish hundreds or vi teen magazines around the world including computer world and PC World\nAuthor Glenn Redskin worked for a patent McGovern as an editor at computer world during the Nineteen eighties and has a new book out called future forward examining the legacy of McGovern work\nWe ask Glenn Redskin to start our conversation by describing his former boss\nWas pat and govern what you saw was what you got he was a genuine person who didn't put on any airs for people\nHe was genuinely kind he genuinely believed that if you treated employees and customers in in the proper manner in the right way that you would get back um rewards in spades and so\nThis guy was uh the real deal in in an industry in business which CEOs are often so cutthroat and so focused on the bottom line this was a guy who really was focused on making lives better in Massachusetts for example\nHe created the east stop the employee stock ownership plan that allowed a lot of employees including me to build a nest egg that we never would have gotten at another company he was among the first companies in Massachusetts to approve\nHealth benefits for spouses and partners of of gay employees this was a guy who just saw the world differently\nI D G started a the now of course ubiquitous for dummies or how to series of books with a black and yellow covers the first for dummies book wasn't explained her on Microsoft's dos operating system he was interviewed by MIT back in two thousand nine\nAnd this is what he said about the Ford dummy series\nOf sitting next to somebody in their plan and they say I Know what ... oh the guy here that that would be like Bill gates called me up and said\nOh we found that people are taking our manual out of the dust AH Software a package and tossing it away and then by your a manual because they can understand it so we should do is we'll put our code inside your book and they will sell the whole package which we did worked out very well\nDid that for dummies book fall into a pattern that governs of view making information accessible to everyone as much as possible was that the driving force behind it well it certainly did\nWhich was to you know share information about information technology but in fact the for dummies book idea was presented to him by one of the employees are using patch famous let's try it attitude pat actually was a little hesitant because he wondered and worried\nThat you would be insulting the readers by calling them dummies and when this young editor explain to him the purpose of it or he bought and right away and really the rest is history because that series just took off and there are now literally thousands of titles in that series\nTell us a little bit about the story in the book about how to govern in id gee we're able to convince Steve Jobs of apple to license the name mackintosh hard to imagine apple licensing mackintosh anyone\nYou have to understand in Nineteen eighty four Steve Jobs was just introducing the Mac and jobs was intent on making this ubiquitous platform and when McGovern showed up right away and he was you know the consummate salesman\nAnd said we can start a publication called Mack world on the day you release this computer\nAnd it will share with the world everything about Mac it will be the cheerleader for the brand and uh he convinced Steve Jobs that this would be really important for the brand jobs eventually and not long after decided that it was a bad idea to license the name and wish that he had never done it\nBut McGovern managed to make the relationship work\nOr in a very positive way for decades\nWhat do you think that the government's biggest accomplishment was\nThat governs greatest accomplishment was building this global empire\nIn order to allow people all around the world to share information about information technology he also gave three hundred and fifty million dollars to MIT to found the McGovern Institute for brain research he built three of those in China so this guy left a legacy of\nPeople sharing information and making the world a better place because technology\nFor all the the nice thing about it is in in
