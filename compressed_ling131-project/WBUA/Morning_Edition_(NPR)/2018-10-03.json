China considered the Americans a threat and the huge Chinese army was soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but then intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with him so he sweat this information under the rug\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name is general Oliver Smith\nRealized

Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV is turn this on so any potential witness for victim is um let's say ten\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing\nThat is because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca Campbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nWhat trauma informed interviewing as saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in that case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation and the case that just Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed reporting but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrump believes the retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in over ... sex crime cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try looking at\nCircumstances scaring from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this oh fender becomes a big piece of this ...\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar tax but at the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI ...

Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week recalled some earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown between Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork we've been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy lead the attack\nIn Robert Bork some Erica there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination at the Ventura Lee Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very seat that as being battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about how politics and the government work hike okay Hi fi here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa aspect from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process has ended how does it affect their legacy we're not ...\nWell the hundred and sixty three nominations residents has been for the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice vote and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have the means that it's not controversial and that at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen it then rejected but the first was in the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused to move Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty that Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice Abe Fortas apt to chief also found in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected sense Rutledge but by the way he was also the fish to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWell the other part of our question is interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been saying you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominees after a contentious fight like this\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from his ship and went on to write books and make speeches than the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg was forced to withdraw because it illegally smoked marijuana but he stayed on the federal appeals court until they took senior status if he is Mac\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee cars that caused them to be removed\nUh the way you move is Supreme Court justice through impeachment just like the president only one justice has ever been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate\nThat was Samuel Chase and Eighteen oh for Thomas Jefferson wanted him off to quit because he disagreed with him politically he accused him about partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house of representatives had hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness is hardly know\n'em dead and the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing adjusted for political reasons\nAnd that leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from personal Connecticut I was wondering two other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now if so what was the result is that what is it with these lifetime appointments well lots\nOf judicial planned in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age cement and they've been talk of the Eighteen year term limits fares Supreme Court

I don't know that I Would make that argument that far ... like I think there are certain issues look there were already issues about whether he could fairly judge issues on presidential power and there were lots of discussions about whether he needed to recuse at the beginning of this process\nBecause President Trump might conceivably have some case before the court and over again I'm right\nI think there are numerous cases that could come before the court involving President Trump and a judge Kavanaugh has made lots of comments about the extent of a presidential power so that was a concern already and I think his demeanor last week um shows that there are a lot more concerns about his temperament\nJob at the American Constitution Society thanks so much and\nKeep a new State Department visa policy declared that starting this month and diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married Here's NPR's Michele tell them in\nA State Department official says marriage equality is the love the land here in the U.

B. U. R. doubled\nFor every month of the next year or have that hundred or two or that thousand or two dollar pledge that we hope you'll give in the next couple of minutes be doubled doesn't matter what the amount is only matters that you become a contributing\nListener the pledge line is one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or you can give at W. B. U. R. dot\nYou know it might seem like it would be easier if we just got a few or a few dozen or a few hundred\nDeep pockets to fund WB you are but that would be the shareholder model and that would mean that we would ultimately have to serve their interests so this is a different model this is the independent journalism listener supported radio model not for profit model\nThousands of people contribute each year to W. B. U. art amounts of ten dollars a month twenty dollars a month sometimes a thousand or a few thousand but it is mostly smaller donations and that is how you create and protect independent journalism\nNo better time to do your part toward that goal then right now during the first lasted only dollar for dollar match for the entire fall fundraiser and here's the thing other listeners have already been doing their part this morning they have taken about half of the matching money off the table\nYes she does and and on the stand insisted that that dash cam video which which seems to show the shooting very clearly um you know officer Van Dyke says that that does not accurately represent what happened it doesn't show what happened from his perspective\nUm that was an understanding yesterday he talked a lot of things that that he said the dashcam video can't see like McDonald's face in his you know he describes his huge eyes and and as\nShe was looking through Van Dyke and then he talked about that action that you heard there in the intro of of McDonalds turning toward him with and waving a nice forcing him to shoot 'em as you said none of those things are on the dash cam video\nAnd is this critical to his defense to try to describe his own state of mind and suggest that whatever you believe from looking at the video I believed I was in danger\nIt's absolutely critical to his defense I mean even if he wasn't an officer acting in self defense or requires that that the person who does it feels afraid for for his or her life\nAnd the police officer the bar for conviction is even higher you know it has to be what a\nReasonable officer would have done in that moment and so what Van Dyke even before he testified what he needed to convince the jury of\nIs that he was reasonably in fear for his life and so he's trying to bring in all sorts of other considerations besides that dash cam video to show why he would reasonably be here for his wife whites that look on his face or the turn that that you can't see on the dash cam video\nAnd I guess that would explain why he took the risk of taking the stand which defendants don't have to do\nThat is right and and this is not something I expected a you know it's something that we've been asking um attorneys in court routes watchers are the first two weeks of trial or do you think than dogs can take the stand\nOr what we heard were mixed answers we heard\nFrom a lot of attorneys who said um well you really have to testify out top or not you really have to testify if you're claiming self defense that's what's going to bring it home from the jury we also heard from a lot of other people who said oh no that's a huge risk to be to subject yourself to cross examination when there is that dash cam video\nWell how's the cross examination go well\nUm when bombs or Van Dyke was giving his testimony when he was questioned by his own attorney he was very emotional he cried when he described the shooting when he was being cross examined that emotion and sadness went away the prosecutor pushed him on the fact that his testimony was contradicted by the video and that it doesn't fit what a Van Dyke set in police reports\nInducted not have good answers for that he said he didn't remember what he said right after the shooting 'cause he was in shock and couldn't explain discrepancies with the video and he was he was combative with prosecutors seemed almost annoyed that he was being questioned\nDid is initial reports say anything about that look on the suspect's face or the the turn or anything else\nIt didn't say anything about the work but it did actually described in great detail alleged movements by requirement Donald the waving of the knife raising the knife and and it describes officer Van Dyke backpedaling from McDonalds none of those things are on the dash cam video\nPatrick Smith of member station WBFO easy in Chicago is covering this trial and his reporting
