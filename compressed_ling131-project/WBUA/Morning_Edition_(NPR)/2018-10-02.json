and with the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's hard for a lot of us\nTo get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how differently the total was of the two witnesses Dr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained I understand and appreciate\nSet out what happened to me and the impact that it had on my life and I my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own behalf\nOf his number one in the class I don't know if I thought well no no no no no no no no not this I'm going to I'm going to borrow more I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school rather severe mocked me was\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger\nFury tears in a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people [noise] I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that seemed tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling\nOf what happened to her ... has been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen\nElection anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning on women's march it was also anger\nAt some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the inter ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march and it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really just missing a lot of quarters as being about the cats to put the hat you know a bunch of women getting together and there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road\nBut this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has women protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office and historic numbers and then\nMeet you [noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically once so threatening about women saying well in part that\nAnger of the founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is a revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government so they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out are condemned to in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color who do so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think it's\nImpossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading fingers of so many of our social movements in ways that have remained invisible to us so when we think about meat you one of the things that gets lost [laughter]\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment stems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color who were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq's\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained but in fact\nAll of that is for grounded by women of color whose story so\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks in the past ... years and then we have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was a character assassination by the left so is women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive part of the antenna\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still I think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time\nAnd the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around calving off is going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future [noise]\nRachel\nSpoke there was Rebecca Traister the author of the book good at

Inskeep one woman found a way to attack high health insurance prices\nAnd that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer\nWhich passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about uh sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan in twenty fourteen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families and that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go\nBroke so the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us who get our health care benefits through our employers\nAnd part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Marilyn Bartlett do differently she had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd knew how to follow the money and so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid\nEach hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see that her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets\nPaid well and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage\nNeed our money so she said look you hospitals that are five times the Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital there would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals she called in a union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign statewide they sent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices\nIs there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for hospitals and other medical costs\nMarilyn would say absolutely yes her message really to employers as you need to push back you need to read the fine print in your contracts\nYou need to demand to know where the money is going and why the costs are so high get an itemized explanation for all of the expenses and when you do that you know you may need to the smaller employers may need to join together with other small employers to increase their leverage but they can bring down the prices\nMarshall Allen of ProPublica thanks very much\nThanks so much Steve this is NPR News\nProtecting

company Amazon announced that it plans to raise wages to Fifteen dollars an hour that is for all fulltime part-time and seasonal workers they're going to start this next month\nTo bold move for a company that's been in the spotlight lately and not in a good way necessarily NPR's Alina Selyukh is here in the studio to talk through what this change means highly good morning and just to note here Amazon is one of interest and natural supporters solely to what other details can you share\nRight so they she press release inherited a few takes away from that or take away from that you mentioned that uh the Fifteen dollar minimum wage will apply to fulltime part-time and seasonal workers also importantly temporary workers contract workers\nWhich is where a lot of the scrutiny has been for Amazon specifically\nThey issued a number of few months ago saying that the median wage at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars a year\nWhich is a very uh interesting contrast to the fact that the company this year I'm a topped one trillion dollars and worse and so for the contract workers\nThat Fifteen dollar minimum wage will mean a lot\nI'm also the number of employees that will be affected by this is pretty staggering it's more than two hundred and fifty thousand\nTimes on well I mean I I noted it you just talked about an Amazon has been under a lot of very public scrutiny for how it treats its employees not just the the median wage which you outlined but just the conditions of workers is is this change a result of of that public scrutiny\nWell it's unclear you know if you follow Amazon if you wait kind of long enough there will inevitably be some kind of a story in the news about um a specific it's usually specific warehouse in a specific location where some\nI'm a criticism comes up about the the way that the employees were being monitored or how much money they're making and general Amazon usually comes back to that to say well actually all of our full time workers um in warehouses well do you make Fifteen dollars to begin with if you count in all the benefits and things like that\nUm but the interesting thing is that this has become kind of a rallying cry Senator Bernie Sanders has gone after Amazon for this\nBase does a CEO Jeff Bass was came to speak in Washington a few weeks ago when I went to that and outside of the hotel there was a small group of protesters\nUm they describe themselves as socialist and mainly what they did talk about what specifically that optical kind of contrast of Jeff Bass does not just the wealthiest man or in the world but the wealthiest man and history running a company where the employees were uh I'm not making a huge amount of money\nUm and they had the little signs talking specifically about that\nI'm In the other thing to remember is just how ... how vast Amazon has become a few months recently right I mean the larger business context for this Amazon clearly is doing well in this moment sort of feeling like they can afford this change\nIs I think that's part of it and you know Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gets asked a lot about you know do you think your companies too big\nAnd they did buy a whole foods recently they have a variety of businesses getting into cloud services getting into deliveries I mean we're talking truck fleet of truck drivers fleets of warehouse workers fleets of\nUm you know call service people and it often turns it into a bit of a philosophical conversation about you know large institutions should be scrutinized you know it's not personal large institutions anymore she'd be scrutinized [noise]\nUm but the fact that they now do you have sort of this interesting span of workers and retail on and on the business side kind of does make it an interesting development that that that they're raising minimum wage\nMean lawmakers on Capitol Hill you mentioned Bernie Sanders but others have been pushing for a federal minimum wage uh Fifteen dollars an hour how is this move now by Amazon such an important company how's that going to affect that effort\nBut there is a really big us being in that press release that Amazon issued which is they're saying they are going to quote working again congressional support for an increase in the federal minimum wage\nWhich could be huge if you have one of the most valuable American companies now lobbying for Fifteen dollar a minimum wage federally that could be really huge\nIt's important to note that other companies have been moving toward this a lot of the states have been moving toward the target as one example I can offer of a company that is going for Fifteen dollars by twenty twenty\nAnd also importantly in this moment the timing of this is interesting we're about to go into the holiday season and Amazon says it will pay it seasonal workers Fifteen dollars um this is perfectly time for that that creates a lot of pressure on a lot of the other retailers that are battling in this really tight labor market for the exact same types of\nPeople who might be looking for employment right during\nThe holiday season All right great explainer NPR business reporter Alina Selyukh for us on this announcement that
