David Greene and I'm Steve Inskeep in Nineteen sixty five when President Lyndon Johnson went to Congress to propose the voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about how politics and the government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration well other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is All right here's our first listener question\nDishes claiming heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five how divorce changed since the Supreme Court granted black citizens right to vote and wait for the barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes motivated stationed laws were controversial uh at first people staffing oppose were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd as a century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late Nineteen the early ... centuries a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters\nAgain it was named immigrants and at first by big city political machines\nWhat about the the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens'\nWell of course not men but given the right to vote in the fifties and then let in Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws in the south effectively stripped African Americans and the voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment in Nineteen twenty\nIn the south couldn't vote either just because the registration frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nOr we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is the candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBut I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp\nWho is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about ... himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies the lawsuit charges discrimination same eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy pigment short and I live in a lot of ... when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me\nThen I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office addressed how is that going to

states let's take a moment to check on democracy in Afghanistan that country has been planning parliamentary elections this week up\nMost of the voting will proceed but in a very large populous province the voting has been postponed that after an attack that left to senior officials dead including a top police chief\nPamela constable covers Afghanistan for the Washington Post and she's on the line walking to the program\nI'm Glad to be with you I guess we should figure out what was supposed to happen this weekend what is the original plan what's at stake and what's the campaigning been like\n[noise] um the original plan was to have a very big nationwide election more than two thousand five hundred candidates for two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament\nCandidates of all all flavors and philosophy that with lots of excitement about the election but also lots of current and worry partly because the ... tried to call it on a cat now come true awe and partly\nWidespread a widespread charges on that they're going to be massive fraud fade a lot of positive uh campaigning lot near fresh faces a lot of the ads and but also a great deal\nOf worry a A N and an anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting that in Kandahar Province really large and important province the voting will be delayed for a week but this does raise a question what was possibly going to be in\n[noise] right and we don't know that obviously this is a measure taken on an emergency basis\nUm just to to sort of calm things down and I'm kind of hard for very large province which is tough law it's the least have its intelligence chief and its governor has been gravely wounded um there's acute security vacuum people are very nervous and worried um so I think this is obviously a measure designed for short term relief of that\nI'm obviously decision will be made later on I I Would take and hope that that elections can be held there because it's a favorite populist lots and lots of voters but let's let's see what happens tomorrow um let's see if there's violence elsewhere or not\nUm and to what extent that happens how how bad it is I suspect a generally speaking out they're going to be taking things one day at a time here\nDoes it feel and the rest of the country Pamela constable like a democratic process do you do feel like you're in the middle of a reelection campaign where the people's will be expressed\nI Do it does a it's been it's been a a a nice experience so to speak out compared to\nPrevious elections here um you know record record numbers of candidates out and about a four hundred women are among the candidates with it which is extraordinary a for a very traditional society like this one up on the other hand candidates although they've been busy\nAn active have not been doing a lot of public campaigning they've ... they've been cautious they've had inside events um it had a loudspeaker trucks but you have not seen a massive public rallies a few have been held in the provinces and some of those have been attacked\nI'm so and and as we mentioned earlier hadn't had candidates have been killed\nWell okay Pamela constable of the Washington Post

different\nMy parents are pretty much their lives are in little Saigon my dad works at a pharmacy and so they're like during the Vietnamese community right and for me I go out in the world I experienced racist that I Know what it feels like to be discriminate against I I think my parents haven't because really they their lives or hear\nTheir communities here they go to a Vietnamese math they go to their customers are meeting these are our ... our diverse\nNow I realize my experience as an American very different from my dad\nAnd these generational differences extend into politics older Vietnamese Americans have tended to vote Republican many of them fled communism and they see Republican presidents from Reagan on as being tougher on communist leaders some younger people like ten term trend has been leaning more democratic and that is one reason\nThe party believe they can unseat the Republican incumbent here\nSo when we went to visit the anthem trim we had heard that there were some political differences in her family though I'm not sure she herself new quite how stark they were\n[laughter] hopefully my boy\nShe invited us into her parents' home her kids were playing around with eating snacks and they were orbiting around the grandfather [laughter] how trend is the ... father he primarily speak Vietnamese and his everyday life including when he talks politics with his daughter\nHe's been backing Republicans since he first started voting in Nineteen Ninety two and he told me he was certainly no fan of president bronco bomber who he said just wasn't tough enough on the world stage\nWhom uh been to like him very much and then what now I guess we're today we have Trump what do you think of Trump so far [noise] sofa\nIn this country who do good job what do you like what you're unemployed rate the low uh-huh and um stock markets in a brokered in Greece and so the economy is important to you yeah\nNow that this is this is um I open it [laughter] [laughter] I didn't realize how he he thought of trying to see how they talked about that so is this the first time yeah I had a surprise 'cause then I'll have a conversation\nWell now the other stuff that he does against the media\nAgainst like just civil society we grow up knowing how I'm democratic Vietnam as the ... that the press on basically writes when they don't have the same right there and to see some of that happening now in America you know in some factions that government is scary because that was something that I never really a match as\nWe would be in a situation where we have a president said basically calling to press the enemy of the people like we hear that from communist Vietnam but we don't hear a you know I Would never have imagined that would be reality here today\nCould you say that you're dead and yeah I'm just I just wonder why\nWhen Trump calls the media enemy of the people what your reaction to that\nMan you know I like all the Obama ad after you get\nTo see them time to read this book about what this thing where they don't care about it through a thing you just say yeah CNN again from would fall for both of them\nSo they're not they're biased you know Fox News clearly as by it and I don't know if you're does seem to al ...\nBoxes like it's kind of you know make a phone [laughter]\nYou think you think the media is too negative about Trump's that\nHe's not fair to say that Russia interfered\nIn through the election in this country mhm but when they know that why I said oh I shouldn't before the election [noise] the way until Durham\nNorth elected and they make issue\nSo if if they find out that drum worked with the Russian yeah that would that bother you yeah you don't you don't believe that you\nKnow the groove of that I don't need to believe them\nYou know through that but I don't eat an FBI ... no ... no not at all he believes\nThat the Mueller investigation should continue so that they have we have the facts I agree with that\nYeah just something you agree on yeah there are a lot of families who've been divided over their views of Trump what is your dinner conversations that yeah that go really badly in I mean people get it from the table yeah it I mean this is it doesn't seem to be happening in this\nNo because I don't think our country should be torn apart because of one person\nI clearly have strongly against you know what the president stands for and I also believe it's important to me I think my parents I Know what their experience has been and and we came here say that we can have the freedom to have different views to have these kind of conversation said they don't happen in Vietnam and so the fact that my dad\nHas a different view from me on this particular issue that doesn't bother and gives me how that free and that's why my parents' lead Vietnam to be here in the first place\nEverybody got to go to vote yes you would fall toys and for future with thinking\nShe think everybody should vote

voting rights act he outlined some of the bill's provisions\nFinally this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting\nEven now when it comes to voter registration laws there's a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts\nIn the government work ahead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration well other states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with this patchwork system what is the deal is going to jail All right here's our first listener question\nThis is claiming a heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five how laws changed for Supreme Court granted black citizens the right to vote and wait for the ... barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes but a registration laws were controversial uh at first people staffing the POWs were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd as the century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrants didn't vote by the late Nineteen the early ... centuries a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machines\nWhat about the the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizens'\nWell of course not men but given the right to vote in the fifties amendment in Eighteen Seventy but the Jim Crow laws in the south effectively\nStripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of rights of course white women and black women couldn't vote nationally until the nineties amendment in Nineteen twenty but you know before you're sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because the registrars had frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nOr we have a couple of questions about current controversies\nMy name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is the candidate for governor allowed to purge voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself a secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBut I assume this is in reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and isn't thinking about ... himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those Africans are members of racial minority groups\nThough they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question\nHi my name is Amy paying their chart and I live in a lot of ... when I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me and I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office addressed how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWell they're complaining about it just has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require current residential streets addressed Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and planning I see irony that the nation's original residents are being questioned about their residency\nBoston's largest radio news rum Ninety two point seven ... eighty nine point one WVU wage
