Greene each month NPR and Kaiser Health news took a close look\nAt a medical bill that you've sent us today we're going to hear about an unexpectedly expensive bill for a skin allergy test from ... in San Francisco reporter April Dembosky has the story [noise]\nWhen ... when she goes to the doctor she feels up on gas impacts a sandwich\nWhat I Need to make the three hundred miles fries Winston is an English professor in rural eureka California\nWhen she needs to see a specialist she often drives six hours one way to Sanford healthcare just south of San Francisco\nI had this rash that wouldn't go away [noise] she got that rash last winter after horseback riding and it lasted four months\nIt was it she and like read the like ... and\nShe made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the ... she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to lip bomb Neal for in\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test\nBend a pain hall a phony um\nThey tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement is usually found in beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put ... into a tiny plastic capsule then they drew a grid on one since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left and then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to a lemon substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers that then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know that a four cylinder six hundred solar engine does it have the top of the one flew to stereo system or does it have the more comfortable seats we want to know or paying for it and here we don't have any of that\nWhen students insurer Anthem Blue cross agreed to a negotiated rate of fourteen thousand dollars the company says it tries to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the mass just doesn't add up Rico says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area even if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she did that down to Fifteen hundred ... put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it for a lobby the fitting a five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to her ... her\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise]\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do at a more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I was\nPart of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place\nTo live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital system in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high prices become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition\nFor people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive in healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area\nI mean the expert and the peace says that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area\nWell in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage comes from home instead

F. A. a Rembrandt he's touring through the gardener he says\nLooking at the very pieces that were stolen you'll hear a lot of Connor in this podcast because we actually spoke to him here's a little\nBit of that I knew that the paintings were uninsured and they knew they would do anything they get paid back and so it made sense that they would come up with a substantial reward for a return of those things in that that was my plane with a gun\nSo what he's saying there what he told us is that his plan for the gardener was to get the reward that he assumed the gardener would offer he didn't want to sell the Rembrandt and the ... on the black market he wanted to ransom them back to the museum\nBut despite what he wanted to do Kelly or miles Carter was in jail at the time of the gardener that's\nRight I Know the plot thickens on march Eighteenth Nineteen Ninety when the Gardner Museum was robbed Connor was serving time in federal prison in California on a drug trafficking charges it happens but he says he knows who did Rob the Gardner Museum\nThere were some time accomplices of his ah they he says helped him Rob the worth of state in Maine\nAnd he says that they did it to help get him out of prison and that he knows that because one of the man whose name was David ... and flew to California from Logan Airport in Boston and said we did this thing for you for gun and get you out\nSo Anthony Mari said back at the start of our conversation that miles Carter was the inspiration for the Gardner heist but could he then have actually been involved in planning it with his friends\nYou know my thinking in this whole story is if he could broker the return of a Rembrandt while he's sitting in a jail cell in Boston isn't it possible that he could have also helped organize the theft of a Rembrandt from inside a Jeff how\nWell OK more to come Kelly horror and senior producer and reporter of last seen thanks for joining us You're welcome same to you jak wrote all ego senior reporter for laughing thanks Bob [noise]\nNext week on do you view ours MORNING EDITION the suspect who's finger French were among the first sent to the FBI Headquarters after the Gardner heist\nFirst is this sort of aristocrat who was a famous writer then he's none of those things and then not only the things he's a crook and now as he broke his monster\nYou can download the first seven episodes of last seen on apple pod cast for wherever you get your ... to listen on our website for for information on how to download the podcast visit W.

[laughter]\nThat's what it sounded like a Red Sox celebrated the team's fourth championship in fourteen years last night inside the visitors' clubhouse Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles Sox beat the Dodgers five one last night and won the series four games to one that would be you are sports in society reporter Shira Springer was at\nDodgers stadium for the game and in the clubhouse for the post game celebration she joins us now from Los Angeles she were good morning good morning so tell us a little bit about the while some races the soccer you know kept off this remarkable season with a World Series victory\nYeah you could hear it was pretty crazy in the clubhouse and I think it was a mixture of like pure joy on the part of the players and winning but also a sense of relief and that they got the job done after a hundred and eight when season because there was a lot of pressure on them to win the world series\nUm but it was it was wild I mean you know the goggles the champagne bottles of beer cigar smoke and then just players bouncing all over the place and you know hugging each other and\nUm I generally having a really really good time\nUm they were also blasting music and at one point in an oath to Fenway Park they were playing dirty water and then it segue to\nSweet Caroline so a little bit of Boston in the clubhouse in and it also was interesting 'cause during the game there was a little bit of Boston in Dodger Stadium you had fans actually hear them chanting let's go red socks to a large Red Sox contingent in Dodger Stadium\nUm they were also cheering with every Red Sox home run so it was it was a little bit of or maybe even a lot of of Boston\nI'm In LA last night as the red Sox won\nLet's talk about the reversal of fortunes for pitcher David Price you know he had struggled mightily in October up until this year you got his first postseason when as a starter in the last series against the Astros he got two more wins in this World Series what does that performance mean to him\nWell he spoke about that after the game and he said you know listen his confidence never changed are diminished because of how many times he failed in October and he said he always believed in himself and in his abilities\nBut he admitted that it was really nice to come through on baseball's biggest stage you know both for himself and his teammates and to\nKnow he could win in October and show he could win in October um in game five he pitched seven innings allowing one run on three hits um and he was also happy that the media can't hold his past October failures over his head anymore\nOut all the cars now ... feel so good or to the markets all your all go to ... to I'm told that trunk or the ... for a long time for the record it and we will but you don't have any more ...\nRaises also a good example of how players image can totally change based on how he performs in the post season I think price and his career will now be looked at much differently because of how well he played during the twenty eighth team playoff\nWell another player who's also really looked at very different ways first baseman Steve Pearce he was traded from the blue jays over the summer you came to Boston as a role player and now he is World Series MBP how shocking was what he did this postseason\nVery shocking I don't think even Steve Pearce expected to be in a World Series MVP even you know with all that he did during the series he came up big in game for with a home run and a double and then in game five he had to run home or in the first inning that really set the tone for the red Sox\nAnd then of course he hit another home run in the eighth inning um and he finished the world series with a total of eight RBI so not bad for a guy who's played for a lot of different teams but really didn't stick anywhere um and as you mentioned the thirty five year old was traded from Toronto to the red Sox and late June\nAnd when asked in his post game press conference what it was like to join the red socks of teen he'd a cheered for as a kid here said this\nYou know you you see how much fun to have your point against them all the time and how how good they are to come over and be a part of part of that team or you know the chemistry that they had you know they they welcomed with open arms and and they made it very easily to I'm putting my game of baseball and and I can be ...\nPeers also talked about how manager Alex court was a great leader ah throughout the season and how core and made sure everyone knew their roles and how that produced a truly magical season\nNow fear you've you follow the red Sox throughout the playoffs what impresses you most about this run to the world series or ninth World Series championship in the ministry\nAnd

I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm David Greene each month NPR and Kaiser Health news took a close look\nAt a medical bill that you sent us and today we're going to hear about an unexpectedly expensive bill for a skin allergy test from ... in San Francisco reporter April Dembosky has the story [noise]\nWhen Janet Winston goes to the doctor she fills up on gas impacts the sandwich and two big services laugh and that's what I Need to make the three hundred mile fries Winston is an English professor in rural eureka California\nWhen she needs to see a specialist she often drive six hours one way to Stanford healthcare just south of San Francisco\nI had this rash that wouldn't go away [noise] she got that rash last winter ever horseback riding and it lasted four months it was itchy and like read the like poison oak she made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford\nAnd she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the ... she was prescribed maybe her shampoo\nI started going back over my whole life and all the things that I had reacted to lip bomb near ...\nThe doctor suggested coming back for a comprehensive skin allergy test\nBend pain call a phony um\nThey tested her for a hundred and Nineteen settlement is usually found in beauty products Basset trace in some aerosol they put that into a tiny plastic hassle than they do a grid on when since back in magic marker\nSo that they know what substances going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back that's it Winston left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back\nTurns out Winston was allergic to eleven substances they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later the bill came\nI was in total shock forty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tape some plastic capsules to her back I didn't have any needle stuck in me I had no scalpel stuck in me I had no anesthesia\nIn a statement Stanford said the procedure was highly specialized and required extensive technical resources and knowledge that medical billing expert Michael ... says there's not enough information to understand the charges imagined buying a car for forty eight thousand dollars\nWould want to know if it had a four cylinder six hundred solar engine does it have the top of the wind blew to stereo system or does it have the more comfortable seats we want to know or paying for it and here we don't have any of that\nWhen students insurer Anthem Blue cross agreed to a negotiated rate of fourteen thousand dollars the company says it tries to strike a balance between affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the mass just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area\nEven if you charge the feet hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the mass still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she did that down to Fifteen hundred ... put it on a credit card but you think of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eight thousand is going to pay for those ... cases and that ... you know\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patience maybe it'd be worth it the ... the fitting a five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive though\nHer she for a partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to her co host Noel King\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test [noise]\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergies so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this is a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive\nPlace to live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital system in the bay area there are four they can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead\nBasically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things they can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy test\nOh how could expensive could it be a thousand bucks but here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert in the piece sets that thirty five dollars per skin test is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks

clubhouse Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles socks Dodgers five one last night and won the series four games to one that would be you are sports in society reporter Shira Springer was at\nDodger Stadium for the game and in the clubhouse for the post game celebration she joins us now from Los Angeles she really good morning good morning so tell us a little bit about the wild celebration as the ... you know kept off this remarkable season with a World Series victory\nYet you could hear it was pretty crazy in the clubhouse and I think it was a mixture of like pure joy on the part of the players and winning but also a sense of relief and that they got the job done after a hundred and eight when season because there was a lot of pressure on them to win the world series\nUm but it was it was wild I mean you know the goggles the champagne bottles of beer cigar smoke and then just players bouncing all over the place and you know hugging each other and\nUm I generally having a really really good time\nAnd they were also blasting music and at one point in an oath to Fenway Park they were playing dirty water and then it segue to\nSweet Caroline so a little bit of Boston in the clubhouse and and it also it was interesting 'cause during the game there was a little bit of Boston in Dodger Stadium you had fans actually they hear them chanting let's go Red Sox\nStill at large Red Sox contingent in Dodger Stadium\nUm they were also sharing with every Red Sox home run so it was it was a little bit of or maybe even a lot of of Boston\nI'm In LA last night as the red Sox once\nLet's talk about the reversal of fortunes for pitcher David Price you know he had struggled mightily in October up until this year he got his first postseason when as a starter in the last series against the Astros he got two more wins in this World Series what does that performance mean to him\nWell he spoke about that after the game and he says\nChanged are diminished because of how many times he failed in October and he said the always believed in himself and in his abilities but he admitted that it was really nice to come through on baseball's biggest stage you know both for himself and his teammates and to\nKnow he could win in October and show he could win in October um in game five he pitched seven innings allowing one run on three hits um and he was also happy that the media can't hold his past October failures over his head anymore\nOut all the cars now ... feel so good for there to look into your good fields to I'm told that trunk or you guys have had it for a long time you put the courtroom we will but you don't have to be more ... or if it was really the\nPrice is also a good example of how the players image can totally change based on how he performs in the post season I think price and his career will now be looked at much differently because of how well he play during the twenty eighth team playoff\nWell another player who's also really looked at very differently is first baseman Steve Pearce he was traded from the blue jays over the summer you came to Boston as a role player and now he is World Series MVP how shocking was what he did this postseason\nVery shocking I don't think even Steve Pearce expected to be in a World Series and maybe even you know with all that he did during the series he came up big in game for with a home run and a double and then in game five yet a two run home or in the first inning that really set the tone for the red Sox\nAnd then of course he hit another home run in the eighth inning um any finished the world series with a total of eight RBI so not bad for a guy who's played for a lot of different teams that really didn't stick anywhere\nOn and as you mentioned the thirty five year old was traded from Toronto to the red Sox in late June and when asked in his post game press conference what it was like to join the red Sox the team he cheered for as a kid pure said this\nYou know you see how much fun they have NO PLAN against them all the time and how how good they are to come over and be part of part of that team or you know the chemistry they add you know they they love me with open arms and and they made it very easy for me to a game of baseball and and I can be ...\nPeers also talked about how manager Alex court was a great leader ah throughout the season and how core and made sure everyone knew their roles and how that produced a truly magical season\nNow fear you've you follow the red Sox throughout the playoffs what impresses you most about this run to the world series or ninth World Series championship in the ministry\nWell I think they did one of the hardest things you can do in sport they met the highest of high expectations I mean don't forget the players\nTalk you know we're talking about winning the world series back in spring training they they thought they had a team that could do it and then they finish the regular season with a hundred and eight when the most in the major leagues this season ended a franchise record\nAnd that put a ton of pressure on them you know basically anything less than a World Series title would have been a disappointment\nAnd of course we know now the more than rose to the occasion with the way they played they only lost three games a during the playoff run\nAnd they you know rebounded from tough defeat and another interesting fact they clinched every series on the road so a really special team here and not only that they did it with players who are humble and likable when you're talking to them in the clubhouse they all put the team's first", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "29"}
