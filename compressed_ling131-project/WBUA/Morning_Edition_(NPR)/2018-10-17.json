the systematic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in the recruitment two girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my either and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within his his group of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what are you doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we asked the and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped empowered Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with them but she conceded in an interview but that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't didn't really get it\nAnd then my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that Johnson had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV rain [noise]\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors that was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who have contact with them which according to reports and to our report thing and also to court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nHim or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually we're going to bring a case they were re tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools where the schools that you dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if for organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had and the Chinese leadership that there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse with an institution and any other context\nIn Liberia is still a lousy organization to operate schools there well\nThe story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like the local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm On the local community had the sense of a lot of people had a feeling that somebody had gone wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's\nYeah and some of the folks I talked to tree after ... because a lot of them are newer immigrants from mainland China or casting is very much a make or break way of social mobility\nOr they do believe that the test scores the Asian Americans get should count for more than a shock features weak leadership or I'm I'm a personal rankings\nIs this debate any difference if we move away from an elite university like Harvard to a less elite university or a workplace or housing anything else\nYou know it's an interesting question I think it is\nUnfortunately in a way that the debate around her neck faction has whittled down to this question at Harvard is Harvard is an unusual institution here suggesting um when we look at\nWork play a job hiring contracting a lot of people age American include are very supportive of current action so it's really provide a you'd go air into the issue at all\nNo okay so there's a there's a relatively narrow group of people with a relatively narrow objection at least right now because they're challenging Harvard all of this could affect affirmative action or what is seen as affirmative action across the country I Do want to ask one question about these activists so uh it is easy from the outside to get or give the impression\nThat some Asian groups here are being used because they are teaming up with a conservative activist who was against affirmative action for other reasons for his own\nReasons do the Asian American opponents of affirmative action feel like they're being used\nThe folks that talks it would really bristle at such an accusation um they're very conscious of what they're doing a lot of them were involved in the fight far before um linking up with Edward Blum so you know they have a lot of autonomy they're they're really doing what they wanted to be all along\nTo be able to partner with something like ... for both sides\nVery briefly what is Edward Blum the activists give them that they wouldn't otherwise have\nYou know I think he really has a long term vision he's been working\nA he was part of the goldfish or kidney Richard taxes while their cases are still going on he was already planning his next move so uh I think he's just as a level of strategy that they they didn't quite have themselves\nWash U is a staff writer at the New Yorker

number\nWho did this to one is eight and a woman to be punished for the crimes they committed against using the women and we hope to see them in court in public\nI think it is easy to see winning the Nobel Peace prize as a kind of combination or end of a person's career you've you've done what you said how to do\nIn your case at twenty four years old that is clearly not true you clearly feel like

now good morning Bruce\nGood morning so I understand the ... gave you a preview of the plan yesterday what's the big picture\nWell he did and it is big and bold the mayor told me that it's not just a comprehensive but transformative vision for Boston waterfront the plans are details hold for a specific strategy some block by block building by building to make\nThe city's forty seven mile soil and not just more resilient against climate change but it also is a dramatic redesigned the shoreline that we'd had sixty seven acres of green space here's mayor ...\nWhat we're doing is putting a plan together of creating more open space more accessibility more opportunities for people while we're also creating an opportunity to protect and preserve the city of Boston\nAbout the mayor says he's not waiting for Washington to act that climate science is real and Boston the plan is want to protect us against the worst case threat predicted for twenty seventies forty inch wise in the harbor sea level and more intense and frequent storms\nHow about the sixty seven two acres of green space Bruce is that going to be the land built out into the Boston Harbor or is it sixty seven acres of existing shoreline how's it going to work [noise]\nThat's what the mayor says he's going to add a landfill that creates these new parks and natural various preventing the harbor flooding years long coastline there will also be seawalls and new structures channels water\nAnd some places the idea is that actually elevate the streets in roads the costs were raising for example ... boulevard and slums thus far from the north end the mayor told me that during a nor'easter last year the Boston fire department was considering evacuated in the north and\nThen there's the uh forty point channels area that's especially Britain right now for this park here the children as young as being raised to lease more resilient\nIt's not hard to imagine this is going to cost a lot of money what's the price tag\nBig bucks when I asked the mayor several times and he wouldn't say you can't put a price tag on it right now because it's an evolving plan that will take place over decades this is just the beginning of discussions with history it's neighborhood but she does say that it's going to take city state and federal\nMoney yeah companies are going to have to kick in the idea is to send millions to save them [noise]\nThe investments you make now are the savings of tomorrow and that's I think a lot of businesses will see the importance of this plan rather than have to rebuild the building

costs more than ... flooding and that could prevent four hundred and fifty million dollars in damages and the future\nAnd the mayor says that Boston already has two hundred and thirty million dollars

have a very on the harbor I mean it might sound great but it sounds like it's a futuristic movie that we are trying to build a have a very close it's going to cause all kinds of ecological issues for us as well and I don't know anywhere in the world that has a barrier on the outer harbor that close to say I just don't see the value of that today\nSo Bruce what now what happens to this plan from

city of Fall River is and I will not resign [noise]\nProsecutors say Korea bilked investor in the tech company he formed before he became mayor and use the money to fund a lavish lifestyle including a Mercedes as well as clothing and jewelry\nKorea did not address those charges and he refused to take questions from reporters about what happened with the money invested in his company instead Korea attacked the federal investigators disputing their claim about his social media app and seeing the investigation was to blame for its downfall\nCrazed appliances resonating with some supporters in Fall River shoe Matthias sees the mayor as a reformer who's going up against an old boys' network that's not allowed to get him\nWhen Jason to go for he didn't want to play games and he opened the city to other developments all over the state and so this really antagonize them to the point where they promised that they would bring him down\nThey're not going to succeed but he is innocent [noise]\nProtesters calling for Korea to step down gathered in front of city hall in the afternoon the demonstration proceeded to special city council meeting were counselors debated whether they can remove a mayor who's been indicted on felony charges\nCouncil vice president Pamela liberty ... both said with a Thirteen count indictment over his head Korea cannot effectively the city\nFor not being able to focus on the city Thursday Friday and Monday to friday every day meant all over the phone calls emails and just from all of them are you ... the mayor's office was locked to push the tails I'm fine\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nOn as a consequence you know potentially all of those who have contact with them which according to reports and to report thing and also to court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nHim or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually we're going to bring a case they were to be tested on one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for this says\nYou know where are your schools were the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly feels that even if\nFor organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to the cities\nThe girls of Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had the chance of leadership so there was a sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to the view that says you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points with organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution and any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools\nWell that the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people are involved in the building up as an organization like this you have local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community or the sense of\nA lot of people that feeling that something's gone wrong in this and this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has announced a fool investigation involving seven different ministries they've said that they are looking into reopening the case\nUm um they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit thing these organizations have we hold them accountable they're looking into whether the HIV aids policy was was fold and the school\nThat was

the proposal is part of a ten year master plan for dealing with aging school buildings and they're shrinking school population WVU ours Gary Young joins us now to talk about it good morning Carrie\nGood morning Don so which schools are closing and why\nThere are too high schools in the list for this proposal and that's west trucks very academy and the urban science academy they're both on the west trucks very campus and BP officials say that's really for safety reasons\nIt we've been told they old actually almost didn't reopen these schools for this year but did manage to Nixon emergency repairs\nInsurance superintendent ... told reporters yesterday that that those repairs won't hold up past this school year though so that decision was made to shut the schools down\nThe other school that officials are proposing to shut down is in the ... middle school in Dorchester and that it's leave that to happen after next school year so the summer of twenty twenty\nThat would be for it's a very different reason though and that's actually more directly in line with the goals of this ten year master building plan that you\nStays to a district officials are trying to phase out the use of middle schools in general and uh they say they've seen declining enrollment in the schools about Eighteen hundred kids the last in the last six years\nNow as I understand that ... parents are these schools just found out yesterday was the early response so far\nWell shutting down the school is is never easy on a community of students who go there and a district officials did hold some community meetings last night to tell parents\nSo I haven't heard yet from a family that's that will be directly impacted but I did speak with Kevin Murray he's from a a parent group and the district called quest or quality education for every student\nHe managed to see a leak letter to parents sort of notifying him about this move and you know it was telling them that they would be taking extreme care to make sure that the students will being would be a would be a taken care of during this transition but but Murray says you know really that to him he says\nIt's kind of boilerplate from every statement from the school or when there's been a school closing and in his mind it's never been done correctly\nI did also speak with officials from the Boston teachers' union I spoke with just gets hangs was the president there\nShe act those concerns about how hard closures are on a community if she does welcome the idea of new facilities but she says her membership is really concerned about whether this this plan will actually create better opportunities for students\nWe know many of the teachers feel that more attention needs to be paid to let the kids will gain or lose as a part of the initial plans that we have seen or any plans for the Fort\nGary what about the money moves does this save the Boston school district any money is that a factor\nWill these closures are actually not supposed to save the district money while the two west trucks very schools will be shutting down at that site will actually be prioritize to get a new seven through twelve high school and the McCormack Building is supposed to be re purpose\nAnd the construction plans for built vps phase two were also pretty significant it's supposed to be a one billion dollar investment in the district and it includes about a dozen major projects that would be either brand new buildings or major renovations at least\nInterim superintendent ... district leaders have a lot of goals for this proposal uh one being that they just hope to get on a better pattern of facilities maintenance rather than being on this deferred maintenance sort of cycle and letting it pile up\nBut there's also an equity factor here too here so parole explained it\nBuild vps as an opportunity not just to build new buildings but also look at\n'em expanding equity um access to quality and driving toward smoother transitions and pathways for students\nOr young if there's one thing we know from watching Boston Public schools over the years is had NO PLAN is set in stone this one has been a done deal yet so what comes next\nYou're right the the school committee will be meeting tonight and that is open to the public we are expected to have a revised plan by December though of the school committee is expected
