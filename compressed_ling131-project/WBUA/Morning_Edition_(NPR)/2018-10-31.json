... she wrote trucks invest Wisconsin [noise]\nWB you are I'm Bob Beck once again a U.S Senate debate was about President Trump that's the big takeaway from the final debate between senator\nJeff deal may clash last night over deals support for the president and more interest in replacing him WVU ours Anthony Brooks has our story\nWarning deal wasted no time in last night's debate using their opening statement to launch would've become familiar lines of attack here's deal going after Warren for her possible plan to run for president which he says will make her a part time senator\nElizabeth Warren desperately wants you to believe that her focus is on Massachusetts but the fact that she doesn't care about your house she cares about\nThe White House and here's warrant attacking deal as the guy who's promised to have Donald Trump's back in Washington\nHe's also embrace their tax plan that his Republican colleagues say they're going to pay for by cutting Social Security and Mr Dale says he wants to be with Donald Trump a hundred percent of the time\nDeal co chaired Trump's campaign and Massachusetts but argues that unlike the president he has a record of working with Democrats but at the WCBS debate last night there was no agreement between the Republican challenger and the Democratic incumbent starting with the first question\nDoes President Trump's divisive rhetoric help incite violence including the recent attempted mail bomb attacks and the shooting massacre the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nDeal blamed pockets of deep seated hatred and didn't mention the president but he did criticize war and for some of her heated rhetoric\nFor example a year ago health care was being debated by saying that Republicans want and this is a quote blood money from the American people at a time when Congress in ... had been shot by us Bernie Sanders supporter that's the kind of rhetoric and dialogue that pushes people in the wrong way\nFor her part Moran placed at least part of the blame for the breakdown of the nation civil discourse on President Trump\nUltimately the responsibility for the person who commits violence lies with the person who commits the violence that Donald Trump is not making things better when he does a tax on the free press when he tries to turn people against people Warren and\nDeal clashed on a number of issues including taxes and presented to radically different views of government and how it's working or not working for Warren it's bad news Republican tax cuts benefit billionaires in corporations and the expense of working people\nWe live in America where opportunities for the middle class are shrinking their growing only that that's tough and that's what I fight back in ...\nIn warns view the economic glass as half empty and because of President Trump but the Republicans it's continuing to drain\nBy contrast deal sees the glass half full and filling up thanks to Republican policies including their trillion and a half dollar tax cuts which he says is helping Massachusetts\nThe fact that matters more people in Massachusetts are making money they are having wage increases and that is translated into vacant he'll taking in over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated tax revenue because of all the people out there working companies have been able to reinvest\nThat you also just agreed on immigration and President Trump's proposal in birthright citizenship\nTrump suggested he could end the right of children born to foreign parents in the U.S to become citizens by executive order which deals says he would support immigration in the United states is and the head and I think what I'm looking at the birth rate issue and making sure the chain migration\nUm is not on the table anymore is one way to go about it a number of legal experts say that would run afoul of the constitution appoint Warren use to chai deal saying that\nHe will have Donald Trump's back when Donald Trump tries to race part of the constitution of the United states that just shows how far Jeff deal without a backup Donald Trump\nHas the debate moved toward the end it returned to where it started about whether Elizabeth Warren will run for president that Senator Warren\nWill you serve you a full term if you are elected next Tuesday\nSo I've already said that I Will take a look at running for president after the election but I guarantee that no matter what I Do I Will work for the people of the commonwealth of Massachusetts\nRepresentative deal so yes the answer for me it is but ironically my opponent and President Trump do have something in common either wants to be senator for Massachusetts but both want to be president\nIt was one of the few light hearted moments in the debate but deal remains the underdog in this race with a steep hill to climb\nA new Boston globe Suffolk University poll shows him trailing Warren by more than twenty points with less than a week to go before election day but that same poll shows little support among Massachusetts voters for a possible war in White House run in twenty twenty\nWhen asked if she should run for president in overwhelming majority sixty eight percent said no\nFor nine point nine W.

[noise]\nThis is Donald you be you are I'm Bob ...\nOnce again a U.S Senate debate was about President Trump match the big takeaway from the final debate between Senator Elizabeth Warren and her Republican challenger Jeff deal\nMay clash last night over deals support for the president and more interest in replacing him WVU ours Anthony Brooks has our story\nDeal wasted no time in last night's debate using their opening statements to launch would've become familiar lines of attack\nHere's deal going after war and for her possible plan to run for president which he says will make her a part time Senator Elizabeth Warren desperately wants you to believe that her focus is on Massachusetts but the fact that she doesn't care about your house\nShe cares about the White House and here's Warren attacking deal as the guy who's promised to have Donald Trump's back in Washington he's also embrace the tax plan that his Republican colleagues say they're going to pay for\nBy cutting Social Security\nAnd Mr deal says he wants to be with Donald Trump a hundred percent of the time deal co chaired Trump's campaign in Massachusetts but argues that unlike the president he has a record of working with Democrats\nBut at the WCBS debate last night there was no agreement between the Republican challenger and the Democratic incumbent starting with the first question\nDoes President Trump's divisive rhetoric help incite violence including the recent attempted mail bomb attacks and the shooting massacre at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nDeal blamed pockets of deep seated hatred and didn't mention the president but he did criticize war and for some of her heated rent\nBy saying that Republicans want and this is a quote blood money from the American people at a time when Congress in ... had been shot by us Bernie Sanders supporter that's the kind of rhetoric and dialogue that pushes people in the wrong way\nFor her part Moran placed at least part of the blame for the breakdown of the nation civil discourse on President Trump\nUltimately the responsibility for the person who commits violence lies with the person who commits the violence that Donald Trump is not making things better when he does a tax on the free press when he tries to turn people against people\nWarrant and deal clashed on a number of issues including taxes and presented to radically different views of government and how it's working or not working for war and it's bad news Republican tax cuts benefit billionaires in corporations at the expense of working people\nWe live in America where opportunities for the middle class are shrinking their growing only with us it's talk and that's what I fight back at ...\nIn Warren view the economic glass as half empty and because of President Trump but the Republicans it's continuing to drain by contrast deal sees the glass half full and filling up thanks to Republican policies including their trillion and a half dollar tax cuts which he says is helping Massachusetts\nThe fact that matters more people in Massachusetts are making money they are having wage increases and that is translated into baking he'll taking in over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated tax revenue because of all the people out there working companies have been able to reinvest\nBut you also disagreed on immigration and President Trump's proposal in birthright citizenship\nTrumpet suggested he could end the right of children born to foreign parents in the U.S to become citizens by executive order which deals says he would support immigration and the United states has had a head and I think what are looking at the birth rate issue and making sure the chain migration\nUm is not on the table anymore is one way to go about it a number of legal experts say that would run afoul of the constitution appoint Warren use to chai deal saying that he will have Donald Trump's back when Donald Trump tries to or race\nPart of the constitution of the United states\nThat just shows how far Jeff deal will go to backup Donald Trump because the debate moved toward the end they returned to where it started about whether Elizabeth Warren will run for president that Senator Warren\nWill you serve you a full term if he were elected next Tuesday\nSo I've already said that I Will take a look at running for president after the election but I guarantee that no matter what I Do I work for the people of the commonwealth of Massachusetts\nRepresentative deal so yes the answer for me is yes but ironically my opponent and President Trump do have something in common either wants to be senator for Massachusetts but both want to be president\nIt was one of the few light hearted moments in the debate but deal remains the underdog in this race with a steep hill to climb\nA new Boston globe Suffolk University poll shows him trailing Warren by more than twenty points with less than a week to go before election day but that same poll shows little support among Massachusetts voters for a possible war in White House run in twenty twenty\nWhen asked if she should run for president in overwhelming majority sixty eight
