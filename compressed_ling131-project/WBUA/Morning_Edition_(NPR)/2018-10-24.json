elections are seen by many as a referendum on President Trump that means Trump is the dominant factor in many political rate\nHere in Massachusetts this morning do you where you are senior political reporter Anthony Brooks looked at how the president is casting a long shadow across this stage major political races\nLet's start with the Massachusetts Senate race where President Trump is a central focus\nElizabeth Warren and a Republican challenger state representative Geoff Diehl debated twice this past weekend and both times warns central line of attack against the ... the man who co chaired the Trump campaign and Massachusetts is that he's too closely aligned with the president\nMy opponent Mr Dale has said that if he's elected he will have Donald Trump stack one hundred percent of the time\nFor his part deal attacks Warren for being overly focused on opposing ... at the expense of Massachusetts\nSenator Warren continues to talk about Donald Trump and vice president Pence because this is what she is all about making sure that everybody knows she wants to go to the White House she doesn't care about your house she cares about the White House\nWarren says she'll consider running for president after\nThe November election and she's already done a lot to lay the groundwork which deal is trying to use against her in the primary he was able to mobilize the state's pro Trump Republicans and beat out to more moderate candidates but now he faces the general election how's that going to work\nIt's not [laughter] that's the rub for ... and got him out of the primary\nBut Aaron O'Brian a political scientist at UMass Boston says it won't be enough to beat warn the most recent polls have deal trailing her by more than twenty points in a state that voted two to one against Trump\nGeoff Diehl running as Trump just isn't resonating the people who like it in Massachusetts love it there's just not enough of them project deal to carry the day\nThat maybe so but it doesn't stop president from from forcing his way into the race\nGod 'cause they always want me to apologize for saying that\nThis is Trump's favored line of attack against war and one of his harshest critics it prompted her to take a DNA test to support her claim that she does have Native American ancestry\nThe senator says she did it in the name of transparency but she also hoped it would diffuse the president's attacks but it didn't it just prompted Trump to dismiss the test and continue to mock\nIt'll show everybody ... she is\nShe's just playing a game and he can't play it plays it badly\nEileen McNamara and author and former columnist for the Boston Globe says one more in took that DNA test she walked right into Donald Trump's trap\nDon't get distracted he is that ... a distraction and she fell for it\nSo this election season is all about Donald Trump just ask them here he is campaigning in Mississippi earlier this month\nAnd I'm not on the [noise] when I Am on the because of how a referendum without me [noise]\nIs it fair to say that just about every race across the country as a referendum on Donald Trump right now no question this is Maryanne Marcia Boston based democratic consultant\nAnd every candidate will be measured especially Democrats on your opposition to Donald Trump\nMarsh says a case in point is I honor Presley who ousted Congressman Mike cap you want to win the Democratic primary last month although they agreed on most major issues including their opposition to Trump marsh says Presley pledge to build a movement to oppose the president helped her when\nVoters today saw that approach as a more compelling way to take on Trump so if you're a Democrat and you're running for office this year your opposition to Donald Trump is everything\nIn the race for Massachusetts Governor opposition to Trump may not be everything but Democrat Jay Gonzales is trying to use it to gain some traction against the popular incumbent\nHe's trying to link Charlie Baker to Jeff deal and by extension to Trump is going to vote for Jeff deal in their most recent debate that was an awkward moment for Baker who says he supports the full Republican ticket but seemed paralyzed by the question about the\nI don't know what I'm going to do with respect to that one vote for the guardian endorsed decision\nAfter the debate Baker said he misspoke and that he would vote for the ticket so Gonzales was able to make his point that Baker a pro choice pro gun control Republican who didn't vote for Trump is endorsing the state's top Trump supporter\nHe can't say he is for a woman's right to choose for algae tiki rights and then ask the people in Massachusetts to support Jeff deal where does he stand\nBaker might have stumbled on the question about deal but trying to link him to Trump is a tough case to make according to Aaron O'Brian of UMass Boston O'Brian says that's because Baker maybe among the most prominent anti Trump Republicans in the nation so when Gonzales brings up Trump O'Brian says it doesn't stick\nAnd anything I think Charlie Baker is actually benefiting Charlie Baker is winning has he is the Republican that's not\n[laughter] but that won't stop Gonzalez from playing the Trump Card against Baker and it won't stop Trump from dominating the current political season for Ninety point nine WB you

Brooks looks at how the president is casting a long shadow across this stage major political races\nLet's start with the Massachusetts Senate race where President Trump is a central focus\nElizabeth Warren and a Republican challenger state representative Geoff Diehl debated twice this past weekend and both times Warren central line of attack against the ... the man who co chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts is that he's too closely aligned with the president\nMy opponent Mr Dale has said that if he's elected he will have Donald Trump's back one hundred percent of the time\nFor his part deal attacks Warren for being overly focused on opposing ... at the expense of Massachusetts Senator Warren\nContinues to talk about Donald Trump and vice president Pence because this is what she's all about making sure that everybody knows she wants to go to the White House she doesn't care about your house she cares about the White House\nWarren says she'll consider running for president after the November election and she's already done a lot to lay the groundwork which deal is trying to use against her in the primary he was able to mobilize the state's pro Trump Republicans and beat out to more moderate candidates\nBut now he faces the general election how's that going to work\nIt's not [laughter] that's the rough for ... and got amount of the primary\nBut Aaron O'Brian a political scientist at UMass Boston says it won't be enough to be worn the most recent polls have deal trailing her by more than twenty points in a state that voted two to one against Trump\nGeoff Diehl running as Trump just isn't resonating the people who like it in Massachusetts lump it there's just not enough of them project deal to carry the day\nThat maybe so but it doesn't stop President Trump from forcing his way into the race\nThis they always want me to apologize for saying that\nThis is Trump's favored line of attack against war and one of his harshest critics it prompted her to take a DNA test to support her claim that she does have Native American ancestry\nThe senator says she did it in the name of transparency but she also hoped it would diffuse the president's attacks but it didn't it just prompted Trump to dismiss the test and continue to mock 'cause it'll show everybody ... she is\nShe's just playing a game and he can't play it he plays it badly\nEileen McNamara and author and former columnist for the Boston Globe says one more and took that DNA test she walked right into Donald Trump's trap\nStill get distracted he is a ... a distraction and she fell for it\nSo this election season is all about Donald Trump just ask them here he is campaigning in Mississippi earlier this month\nAnd I'm not on the time when I Am on the ACA because how a referendum about me\nIs it fair to say that just about every race across the country as a referendum on all Trump right now no question this is Maryanne march of Boston based democratic consultant\nAnd every candidate will be measured especially Democrats on your opposition to Donald Trump\nMarsh says a case in point is I on Presley who ousted Congressman Mike cap you want to win the Democratic primary last month although they agreed on most major issues including their opposition to Trump marsh says Presley pledge to build a movement to oppose the president helped her when\nVoters today saw that approach and the more compelling way to take on Trump so if you're a Democrat and you're running for office this year your opposition to Donald Trump is everything\nIn the race for Massachusetts

to do with respect to that one I don't know if we're going to vote for the guardian ...\nAfter the debate Baker said he misspoke and that he would vote for the ticket so Gonzales was able to make his point that bake a pro choice pro gun control Republican who didn't vote for Trump is endorsing the state's top Trump supporter\nHe can't say he is for a woman's right to choose for algae B. T. Q. rights and then asked the people in Massachusetts to support Jeff deal where does he stand\nBaker might have stumbled on the question about deal but trying to link him to Trump is a tough case to make according to Aaron O'Brian of UMass Boston O'Brian says that's because Baker may be among the most prominent anti Trump Republicans in the nation so when Gonzales brings up Trump O'Brian says\nIt doesn't stick and anything I think Charlie Baker is actually benefiting Charlie Baker is winning the has he is the Republican that's not\nTrump [laughter] but that won't stop Gonzalez from playing the
