coming in the morning Bob so let's get right to the point what what advantage due legacy applicants get when they apply\nTo Harvard well we've known for decades that they get an advantage students who had at least one parent graduated from Harvard Radcliffe got what was described by school officials as attempt\nBut we don't know how big an advantage that represented until these filings in this lawsuit okay so what are the court filings show about the size of the advantage\nWill probably seems pretty big based on the six years of data that that they did share with both sides of the lawsuit and an expert witness for students for fair admissions which is the group that suing Harvard found the legacy acceptance rate was almost thirty four percent\nThat would be more than five times higher than the rate for non legacy students that just by point nine percent\nBut we can't necessarily put all that down to deliberate ... preference for the children of alumni or at least that's what Harvard's new president Lawrence back how set in conversation with radio Boston earlier this year\nThey're applications tend to be well put together or they have deep knowledge of the institution so it's a self selected pool which is a group by almost any metric looks very very good relative to the broader applicant\nBut not good to everyone right max he had this practice if you poll is actually really unpopular in the United states and I think you can\nUnderstand that when you think of the pool of students back out just described about Seventy percent of those legacy applicants were white and in Harvard Crimson survey of this year's freshman class nearly half of them reported that they came from families that are in at least five hundred thousand dollars a year so these are students who are already set up to do pretty well on the SAT say\nTwo thousand for analysis they looked at the top ten schools in addition to existing academic merit and found that being a legacy applicant just by itself was worth the equivalent of a hundred and sixty extra points on the SAT\nEvan ... is a writer and academic who graduated from Harvard himself back in Nineteen eighty nine he says that one hundred and sixty point boost is a moral abomination\nWait a second they already have a built in advantage their parents are rich and they go to the schools [noise] no no no don't worry about that but still give them another hundred and sixty point it's insane\nSo get rid of that advantage\nFirst generation students more low income students both groups that are pretty under represented at Harvard and other Ivy League institutions so what is Harvard say ah how does it defend the practice and ... and what about the money are they in it for the do well on the university's had a chance to make a number of arguments for legacy admissions in the past few months\nAnd money does come up a an expert witness for the schools that that abandoning legacy preference\nPreferences could result in substantial cost for Harvard including a possible hit two alumni giving but president back as says it isn't as simple as dollar as dollars and cents\nR. admissions process would be much easier for we were going to do was to auction off places in the freshman class we don't do that to the contrary we seek out students who are talented and gifted and whose families can't afford to attend a place like Harvard\nSo Bob in theory if wealthy multigenerational Harvard families are more generous it would certainly help keep the school tuition free or close to it as it is for families earning less than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year but the plaintiffs aren't buying that they cite multiple studies that show that a legacy preference doesn't necessarily result in increased giving\nArt back to the big picture here how how does legacy preference then fit into the issues at the center of a lawsuit go into court next week alleged discrimination against Asian Americans\nI think it's kind of at the periphery Bob but I think it sheds light on what's at the heart of this issue this lawsuit is about affirmative action on the basis of race yes but\nHow much can colleges actually consider a student's race when they had met them but I think these data show that Harvard at Harvard and other universities discriminate for and against applicants all the time for all kinds of reasons\nSome have called legacy preferences affirmative action for the rich\nAre critics argue that ending it could bring in more economic diversity to the ivy league but Harvard we'll be defending the practice and all of its admissions practices starting next week in federal court\nNext week in federal court which is exactly where reporter max Larkin and reporter Carrie young will be covering

admissions and Harvard\nBut court filings have also shed light on another admissions advantage the so called legacy preference given the children of Harvard alone and critics say that favors affluent white students\nMax Larkin from WVU ours FIT now joins us in the MORNING EDITION studio to explain good morning max and thanks for coming in the morning Bob so let's get right to the point what what advantage due legacy applicants get when they apply to Harvard\nWell Bob we've known for decades that they get an advantage students who had at least one parent graduated from Harvard Radcliffe got what was described by school officials as a camp\nBut we don't know how big an advantage that represented until these filings in this lawsuit okay so what are the court filings show about the size of the advantage\nWill buy it seems pretty big based on the six years of data that they did share with both sides of the lawsuit and an expert witness for students for fair admissions which is the group that suing Harvard found the legacy acceptance rate was almost thirty four percent\nThat would be more than five times higher than the rate for non like these students that just five point nine percent\nBut we can't necessarily put all that down to deliberate ... preference for the children of alumni or at least that's what Harvard's new president Lawrence back has set in conversation with radio Boston earlier this year\nThey're applications tend to be well put together a they have deep knowledge of the institution so it's a self selected pool which is a group by almost any metric looks very very good relative to the broader applicant\nBut not good to everyone right max he had this practice if you poll is actually really unpopular in the United states and I think you can\nUnderstand that when you think of the pool of students back out just described about Seventy percent of those legacy applicants were white and in a Harvard Crimson survey of this year's freshman class nearly half of them reported that they came from families that are in at least five hundred thousand dollars a year so these are students who are already set up to do pretty well on the SAT say\nA two thousand for analysis they looked at the top ten schools in addition to existing academic merit and found that being a legacy applicant just by itself was worth the equivalent of a hundred and sixty extra points on the SAT ... is a writer and academic who graduated from Harvard himself back in Nineteen eighty nine he says that one hundred and sixty point boost is\nImmoral abomination\nWait a second they already have a built in advantage their parents are rich and they go to the schools [noise] no no no don't worry about that but still give them another hundred and sixty points it's insane\nSo get rid of that advantage Bob and you could theoretically admitting more first generation students more low income students both groups that are pretty under represented at Harvard and other Ivy League institutions so what is Harvard say how does it defend the practice and what about the money are they in it for the do\nWell on the university's had a chance to make a number of arguments for legacy admissions in the past few months\nAnd money does come up a an expert witness for the schools that that abandoning legacy preferences could result in substantial costs for Harvard including a possible hit two alumni giving\nBut president back out says it isn't as simple as dollars and cents\nArt admissions process would be much easier for we were going to do is to auction off places and the freshman class we don't do that to the contrary we see kind of students who were talented and gifted and whose families can't afford to attend a place like Harvard\nSo Bob in theory if wealthy multigenerational Harvard families are more generous it would certainly help keep the school tuition free or close to it as it is for families earning less than a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year but the point\nAnd he's that show that a legacy preference doesn't necessarily results and increase giving back to the big picture here how how does legacy\nPreference then fit into the issues at the center of a lawsuit go into court next week alleged discrimination against Asian Americans\nI think it's kind of at the periphery Bob but I think it sheds light on what's at the heart of this issue this lawsuit is about affirmative action on the basis of race yes but\nHow much can colleges actually consider a student's race when they had met them but I think these data show that Harvard at Harvard and other universities discriminate for and against applicants all the time for all kinds of reasons some have called legacy preferences affirmative action for the rich\nAre critics argue that ending it could bring in more economic diversity to the ivy league but Harvard we'll be defending the practice and all of its admissions practices starting next week in federal court\nNext week in federal court which is exactly where reporter max Larkin and reporter Carrie young will be covering the trial for WVU ours ... team for MORNING EDITION and all the programs here on WB you are
