F. L. dot edu [noise]\nThis is not what nine do you be you are ...\n[noise] today we continue our investigation of the Nineteen Ninety Isabella steward Gardner Museum robbery the largest unsolved art high used in history\nAnd the latest episode of the W. B. U. R. Boston Globe podcast last seen we're focusing on a retired FBI agent Bob Whitman and his claims that he was very close to recover English stolen gardener art\nJoining us to talk about this our senior producer and reporter for last seen Kelly horn hello again Kelly hello and hello to senior reporter jak rarely go good morning jak morning to you so jak you first uh last week we looked at the FBI's main theory that at least some of the Gardner art traveled from Boston\nThrough Connecticut to Philadelphia for sale and this week you talked to Bob Whitman who was based in Philadelphia for the FBI tell us about him\nSo Bob Whitman founded the FBI's art crime team\nAnd um she recovered by his account is three hundred million dollars worth of lost art in antiquity throughout his career for the FBI or it really incredible things an original copy of the bill of rights I'm a ring with a lot of George\nMore than thirty five million dollars here's how one of his retired bosses at the FBI a guy named Eric lives describes Whitman\nBob Whitman in a football analogy but as a quarterback he had the experience and expertise and unusual too many programs Bob not only had the art expertise but he also was an undercover agent so it was a rare opportunity for us to take advantage of his skill set\nSo Eric Ives says that Bob Whitman was uh the right guy at the right time there was a lead that came in in two thousand six that there was a gang in France that had the Gardner paintings the the actual information was that they had\nA Rembrandt and they Vermeer stolen in the United states two decades earlier nobody said the word gardeners but there was no other Vermeer missing in the world at that time\nAnd what Whitman did was go to Miami where he met with two French gangsters and proceeded to develop a relationship with these two men who were essentially brokering the deal I'm On behalf of course again gang in France where allegedly the paintings were being held\nKelly why did agent Whitman believe these gangsters or when they claim they have the gardener\nWell he's been to a very long time cultivating relationships with them and that common aided in a one of them drawing on a napkin what he called the triangle of trust saying that we see we men ah a Frenchman named Sonny a Frenchman named the rent and of course Bob Whitman\nWho was and posing as a shady art dealer named Bob Clay we three men form a triangle of trust\nAnything that passes between us doesn't leave us and so he determined after spending a lot of time with these guys that they really did have a strong lead on where these paintings were so uh his gut instinct is John\nOkay Jack ... is undercover but the Boston office of the FBI is also involved\nCorrect so the Boston office to this day controls the gardener investigation it's a crime that happened in Boston and that's the way the FBI works they hold on to their local cases but Whitman was the undercover agent so\nWhile he was the only one interacting with the criminals face to face he was answering to bosses in Boston even though he worked in Philadelphia So\nThere was this hierarchy that he was forced to buy FBI protocol follow 'em and what he says happened\nIs that a supervisor in the Boston office effectively sabotaged his efforts that the closure he got to sunny and ... and the more intelligence came and that they could actually have these paintings\nHe the supervisor in Boston started throwing up roadblocks and eventually tried to insert another agent to replace Whitman on the case which is basically the reason that the whole thing fell apart that was what women said\nAll right so you use the word sabotage and roadblocks is Whitman essentially accusing the Boston office of the FBI misconduct\nShe did not say the word misconduct but it's hard to interpret it as anything but that he is saying that the closer he got to the are the harder the Boston office made it for him to run out the lead to its full extent Kelly what's the FBI say\nTheir silence is still allowed right now and they have not agreed to stick with us for this type cast so we are we really curious about this why would the Boston FBI if it's true why would they want to sabotage the sounded like the best lead that they'd had since the heist\nAnd ah we spoke with a former prosecutor who was attached to the Philadelphia archive team for the FBI his name is Dave hall you'll hear him in the pod cast and what he says is the reason is really all too human it was about ego and are clashing uh desires to be the one who brought these things back\nOkay Kelly who are in senior producer and reporter of lysine thanks Lon thank you same to you jak rarely go senior reporter for lashing thanks about [noise]\nNext week on WVU ours
