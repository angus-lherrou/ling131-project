for being with us\nThank you so much for wanting to talk to you\n[noise] when someone says do you tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it on my mother's a radical model and like most Americans she just had a rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patches\nShe had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university and she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson rally in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life\nI think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now but that readily practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into\n[noise] well um [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't really think so to the outside world your mother or progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications\nUm she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was doing with what I Would call like shards of abuse and you know when I was around nine or ten she started to 'em with me when I didn't do\nRight and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police why people would be even a\nHarsher and those beatings just things started to give her aggressively worst and I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town\nAnd her partner also started to give her aggressively worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back that we just didn't know how to talk about any we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the beatings that she endured all of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that I was gonna say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just traumatic thing but I Will say layers of\nParticular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I think let me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic\nKids so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bullying and a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women's had to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nAn individual you started to start as a way of attempt in the high in ... in a disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I\nThink that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lotta times that starvation and I just kept thinking like if I can just push nobody pushed nobody pushed my body I can disappear and at that point you know I've had lots of running as police\nKicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I can just make my body smaller like I Would be okay with people wouldn't see mia such a threat and I kept it up for like Thirteen Years and my body ...\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how did that\nUm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overused wrote from not sleeping in a row from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I've made from a particular date until another date probably for like six years went to a\nCasino and it was hard to write about harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in the book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim and one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there is a shame when we show people and people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to eat right\nAnd especially if it's if it's a it's kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through my gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the watchful myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home and that's why we're feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse or addiction the gambling most as my family and we still can't really honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nI Love my mother's death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read a teacher and my mother and not love me enough\nTo instill a practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing to say and I don't know if that's true\nBut I Know I'm a writer Norman American reader and I want it to use my words to try to talk to her trying to tell her that we can be better we can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this book\nHere say lemon his book heavy and American memoir thanks so much for being with us thank you so much for having me\nOn\nMy church cello

a number of civil rights groups are showing over tens of thousands of other applications that have been held up but\nJust over three weeks before election day the vast majority of those applications are from African American voters\nGroups are showing Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp who runs voting in that state campus also the Republican nominee for governor reporter Johnny Kauffman of member station WAMC in Atlanta joined us Johnny thanks so much for being with us no problem what are the region or reasons these applications are being held up\nSo these are applications Georgia's system has flagged for airs there's this controversial process here called exact match which compares voter registration applications to other government database and so basically it works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe it's missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens then the application is frozen\nAnd people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this is the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote you can clear up the problem\nBy going to the polling place with your photo ID and then you can still vote I mean that's about that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about not just conventional vote fraud as we've noted in this country but but perhaps foreign powers somehow invading the voters roles and uh we we we've certainly been concerned about that what is the complaint that show rights groups are making\nWell the group's point out that the vast majority of potential voters on the list or people of color meaning that the process is disproportionately affecting people of color and they say that this violates the voting rights act and the constitution and actually last year the civil rights groups challenged a similar policy to this under ... office they made similar complaints\nAnd there was a settlement they ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy under camp he's actually following state law and his office says you know this exact match protocol it's really important to help fight voter fraud\nAnd of course he winds up being the Republican candidate for governor against a Stacey Adams Abrams to Democrats first African American candidate in Georgia nominated for governor by a major party this has become a huge issue in the race has been it\nYeah she is really going after a camp for this um she said everyone who can vote should vote on behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color\nI'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis uh but for both candidates motivating debates is really key in this race because the polls show which really close and there are very few undecided voters so old out who's got to show up Johnny Kauffman of member station WABC thanks so
