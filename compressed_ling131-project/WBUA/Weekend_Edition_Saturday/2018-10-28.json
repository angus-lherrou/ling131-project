feeling frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages sent to critics of President Trump so let's take a breath for a moment and take stock are we getting it\nGetting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us how\nWhat are we listening to and what is it doing to assault\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric thing also about the way the caravan of migrants is being discussed\nOr we'll Schachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and ... is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWe want to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that\nWere in that campaign we saw the rhetoric being used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the elections\nNow we came back from the precipice during the presidential campaign [noise]\nBut now here we're at the precipice again\nAnd it's similar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that man was targeting Republicans and was enraged about the geo peas position on health care\n[noise] definitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords who was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric\n[noise] there is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders uh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacist in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise]\nWhat sets this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena we're seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize and hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute has actually had calls for major U.S corporations we're product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new\nI ... I Want to turn to you now I'm the Kevin of Central Americans many of them seeking asylum ... has been in the news is you know I'm you've actually researched how language informs social discussions and perceptions\nAre in the context of immigration a so you are looking at how the way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect\nOn how we as individuals view an entire group of people [noise] absolutely\nYeah so in in one reason study with Renee floors you the\nPhysiologist at the University of Chicago we found that white Americans overwhelmingly associate undocumented immigrants with criminality and of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite\nBut when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about the many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America\nIt's not hard to guess what is driving this stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is the people who are anti Trump in general also absorb this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we ... we had talked to size we would find something different that you know we have\nWe are living in these um echo chambers where we're consuming very different news and media and we thought that that would be reflected in attention ideas and stereotypes that that a liberal versus conservative held and yet this criminality stereotyped as it seems to have\n[laughter] now as for what's next for the Fox um that would be the goal winning the world series they want to clinch how is the team approaching game five tonight and all that I think the\nBig thing for them is trying to keep their emotions in check and stay level headed and they're also reminding themselves that it's not over until the final out and the guy on the mound trying to finish it for the Sox is going to be data price he was named the game five starter and he's going to be looking for his third win of the twenty eighth team playoff as\nWhat I'm calling his postseason redemption tour continues a and if the ... and if the series goes to a game six course said that sale will be the starter\n... so well if it goes to a game six I guess we can sort of a check the box office for energy\n[noise] yeah I don't have any concerns are in that department with Chris Sale\nCher thank you thank you Jerry Springer is WB words words in society report or this is Monday point nine WB you are\nWeak in the old you be you are Boston Globe ... y or Z infamous Boston or lawyers are Gardner Museum art or was he was\nI knew that they would come up with all the things that was\nRobin we joined with reporters Kelly Horace Mann jak Rodrigo as our series on the Gardner Museum investigation continues tomorrow on WB you ours MORNING EDITION\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Bible European made language learning program Bible teaches practical conversation and Spanish French German and other languages available in the app store or online at B.

communities that's according to a new poll by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health\nNow one county in western Washington is taking a unique approach to tackle the problem and a boy clue why rocket why rock of finding fixes podcast reports how that works\nBack when ... was the police chief of stand would Washington population seven thousand people he thought rural communities like his were immune from the opioid crisis until one day a mother walked through his door\nAnd basically said gee if you have a heroin problem in your community and I I remember thinking well it's not possible to stand would than heroin is in big cities you know was homeless population is not in rural America\nFor decades heroin was a big city problem\nBut no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened in the last five years now ... agrees a few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toward the jails and saw this\nVery very sick very very sick people because you talk sing from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can help people were burned out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriff to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts in the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand with is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural disaster\nThe same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic snow how much county is the first county in the country to treat it this way for the idea grew out of their experience with another tremendous disaster in the county [noise]\nTwenty fourteen the town of Oso, Washington experienced one of the deadliest landslides in American history\nForty three people died Sherri ... is the sheriff's director of communications she took reporters to see the landslide and she ended up learning something to\nIt was amazing to see Black Hawk helicopters flying with our helicopter and a fixed wing over the top of that and all in coordination with each other all the same objective which is like fifty\nCoordination life safety what if they use that system everyone working together across government agencies to tackle the opioid epidemic\nCounty leaders took the idea and ran with it now the response to the opioid epidemic is run out of a national emergency operations center\nA lot like during the Oso landslide every two weeks representative from across local government meet people in charge of everything from fire trucks to the dump\nThe technical name for this group is the multi agency coordination group or Mac group they come straight out of FEMA's emergency response flavor six ten is completed they talk to your PowerPoint slides think silently fires kind of the numbers refer to items\nOn there to do list there are seven big goals like reduced opioid misuse and reduce damage to the community each school is broken down into smaller pieces\nCats and a project to train schoolteachers to recognize trauma in addiction this to do list is over one hundred items long some of these goals a really long term and they're going to take years decades iron is also the spokesperson for this group she says the key is to be realistic\nSo if you set an objective for yourself to just end the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful in in either in any of our lifetimes 'em by breaking it down like eating an elephant you just can eat one piece at a time breaking it down into a piece that you can actually digest\nThey make transportation easier for people in drug treatment they train family members and others in the community an steps to reduce overdoses with medicine and they actually send teams of police officers and social workers\nTo help addicted homeless people\nIn Marysville, Washington rains are serious here forest next to a strip mall\nOfficer Mike you will cracks jokes the civil legal campers\nI grew up in\nThe woods throughout this county or the sight of homeless encampments piles of syringes and trash\nHeels job isn't to arrest the campers help them get drug treatment and housing we're\nWe'll get to and from your point minutes\nThe new approaches paying off\nThe teams have helped hundreds find housing and drug treatment\nThat's just one item and the counties plan\nAnd problems with opioids are far from solved here so snow Holmes county will keep working on their large and small\nGoals one bite at a time for NPR News I'm ...

B. U. R. dot org WVU are Boston's NPR News station\nThis weekend edition with special\nCoverage from NPR News I'm Lulu Garcia Navarro we're watching a press conference is about to start in Pittsburgh this morning eleven people are dead at the tree of life synagogue in that city six people were injured suspected gunman Robert Ballard is in custody the department of justice is investigating it\nAs a hate crime will be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning highly the [noise]\nUh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims\nBut what we know is that a lead and people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told none of them were children um and also that six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well yeah this alleged shooter\nHas been arrested and charged up what do we know about the motive for this crime well it is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media\nAnd he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the death of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened and what else do we know about how the attack happened well authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes\nAs a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns are engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] put this into context for us so there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern\nRate I mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil again eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America\nAt a rate unprecedented in decades\nYeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning\nRight um I went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue to the police tape um\nAs far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials\nI'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a ... a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner and and this was you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and\nUh people are\nGrappling as they as they do and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding\nYou have other mentioned there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened at a house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want to save and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happened so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and and so that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help families I'm Jewish and otherwise uh throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around this country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n[laughter]\n[noise]\nIncredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nAnd it's something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside the Senate God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process\nAnd the president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there have been mass shootings in recent years the gift tax is that the actively carry out that's the sentences but unless the president is calling for that to be more of the conversation and obviously\nPresident Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime right and\nAnd he you know he and the vice president have both said that\nAnd and said that this is he said essentially that this is a you know sick thing to do and so he's he's certainly called it out I'm a ... of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that\nWhen you walk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it what are they saying about um why this might have happened\n[noise] well I think in these situations and and I I've not been on the ground here if it's for too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just to be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and in\nEach case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after that it's a lot of shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motor for crimes that they can prosecute investigate and said that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere is also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we've said\nIndications that suggests that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant uh motives\nThat tells us something about why this might have happened again that's still under investigation but it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happened and also we'd like to know more about about the victims soon\nWe're going to bring in a are Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara good morning It's MORNING\nSo I set the scene for us the president's response and and basically how we are actually starting this press conference now I'm willing to go there live here we don't\nOffer our most heartfelt condolences and prayers\nTo the victims of yesterday's senseless acts of hatred and violence to the families and friends and to Pittsburgh Jewish community and to the larger community of Pittsburgh\nThe Jewish community of Pittsburgh is one that we as Pittsburgh this treasure it's an important part of the cultural and social identity of Pittsburgh and so this was an attack\nUpon our neighbors and upon our friends in one that we felt very deeply the fact that this attack took place during the worship service makes it even more heinous place of worship is a sacred place it's a

morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case he's or say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story would turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning\nMourning all the all right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWill we expect they opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will uh it seems will be taking the lead and the and the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation well are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's a perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources\nMake all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge um CNN has reported citing shores yet a parent Lee was making them\nAny other help are we getting a picture of how she became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty six team you had a very troubled life lots of arrests\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building in nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale\nIn park on the community that had that horrific school shooting this year that's only about Fifteen miles away from the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nIn say aren't begin making all these attacks\nAgainst David Hong one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud he didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nThe financier who's been in the news so much lately in in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail I understand you spoken with coworkers including one who was in that fat\nYet Deborah gr Reagan was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nSat talking much Sandler he loves Hitler Hitler and we should go back to that site with Hitler\nThat's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre we thank you so much thank you losing\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from\nAffect our point of view what's often called identity politics and when we talk about identity in politics wheat and yes that includes NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by Nicole Anna Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me [noise]\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a monolith black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engaged in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true\nYeah and and somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so\nI have tweeted frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that silent whites me very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does not accurately reporting this story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWith the political implications of not being specific when we talk about like people\n[noise] well I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this leading up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election\nWhat we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue and in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack and so by and instead\nFocusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say white but are voting it is when\nTo the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we had legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut white voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not\nActually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously is the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also the sense that news organization and specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things then said when you're trying to\nDiscuss some of these racial um divisions in this country\n[noise] when I was clearly argue we're all biased I think the way that we covered the election showed that by to be very glaring clear\nBecause we were ignoring miserably with voted on the ground were saying right ... voters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and to change our country like they were saying exactly
