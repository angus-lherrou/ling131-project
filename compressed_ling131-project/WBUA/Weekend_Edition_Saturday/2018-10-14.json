Garcia Navarro good morning everyone a massive relief effort is under way in the Florida Panhandle to help communities that were hit hard by hurricane Michael Parker elementary school just outside Panama City National Guard troops handed out water and ready to eat meals to medicines\nWe cannot because we've heard out they were passing out food and they go out we can get I'm Alive\nOnce evident time again and not have a wide at a time it's the most devastated I've ever been but the most blessed I've ever felt all my children survived all my grandchildren survive will say well rebuild will be good\nRobin ad hoc of Springfield and Sally half Callaway, Florida to communities that were particularly hard hit when the eye of hurricane Michael pass through starting with the latest on the relief effort is NPR's Joel Rose in Myanmar Beach Florida the morning theloop\nOr you've been in Panama City and the surrounding towns I mean tell me what you're seeing\n[noise] well it feels like the relief effort really is getting underway now at least in and around Panama City it took a few long days after the storm for the official response to sort of get off the ground\nBut I really saw difference on Saturday there were multiple locations in Panama City and other towns where emergency officials are handing out food and water like we just heard of the top but that said there is a huge need for basic supplies and not just on the coast storm did it a lot of damage in small dirt road towns forty and fifty miles inland\nAnd there are very long lines for supplies all over the region lots of people need help\nYeah and the pictures of devastation are are incredible how much does it still without electricity right any any sense when it's coming back\nYeah there are still tens of thousands of people without power the local utility Gulf Power estimates and it's going to restore electricity to most of the region by the end of the week\nBut that estimate that not include some of the hardest hit areas right around Panama City which might be without power for weeks I Would say maybe months ... just driving around in Panama City I mean it's unbelievable the number of electrical poles that are down you see power lines in the street everywhere you can't really drive without driving over them\nAnd at the same time there's no water nominee gas stations are open the ones that do have gas have really long lines so I think things are gonna be pretty rough year for the foreseeable future\nSays Joel what are people telling you they're going to do what they're going to stick it out or they're going to leave\nI think a lot of people may not have any choice I mean both in and around Panama City and out in the countryside it's one of the poorest regions of Florida are places where people a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck\nAnd just you know right now a lot of the people I've talked to are are focused on just getting through today and tomorrow you know trying to get water and ice trying to get a tarp to cover up the hole in the roof maybe before it rains um although luckily there is no rain in the immediate forecasts but you know that's where people's minds are\nYeah we've heard there were really big problems also with communications or is that getting any better\nI not that I've seen most cell carriers are still down around Panama City I mean many even emergency officials don't have phones that work um so you know it's a big problem people can't call their relatives to say they're okay um and and it's I think has to be one of the things that's really slowing down the rescue and relief effort\nNPR News Culver City California\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station\nAnd from the library of Congress with the national library service for the blind and physically handicapped a program that offers thousands of books for all ages in audio in braille formats more at one eight hundred three hundred six thousand and from T.

governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the GOP is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe just enough Hi Lulu so can Democrats\nCut into the ... edge among governors they haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty Twenty one there will be\nA census that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it's a good sign for Democrats this math is really for them what states are you watching heading into this last month that the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida and Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win in these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big\nQuestion and then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then it didn't seem real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by five super education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level and Republican polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary\nHealth care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four much\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbents and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you\nAbolish ice has been a rallying cry for some on the left the whole gained traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but who don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet progressive activists have won a number of victories convincing local governments to stop detaining immigrants and their jails the federal immigration and Customs Enforcement agency Matt Katz from member station WNYC reports\nIn Hudson County New Jersey a routine contract renewal turned into a political firestorm\nWhen we want to\nMe she was a deal the county has with immigration and Customs Enforcement agency pays the couch eats a house immigrants picked up by federal authorities more than half of the inmates at the Hudson County jail or ice detainees\nActivists urge local legislators to pull out of the contract last week one of them call Schwartz other counties shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nOn you'd night you can you do have power and it made up your lawn and maybe for one county in one state over one didn't matter what if we can get down here in our county we can do what we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five tens hours Hudson\nBut not until twenty twenty that way to counter you would have time to replace the tens of millions of dollars it gets from ice you all democratic ... as the county legislators in New Jersey or known assured residents that action would be taken years Anthony remodel\nAs a strong possibility we will be saying that is\nSo it's not just rhetoric across the country local officials are responding to anti eyes activism in California Contra Costa county Sacramento County and the city of ... of pulled out of their contracts with ice\nIn Williamson County Texas a detention center will no longer hold immigrants as an Atlanta the mayor issued an executive order stop accepting ice detainees\nWith all this is not happening without pushback\nYour job to represent the taxpayers of town not that's [noise]\nNot balls or a lifelong resident of Hudson County accused officials of putting immigrants ahead of us citizens she says the ice money helps to keep her taxes low some immigrant advocates also opposed ending the contract they warned of unintended consequences run ... represents immigrants the gel pro bono\nFamilies and lawyers and their community are here\nAnd the separation from those resources is critical to enabling detainees actually win their cases remain permanently in the United states for have released on bond\nVersus the detainees should be allowed to stay in New Jersey near their families and lawyers alike and other parts of the country immigrants jailed in Hudson County or a eligible for free legal representation\nThe free holders did agree to try to improve conditions for immigrants before the end of the contract the gel has been plagued by problems suicides poor medical care that food several former detainees testified at the hearing last week visited those\nFor ... twenty five year old from Cuba said he was raped twice by other detainees the gel director who was also at the meeting said he would investigate those said that's\nNot enough he urged the legislators to end the

Navarro\nUtility crews are working to restore power to customers from the Florida Panhandle to Virginia in the aftermath of hurricane Michael officials are warning it could take weeks in some areas\nAs we see more and more powerful storms hitting us it has many thinking about how to make the nation's power grid more resilient NPR's Jeff Brady reports\nIn Panama City Florida right now this is a common than\nWe were lucky to have them or using gas powered generator utility crews to fix all the downfall and wires and restored their electricity fake county emergency services chief mark Bowe\nAnd says that will be a long slog\nThis electrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground now\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive has got Aaron Senate the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the pole and to restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the element\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground in is not a silver bullet\nHit the expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most said they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility\nUp to twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a lot and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce in a line of ... and it can actually be much more cost me auntie Caroline and I ... and ... and an overhead wire\n... as in flood prone areas that can make more sense to elevate grid infrastructure she says already there's a lot of work and planning being done around the country to make grids more resilient\nOne thing McNamara would like to see more of his independent micro grids with solar power and battery that places like water treatment plant hospitals and facilities where residents can't easily evacuate\nAnd we all need to be the sting joins meaning of ensuring that critical infrastructure vulnerable population you keep the lights on even if the broader pounding down\nMcNamara was lead author of twenty Fifteen report that called for more renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases from power plants and address climate change that's a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost also fuel industries\nJeff Brady NPR News\nMichael hit the panhandle just as the voter registration deadline for next month's election closed in Florida we know Florida as a big presidential prize it's also hosted a bunch of closely watched political races this mid term season mark a poodle covers Florida politics for political and he joins us now on the line\nThanks for being with us thanks for having me so first off you grow up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or not just over a year ago you've seen a lot of storms come through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of Cleveland, Mississippi\nLooked a lot like Mexico beach looks now there were just homes wiped clean from their slabs and then all\nOf the associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once lush area into a desert just stripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human\nHabitation construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson and a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat Andrew Gillum is running for governor against Ron dissent is a former congressman\nWho also has a lot of support and pockets of Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott Hurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the stage he saw his net favorability rating rise by ... percentage points and then it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally\nRisk out was running ads touting his leadership during hurricanes so he has been kind of all over ah both physically and these different pockets of the state in different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like\nA scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott as governor Jeb Bush\nAnd Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four there is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it would appear so far\nThat Governor Scott has to a lesser degree\nAndrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is the executive albeit of the city of Tallahassee mayor\nBut it was hit pretty hard\nIt was hit yeah a Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in\nThe uh the the county Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power loss and coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum by his opponent round the Centers for his leadership during a\nStorm hurricane her me this time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly in in one case actually changed on trees away [laughter] and moving debris\nHe's making sure Gillum is that he is not perceived to someone who is just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone's trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess that remains to be seen ah what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire panhandle meal is impossible pull right now because you can't get a hold of a half you know eating or scent of the people\nThat political as my computer joining us from Florida this morning thanks so much thank you\nTomorrow on MORNING edition after big win on the Supreme Court

governors\nOver the last decade Republicans have made historic gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the GOP is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break them down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they can pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and this is incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty Twenty one there will be\nA sense is that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of got into really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to drop congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats and so it it's a good sign for Democrats this math is really for them what states are you watching\nHeading into this last month that the campaign I mean where they're really tight races so there's a couple of pickup opportunities\nFor Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan I say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always\nYou know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and these sort of purple states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santa is going to be I think a really close race still next door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams would be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that's a state there is changing has it changed enough that's a really big\nQuestion and then they sort of a handful surprising opportunities for Democrats in the mid west and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but then Democrats I'm real chances to flip some places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that it's sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states had been rocked by Pfizer for education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level and Republican or some polarizing nominees friends is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally you only narrowly won his primary\nHealth care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tariffs is playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising a notable for Republicans is how many of their incumbents and really blue states are in really strong positions\nMaryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott are all favorites to win reelection they could flip the seed in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New England Republican That's NPR's Jessica Taylor thank you so much thank you [noise]\nWhole gained traction due to President Trump's hard line immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key

one of them called Schwartz other counties shouldn't profit from President Trump's immigration crackdown\nOn your night you can you do have power and it may not be alive and maybe for one county in one state over one did anything better but if we can get that down here in a county we can do what we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five ten sours Hudson County voted to end the ice
