and from a procedural vote yesterday Senate Republicans have secured the votes they need to confirm it that is expected just a mentor conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good morning Scott now we could both named conservative justices Souter Stevens Blackmon Kennedy who issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court but uh this confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh could have impact generations good\nOh yes we assumed the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents to named to Bush and out to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who has been which has been growing for some of the court for years and a swelling presence on the federal bench with its lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own\nWhat do we need to know about\nThe federalist society has ... they're going to be um more prominent than ever in us life\nOr the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students and Google's legal scholars\nAre people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two judges generations\nAsking the question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let let's underscored there's nothing remotely secret about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population um\nIs Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination of of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized get up to the polls about a month from now or do many feel mission accomplished\nThere could be both a feeling of accomplishment ended up feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the confirmation process and some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut terms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction in right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party and that could also be a big factor in the midterms\nOn trial Snyder NPR News from Washington\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the

weekend edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon Brett Kavanaugh seems to be on a clear path to be confirmed for the Supreme Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Meghan ... column for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views which we will ... enjoy just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations\nOf sexual assault by Christian Bussey forward now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] I'm was that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes I don't\nThink so I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes or perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it then look for possible\nThat they should confirmed me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're saying that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the city did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and they had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically choose the crowd I wasn't aware of that because she was in well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she told and sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen to shoot\nPeople basically issues of cooperation were her therapists notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name in two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats is really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot\n... let me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she said she found Christian Bussey Ford a sincere\nA book that she couldn't let her church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNo the world hurt from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time it is an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated\nTo consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible [noise]\nUm and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right Democrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews\nRepublicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all that's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved\nFrom people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nIn a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story\nAnd it it's way worse than what ... making the colonel thanks so much think you can [noise] to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents the president called the article quote a hit piece\nWith us now to talk about some of the allegations Jumo Brian he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nThat easily their head or of this one I don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump\nUsed a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious and possibly fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth for about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump\nTasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inheritance gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald represent over the years I've built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that\nThe times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty bare and that story so that's another important theme of the story which is\nThe president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] ... is there anything that you that you can recognize that maybe people are going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump in his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the buildings so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company it was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used\nTo inflate how much they were spending an equipment and supplies for their armada of buildings so they could then pocket the differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it\nAll of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps any he earned his living on his own\nRather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which is essentially the story he's been putting out there for a long time\nWere funded by you our listeners and by the biggest so guest conductor

C. and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had\nProbably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of\nSexual assault and ask them how they plan to vote and he said away he he was very engaged in the conversation you had to step out of the ... ... ... ...\nYou you feel like you were hurt and received ...\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely gauge he has got a question um I Do believe that John mentioned cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision\nDoes your votes continue if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers do\nOur does continue so uh as far as the Senate go eat it he kind of knew that he had he kind of had it because the other options Patrick Morrisey has done terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of the opioid crisis\nAnd so he kinda nearly a dozen believe an opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and that he's just a bad guy and I think he knows the\n... camp this was all your opinion what me underscore\nA quarter of this is my opinion yes of course um so yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well well it does continue or yeah\nSo we're working on um we're working at a state wide to take things we've got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if you if you're Jones is if you have accepted senator mansions votes for what it is and I'm Still support among a great many issues and I got a job you're there's this very civilized and democratic to me\nAnd I'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly as support has because I think the I think Morsi's worst choice mansion does still support us on the AC a and tax reform so badly we still have to go with him and hopefully get somebody else at twenty twenty four\nTaylor Wilson of West Virginia thanks so much think yeah the\nProtests on Capitol Hill coming years since the advent of the me too movement started with Harvey Weinstein and the many actresses models employers and others who said that he had sexually harassed or assaulted the allegations first reported by the New York times and the New Yorker\nWomen in Hollywood were quick to take up the cause huge Oprah Winfrey at this year's Golden Globes\nMe embarrassed\nLoose with Blair takes a look at the impact of me to a year later\nAt Dunbar high school in Washington DC psychology teachers terrorists swallow once your students to consider some of the questions raised by the me too movement like consent should we be looking for the verbal ... Seventeen year old Marcus bright shares what he's learned\nOf when you will learn you may you may or may be\nThat that is a good rules a live by each made him better\nAlright swallow says me to have been an opportunity to talk about serious and relevant issues like consent and sexual harassment\nBut it's important to teach our students when they're younger so that they don't grow up in a culture where they think it's okay to like give these girls and boys the voice to say like this is not okay I'm not going to tolerate a\nWomen aren't tolerating it either and the results are measurable this year sexual harassment reports to the EEOC or equal Employment Opportunity commission have gone up to twelve percent that's after years of remaining steady\nThe EOC is the government agency that handles workplace discrimination cases including sexual harassment\nThe vast majority of those claims do not go to litigation but even the number that do doubled this year the EEO sees acting chair Victoria ... says the interest generated by me to has been enormous\nWe've had a five fold increase of hits to our website of people looking for information about sexual harassment we've done hundreds of training sessions for employers\nHere's something else that has changed as a result of me too there's a real money available for women to get help so Sharon to Johnny\nI've been a civil rights lawyer and women's rights lawyer for the last Twenty years and he told me at any point in those Twenty years that there would be money available to help people come forward to help people with their cases I Would have told you that just never going to happen\nTo Johnny is the director of the time's up legal Defense Fund it covers legal fees for alleged victims of sexual harassment with big donors like Shonda Rhimes and Meryl Streep the fund reached Twenty one million dollars in just two months at the same time\nMuch lawyers can do of the thousands of sexual harassment reports that come in only a fraction get funded for legal help\nSome people are coming to us you know two years after this has happened to them for five years after this has happened to ten years after this has happened to them\nBecause they never felt comfortable coming forward before and the way the law is you have to report or bring a case within a certain amount of times if some of those women are out of time\nSome of those women who are coming forward are independent contractors and unless you live in certain states you're not covered by discrimination law and so it's a matter of people coming forward and we connect into ... and the lawyers helped them when they can but sometimes there isn't something that can be done you got a plow\nThe ground and plant the seeds before you can read to harvest\nJoe Freeman has written books on women's liberation and other social movements to put me to an contacts she says look at the fight against racism\nA hundred years ago the culture condoned white supremacy we've been fighting that one for a hundred years and I think we've made a lot of progress but they've done yet\nFreeman says social movements need both the high profile surges like speeches and marches but they also need the behind the scenes work like the time's up a legal Defense Fund\nThat underneath the rate or behind the scenes organizing is extremely important what you see are the search for what's catching our attention now is the vest turnout of people like Kevin up\nHere today not because I Want to be terrified\nChristine Blasey Ford's allegations that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were in high school is one of those surge moments\nSays Freeman hundreds of people protested Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court this week they marched along the national mall\nOne of the protesters Lyndon Miranda brown came down to New Jersey she says her feelings have been all over the place the past few weeks [noise]\nAppalled and also [noise]\nI Would have a round leave without the support of the me too movement forward might not have come forward at all\nReally think that was our hotel over the head of taking\nI Would imagine that the effect on a potential reelection run by Collins would hinge somewhat on what Brett Kavanaugh might do on the Supreme Court\nI think that's exactly right sure and I think you know if there's a controversial decision that sort of confirms what had been um a lot of people's worst fears those votes that he takes those decisions that he makes will forever be attached to Susan Collins supportive him\nWill Steve thank you very much Vicki Sharon\nThat's Maine Public Radio's chief political correspondent Steve ...\n\nFor the first time since two thousand for it's a postseason match up between the red Sox and the Yankees last night at Fenway Park in game one of the best the five American League division series\nThe final few innings created some tension for Boston fans but the Sox hung on for a five to four victory WVU are sports in society report is Shira Springer with at the ballpark and she joins us now good morning Sheera good morning sharing okay when isn't when yes first and foremost let's\nLet's take a look here in the regular season the red Sox had the best record in baseball franchise record one hundred and eight wins but then heading into the playoffs some big concerns had emerged about the AIDS Chris Sale and about the bullpen so first let's consider sale\nLast night starter okay you got to admit it Sharon you were a little bit nervous about yeah ... yes yes yeah I mean you know he'd been injured they didn't have there been some issues yes\nOh yes some issues those issues were some shoulder inflammation some students on the disabled list because of that in recent starts his velocity had dropped and there was also some issues with his mechanics that they were trying to straighten out so this was all sort of the backstory heading into game one would Chris Sale\nBeing the age that the red Sox needed and they needed their age to go kind of deep into the game because there were those bullpen concerns huge sigh of relief for the first few pages as\nMarin sales velocity was up where it needed to be in the mid nineties he topped out at Ninety seven\nAnd he looked like the dominant picture the red Sox needed to that was huge I Will say though ... never doubted his ability to be on the mound and give the red Sox exactly what they needed in game one and here's what he said after the game\nIf you didn't see the ball out of my hand out you're thrown there's no holding back the woman's do hundreds of dollars of investment voter morals morals are like this month so for every person in the house up and down the line up and up and down the pitch and stuff where you are forward prepared for whatever's thrown our way more than ...\nAnd just the you know the final line for Chris was that he ended up pitching five and a third innings actually held the Yankees scoreless before being charged with two runs when a parent inherited runners scored in the sex he had eight strike out\nGoing forward when Chris cell walked off that mound last night the Fox were up five ten nothing but you know keeping that kind of lead share that would have been too easy so how 'bout that both ... who boy [laughter]\nI feel is is going to be a white knuckle playoffs\nFor Red Sox nation as soon as the red Sox relievers came in the Yankees were able to chip away at the red Sox and you could sense the tension people were getting nervous wondering if uh five run lead was enough\nAs it turned out even though the relievers got in trouble in the sixth and then again in the seventh and there were bases loaded they got out of it they had to bring him at one point\nHe scheduled game three starter report cello yeah we noticed eighth\nWhen Rick poor cello came in and the eighth it was very clear to everyone in the ballpark that manager Alex Cora\nWas going to put it all on the line that he felt the red Sox had to win game one that it was a tone setter and he was going to do everything it took to get that when because when you're in a short series five game series winning game one is crucial you lose game one you effectively lose home field advantage\nTo that included bringing Rick for sellout in in the eighth and then Crick kimbrell for a four out safe which he hasn't always been an excellent that that is true but he was last night he did get it done so and like it when you again shy of relief in Fenway Park when he got it done\nIt is definitely fair to say people had a little roller coaster ride of being jubilant and also cringing\nI'm being a Red Sox I mean isn't that isn't that part of our so does that is another day at the office for a Red Sox fan absolutely so tell us a little more about the atmosphere at Fenway last night\nJust ups and downs ups and downs corresponding with a play on the field but I think what was good just for the Senate he of Red Sox nation was the fact that in the first inning JD Martinez had a three run Homer and it was sort of like\nOkay this could be OKC thank God for GDP Martinez and you know he actually admitted after the game that heating a home or in the playoffs for the red Sox against the Yankees had a much different feel\nYou know or the day before the season doesn't matter anymore says the play offs from here on out everything starts to zero so you know what's\nAt stake and there was a fun moment in the post game press conference when Chris Sale and JD Martinez were there together and Christian Bale looking over a JD Martinez says you know three run Homer and the first inning I'll take that in game\nTwo and they're you know they kind of looking back at him like okay you think this is so easy to order that one yeah what what do you think lessons when\nTells us about what we can expect next alright fans have got to buckle in and prepare for a bumpy ride because it's gonna be like this I think the entirety of the playoffs they're going to be some real high high you know using some great heating and then you're going to have to sweat through the later innings with the bullpen\nYou know in some uncertainty to tonight with David Price taking them out and so it could be a little bit of this same anxious nervousness how is David Price going to perform will he get his first postseason play off when\nYou know can he can he take the pressure of the playoffs against the Yankees and and all that comes with it and we'll David Price have a large enough lead\nWhen the bullpen takes over share thank you thank you WB you are sports in society reporters Shira Springer this\nIs Ninety point nine WB you are later today on this American Life or producers
