G with us this morning as NPR's Deborah Amos has covered Saudi Arabia for years Debra thanks so much for being with us the money you have seen the shouting statement what does it tell you about how the kingdom mishandling crush\nWhat we see is that for the first time officially the Saudis say that ... is that the account places blame an senior advisors none of them royals ... for a policy that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there's a standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the account lays the blame on the senior security officials who went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist they covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership failed to confirm his death earlier bad news travels slowly to the top\nIs how one Saturday defender put it on Twitter these latest accounts distance the top leadership and especially the powerful crown prince\nBut there are so many questions left to be answered\nOne of the biggest right in front of his whereas Mr ... body\nIndeed so this how do you account says that his body was handed over to a local Turks for disposal\nTurkish authorities have been continuing this investigation and now it's in a forest near the you know the consulate so the official account doesn't explain why uh\nFifteen man team was sent to stumble or why a sixty year old Jim ... would start a brawl with this large group most of them were half of his age you know those are the names in the ages of the squad has been documented by the New York times and the Washington Post\nAnd the Turks leak those names in the run up to the official account which was made public on Saudi TV early this morning there's been this on line army of Saudi social media box\nA it's a smear campaign against a show gee I'm there's another hash tag that says we all trust Mohammed bin sell them on that began trending on Twitter tutors hugely popular in the kingdom and you have to read it to see what's going on internally\nAccording to their question that has to be raised how could an operation on the scale take place without explicit knowledge from the top including the crown prince himself or and or can

edition from NPR News I'm Scott Simon the Trump Administration has had a muted response so far to the death in your mouth to show gee we turn now to even adult or he was US ambassador to NATO under President Obama and now head of the Chicago Council\nOn global affairs his new book co authored with James Lindsey as the empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership Mr ... thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience to Saudi explanation of how Mr Grisham you died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a bump tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nAn explanation by the president uh how much of this damage with imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because\nIt seems to me like both Washington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow the U.S response to let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nMullet the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well to to the to the Saudis to suspend\nArms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a better sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there was a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to ... the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is that is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries on to a point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it is not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a ... it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments of that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us rich twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that\nMake clear that the kind of behavior we've seen coffee weeks is unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nSo during the for profit is it new you probably remember hatred mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War\nBut American mercenaries working for foreign powers that something that they were ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news and joined just in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you\nWhich is what you're talking about in your investigation and such a demand\nFor the last Seventeen years\nSeals special forces\nAnd other parts of the U.S government have excelled at this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects shows the changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and uh we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them as the N. word definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden in twenty Fifteen\nLee's special forces a an unsealed veterans Navy SEAL veterans'\nDay deployed on a mission to kill\nThe leader of the eight and branch of al Islam and all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen to his longest party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader the LA\nI'm Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should just in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservists he he was at that level of of command of one of the the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically you had a ... a top secret clearance sources told us even when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know\n[laughter] I guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that\nThere are laws that do govern whether the U.S whether us individuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nAre you seeing how Americans have served in the French ah well I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces and these are not ...\nA lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world\n... short right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you're enjoying a foreign military just for the money now and by the way this doesn't apply to people who joined ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is going to ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um it was just an anecdote or a trend\nRight is this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend ... are are there the only ones who've done this or the other countries will try it [noise] um are there other Americans\nAs in the ones in rather Americans you'll leave you've uncovered yeah right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm going to keep on looking at it and I've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working\nAs Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work\nWell there's several reasons what is a there's a lot of money involved but they also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he's doing U.S policy the ... the U.S has not spoken out against the war in Yemen we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we saw them guns we train them we can do

the past few years the opioid crisis as the the face of addiction can be just about any fish and the rich or is it appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days\nChurch many readers this week is included a photo of this Marlene fish of metal to Lynch in there\nWith her toddler son Hayden\nWas grinning from his perch on her back that photo shoot a good day from it but she suffered from addiction and she was sixteen years old and production ... a drug for cold of her life\nShe was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal and limbs to mere died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age\nWho sister Kato Neal Rosetta which wary and joins us now from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with\nThanks for having me first we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to sing a she wanted to be an actress and starring Broadway musicals and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in lived and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from a disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates um until farm and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get him help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um disappeared again\nDrove more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise] what made you sure all of this in Europe which were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult\nHer addiction didn't define her but it did define the way she lived and certain not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry the hope for them and our hope also now lies with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these Jeff stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so\nLet's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or buprenorphine there's evidence that they work but they're very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate based pain killer\nBut to prescribe some of the medications that help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver there aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing\nI also think that stigma and shame are huge barrier\nTo recovery for people and that's part of the reason that we wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond\nBecause we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that not even one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with your son and her ... in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service for ... ... yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWhile through song of course there'll be performances and we actually have a\nA video of Matty singing Vonnie rate songs is just sitting at the kitchen table will play share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about this obituaries that people have shared stories about Matty that we didn't know and they've also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now\nAnd I think we'll have more is that kind of sharing on Sunday\nWhat Bonnie rich on there [noise] I Can't make you left me\nDoug indeed fun now a\nCaterer O'Neill wrote about her

different places for the past couple of weeks for the death of ... of the president calls it credible lumps in Congress don't\nThe Saudis say he was killed in a fist fight with Fifteen men\nAny child in any school yard in the world could see through that story Scott but it wasn't concocted to be believed any more than the earlier versions of this story the Saudis have now banned\nIt's intended simply to be told and accepted as a pretext for continuing business as usual and that's less about oil these days and it's about billions of dollars in arms sales President Trump made that clear this week while\nHe was seated with executives from a number of us arms makers who are selling those weapons to Saudi Arabia the president has made it clear this journalist was not a U.S citizen and that this is not the president's focus right now what is focused\nThe president made that clear this week by spelling out is gender like a shopping list he said this election this fall is about cabinet the caravan law and order and common sense\nAnd the president and other Republicans have been treating Brett Kavanaugh as a martyr even though he was in fact confirmed and is in fact on the Supreme Court now\nThe caravan is that group of several thousand refugees from Central America who have been stopped at the border of Guatemala and Mexico far from the United states but they wanted to be coming to the United states so the president is using them to symbolize the immigration he wants to stop\nAs for law and order that's the phrase is oldest states' rights and of course we all want the rule of law applied equally to all but the phrase has also been used\nAs code for resistance to social change and common sense is another familiar phrase a recently used as a political casual by the Tea Party\nAs you mentioned round the caravans been a feature of the the rallies that President Trump has been addressing but he's also threatened to withhold some foreign aid over it has me\nYes the stopping the caravan and the threat of withheld assistance is substituting right now for the border wall which the president has made the symbol of his immigration policy and much more and which so far he has not been able to\nBuild all be noted uh it does seem those of the polls have tightened in recent days I haven't they\nYes some of the polls have tightened down for a variety of reasons among them that this is October and that's what the polls usually do in the month before an election especially if we've seen one party or the other getting well ahead in the early fall in October that lead shrinks sometimes that means a close election\nSometimes it doesn't but the more lightly attached boaters in either party tend to come home in October and that's been especially true of

Democrats who protested Kammen Kavanaugh in unhinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about the that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border and lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nAnd democratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on and come on and\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies him in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of a ...\nAnd various John ... thanks very much for being with us thank yous got well President Trump says he wants more information before deciding how to respond to the Saudi explanation of ... death\nSome members of the U.S Congress has called for sanctions on Saudi Arabia the Trump Administration has appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space\nThis week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on his face at least a friendly visit three on for talks with both the king and crown prince compared to other reporters on his return to the U. S. the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWe have long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ...\nIs right about that for decades us presidents from both parties who felt the need to do business with the salaries but while some did so quietly even at times reluctantly endless stand resident of the Fletcher School says President Trump has been eager to showcase his Saudi ties\nTrump has no artifice about him so he's quite up front about this sort of transactional relationship in a way that other presidents might have been somewhat more embarrassed or inhibited to speak about\nAll this week when the president was asked about the show ... case he emphasized Saudi Arabia Israel not only as an ally but as a customer\nWhen I went there they committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military [noise] those are the biggest orders of the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states the getting them as pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like Hoover than lucid motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard in Georgetown and foreign policy think tanks here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis acknowledged ...

Arabia\nThey invest in long term goals they invest in real estate they've been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institutions and art museums they have a lot of money to spread around\nDecades runs and says both the U.S and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War of the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partnered to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on that front is mixed former President Obama took a step back from the Saudis as part of his diplomatic overture to Iran\nMore tightly than ever the Trump Administration has put all of their ... and they have been very very public about that\nTrump has sided with Saudi Arabia and its regional fight with cutter and encourage the very public romance between his son in law Jared Kushner and the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin selmont as the

Arabia which is very slow he could be patient he he expected to the patient about what he didn't expect with their reversal that he was seeing with mine didn't from on\nTrump says he will listen to

I don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they didn't get to a big deal\nAnd I I get it I don't like it because I think that it imbalances the game to the land of the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is six eleven or whatever we know they can sort of a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that they it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation was with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break serve\n[laughter] of Howard thank you you're in San Francisco good they're commemorate and fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the\nMedal podium a thanks very much for being with us Howard oh it was terrific thank you\nWhen the baby of and HIV positive mother in South Africa was suffering from liver failure doctors were confronted with a heroin choice transplant part of the mothers deliver to the infant and risk transferring HIV or\nWhat the child grow sicker and most likely die child received part of her mother's liver and so far there has been no sign of HIV the surgery is your first and could significantly change the pool of organ donors in South Africa\nWe're about twenty percent of the population is infected with HIV largest epidemic in the world\nDr Harriet death riches and medical bioethicist at which Donald Gordon medical center that's where the trench flat happened and she was part of a team of doctors who helped prepare for the surgery she joins us from Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us\nToday and I had any Anya how's the baby doing and the\nBaby's doing very very well we are very yeah after the ... happened now and to see the ... and thriving under these circumstances with this ... case is obviously enormously gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we may\nWell help us understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't yeah\n[noise] yeah so\nWe knew that there was a really high possibility that three ...\nWe would give this child HIV but the other thing we had to wait is that the child had been on our way to list for a living for three times the average and the child is getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated\nAnd we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat if the parents tell you\n[noise] so it depends on the thing to ask why concrete\nWell controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy when you consider us so they were sick need that to wish from the parents and the ... who was the diner\nThat she could be it and we had to consider that they can't because we have to make sure that we promote Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible so it was interesting that in this case it was very much today\nFrom this very brave sets of parents who wanted to save the life of their child\n[noise] talked records do think this uh this case the more people know about it will ah contribute something to lifting the stigma they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to hurt so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's\nIt's a multifaceted\nSays us in South Africa although we have this very well integrated national and AIDS treatment program\nHIV is still very stigmatized and one of the things we would really hope to shine through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in normal life\nThen that shouldn't ... from being an organ donor it shouldn't stop you from having those options that HIV negative people would have\nAnd we hope that by showing that HIV positive people can do this that that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious dance and HIV stigma\nDark harried Etheridge medical bioethicist at which Donald Gordon medical center in Johannesburg thanks so much for being with us thank you very much\n[noise] [noise]\nJoan of arc has become such an emblematic figure saying to the Catholic Church the inspiration of so many novels you films and of course George Bernard Charles iconic play", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "20"}
