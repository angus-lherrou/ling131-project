correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina Hi Lulu\nThis has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court [noise]\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nAn incredibly important thing for the court to guard\nBeing impartial of being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process an environment than we live at\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes you can't have a avoid getting sucked into very big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether\nThe employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on

divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to state you know as if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because the story was all I knew and it was so important\nTo all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions in a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by\nThe judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that the my race was a relevant\nThe word that the judge use was assimilate to choose was one of them and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre such that it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what are the challenges that you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levy that you with your parents first\nOf all I wouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even um despite all the things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like things on chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this

now to sort through the story I'm good morning Hi Lulu it's a very confusing tale um talk us through what do we know\nWell we know democracy Yogi walked into the Saudi conflict Tuesday around one in the afternoon he needed some paperwork relating to a pending marriage to his Turkish fiance a she waited for him outside holding his phone until well after the consulate closed ah says he never came out\nA Turkish police opened an investigation and then came the surprising reports first by unnamed Turkish officials now on the record but an advisor to president ... on that investigators believe the show he was killed in the consulate are aired on says he said that the journalist disappearance but not much more than that so far\nAnd we haven't seen any evidence to back up this claim that show used it just the persistent question if\nHe's still alive where Izzie\nYou know what if the Saudis than saying well\nThe Saudis are basically denying everything except the fact that they show you did come into the consulate Tuesday Afternoon\nOr the Saudi press agency quote officials saying he left the consulate Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg News they're very keen to know what happened to him a there is no evidence on the outside whoever to show that show you actually did leave the consulate\nThe consul general invited Reuters reporters in showed them around there was no sign of just showed me he said the consulate has multiple exits but why would they show the lead by another exit if he knew his fiance was waiting up front\nSo lots of questions does advisor to

S. where NPR's Jackie Northam reports Washington pushing back\nThe U.S is unquestionably the leader in advanced technology and artificial intelligence robotics sophisticated weaponry it's what's helped give the country and national security edge\nThat something China has recognized in one sitting on his James Lewis specialist in China and technology at the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThe Chinese figured out the technology is the key to wealth and power and the source of technology is still the west for China so how do they get their hands on that western technology\nThree years ago Beijing unveiled it's made in China twenty twenty five strategy which calls for the country to become a world leader in advanced technologies including artificial intelligence AI\nAs part of that China is forming global partnerships pumping massive resources into tech firms at home in Europe and here in the U.S\nLet's say they're very systematic very long term in their approach and it's very well funded\nMichael Brown is with the Pentagon's defense innovation unit in Silicon\nConcern in Washington that China is acquiring too much sensitive us technology and transferring it back home\nThey don't play by the same rules that we do so a cyber theft is on the table and does her last name is on the table which can include recruiting key talent at networking events that are sponsored by the Chinese government working with us universities\nJust last week Bloomberg reported to us was investigating whether China allegedly infiltrated the Pentagon and major companies such as apple and Amazon by building spy chips into server mother boards and mother boards were manufactured in China the company's denied the allegations\nBut there are other ways China is making inroads to\nCapture American innovation [noise]\nThere's a quiet leafy part a Silicon Valley called Sunnyvale and a lot of the tech giants have a presence here there's Amazon labs linked in Yahoo and it's coming up now to Google complex and I can actually see some of the workers city at a picnic tables and enjoying the fine weather\nJust behind the Google complex is a Chinese company called ... and its fools arrival [noise]\nIf I Do is China's largest Internet search provider hit openness innovation center here in Silicon valley with a focus on self driving vehicles and other Chinese tech powerhouses Alibaba ten cent walk away also\nHave their own research and development centers here\nInstead of buying an existing us business the Chinese tech giants come in and build a new company from the ground up these moves are called Greenfield investments and they hire way a lot of us workers says the C.

Thirteen hundred rounds of funding for us start ups with at least one Chinese investor over the past eight years\nIs very common for Chinese firms to have some sort of ties are government might just be because they have to answer to the government leaders back at home and the first is the level of control\nMachine go says this has become a concern and national security circles because the nature of emerging technology is inherently you'll use in other words the AI algorithms used to help speed up your smart phones could also be applied to weapons on the battlefield\n... says while he's not aware of any smoking gun case where a Chinese venture capital has plundered sensitive technology from the start up it's widely acknowledge at a risk exists\nThat venture capital and other minority investments provide training the best of access potentially sensitive technologies particularly ones that are in a sense an early stage where us governments haven't had a full transfer evaluate the implications of those technologies\nBut for many American tech startups Chinese investment can be critical\nI think we got lucky and you've got a beautiful shreds it used to be an architectural consulting for\nChris Nicholson is the c._e._o. of sky mind which makes cutting edge artificial intelligence software daylight pours through the large windows overlooking San Francisco's mission street\nMission between night's event is a little research has got to try to press report\nNicholson helped create sky mind about four years ago he says the company like many start ups was very fragile in the beginning until it got its first investment of two hundred thousand dollars from Chinese consumers tech giant ten cent\nAnd nobody else fold that allowed us to survive and that's just like ... it's just by yourself enough time until you realize you're interested in the\nSky mind now has funding from some major American venture capitalists and a few smaller Chinese ones Nicholson disputes that venture capital investors automatically gain access to start ups research or know how\nLater stage investors putting in much larger amounts typically ask for things like information writes imports seats Nicholson says no investor has ever ask I mind for confidential technical information\nRight now for two people that it's me and microphones here\nFor decades funding for firms like Nicholson's was through the defense department it helped create technological breakthroughs that led to things like semi conductors in miniaturized GPS but that funding over the years has become slow and cumbersome well technology has been moving much faster in the private sector [noise]\nThe Pentagon recognize the problem in in twenty Fifteen set up the da you the defense innovation unit [noise]\nDrone at the buses above a tarmac and CGI use Silicon Valley lieutenant colonel David Ross side says the Pentagon created the unit and so we make it easier to get funding to start ups\nWere trying to grow the defense industry base by in type thing these companies are traditionally would work with us don't honestly need to work with us but how the great capability that we would all benefit from\nThis ultimate funding is one way Washington is trying to counter Chinese investment\nThe Trump Administration has also been aggressive in blocking several large mergers and acquisitions of us tech companies by Chinese firms\nAnd Congress is beefing up laws on the books end up protecting us technology from foreign governments it will allow closer scrutiny of all sorts of Chinese inroads in the tech sector says Mario ... a trade lawyer was Kirkland analysis\nI think some deals where there are Chinese investors will be a lot harder more deals will get a lot more scrutiny and some deals just\nAre not going to happen many us tech companies push back against tougher laws on foreign investment warning it could strangle innovation sky minds Nicholson again\nIn Washington DC people think innovation is an American monopoly they think that people can't go anywhere else British that's not check his moving fast you know a lot of different countries too if we shut the door here I was just going to be another war and it's going to be outside of us jurisdiction\nNinety two point seven WB you ate his very eighty nine point one WB UH Brewster and streaming at W.

so the Republicans and the president are trying to portray the Democrats are sort of weaponized the me too movement for political gain\nAnd on the left many see the Republican Party now as the party of sexual assault supporters uh with Roy Moore in Alabama President Trump on tape saying he has sexually assaulted women and now Kavanaugh sitting Supreme Court justice where does this leave the country well\nA week ago when a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was this interesting our country apart\nAnd that is really how it has felt that ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wounds if that's not to grow the an analogy\nI thought you know I think people were already angry\nBut the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled\nA lot of these questions aren't how emotional they are for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh uh left that was already I quite exercised particularly ... particularly women\nEnd up on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the president\nYet the midterm elections are less than a month away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the window at the president's back now and the Republicans do I think I have no idea frankly\nOr to tell what it is a signal and what his noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national sentiment all the science has been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republicans seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them uh but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nI ... and the trajectory is still rather remarkably as you said at the statistics are very good for the party in power usually a president with this kind of economic strength\nIs pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed off on the Republican Party and we have seen Republicans are

associate justice of the Supreme Court like having a confirmation fight is now over but as NPR's Scott Detrow reports from Capitol Hill it will likely linger over Congress and American politics for very long time\nAs senator stood at their desks and formally voted on cabin on vice president Mike Pence presided protester after protesters stood up and yelled raw and visceral messages strip mansion [noise]\n\nCircles has been seen some of having all confirmation Senate taking on one of its most important and historic responsibilities running smack into hyper partisanship as well as a cultural

partisan\nVote to confirm drug Scott ... is a vote to end this worry dark chapter in a sort of history\nBoth parties leave the confirmation fight outraged and agreed but for very different reasons Republicans sock character assassination old unproven allegations designed to destroy Kavanaugh's reputation Lindsey Graham's diatribe during the hearing on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations some of the ...\nBest I Would never do to them what you've done to this guy this is the most ethical sham I've been in politics\nDemocrats like New York's ... brand soft Ford's claimed Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in high school at the combination of the year old me too movement a referendum on whether women are believe when they report harassment or assault\nWe allow women's experiences sexual trauma the second one man's promotion it will not only diminish this watershed moment a societal change we are as it will bring shame and this body\nBut in the end Republican after Republican concluded what Nebraska Deb Fischer did\nI appreciate professor Ford sincere testimony I Believe she has experienced a traumatic event that no one should have to endure there is no evidence though that judge Kavanaugh was the perpetrator\nThe Senate checked awful lot of other legislative business as a confirmation fight play out an even pass some sweeping bipartisan governing bells\nBut while they differ on the root cause what became a toxic confirmation fight lawmakers from both parties are worried about its lasting damage Republican Lisa Murkowski spoke to that issue explained why she was the lone Republican opposing cabin\nAnd the legislative branch [noise] we have an obligation a moral obligation to do better than it\nRight now both parties are ceding with anger just before the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh Schumer urged Democrats to channel that outrage into next month's election\nVote if you believe Dr Ford and other brave women who came forward and you want to vindicate their sacrifice vote\nRepublicans are seeing a boost to McConnell told the Washington Post\nThe whole thing was a great political gift thinking what he called the mob going after Kavanaugh\nFor energizing Republicans for the first time this cycle there's about a month left to election day the big question now is which party voters will still be angry about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina Hi Lou ...\nAnd the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues well I think they'll all suck\nIt up he'll suck it up bill suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and get along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work and let me let me ask this have any of the justices said anything publicly about this\nNot per se but justice is Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were Princeton on friday and asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court hears what Justice Kagan said\nIt's an incredibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial of being neutral and of not being simply an extension of the terribly polarized political process an environment than we live at\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term\nSometimes you can't have a avoid getting sucked into very big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether\nThe employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers\nGay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin other places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the courts swing vote when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look like\nI'm closely contested cases\nYou will see a court that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment for the ability of the federal government to regulate\nFor the way the power is allocated in the federal government whether the president has more and more power\nWere not NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg thank you need us to find much thank you my\nName's Nicole ... who was born into a Korean immigrant family and then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to faith you know as if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because this story was all I knew and it was so important\nTo all of us as an adult ... did start to ask questions and a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by\nThe judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that the my race was a relevant\nThe word that the judge used was assimilate she chose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you were you were of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought and transracial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense to just kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that defined what what is it challenges you face because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me to say this is racism even um despite the things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like things on hands\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents' experience as white Americans\nI Can't tell them like it will hurt them I have to protect them from this knowledge and if I tell them they might not understand anyway because their weight\nChance of
