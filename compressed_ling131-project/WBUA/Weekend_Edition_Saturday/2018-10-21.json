A. dot org [noise]\n\nThis is weekend edition from NPR News I'm Luke Garcia Navarro good morning\nIt's been a long road to get to this milestone in Afghanistan they were twenty five hundred candidates trying for nearly two hundred and fifty seats\nI'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nDozens or dead but the vote went on to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is reporter Jennifer glass she is in Kabul thanks for being with us good to be here that live\nThere were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people lined up waiting to vote\nCertainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that right now we really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul or the suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he detonated his explosive vest outside\nOr in the north there was shelling in ... we know that they burned down one polling center outside of ... city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of Kabul abroad his armed men in he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections\nThe Afghan governance announced its arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nOne of the more hopeful signs though this time around is the number of women running right over four hundred what will just mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said Lou there hasn't been parliamentary elections in eight years the current parliament has been a frustration to many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that\nHas held Afghanistan back\nAnd it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and just\nBriefly what is signify that the vote was held after so very long it's always important to remind people that this is a country in conflict to conflict at the United states is involved and\nIt is and there was a lot of controversy about whether this vote should be held at all\nBut Afghan officials were adamant and international officials were adamant that they were going for with this vote and I think today they might be happy with their decision\nMore than three million of eight point eight million registered voters coming out there trying to show that the that Afghanistan is making progress and the battle insurgents around the country the Taliban are resurgent Islamic state was against the vote and yet still Afghans came out to exercise their civil\n\nSupport for NPR

Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that's my mommy is an expert\nOn Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us my purse or ... or the development of this story playing out in the middle east it is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty or many of the issue a statement supporting a boat so Saudi Arabia and a Kingsolver and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissident\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air among those members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract that much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they are looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists and others and so there are clearly not a beacon of liberal democracy and the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price uh from the Saudis which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI mean that's the bigger question ... what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why exposed a Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated debt\nOr they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange the native investment investment opportunities and that's all something that's going to review in much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so that doesn't want to go to the INS is very clear about that and so it really depends on their own\nCountries with with with liquid ...\n... and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to hold sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty four teams students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of why\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very nicely blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis in the shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't and this has published an exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version they Mexican Government said that the army and then at least they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two oh gee I Wish ... everything and the ... what I had seen all these years four years\nOf the investigation is that all these ... you sound like it's not to its ally\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who\n[noise] what I discovered was that the army and the ... not Joss Whedon Nazis about wild west happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the ... not just is even more\nI had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up well he's way chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean see I was before that\nSo the federal police and the army were chasing the students how would the students kills\nWell their students arrive near while they're the army the police\nThey state police were waiting for them\nThan their students decide to move that two bosses where they were transferred dating insight to the CD to be able to take the more versus mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to that brought this to Mexico City so they went to was a station\nThey do do that you bosses and when their students were trying to escape ... beside buses ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staples east is that to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're always at the end of that back way to bust his\n... from these two buses disappeared all the forty three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students are on the buses disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside buff is why they did was just too\nI'm not so nice to Boston is what exactly that two votes is that the army and they said that police start to money or a\nScene Steve ... before I mean these two both said was that the boss is where the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside enough secret parts of the of the bus the secret compartment as harrowing to me as a harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students the ... vote the army and if the police they knew that [noise]\nSo these students were almost victims\nOf circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what this was that really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow you know that heroin was hitting on that bus\nI was able to connect with one drug lord enforced on drug lord I was able to contact with one person that works for him and the west these ah informant and inside the cartels that explain made this ... [noise]\nDo we know who ordered the crime I mean there's been over a hundred arrests in this case do we know who actually said you know targeted these students in order to this to happen according with my investigation\nThat there's a responsible these crime wise that twenty seven battalion any water\nIn particular decorum than that received a phone call from the rubble are ordinary him you have to rescue my drugs I pay you for the ... you have I don't know I Know what you have to do I want my drugs back\nPatriots Chicago today to play the bears partly cloudy after morning a light rain today in the forties right now forty seven degrees in Boston\nWhere funded by you our listeners by Cisco presenting their new Web ex meeting used by fortune five hundred companies Web ex allows users to connect on video meetings in real time was a single click more it's just go dot com slash go slash choose whether\nIn Boston interiors store and why is it featuring furniture and accessories for\nYour living room dining room and bedroom Boston as you were yours dot com for locations [noise]\n\nSixteen years after the Gardner Museum robbery hog lead in a cold case and then we can all do you view are marketing part casualty\nThere was a gang in France that had a Vermeer nobody said the word Gardner but there was no other mere missing in the world and that my my father was\nGoing to be with reporters Kelly horn and jak readily go as our series on the Gardner Museum investigation continues tomorrow on WB you ours MORNING EDITION\nAnd this from the station and from pro quest as literature on line premium features works from the eighth century to the present day and makes minority authors works discover Abul along with the western canon at libraries or pro quest dot com\nAnd from the alliance for lifetime income a nonprofit composed a financial services organizations working to educate Americans about options for securing protected lifetime income in retirement more at alliance for lifetime income dot org\n[noise] this this weekend edition from NPR News I'm the guy at the end of our world and it's time to play the puzzle [noise]\nJoining us as always is Will Shortz puzzle editor of the New York times and weekend edition of the puzzle master the money well you ... your back from LA I'm back from LA I'm so go ahead and remind isn't last week's challenge\n[noise] yes I said take the seven let her last name of a famous woman dropped the letter E. add an eye on an ass and you can rearrange the result to get a word that famously describes this woman who is she in most of the word\nWe answer is Steinem as in Gloria Steinem and she was a feminist and how cool is that her name has all those letters\nVery cool um we had four hundred and thirty eight responses and the winner is dead panic China of metal is New York congratulations and welcome to the program thank you very much so you've been playing the puzzle for a quite a while I understand\nWhat happened in trying to enter as many times as I can really was this a dream [laughter]\nThis was this wonderful\nI I also heard you have a large collection of books as well\nYes um I collect Sherlock Holmes petri dishes and novels and stories about a Conan Doyle um have roughly a just check this morning I have about a thousand now\nWow what draws you chew Sherlock Holmes\nUm the the analytical thinking the way that he's able to you know analyze a problem from very little information\nWell um I Hope you'll be able to analyze the questions to the puzzle um are you ready to play I'm reading All right well take it away\nAll right Dan I'm going to give you two words\nThink of a word that can follow my first one in pre said my second one in each case to complete a familiar two word phrase\nAnd the answer will rhyme with one of the two words for example if I said snail and order you would say male as in snail mail and mail order and mail rhymes with smell and the ... can be for either the first there was a second we're\nNumber one is legal and by the Y.

voice to a bipartisan chorus of criticism according to ... he died Saudi hand in there is tumble consulate the Saudis took\nA very long time to explain this that and many details of this explanations and difficult to believe but the president wants to give the kingdom the benefit of the doubt we'll descended allow that\n[noise] well the Senate needs to have a a very intense discussion about this because uh basically President Trump is a giving a sense that this was a credible story this half ... half baked story\nOr the ... instead of sending a powerful message about American support for human rights and and free press this uh it just seems like almost like our administrators shouldn't tripping his regime is working hand in hand with the Saudi Government to take a very serious situation and tried to dismiss it\nAh what should the response the what should not powerful message the\nWell the message to start by saying this story is completely unacceptable it's full of every kind of holes not given it any sort of of credibility and that we have to get to the bottom of everything that that happened\nSecond is we need to realize that this is this is one piece of a broader set of issues we have to address a prior to the incident in the consulate the Saudis were using an intense a team of folks on Twitter to discredit crush muggy and and other dissidents or around the world\nAnd furthermore they are involved in this or a horrific war in Yemen where we are actually assisting them\nAnd this is a a situation where you have the worst cholera epidemic ever recorded in

for example that are used in Yemen I'm should those weapons deal me try it I mean should the United states stopped providing weapons Cincinnati\nAbs absolutely there's already been a bipartisan support for ending these these sales states precision guided munitions\nThere was initially so support for selling them because they thought was the Saudis were hitting civilian infrastructure in Yemen because they didn't have precision guided munitions and then when the U.S provided them they use them to hit civilian locations\nAnd us a shattering the infrastructure and placing a millions of

Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me All right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain that Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats\nAnd that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with\nBut if there is some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person\nDoesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates don't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves then ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad potholes\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I I say all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied to actually be the Democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in a state that's in as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national times just can overwhelm everything yet but taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear\nA lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the state legislators were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of the states where state legislatures draw the lines now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nRead Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much that you forty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon's Saturday Night massacre president\nLet go of his attorney general deputy attorney general and the special counsel investigating the Watergate scandal President Trump is locally frustrated with Robert Mueller's investigation so could it happen again here's Ron Elving NPR senior editor and correspondent

Washington Post reporters who pursued it when few others were paying much attention Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\nNixon was re elected in a landslide that November but in the early months of his new term there was trouble within his inner circle\nGood evening the biggest White House scandal in a century the Watergate scandal broke wide open today\nIn April or Nineteen Seventy three you

taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz when after Hispanic nickname his rival ... works has long used\nTo\nThe gruesome self hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nYour name is Raphael you know you go by Ted that's an angle sized version of it he went the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nTonight the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA test\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized you said we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way to use I don't think for\nHas to do things together but I think that we can over your side of the day that we can\nBring identities and when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work than they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other\nSort of the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can take 'em too seriously and then many political complex I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them when they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the kind of his best the one other grounds so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role of identity in politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or co opting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly constantly [laughter] I I\nThink you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently during his mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that means I'm a terrible road because once you've created\nA racial divisions it takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know we'll through the ... century they're drawing people together or through making them feel assured hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is a political identities right now\nThe labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one of my identity wins everybody now their identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means you lose the sense that in elections reserved and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order to should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm I'm hearing a real narrative concern um that identity um and the politics around it has been weaponized and and it's certainly\nNo I think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know our country today is that we're more defined as around identity then we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come through reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession you know coming together but losing\nLosing to the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied and making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common cause\nYeah now the question is whether you could do that with our what your cold rightly recognizing identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies\nDemocracy needs the capacity for compromise and turning everything into an identity and she makes it very hard to compromise\nKwame Anthony Appiah is a professor at New York University His latest book is the lies that bind me thinking identity thank you very much thank you very much\nAmerica's Test kitchen is celebrated as a reliable source of advice for home cooks they test tools techniques and recipes before

nearly two hundred and fifty seats\nI'm Talking about parliamentary elections there first in eight years and the vote has been bloody with many reports of violence at polling stations including a suicide bomber in the capital Kabul\nDozens are dead but the vote went on and to talk about the significance for America's longest running war is a reporter Jennifer class she is in Kabul thanks for being with us get to be here live\nWho were people able to turn out to vote in large enough numbers or did the violence keep them away\nYou know despite threats from Islamic state and from the Taliban more than three million Afghans turned out on Saturday and today there are people lined up waiting to vote certainly some people will not get the opportunity to do that\nRight now we really only seen numbers from the big cities and it's the rural areas where people are most it threatened maybe might feel most intimidated\nTell me a little bit about the violence what happened\nThe biggest single attack was a suicide bomber here in Kabul\nThe suicide bomber trying to get into a polling station was stopped by policemen he\nDetonated his explosive vest outside or in the north there was selling in ... we know that they burned down one polling center outside of countries city and there's been some irregularities as well one local strongman on the outskirts of Kabul\nI brought his armed men and he's a candidate and he tried to prevent\nOther people from getting to the polling stations so not by far the cleanest elections the Afghan governance announced its arrested a few dozen people for fraud and intimidation they're trying to make sure that Afghans will have faith in this election\nWait a more hopeful signs though this time around is the number of women running right over four hundred what would this mean\nThey are guaranteed sixty eight seats in the parliament for each province but I think the the real key has been the number of young people running as you said lately there has\nPrint parliament has been a frustration many almost a symbol of corruption and patronage that has held Afghanistan back\nAnd it was really interesting to see election observers at the polls there were four hundred thousand of them many of them there to support their own candidates to make sure that their candidates got a fair shake\nIn these elections the fact that so many young people and non politicians were willing to put themselves out there I think shows that there's a new generation of Afghans trying to change things and just\nBriefly what is it signify that the vote was held after so very long it's always important to remind people that this is a country and conflict to conflict at the United states is involved and\nIt is and there was a lot of controversy about whether this vote should be held at all\nBut Afghan officials were adamant and international officials were adamant that they were going for with this vote and I think today they might be happy with their decision\nMore than three million an eight point eight million registered voters coming out there trying to show that the that Afghanistan is making progress and the battles insurgents around the country the Taliban are resurgent Islamic state was against the vote and yet still Afghans came out to exercise their civil right\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the library of

Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire since\nA Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul ... ... is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy pressure on the development of this story playing out in the middle east it is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty at many of the issue a statement supporting a both Saudi Arabia and a Kingsolver and of course uh the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worried that the people who are activists journalists dissident\nUm and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those members of civil society\nYou're trying to figure out Turkey's we'll hear we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist up without their intelligence services leaking information\nIt's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think a and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they're released information really to extract that much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis\nAnd I would say that they made it very smart or they looked like the hero in this story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison or many of them are are journalists as well and activists in and out there so there clearly not a the beacon of liberal democracy and the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically\nDefending or you know uh this one man Joe Biden and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important\nImportant important price or from the Saudis which has yet to be determined that really\nI mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why expose a Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis\nThey have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency date foreign exchange need investment that he'd investment opportunities and that's all something that that area and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe they can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so that doesn't want to go to the ins are very clear about that and so it really depends on now\nCountries with with with liquidity\n... and and just briefly we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult uh I Believe for a U.S government who wants to hold sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saturday but it looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was the best and among many a political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much thank you on September twenty six twenty four teams students from the teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for it\nArrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of water\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very asleep blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups and the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I hadn't done this is published and exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events\nWas a fabrication in these official version they're Mexican Government said that the army and if it up all these they didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends species official start eat what I have seen all these years four years\nOf investigation is that all the official better showing you sound like it's not true its ally\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked these students and why they were attacked [noise] what I discovered was that\nThe army and the for the police not Joss Whedon not these about wild west happening that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just is\nEven more I had reports on the show to report that proves that the army and if it up well he's white chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the I was before that that so\nThe federal police and the army were chasing the students how the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive near while they're the army the police\nThey state police were waiting for them\nThan their students decide to move that two bosses where they were transferred dating insight to the CD to be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to the brought this to Mexico City so they went to was a station\nThey do do that you bosses\nAnd when their students were trying to escape ... it'll be five buses ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staples east is that to shoot I gained the buses just stuck them mhm they they're always at the end of that back what you've lost his\n... from these buses disappeared or they're forty three students\nSo the federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses um the the people that were on those buses the students are on the buses disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group students why would the federal police\nAnd the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside bus is why they did was just too\nI'm not so nice to Boston where exactly that two votes is that the army and they said that police start to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses would that do versus where the students were traveling from their school do why why so when I was able to have found is that in these two buses\nWhere a inside enough secret parts of the of the bus secret compartment as harrowing to me as a harrowing two million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students and even now it for the army and if the police they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to
