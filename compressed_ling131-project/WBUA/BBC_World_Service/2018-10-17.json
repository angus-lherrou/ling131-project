the the problem with Brandon Lucas [noise] we we say that it's a it's a huge game Fortnite I don't play but I've heard of it how was it a global in a big money generator you don't you don't make any money playing it do you make any money buying it to play it\nWell you have to ... to pay any money to play the game was down there again I think that's one of the reasons it's been so successful you know it's really accessible to lots of people if you want you can buy a thing called a season policy about maybe ten dollars and that gives you access to so cooler weapons and guns and outfits and that sort of thing\nAnd but yeah it's not really an money generating game in the sense you have to pay a subscription or anything like that but obviously lots of people have super into the game and willing to buy that season policy and that's how the company generates money\nAnd now if someone is in trouble tell us about the videos posted on line there and why the company at the games is suing that player Brandon\nLucas so yes it Brandon Lee ... is accused of making these hacks to the game and selling them\nAnd these ... to cheat basic take that he's made these include ... does is it makes it much easier to kid enemies 'cause you don't have to aim it than it does it for you automatically so he's been selling these modes to the game on nine and ... I'll put the two hundred pounds\nAre buying those people are buying them yes because again it's a hugely popular game and and some people have got the money to access these kinds of things but overseas and knowing for people who haven't got that kind of money because they want to play the game fair and square and these other people cheating\nAnd of course the the the issue that at the games I guess are having with it is that essentially we're talking about hacking into the software uh Fort Night\nThat's when they basically ... these people have copyright infringement and they're saying you know you've taken a product you modified it against the wishes without permission or that you have spoiled it essentially for the other players and on and it belongs to us you have no right to do that\nCan he be the only one that surely EPA games should be targeting everyone who does\nThis in fact it's argument is that he's being singled out he believes that some fat he says ... of other

know they they have to stop somewhere and perhaps that trying to demonstrate with this case that if you do this this is what the consequences will be\nAnd it's just tell us about the significance of this case is this the first in in in the industry\nI Know if it's not even a fast food night really they vote yeah they they had some people in a restaurant I think in um a different game that she'd

things he gets in their video games journalist joining us life\nLewis be cheating and all sorts of games um thank you Eli I understand a bit more now twenty two minutes possibly out now Canada has

will be selling it to you know over the counter here\nUm there are about three locations here in in St john's area that you can walk in off the street by the candidate but\nFor for now for the most part\nYou'll be ordering it on line it's controlled by the same corporation of government that controls the sale of liquor\nAnd they brought in older roles of regulation companies have to fly in order to be able to sell it legally there are about twenty two locations off in a in the country right now that in ... in the profit right now that can sell it and they will pay an excise tax the government

the vice president of the parliament she oversees relations with national parliament and has played a prominent role in the debates about the future of European agriculture but right now\nAs an Irish politician representing the governing finagle poverty in Brussels her primary focus is bricks you know one of the nation stands to be as affected by Britain's departure from you\nAs Ireland the only land border between the u._k. and the union is the from here between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic it's what happens at that border and the stages of Northern Ireland post Brexit has become the biggest obstacle\nTo a deal as the torturous bricks negotiations into the final phase indeed the Irish Question could yet ... any sort of agreement but could either the you know the u._k. really let that happen well read McGinnis joins me now\nWelcome to hard not to be here [noise]\nAre you surprised that after a year and a half off in ten inch negotiation between UK and EU\nOfficials here we are with fish and game of I just described underway and it seems the issue of the Irish border and the restrictions stages of Northern Ireland are\nObstacles that cannot be overcome\nI'm disappointed maybe I'm not surprised but I'm not without hope so just let me take this week because everyone's quite anxious about what didn't happen at the weekend um well what\nIs happening is the talks are continuing so there's no sense that there's a breakdown but there than in past and it's not surprising that the issue of northern art on the island of Ireland is the issue that the withdrawn agreement if\nYou like still has to be completed\nOn because remember it isn't just the ... you or me as an Irish semi pie or the our government and sat down to the United kingdom the bushes prime minister\nLast December signed up to an opposite of commitment that there would be no high board has no return to the past on the island of Ireland where a piece of that in March in fact the attacks on the table and draft withdraw\nDivorce if you like agreement and the incomplete parts are around and northern are and what has told me I have to say is that normally when we go see a certain level ... papers produced I don't like what's on your paper for example but I'm going to propose changes I guess what you want to agree with all of them but you take some on board\nThat has not happened in these negotiations what is happening on this is a troubling part that I Hope we can get over is that the u._k. side on and that is their right to do they have said well\nWe don't like what's daughter we went to an all around we're proposing that in the future relationship we'll\nAgreed to this if you like time and then the customs arrangement temporary customs arrangements and then the way trying to reverse the future\nOf Reverend Wright making sense it is where you located lands but I I Am very aware that the people in Britain none of around the world there is a great deal of comfort occasionally but if I don't want you seemed to be saying is that the British Government led by Theresa May is written aging on promises me when it comes to the so called Irish\nIf I Want to see is that what I Would but I'm not using it I think she hasn't delivered yes on promises made that is a big fat\nFrom saying she's ... and I understand the pressure that cheese on there were not blind to the politics of the conservative party I'm not blind to the fact that the Wii U P is popping up to the conservative government there's a budget votes on the twenty ninth of October\nBe their lives there and I lived and know what had happened and I think that's the part of the discussions that people aren't hearing\nAnd you have to obviously respect different views on that but at some point when when language and you know like I say shall not blood red lines I some today for example I read I wouldn't even say it on television vulgar comment about this I thought what going too far here and that's like cabbage required but also understanding that the u._k. isn't\nNow so much energy from the European Union and they have everybody's been say Reagan I meant to say they're a much bigger dangerous and challenges facing that you and for you as a\nAs an official with with a sort of overview as vice president of the European and not on a ... a very different that's fair enough you know what role is vice president the European Parliament how worried are you by the fact\nThat in the midst of all this fuss about ... what we don't seem to be focused on is that certain countries in the new like Poland and Hungary legs are simply refusing to play by the use rules and accept basic in your values when it comes to things like a free media and independence and the judiciary\nAnd I think we all should be worried about that of course we're all concerned about it that's why I voted that there should be a ... view of what's going on in hospitals and ... ...\nMotives doesn't doesn't work because not only opponent and hungry for themselves but they are acting with the support of a block of countries have articles that would allow them to be disciplined by the ... commission the ISI Jay and others it when I was\nI Know but I mean I've met picked or been face to face and I said to him my concern about what's going on in his contract at so bill under no illusion that why breakfast is a big issue where also dealing with those other other fundamentalists I'd wanna portions they at least within the European Union you have a capacity to influence\nAnd to bring our to go seven which you say is not going to what\nWill they match you say we are dealing with it under article seven article sending was triggered last year against Portland this year the polls have pressed on with these judicial changes which have involved the president basically getting rid of molten God I'm the judges on them all the protests about it the more the poll say we don't\nCare yeah when you're in a different job than I Am my job is to make sure that the polish leadership\nUnderstands that the root of a half to ... even if that takes longer than I Would like that we keep demanding high standards and the the benefits of Europe is that at least these countries are with us around the table but it doesn't take away some core point there are deep\nVision and what not on the other division that also seems to me that the the the the strain of nativist nationalist populist populist politicians which would include those in governing in Poland and Hungary\nAre making the political weather and politics like yours in the sense of right that it's been a gale in the white a block in Europe the European people's party\nThey are running ... of these people your own blog refused to expel victims will bend street days even do you think he is flaps in European value but first\nOf all I'm not running scared of anyone I'm from a small country but I'm pretty brave in my politics\nSecond laid the Bush conservatives did not vote to function Mr Obama on hungry so there's a question for them to answer and apparently the pressure would it be a relentless what's happening within the ... group are the conversations about what is happening with to or by either I bought him until it and what I\nThink about the iPad ... we had a lot of you know you had an opportunity\nWe we have to say very charity argues the fate of I've had months invade by the leader of our group who also voted compassion whole way we have not yet and talk to that point it may come where we said we cannot be together but don't place uh know traumatic action with inactive or say there's a huge amount of activity\nAnd so you say but look what\nDo I say with respect so I Know because I'm involved in it\nThe truth is you have governments across east Europe who refused to accept the\nNotion of burden sharing when it comes to taking quotas off immigrants on a whole host of other issues including the creation of a new security fools putting ten thousand gone into Frontex east Europeans won't buy it so all of these issues when it comes to that whole issue of migration the notion of collective you action just not happening\nNot yes but the pressure would have to be in that direction\nBecause for one simple fact the biggest driver of migration flows will not become sex but it would be time to change and Europeans to do more on that the reason why is highly on those who've been at the forefront of receiving migrants around me and say in Europe has a ... and then\nThe third point is that the number of migrants coming to Europe has dramatically decreased but what very worrying if you have any concern about human beings is that one and a scene die for what for Asian arrive of one person dies has died in the first couple of months of this year that is a horrific statistic\nLucille the highlight in Haiti arguments about what to do and they seem increasingly been buying the arguments of the far right where I went to go\nBack to the people of Iraq but that said in the u._k. because the u._k. referendum was in my view at fuel is by\nThe false ...\n... and I just play around my gracious as an interesting point about going to do with why\nBecause frankly when it comes to ... European elections the Brits will not be voting for the round your polling evidence suggests that Mr so meaning that Marine Le Pen's party and\nAuthors and countries as far as Poland Hungary Austria you name it they have the political momentum it'd be very outgoing and unless you are very adamant\n... the very at the weekend was the grains that actually what the surprise if you like the gas or it's and\nThere are new tickets coming up Wednesday you should watch out for them but the mood across Europe definitely politics is polarizing I chair the European Parliament has increasingly when I called votes you say that the extremes on the right and left vote the same way on issues so it's not just about ideology here there's something else happening\nIn ... and the body politic I mean I Would worry about whether the central can hold or seen the Social Democrats quite fractured\nAre only ... Christian Democrats that could be applied\nTo election but are you to the that the mainstream blow yeah E. pi paying the European socialist and many people holdings opinion belongs to me but according to opinion polls to many people around Europe they look like the tie tired old Brussels elites who have not delivered I Know the the\nYeah when you see you're using the language which field a referendum here and quite frankly it becomes a bit tedious I may I may have aged since I got elected but I'm not tired\nTo look for in the ... am actually what happens in Hungary and told them this is reality I don't I Know all\nOf that is reality but my job is not to give in to a reality that I Believe would be bad for my children and I have four of them and in fact I warn them I say to them you have taken for granted pace on this confidence because it's\nThere nothing isn't given my biggest worry and I do send them with their sometimes is that we will wonder what the European Union\nDid which was developed peace and prosperity on the continent of Europe for the idea\nThat you can have your own individual policy or you can be a populist when when you have to do is say something but not take the responsibility for us I take responsibility for what I Do and what I say and I hope that in the European Parliament elections we talk about you are I'm not national issues because they tend to be a button\nOn record as I appreciate your historical perspective but here's a quote from a man widely respected around Europe Pasco lime a former commissioner without change and reform\nThe eating you will remain as it is today in his view it relevant to a majority of its citizens that it was an extraordinarily worry any comment from uh Europe file\nYeah it is worrying I mean you can where you have to death he used to do something with us I mean the first part where he sang reform and he's of course that's essential I mean the thing about being a rather than just hold on a second\nIn Ireland for example many of us took for granted the single market customs and without understanding was that his breakfast right across Europe because of the debate people are beginning to understand the finger mocks the customs union\nHow drugs or regulation how chemicals are banned if they're if they're dangerous I mean Europe has done that have pets can be brought on how it is a smaller\nTo the largest part of how we live today\nHas happened because of the good stuff that Europe does but frankly and I was a journalist no media is interested in the good things and you're right to focus on all that that is difficult and needs to be\nChallenged because that's my job to do that but it not time it's no harm to remind people that would that the European Union for my country be we would not be at the table but we had he's get respect them have a word and I think we will be in a much more difficult one\nRaid McGinnis we have to end the thing that you very much the\nDistribution of the BBC will service in the U.S has made possible by American public media with support from fidelity investments sticking a personalized approach to helping clients group preserving vantage there will learn more instability dot com slash wealth fidelity brokerage services L L C\nAnd by the three ... addressing the world's most challenging problem so it's a convergence of artificial intelligence R U T elastic cloud computing or at sea three\nBy OT dot a are\nFrom Boston University this is not the point nine W.

sitting here and some rain ...\nProfessor Steve right will pioneers in the industry say these limitations could yet be fixed a new generation of batteries in the next year or two could double left lying time all the same\nSome of those involved in driving the new tack like engineering ... top ... go Eric uh playing it safe for now using hybrid technology to power that runs\nWorking on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather design for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now\nAnd then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or soon as possible\nAs soon as the battery technology is there describe who is in this game it's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies then you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in the ... that can absolutely are thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you know the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of the start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they develop the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combined airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York or London or\nParis if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe you worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a roadmap for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power train like the ones with vertigo is developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types then grows\nWe took about taxes I think that the tax is going to be picking me up from my office and taking me to my home I mean that presumably isn't the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think it's a nice traffic chided cities in the well a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been all of a sudden they have ... regulations that perhaps they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very carefully\nRight now today in Sao paulo there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on top of the buildings around the city\nAnd so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exists in one city\nBusy business people with five to ten times a year we all find ourselves in these cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting it I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there are now on those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere\nIt's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic how soon\nAre we going to see this revolution you're describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and all caviar by ... that saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus and less like a taxi\nYou're going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport two two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rap and transportation option\nAnd then it just starts to grow from there\nAre a bunch of ... to go arrow hair on business day from the BBC\nThat really for the new tax will be when these flying drones but come\nOn just a novelty placing for rushed overpaid business executives but when they also are a viable option for ordinary people like you will meet well some Seventy or eighty stock sums up battling to develop the hard way and ride sharing tech them ...\n... is investing millions of dollars in infrastructure in lobbying Steve tip it says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nI mean they're doing a great job in galvanizing industry employing everybody together to go after a common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which is well it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but brilliant but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things in simply finding\nIs this going to start in Europe and America where's it going to start somewhere else where about half the regulatory hurdles so that's how I\nYeah I think ... probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong ready to water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and it just a natural fit\nYeah a lot of Iowans to jump over ... less dangerous for that reason because when you're not going to crush onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight you over the water most into but you know if you look around the world a lot of a lot of the most popular city to live in our water bound so there's an application for this type of transportation\n... besides it's hyping type pilots flying taxis and a number of western cities Los Angeles Dallas New York or Paris\nAs soon as twenty twenty five but does that actually unrealistic shut you give them the technical and psychological obstacles we're gonna have to overcome a professor Steve right from the university the west of England will list is the worry\nFirst time we have a ... an accident which can be attributed to machine as you can imagine people kind of lose their mind to it\nAnd say we're getting very very carefully because one major accident and they could shut this down in an afternoon it's a real worry and that's providing pulls facility for the rest of the industry back\nIn the seventies I think they used to be a helicopter taxi service operating around New York and then I flipped over and killed ... people and\nThey're not really done it since have they oh what's the Pan Am building wasn't the weather's ... to crash that that was cool by Gus in say again we have problems in developing these these technologies that oddly enough\nThis is one area in which the technology actually solve the problem we've had in the past\nI think the the ... that will pay an easing in period we the public needs to get used to the idea\nTo just in the same way that we had the the the person walking in front of the car waving a red flag because of that whether that is I ever actually happened that day that was the early days of ... early days it makes it Mesa vehicles exactly we are fearful off\nAnd we need to get used to hide days and so once that seem to be Paul solve our everyday lives and this is what's possible with this new technology people will accept it how long will it be how long will it take to we get to some kind of drugs and drug ...\nTaxi I but I Would love to say I mean this is this is the question everybody asks me my particular hunch timescales is ten to Fifteen Years\nNow the thing is I'd love to be proved wrong in this case because I really well by flying a really well by flying taxi\nBut the number of weeks we've built soup and should jump through as well in order to make sure this equipment is demonstrably say now will take time in the in the sense that we read and just now deciding which groups we do need to jump through\nProfessor of aerospace engineering Steve right and that's just about it for this program men while esoteric also takes over these days flying controls
