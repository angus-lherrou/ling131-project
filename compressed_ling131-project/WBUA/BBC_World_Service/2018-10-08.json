make efforts to restrain or global warming to one point five Celsius so they commissioned this report from the edge of governmental panel on climate change\nI really what scientists have been done doing in the meantime is to try and work out what the differences in in ... like a one point five Celsius well I'm just too so just well that is some errors there isn't quite striking difference in what what five you cut off as many people exposed to wars is going to see\nYou have one the number ... exposed regulating extreme heat waves and the impacts on the nature of the different for example you could actually kiss goodbye to coral reefs to Celsius whereas at one point five up to the deepest sense the divide so quite significant differences between\nWhat's interesting is they trying to emphasize the knowledge and certainly the affordability but the feasibility of some of the solutions that all they really feasible having a look at it with ... these are really major changes to my lifestyle to the world's lifestyle what are they saying needs to be done\nWell that's right if you put it in context we've been using fossil fuels in an industrial complex for about three hundred years and the prescriptions to try and reverse that he is so massive off I'm essentially you need to bring carbon dioxide emissions down to zero\nBy twenty fifty just study is time um you know you call\nIn Michigan emissions down to zero absolutely in every sector of the economy can do it and most of them we know how to do it and ... we know how to do ... we know how to do and he said we know how to do in most areas of industry for example it's tough and agriculture and\nMaybe impossible in aviation so you bring the emissions down it's close to zero as possible and then you have to do what's cool negative emissions where you actually suck carbon dioxide from the yeah\nAnd that can be done either through things like punching forests are older technologies that do this so it is a massive change but in each of those areas it sees all the question is what is it feasible politically\nRight if they want to see it they will go and of course this kind of marvel movie this is not

in the future because that's where we have less confidence and improving tools will help us to be able to make some sense about those events\nOne event that will down please be scrutinized and the next edition will be Hurricane Florence which wrote so much damage in the car line is just a few weeks back\n\nWell\nLive\nSide of a\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the several ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models was suggesting we were heading for something Robert comma\nLet me issue and mea culpa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event that turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got a new ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall ... rage with scale full wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a mostly to petition overland after impact of the dorm with fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description outside from friday also which is as a great slightly who'd of this kind of event ... these very specifically giving a number to the amount the strengths of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur\nOur approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in the north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability ever trends right now is is one\nAnd we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics or intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the ... and you could ... Pacific Ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated as part of past research by climate scientist and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so there's warmer area and cooler areas but basically were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal\nFrom our forecast industrialization so that when we run these modified forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that had on the atmosphere temperature as well as on a certain temperature changes that have on moisture in the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... that are associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for us\nChanging of the tea we actually have a pattern change of the ... the ... that comes from the fact that the climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in the set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation can lead us look under the bonus of climate change so to speak with the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes this'll be interest Michael mind\nParticularly in the like the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see a wall still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form of tropical storm we think that's somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius\nSo there's a very large region in the Atlantic the sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that is the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually expanding quite a bit it's expanding quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that is right on the threshold a little bit of warming\nCan suddenly create a much larger region it's warm enough and we think that maybe why some of these storms are intensifying earlier were seen storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as well\nIs marginal changes to the Atlantic but potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many events that have mocked the past few months\nSea ice is declining rapidly melting foster most some is recovering more poorly each winter Julian Streever of the national snow and ice data center was recently in the Arctic between Alaska and Siberia seeing herself the continuing decline in Arctic ...\nOne of the things when I was just out in the Arctic Ocean and the check to see we really struggled trying to find large enough ice flows to set up an ice camp and also thick enough to support many people out there doing their their field observations\nAnd also we were trying to deploy our booties and you know we couldn't find many flows that were very thick so we're putting out these buoys and ice that may be a meter thick and you're hoping that it was still survive and locations where we put some of our buoys out\nAlready went through about ... centimeters of melt since we had deployed than which gets worrying because of the ice gets too thin and buoys melt out then we lose our data\nJudy instructors posed the research is directly related to the climate slash whether issues of this program\nAre FM Boston homo Boston's largest radio news Ron now just to point of WB you wait just bury eight or nine point one there'll be you'll be UH Brewster and streaming WVU our dog or W.

a whole Jeremy glasses economists columnist and correspondent in Brussels and we can speak to him from that now good morning Jeremy going to be the eurozone's next sulfur in debt crisis\nI think it may well be in the last few weeks had been hopes here in Brussels particularly within the European Commission that Italy's government would be persuaded to back down on some of its spending proposals and tax cuts are not Taliban hasn't been the case in the sense here is that\nThere are people that the commission can talk to an room for people like for example Giovanni tree of the finance minister

up with this budget\nBut do you think that there's a lot of posturing handed in the end they'll just have a line that they'll have to tell you that I Know who could date really take this to the brain can ... really affects the the markets that really effects and that one of the earth than\nWhen I think I think the best case the optimism scene from the European institutions perspective is that the

Italy's debt this is not a government living in the realm of of economic reality I'm afraid and um it doesn't seem like government you know especially listening to your interview just now leaving itself much room to back down to this I added to that you have to include the but the fact that\nThere is now the competition within the government between the Laker now the dominant force on the five Star Movement which used to think of itself as a dominant force and so\nI I can see this becoming a set of competition between the two are doubling coalition partners in Rome as to who can be tougher who can take on the markets you can take in Brussels more\nUm you know we've we've seen the language escalating we've seen ministers accusing Brussels market terrorism with one phrase used um and and I think this this'll this'll points in the direction of um of of of the major showdown in which the Italian government actually embrace it um penalties imposed from Brussels over its budget deficit\nHas got macho politics isn't it absolutely it does does cloud ... of the guy who you'd have a point I mean France and Germany they've gotten away with overspending and and you know exceeding their public debt limits that sets out by the white college it's an e just do the same it is one rule for them and one rule fits in isn't it\nIt's not to turkey and reasonable point and I think the ... there was some in the commission particularly miss miss the most could reach the commissioner responsible for economic and financial effect who were willing to give it to the government to bits of breathing room on this they felt that if they could be escalate the conflict they they would actually denied the Italian government the child to\nA theatrical ... this is disagreements with Brussels but I I think the difference I supposed to keep people here in Brussels all in in the commission would say is that when Germany and France overstepped that um budget rules they were led by governments that seemed at least to understand the importance of those rules and we're willing to die that country's back onto a sensible path\nAnd then they look for example the Italian government budget proposals and the wildly unrealistic growth expectations and there's and say that this is not a government we can do business with in the way that we could do business with for example the French and German Government at the time when they overstepped the debt deficit limit but\nThe European Union can't afford to ... this is this is the ultimately the big problem for actually\nIt's too big to fail exactly and and I think this is also interact with of course the the ongoing debate about reforming the yours and where the the commission is treading a very fine line on the one hand you have\nA countries and like it's a ... like ... or the other countries in southern Europe or who's the front of the week when you feel that there was ... years and he'd been pushing for greater burden sharing within two years and then on the other hand you have an old and European states or one of them is Germany but even more hard line on this is the so called new ... leaks of this new gang of\nA ... a Scandinavian states led by the Dutch who who are very skeptical about any of the risk sharing within the years and and that's all going to come to a crunch and mid December to sum it here in Brussels and that may well now take place against the backdrop of escalating a sort of tit for tat between Rome and Brussels which of course we'll make compromise at the summit very difficult indeed\nJeremy cliff the economists Columbus and correspondent in Brussels thanks very much for that he brings us to the end of this additional business day there's lots more business news online that BBC News dot\nCom and remember that if you miss the program you can always download previous additions from your favorite post costing website I Do get in touch the Twitter handle is at BBC will phase or at my what I the bc without again at the same time tomorrow [noise]\nI make the chocolate party coming up today on point we're broadcasting from Philadelphia where we'll get top reporters views on what sure to be another event but we can do\nPlus Pennsylvania's adventures in redistricting will have a special report from the state's newly created congressional districts and what impact those races could have on the balance of power in Congress that's on point this morning from tend to\nNew and another point nine W.
