transportation ... sorry Donald Gordon medical center in Johannesburg a professor just explain the normal procedure is that if you have HIV you calm during the actual opens because the danger of infections of why but the rules waved in this dramatic case\nOkay so the rules that are the rules have changed a few years ago and I'm sitting in South Africa there was no law against using HIV positive organ but uh I don't think that was explicit in the law itself itself but what is it for happens or in the United states\nIs that are open tonight for HIV positive individual had been banned and I've been so two thousand and searching [noise]\nWhen I log of change some legal hook act\nAnd the hope back then and then the use of HIV positive open and this is really based on research that was done in South Africa by a colleague in Cape Town where because of the critical organs shortage and or\nThe lack of access to dialysis for HIV positive kidney failure patients they started using HIV positive deceased donors into HIV positive recipients was very good results off and do some results\nBasically means um they they don't pass on the condition or no they they already had it because those are HIV positive to reach out to HIV positive right so this is why this is quite dramatic what what was the urgency in in in this case why wasn't it possible to find a a a known\nA positive that

as a dreadful ethical tremendous motion of choice and I just imagine having to make that a ... ... ... is the case that usually a match with a mother is likely to be successful I mean what would that always being the best choice had the mother not being HIV positive\nAbsolutely our living like this year that would have already looking at a magic bullet but you couldn't use it because of this issue now please updates us it's a year since the ... was taken\nHow both doing both of doing brilliant in fact the mom has a completely recovered returned to work out of tune to the quality of life that

future you alluded to the fact that there was a horrendous lack of ... oil comes in South Africa does this make things easier\nThis stuff um it we've cautious in making that statement however uh that that could become the new reality when you can use this uh HIV positive organs or to the gym and living in a city into HIV negative recipients we do feel that this was going to open up therapeutic

what exactly is who and what did it come from some of my even argue that it's impossible to define\nThough I suspect that my three guests today we'll try to convince you otherwise joining me from the United states is Joe dinner scene a cultural historian a chilling University in New Orleans and the author of the origins of who in ... America\nIn Massachusetts is Claudia Springer professor of English and soon start is a ... State University who write James Dean kinda figured the many faces of rebel iconography and when the in the studio is the writer and Theresa Carol taller\nProfessor the Chelsea College of arts in London who started the concept of cruel and her two thousand and sixteen book the bus of cruel style narratives of the African diaspora welcome to all three of you have to start with I went to us each year in time if you could just pick one example\nOf who or what is the perfect example of cool for you personally and why Joe\nI don't like to choose an epitome of cool because of the concept changes every generation a little bit but since it started out as a set of strategies to defy racism I Will choose Mohammed Ali the heavyweight boxer\nAnd Ali although universally admired now a mostly white Americans hated Ali when he took them do some name and trash talk is a boxer\nSo he grew up watching musicians which was Miles Davis but he knew that call had to\nAnd so she didn't fight in the Vietnam War and he went to prison for three years at the prime of his career forefront in probably ten million dollars in their earnings\nAnd he famously said about Vietnam I'm not going to fight white people sending black people to fight yellow people to protect the country they stole from the red people so he was an activist even though Americans thought he was in fact sort of not keeping his place as an African American could yeah what about you\nI'm going to name two people prince and David Bali ... cool they had cool styles and they made cool music they were both somewhat mysterious and unknowable and they continue to define cool even after their deaths in twenty six team\nKind of a little bit about you I'm going to reference to people spending holiday and Mrs Gloria banned from Duncan students house Yorkshire and the reason why I've chosen to women from different parts of the world Billie Holiday of course there's the famous John ...\nMiles Davis said that he wanted it to be kind of music that people could actually listened to him follow an even home too so it was much cooler rather than hop music if you like\nAnd then he terms of his um style there was a way that he dressed and made use of Ivy League style\nAnd this meant um jacket and yes small jacket and tie and things like that he would\nBuy clothes from shops on university campuses in the United states whether it's bound with play so there's an um an album called amusing of miles and he's on the front cover there is no graphics [noise] so it's very unusual even Nineteen fifty five [noise]\nHe's in um says took a jacket beautiful pastel colored quite closely kept a no shit underneath the jacket [noise] there's no smiling he's talking directly into the camera for me he's saying I'm black that far I Am deal with it\nSo he's playing with this time he's saying this is a sort of preppy style or young white men you charge the expense of universities but on dressing like this\nIs kind of claiming it for himself ex athletes not just for one group it can be for me\nI'm like why was that his emphasis on style when the when this looking good visual pose what we're talking about public stick his hand but more generally in sexual terms I could you say something about your family or how this relates to use\nSo when they came over from Jamaica to England in the Nineteen fifties they were still British colonial subjects posed was important to them\nTo stretch decided visibility a sense of pride\nMaking a life for themselves in Britain despite over in spite of\nThe racism to pull up our system that was rising in Britain the Nineteen fifties the Nineteen sixties so there was this continuous actually if you like you have to present yourself the best way that you could but it was on their own terms in terms of how they wanted the will to see them\nUp to this point we defined coolest largely an African American concept something that was developed by just musicians as a result of being on the outside not belonging being the other but well John's was at the height of its popularity the idea of crew was manufacturing itself in other ways like for example on the silver screen\nSummer Nineteen forty one and cash buying one time on\n\nOn Jimmy Johnson all of pounds and all of them were on\nWalks in a mine [noise]\nHumphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine on duty Wilson asylum in Casablanca from Nineteen forty two directed by Michael countries including this was a new type of crude which ... the concept to the Hollywood movie audience with the new popularity of what was known as filmed walk how does filmed while relate to cool\nWell film water protagonists are disillusioned I'm cynical the owners who often get embroiled in criminal activities [noise] this type of terse on ruffled male character was influenced by a hard boiled detective fiction [noise]\nIn a shattering water world the male protagonists just out of step with mainstream culture and he's looking for alternatives he's a new kind of hero because he chooses to opt out and exist on the margins of society he's a world weary and and alienated\nAnd why do you think there's this idea these here as he's cool here is say resonated with the audience\n[noise] I think on the surface ah\nWas celebrating its victory over fascism in World War two there was an economic boom happening in this country following the war I'm On the surface there was a real sense of optimism and hope for the future\nSo for film the wire to a refused that to reject optimism was a resounding way of saying no to official culture and it did appeal to anybody who felt marginalized\nHuh uh there were many films that glorify the United states that were very cheerful and optimistic that film and who are was not this was a John or that was steeped in gloomy and cynicism and disillusionment\nAnd Joe you said that the hula peeled if this film law is linked to the post war popularity in front says ... says like oh but ... ... can you briefly explain why\nIn a way that is a wonderful historical concurrence a Albert ... who writes a book called the rebel a study of men and revolt in Nineteen fifty one\nAnd it is the first history or study of individual rebellion in the history of western philosophy and my favorite distillation in that book that is related to cool\nIt she says that I rebel therefore we exist\nAnd what he meant by that is if your rebellion is meaningful it must create the conditions for other people to rebel so Lester Young rebels and where's the shades and a slang and it encourages all these other jazz musicians to do it\nAnd the same is true with someone like Humphrey Bogart a Robert mentioned they establish a new way of masculine sort of toughness and acting and that provides a new model\nFor fighting society fighting more dominant self congratulatory as a quality said\nAmericans sort of patriotism and so it is not an accident that historically all of this happens at the same time there is an overwhelming need for a new definition of what a dignity for an individual person means in a global culture when the question is how do you matter\nWe need to hear about ... been talking about film we've been talking about this philosophical approach to cool that seems to much concurrently for different reasons and different sections of society and different countries the thing that strikes me is that all these icons of who seemed to be men where are the women can't women be cool to Cairo\nYes they can and I mentioned earlier Billie Holiday as em my example of the ... to me as to Billie Holiday was a jazz artists a jazz singer and she is being seen as a female Jayanti so this idea of where a woman\nInvasive maternity ... ... in all aspects of their lives and uses clues and the way they style themselves to help the articulation of identity and a ... that means for them\n[noise] okay so that's a a female who like hone in jazz today what about in film to a\nA N filming a wire women were often cooler than men and women refuse a docile and subservient role they pursue their own desires often ruthlessly\nAh they can be interpreted as part of the backlash against women who went to work and traditionally male factory jobs such as welding during World War two\nThe film the lifetime fatality is depicted as dangerous evil ... seen mostly in dark shadows at night which is what do you think about\nThis idea that maybe the weather that the icons of who seems to be mostly men\nOr if you're talking about jazz musicians are Fillmore actors this notion of being sort of a rebel loner the tough and stoic and stylish and brave and your art and style this was not really associated with women for quite awhile first time I saw a woman\nReferred to a school in a headline or as a description of her personality and charisma was actually a Kim Gordon who is a basis from the band sonic youth from the eighties or in the nineties and\nSince twenty Thirteen I see it applied regularly to the women are merged in the seventies and rock and roll Patti Smith\nDeborah Harry Chrissie Hi and and uh so I'm just saying that of course there've always been cool women but the term cool and never really been associate with them until recently the newest rebel persona I specially and use it for example are all women and so to some extent\nIf that concept is going to continue to be a vital concept it's going to have to be defined and read directed by women\nWell in a moment we will be taking a closer look at how cool developed and how that rebels spirit was taken out and buy later generations that's in part two of this for him from the b._b._c. while service straight off to the new summary\nOf the b._b._c.

struck a chord with young people\nTheir own unhappiness at growing up among hypocritical and narrow minded adults\nAnd this was during a time in the United states when being a non conformist was actually dangerous his was the period of the house committee on un American activities and the McCarthy hearings and the Senate people were persecuted for their views this was a time of extreme racism segregation persisted in the south\nI'm homophobia massage any were at extreme levels and young people who are chafing against all kinds of restrictions um identified wholeheartedly with James Dean and Marlon Brando\nLet's hear from the Nineteen fifty five so rebel without a cruise with James Dean as the archetype of teenager struggling with his parents\nWe give you love and affection don't lead full then what is it was it because we went to that party you know what kind of drunken brawl those kind of parties turn into starting place for kids\nTo go you said you didn't care if they drink\nHe said I Will\nTell\n\nYou you'll say why do they have another\nIdentify waited to have you know he takes asked\nJames Dean Jim Baucus I'm doren I'm Virginia ... in rebel without a cause from Nineteen fifty five directed by Nicholas re including this was a film that speak for an entire generation of young Americans as you said but there's also point here that these with the new teenagers very much opposed fulfillment\nYes in fact the word teenager was relatively new at the time or to some extent it was a luxury to be a teenager at a time when the economy was doing quite well and a young people didn't have to go to work and become just like their parents at a young age so they had a leisure time\nFor perhaps the first time in American history and uh they were also board\nUm this was a time of white flight from the city after World War two people moved to the suburbs um and there wasn't much to do their so you've\nHad this phenomenon of adolescence I'm at a loss for how to spend their time\nHaving the luxury of a rebellious attitude not wanting to be like their parents because they didn't have to\nAnd countless style that these films the fashion came to be seen as crucial to didn't as as well as the ...\nOf course yes and it gave license to teenagers across the will to make use of everyday objects to say something new something different about what it meant to be a teenager so the classic of course the the teacher to white T shirt nice everyday object which has started um\nAs part of the un nasal unit farming around Nineteen sir teen was seen on the body of Marlon Brando in streetcar named desire than warmed by James Dean\nIn rebel without a cause this dreaming white T shirt it's under a red jacket so some things so ordinary coupled with the a pair of jeans could say some things so radical\nOne of the other major figures from his parents we mustn't forget to embody thoughts rebels spirit was the thing I Elvis Presley\n\n[noise] Joe\nSo what did Elvis fits into this pantheon of coup\nElvis fits in in both directions first of all Elvis worship Marlon Brando and James Dean are actually in the movie could grill plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away and when he first ran to Marlon Brando commissary on the studio lot\nHe shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just your cans with Marlon Brando so that Elvis was a fan boy from Marlon Brando was kind of a shock looking back but the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white\nHe grew up in the deep south\nHe grew up with the rhythm and blues and gospel music\nAnd it is important to remember that Elvis his first hits were also hits on the black charts on the rhythm and blues ... he was doing something somewhat original with\nThe African American rhythm and blues tradition\nAnd so although he has often sort of seen as an appropriate or and you could say he is or is not but a lot of his African American beers at the time also enjoyed who's singing and his take on NASCAR contrition\nSo Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage and he is rock is an energetic he's in control of his performance\nBut he knows what he's doing any one said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience\nAnd then I Do it the next time so we have this real knowledge of how pop works\nThe impacts of people like James Dean into Elvis Presley on popular culture has of course being huge and it's transmitted is such an idea of crude across the globe but I Wonder what you will see how we really talking about American cultural imperialism here is that what cool is in the end Joe\nNo it's sometimes is a certain way it's the power of American culture but\nTen years ago there was a poll thirty thousand people on line of global poll and among the questions were what is the coolest nationality and to my great surprise it was American\nAnd the second question was why and this is the important part for cool the answer was because of the coolest people live there and the people they named where I ... we actually consider cool and so there's a real sort of unconscious\nOr understanding that cool is an essential concept in American culture and in self definition now I'm not by any means saying are apologizing that there is an American cultural imperialism about consumer products and about capitalism that is of course drew\nBut I think that there's both and there's a cool that's attributed capitalism and buying things that are associate with America and then there is that cool is a concept for self definition and rebel cool in America\nClose your was your if you\nWill the American concept of cool inspired young people around the world this is in part because American music in Hollywood films permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nBut cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant cross fertilization between cultures adolescence internationally creatively reinvent the rebel icon for their own purposes\nAnd for post colonial young people the rebels style could be used as signaled their dissatisfaction with the failed promises of of independence from colonialism unemployment poverty racism corrupt governments and oppression persistent both in the former colonies and then the former colonial powers\nThere's it found that to picked young post colonial rebels um the French found law hand from Nineteen Ninety five directed by much it costs the vets in which three young men from the ... the housing projects on the outskirts of Paris\nTry to figure out how to respond to police violence who bear is of African descent ... of Arab descent and Vince is Jewish\nOne of their friends has been shot by police during a protest\nAnd they adopt a cruel detached style to feel invincible to feel strong and they emulate what they've learned from pop culture but they discovered it doesn't protect them\nKind of what you think about this idea of coups cultural imperialism [noise]\nFor me not just about the kind of talking down if you like but it was that what flowed angel it being saying is that making use of those references to create something new and to say something new about their own experiences in particular a particular geographical space\nI since that's what we've been tracking throughout this program the way one star the coolest being taken by another generation and turned it into it saying I'm not as we've been hearing who hasn't remains static concept\nJob today everyone wants to be cruel and we're so things on the premise that that cool but it seems to run counter to the original rebellious spiritual detachment from the mainstream will conformity that we've been talking about so it was cool today there's\nConformity cool marketing cool and there's rebel cool\nAnd the marketing cool is the kind that people promote products and make it seem like you're a rebel if you have one or you'll be popular any of those things\nAnd then there's the grass roots rebel cool in which people and laid out adolescence choose icons that they admire that are rebels that they in a sense vicariously live through or lead them to their own path\nSo I Would say in terms of marketing cool cool is a rebel sensibility for consumer culture and that's ironic right so you don't want to conform so you pretend you're a rebel even though you're conforming but for me the rebel cool part the part that still vital and alive\nI Would define rebel cool simply dissuade cool is how we go she ate maternity in late adolescence two kinds of popular culture between like the age of Seventeen and twenty five and we're looking for self

fabricated by Democrats depress and said before he apologized to Mr Kevin ... for what he called the campaign of political and personal destruction against him\nNow we'll know much more now about Supreme Court justices of how they're appointed on how recently certainly at the appointments system has been intensely political does it have to be like this particularly at a time of increasing it

seemed and play that process did change after the cabinet controversy it did fire up Republican voters\nAnd so many people believe that the Senate very well could stay Republican there's no question this was a powerful political moment for both parties and I think the Trump is trying to keep that fire under Republican voters until we hit the mid term election right when\nIt comes to public perceptions of the Supreme Court which is hugely important part of the constitution the American way of life the accusations that the Democrats of of being fabricating this whole ... how how\nWell is

I Want to go to India for four months\nI'm going to give you this money because I Believe in ... when I get Michael on the joke [laughter] um you know she really trusted Maine it's my first ever experience of a woman helping another woman financially in terms of putting money what you'll belief is\nSo yeah started the full amount of money and run out of money means you a little time to mouth for the next seven years [laughter]\nPulling for you in Singapore how did you get yourself noticed in his saturated skin can market\nYou know when we first thought it very much like comedy and we only had a few thousand dollars to a name we did not come from a family where money was not a problem but that set a small company and a growing company\nI think we also there's always something we have to juggle we have to be smart we can never played a game like how the ... thing gamble Johnson and Johnson ... when we uh marketing I think the most important is a well what if all\nThe referrals that all this thing clients give to their friends the kind of testimonials Wendy share hey look this is a great visuals that I found this is a great part of amusing you must try this try EMS any thing that you say about yourself on line or off line\nI Would say that it was remembering in sub industry economic and he says maximum of ... eight to ten clients today you don't need to acquire a social media following up hundreds of thousands have a successful business\nIf he calculates the amount of ... hours you have a new month they might be two hundred so you need to do is find two hundred clients esteem twenty percent of them are going to be regulars and loyalty and cold like relationships with those\nPeople because when it comes to beauty the lifetime body of customer can run into the thousands I've been with my hairdresser for nine years I've been with my ... you know so it's not always about big numbers in influence marketing it's about\nSmall numbers but having higher quality relationships with your customers\nMaking that connection absolutely to introduce her making over the PC industry the Singaporeans ... are not pointing\nAnd Sharma dean read who founded one now and the beauty networking site beauty stack\nWhen you look at the ship and the dreams of the major beauty companies they still seem to be one maybe by men who need the other end of immigration you have women working within the industry who tend to be\nPaid quaint body the reserves you paid workers windy thing that is that women working these industries pizza badly\nI Do believe that some of the Asian titans like these conglomerates that come from Japan or Korea they are largely male dominated\nBut in fact I'm looking at the small medium enterprises in Singapore that have grown over the last twenty Thirty years were very good reputation many of them I started by women\nAnd women that are about my mom's age which is like fifty five fifty eight years old so they had been in this line for the last Thirty years\nSo I guess being into beauty industry in Singapore we are a little bit fortunate in that way where I Believe that there is a good mix of apologies for women to to be an entrepreneur and to shine and do well as well [noise]\nThe second part on whether or not women um lowly paid and why is that the situation being an industry we do know lightest industry late especially for the front line technicians who are the duty therapists all the front line retail stuff\nBecause in a bar to average no minimum wage but I strongly believe it is the choice of entrepreneur did business owner on how they want to start\nEmployees to be that crammed cram the best employees out there then you have to pay a little bit or not just a little bit or you have to pay above the\nAverage not just minimum wage above average and structure compensation system such that they know that they would be competitive for good luck not just in sales and service in technical expertise and we offer a career progression so they know that\nFor example I have got a girl with us as an ... assistant who now is running my entire kind relations operations team in the last five years she's been five years and that kind of progression would have been very very ... take on how much longer\nBecause they carry a progression says one of one way you do it I just want to ... ... in terms of the new business things like maternity leave and paternity leave we tend to be ... for women progressing within the curies how do you deal with that I Would\nDisagree with pulling statement that it's the choice of the entrepreneur or to remove the barrios the lowly wages NBC\nBecause when I said ... you know I didn't enjoy running the business in those early days is because I felt deeply uncomfortable with paying another go like eight pounds in Iowa it made me feel weird to do that because\nIt just didn't sit right with me oh this is where I disagree with the fact that it's the choices the entrepreneur\nBeauty is not seen as a essential pool a therapeutic all health giving surveys right\nSo because the market right for beauty is in finish treatment is low you can't pay higher wages because the economics of your business will not walk so using your nails done I'm too can full of a critic Niles full I've seen a credit announces low sixteen pounds right\nNow for sixteen pounds it takes about an hour so you're taking away the wage the overheads the costs of goods the cost of ...\nYou ... then pay a higher wage so when you doing you'll ...\nYou'll like how much can I pushed the treatment to pay my team a fair wage and then a wall\nWe charge fifty pounds were critics very expensive we have a salon in central London we use the best quality products I fell on is hygiene Nick on looks nice and his uh generally nice environment to be in\nBut because of all of this we don't make much sense of perfect because when choosing to pay\nOn now technicians violates the only reason I can make these choices because I've another business and other business prospects in other ways to make money but\nOn WB you are FM Boston homo Boston's largest radio news Rome now

H cute it's one of the few solid brick buildings in the slum looking out onto the view of his old neighborhood [noise]\nI grew up in Kibera\nWhich was a tough life they went through I Lived in provided\nI first gun violence was abused\nWe were very poor\nSo it was a really tough place\nKenny isn't exaggerating when he said it was tough I just ten years old he ran away from home\nBecause of it there's no food in the house for me they were very very poor what did you do at other somebody by guarding the from people and you go seldom receive a cop box somewhere we comment\nTypically pita and often bitten by the police had on the streets we I use the drugs I usually put truly um glue or the ... sort of like when they can be high sonic unforgettable [laughter] from my [noise] my pain\nBut then at age fourteen afterlife of poverty and petty crime everything changed after he was befriended by Catholic priests in the neighborhood he started going to school and reading books\nMight add up both Marcus Garvey about two missile Mandela Rosa Parks and they became my mentioned that I never met I used to talk to him oh the ...\nSo in two thousand and four Kenny created shelf go and they started pretty small actually as a football team but it grew and grew he married an American volunteer who came to work on the project which now includes a school for girls a youth mentoring scheme and health clinic and it was the clinic that inspired that focus on water\nWe used to just a little before we went up when you see in our clinic and we don't get caught up some people get ... guys what are we to someone at the committee had\nA suggestion and I'd be a kid like you know what was the opposite of fear edge and by the guy with the air [laughter] ... [laughter]\nI don't know where the topic will be clean no see which when it's lumping you see that what is ... and I'm like wow\nThis is a good idea if I did you just want somebody to queens it we just sat there and you're like wow and you let me think about it is let's get the pie in the end of it yeah\nSo what about the cartels by building these area waterways shelf though is moving into that's hurt trait in a big way and that's where the Kennedys experience in states us in Kibera comes into play it sounds like you've got an enemy the cartels yes are they trying to stop you\nWhere we the people who need it just doesn't like this I think you got them criticizing now have you had an interaction with them yes admitting that they started catching the pipes on Fox they started cutting you'll pipes yes so that was really terrible so what I did for several of them will be agree on I took my wife's or do you have to get\nTo be the ones that didn't want to you know a kiosk so I was an income that's how it with somebody then is ideally I also well by that is that some times that they found that what we don't have mostly on the weekends we don't do send water but that is that they have the water there\nThis is Kenny old I've or he has a run in with the cartels but instead of ending up in a battle he finds a way to negotiate his way out of the problem\nWith ... for two shootings and they said for Penn\nSo you will say it's clean and my oldest clean cheaper and cheap compared to what they must be worried about your expansion fence yeah so yeah so I I Will find a way to walk them rooting for the week without too you know the impact of the system so that's your what's your next [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] just listening\nTo Kenny how his life story the some makes me realize that he really is the key to this\nHere and we sell all was not program it's about the strong willed personalities you can make these solutions\nHappen and you can just hear that Kenny knows his world he's street smart he's slump smart if you'd like he knows how to operate the yeah I don't want to paint shelf though as a one man band you know Kennedy just up on his own doing this in Kibera\nIt's a large organization now that does not so different things they've got that Gulf school like I mentioned the health clinic football team is always and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife and for all that was that they do that very well rewarded he makes a salary of a hundred and forty thousand US dollars a year\nAnd his wife used to make the same I think it's now a bit less still a lot of money the ...\nYeah I put all of that ... they said the salaries in line with organizations of a similar size or everything's being signed off by the ... are paying for that you know quite significant amount of money ... they delivering at the moment\nWell they're bringing in a lot of money shelf though just wanted to ... million dollar prize from the Hilton foundation a hotel room yet the guys behind the hotels and that will help with older the what the shelf that does not just the ... but there are other projects to ... the only one son who are trying to solve this problem\nThere are lots of different people and open I say shouldn't thinking about how to live a wolf to into slums\nAnd just in Kibera a you know the ... so that they all said and I'm thinking one woman she's in Wonder Woman with ... she was a gladiator a few years back if you remember that yeah okay well she runs a foundation that are also dreading bull ... that pumping oil syrup right from the ... of Kibera\nBut that delivering it in Jerry cans on caught so they just ... up and passing it out so they got the walk through the same way by different methods of delivery yeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nBut it's several experts told me the cartels can still be involved with those processes may be the most will be held legally during the daytime than illegally at night so it's a complicated picture ... a lot of different players involved I decided to how to surf go into that\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this ... whole system might actually be quite limited because at the amount of water or you can produce this way\nAnd he said that ultimately the real solution was what with governments and private utility companies to convince them that you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure in the stomach itself so that means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes that Congress and\nPeople like short Cohen Kenya a bit more fleet to ... you know fast to doing things on the ground they know how it works yeah exactly and that is the whole point of ... their grassroots organization led by the parents spoke barons\nThey didn't want to hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with us from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental it's been but he said he had invisible Mentos\n... Rosa Parks this is how he said they influence the way he thought about trying to help people in Kibera\nMen and women who don't just sit down and watch when this was happening and what they did they organized people transform their own life they didn't sit down and which plants and that was that's a pick up the answer for that to be a year come together [noise] you know I\nThe way\nIt was\nThank you Sam for that just for you and thank you well tax listeners for well listening we hope you can she didn't again next week when will introduce you to another problem solver from another part of the planet [noise]\nAnd if you've suddenly realized wait a minute you know what problems over who should be on our radar sharing their debit on this program than do send us an email the address is as always world hacks at BBC coastal UK we love to hear your suggestions [noise]\nAlso do teach in our in our Facebook page called will will will posted video of Chinese aerial piping project and videos of course of all the other stories we do as well [noise] until then take care of him goodbye [noise]\n\n\nDistribution of BBC World service in the U.S has made possible by American public media with support from the three I O T\nAddressing the world's most challenging problems at the convergence of artificial intelligence I O T and elastic cloud computing more at the three I O T dot a high and progressive insurance protecting commercial vehicles and\nOffering specialized coverage is designed to protect small businesses for at progressive commercial dot com\nFrom Boston University this is not the point nine W.

I'm very much talking about the western European\nTradition and so what do I get sort of taken up in in America although interestingly there are more opportunities for women in what is a very new university system in say the nineteenth century so we do find for example\nMurray and it shows an astronomer he was able to teach a strong to be in the women's college so what was that in the U.S and they are in sort of mid to late to nineteenth century so you have a ... system\nAnd often novelty gifts brings a whim and I mean probably over and it's just sort of reforming wells and that includes the idea that women should be educated and have a more public voice perhaps\nSo we do find women there and the way that if we're thinking of the traditional university system in person you've got to look for the Cambridge in England and and women's struggling for very long time to be given places that I've seen\nThe thing that you said that when a field is new\nAnd it coincides with the development of women and an education then you do see more women entering those field I think I could like interesting that in when you look at the desk I think is on women in science for example the some of the countries that have the highest proportion of women in science are countries like Bolivia Venezuela\nThose confession whereas the the lowest ones are the Netherlands surprisingly enough I'd love\nTo know more about the ... and what kind of rolls and you know are we talking about private companies doing such or we talking about investing systems you know what is the kind of funding that goes into research with any investigation there's different countries so in some cases\nI suspect there may be longer focus some women being higher education and so on but in other cases it may be that it's a system that's not terribly well funded and whether a places that aren't very well funded or you know seeing if they particularly socially prestigious then you tend to find women finding an opportunity because men are nuts\nBe doing and certainly we find that in different scientific fields where a field is no full so they're a good examples in the ... century of geology or in the late ... century of astrophysics so and you kind of way of doing astronomy\nWomen over from being quite early pioneers in those areas because they haven't necessarily be competing they own\nFollowing the traditional education system they all competing with a lot of established individuals' usually male to publishing in those areas and some interesting late we sometimes find that that gives women an opportunity to lead off and just start to see that then push that so far a\nTypical an iconic ... computer programming which early on was very much seen as a female role we sort of such as you look for ... years old punch cards and things that were often seen as almost secretarial work and I'm In a very liberal at the time every year old so you know it wasn't necessarily well paid\nAnd often it was left women to do this work but when it was on such a ... to ... teaching was going to be we find that it stopped being paid more seems ... stitches and went into them being the load ugly shutdown that they feel rollout\nRebecca he get lecturing history of science at the University of Penn\nJust how much we can get Phil to that was brought home by city and the u._k. a few years ago they found that two thirds of the British public\nWas unable to name a single famous female scientist soap to end this program we've compiled views women working in stem subjects and asked them to name that stuff female scientist you'll hear new pig every time a name is mentioned [noise]\nMy name is\nReal my actual engineer and engineering hero is Emily ...\nHave to take charge of delivering the Brooklyn\nFather in law died in an accident on site\nWith me here the injured [noise] she makes me over\n[noise]\nMain concern is that how we look at the fire\nSafety nine town [noise] I should not need around him [noise]\n...

to use it as sort of questions they'd be coordinated if not we can end up in a situation where they would be many volunteers with good intentions but it could in actual fact Tampa rescue and recovery efforts\n[noise] that was a statement from the Indonesian authorities today so is this likely to be just a case of the Indonesian government trying to improve the efficiency of the disaster recovery

this as a as a possible trend imaging\nIt could well be a possible trend on one that we have to understand in the context of shifting\nRelationships between international NGOs and southern
