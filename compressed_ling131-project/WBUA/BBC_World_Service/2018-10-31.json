commission\nAnother example of the problem is is there is a question on the form that says are you in the United states citizen and there's lots of evidence that non citizens are illegally registering\nAnd voting because again that's not jak that's a problem and is the problem that many states you don't have to show any id to vote you simply walk into a polling place give them a name and you get to vote\nAnd you know what your opponents say about you they say that you are tearing up specter problem where there was really a problem how do you respond to that\nWhile I respond to that by citing an opinion from the United States Supreme court which is our highest court of law back in two thousand eight what the Supreme Court said is that the United states has a long unfortunate history of voter fraud it's been documented by historians and journalists\nAnd it could make the difference in a close election I don't think anybody disagrees that if you have a national election where the margin of victory as tens of millions of votes\nIt would take an awful lot of fraud to change that and us probably unlikely but we have many many elections in this country particularly at the state and local and city level and many of those elections are decided by just a handful of votes\nThe therapeutic in the southern states but not only in the southern states a long history of focus oppression and what your political opponents say is that the kind of measures that you're talking about victims unfortunate patting the focus oppression\nNo they don't that's their convenient a scapegoating of them in order to oppose them\nRequiring everyone to show an ID when they vote is no way going to suppress votes\nIn fact it's a bit patronizing I think and frankly borders on racist to believe that for example African Americans don't have the ability to get an ID the way white Americans do or Asian Americans\nThat many African Americans only spoke to in North Carolina took a different view especially since the state's voting little was ruled unconstitutional\nThe appeals court said it was written with discriminate street intent to impose cute the problems that did not exist and targeted African Americans with almost surgical precision tons if you could understand when African Americans might be skeptical\nOh I can understand why they would think that but it's not true the whole point of what the those who were suing said was this is going to a depressed turn out the number of African Americans voting will go down the exact opposite happened in fact a African American turnout was a record in the state\nAlready them and is a senior reporter for Mother Jones magazine and author of the book give us the pilot the mold and fight the voting rights in America you know to to convince the any of us\nI think it's a very small problem and one that has been exaggerated I think that you see\nCases here are cases there there might be a county ... county there where it's very problematic but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says three million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur and so I I think there\nHas been a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican side of the aisle who have exaggerated this threat for political purposes and have made it seem a much more widespread in superior than it actually is\nBut if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out ... you need to do something about it\nI think it's a very very very small problems and there are targeting solutions to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution a lot more people have been prevented from voting and fraudulent votes cast\nThat there are many many more people that are being blocked from the polls that have voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there was actually fraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that had been made by people like ... so the bigger problem\nIs that a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not to orange swayed from participating\nBecause of barriers that have been erected to the ballot box of what evidence do you have\nThat they actually do I think there's been a lot of studies there's been numerous studies that have found for example that\nVoter ID laws reduce voter turnout and that they reduced voter turnout most sharply among young voters first time voters and voters of color these are studies that have been done by academics in states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done nationally by government agencies and places like Kansas and\nTennessee I think if you look at the tent or Republicans have claimed many different occasions or that these laws have helped\nThem politically that helping carry key swing states like Wisconsin for example I and I I think it also just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access\nTo the process that your people that are going to participate\nBut also the last election in North Carolina the state board of elections did a careful review and\nThey found ... five hundred cases of people voting you shouldn't have that evidence of vote to froze I asked Ari\nIf you look at the case then from there weren't covered most of the time they were ex felons who didn't realize they were ineligible to know there are people that had already served their time and they were on probation or parole and they thought they were eligible to vote when they cast a ballot 'cause there was a very very steep price to pay I mean you're talking about potentially a facing\n... years in jail a steep fines all for one vote and most people would not do that if they knew what the penalties would be\n... didn't in the end face any further action about ten elements county twelve people were prosecuted\nAnd they soon became known as the elements twelve me had relatives was one of them and for this program the dark side to the American democracy here on BBC will service she agreed to make me she was setting up the ball in

September [noise]\nI'm Laura hunger investigative reporter with the Courier Journal I'm working on a story about babies who are born withdrawing from drugs [noise]\nMy name is dawn forums and I am and the innate holiday I take care of sick babies that are in the ICU um after they're born said to me you know I see you [noise]\nNewborn babies are not born addicted that is a common misnomer but addiction is a complex and complicated disease it has multiple facets to it so babies are not born addicted they're not drug babies their infants that\nWere exposed to a substance in utero that exposure if long enough lead to a dependency and because they became dependent on that stuff said once they are born and they no longer have that substance being provided they become at risk of going through withdrawal and what parts of um withdrawal symptoms debate\nSo babies have the same which all Simpsons as adult they have symptoms that affect their GI system so vomiting diarrhea\nExcessive volume off they have respiratory symptoms so they breathe fast they had difficulty breathing retractions and grunting and what we call it the kitten here which is just fast breathing\nThey also have temperature instability these kids tend to run hot but the categories that we worry about are the ones that are going to compromise their wellbeing those babies are in control of all and crying that is babies don't handle that\nYou and I can cry for hours and days and we'll be fine babies can't cry for hours because as they cry for hours they become physically exhausted and that leads them to actually start having symptoms of really being sick\nBabies typically when they're born sleep twenty plus hours but these little ones that go through withdrawal in part because of their distress in part because of their crime they sleep substantially less than that and in the absence of sleep any of us will get sick but babies that happens within hours today's instead of a week\nAnd what kind of trend have you seen 'em in the last few years um has it gone down up stay the same certainly\nAs I say I mean we know that nationally we know the numbers are significantly increase anyway we've had at seven hundred percent increase in such men's affected and sent in the past decade\nIn Kentucky or nationally nationally and at the trends in Kentucky are probably leading the pack\nHow old's your baby and she's one we go today\nShe had some problem she breathed than some of the fluid when she was coming out and she had flood on her lungs so she had to come up here to the NICU before she showed in the withdrawal symptoms and then when she was up here she did start to show symptoms [noise]\nShe said shy area off and on and um she as tremors which you know look like she's having cold chills

dart\nBoard it's a colorful room yellow and orange walls and uh the furniture is\nAll right so I think everybody's here I'm so we'll just kind of start by I'm walking a little bit about what we're doing my name is Laura hunger we have been covering the drug crisis in lieu of all for a long time\nAre sort of the major reporters covering it but we have actually have a team of four\nPeople led by the the Morgan over there who is the editor and we want to get students voices on the drunk crisis here [noise] so what have you learned in school about drugs drug prevention and addiction\nNot a lot of us it at all no nothing like nothing whatsoever no not really exist and\nYeah they're just they're just basically go over there like you know the drugs and you're just like don't do 'em like they don't really go into ... and do it they just tell you the basic stuff that you need to know [noise] like yeah like common sense to sleep\nLaw school I think they care more about other stuff than drugs they rather stopped the own stupid things like you all you had to just go on his round instead of whether you have something I mean\nIf people were all there are always the one to smell like we used to going and says well if you've got your shirt on sort of just don't want to go you\nKnow that you were\nThere when I'm unclear as long as people that are but I noticed smoke when the teachers are asking those the the little was questioned ah\nOh no\n[laughter] does is everybody knows someone who has been their lives have been impacted by drugs does anyone know anyone who's been in jail or who's overdose or who maybe can't hold our job or anything there has been through drug treatments raising him if he did was\nThat sounds like pretty much everybody\nI think that like sits it's kind of

I Would disagree with us for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context\nIf you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds that was a time with the birth rate in the states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today\nAnd that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely important part of population change in the United states and Europe if you look at later you're us\nThis was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communications\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skilled workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy\nThan the situation is quite different and it creates new class stratification\nThat entail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks\nWho come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you think about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe ... Saddam editor of the national review conservative magazine in the U. S. curbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of a classic American narrative that is at the Pentagon is immigrant who arrives to seek a new life and through hard work determination goes on to purchase them thrive\nSo would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration all through the United states is often described as homes the largest immigrant population in the world it's a question I put to at least a chump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nIf you look at the history of integration and how immigrants who've been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war\nPrior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was a racial citizenship and immigration grants were welcome to that is white people were welcomed there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship and there was in fact the importation of a huge non white working class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here\nWho did the manual labor the agricultural labor\nBut they were not eligible for citizenship\nAnd they were not considered immigrants so when we see this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narratives and it's connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens and people of color are workers to be exploited\nAnd not eligible to citizenship now after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship\nCitizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized and the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship\nAnd they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nIt's a very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white immigrants it's a dream that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream in the midst of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the Nineteen twenty of centuries\nHave applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen ... early twentieth century of large European integration where this suppose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa now people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states as a country of opportunity\nThe American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today\nIt is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color the immigrants who are coming into the country today it's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology\nFall into that category the majority of immigrants or poor low educational levels and they are feeling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them but there's not upward mobility shutdown\nAberdeen period in American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African or a Latin American immigrant with the same as as for European\nNo there have even more recent that doesn't mean that there has never been Asian or Latin American or African immigrants who have succeeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it that typically those populations have been permanently marginal and\nClear that you're on a different and the political spectrum to ... the editor of the national review the head from the other what'd you make of his argument\nThat in order to safeguard democracy in America at the moment to allow the current population to adapt to change it calling me ... needed is a cook on immigration because what is happening is that the economy in America is changing to one that's founded on knowledge on stem subjects rather than a Monday factory\nWell that Dan knowledge economy requires a huge service economy to service it who is cleaning the house is taking care of the children making the food growing the food for the wealthy people in the service economy it's poor people

I Believe they will just shared with no even that\nWith the British prime minister and also the American government says which you are about ...\nYeah just one final thought I mean how much support is that going to be for wider European sanctions given a for example the nuclear deal and the dangers that ... those signs posted on exactly that they say that that's also\nA discussion see why is it that the Iranians risk this at this point you would've thought that there'll be more interested in coming down the European countries to continue\nThat these these arrangements but it's impossible to say why they decided to do just as as possible as we were about Saudi Arabia or the other week you don't always know how things were in these ... countries but to do this time is to be very weird but when you you\nWould support additional sanctions which you\nYeah well if if if if necessary is of course that's where the government do but I think that what the most important is that the Danish government receives an apology from Iran\n[noise] so the next person charity or foreign policy committee of the Danish parliament on those allegations of an Iranian prophet on the Danish song you're listening to music from the BBC well ... stay with us we got a lot more coming up in the next half hour of the ...
