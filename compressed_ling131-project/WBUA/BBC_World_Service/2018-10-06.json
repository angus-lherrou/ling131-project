I Would call them digital bread crumbs but also some physical evidence that would then\nAh basically lead to what happened yesterday and I have to say like you know like the a nice as spies with call in April and the only had about a a decent yesterday so it shows you know that there's a lot of ah coordination between these governments going on behind the scenes that we don't know about Patricia\nI'm just on a purely practical levels um\nIt seems to me that there there it is a kind of terrorism and what it is it seems to be doing is seeping into our everyday lives in the sense that we don't know if I smoke on our on through the been infiltrated we've seen really what looked like clumsy attempts that that have been really quite effective and\nTo me what on setting is a story of it's interesting to me that the the narrative of Russia seems to be almost more powerful than Russia itself I mean\nIs there activity about building a kind of virtual Russia in people's minds\nYou think well I think of course like you know I ... in a way what happened yesterday wasn't about us and by the same time if you look at it from the Russians perspective\nHaving all these governments coming together right and accusing Russia that also puts Russia and then and their way and a good place like you know that managed to get together all these governments and to have all these like press conferences ago across the good old I guess obviously like that does put them in a good place by\nThe end of the day or you know when you are or you know ... ... ...\nYou know ... you know several times and then it's kind of a you know like with what we saw yesterday was that can help to them and they were kind of like put things into perspective and probably you know what they've been trying so eager to lead to prove that they're so great at these kind of like starts in people's minds actually you're not that great\n... I mean you you use the word embarrassed to ... when you look at the main figures in the Kremlin when you look for ... for example he doesn't look very embarrassed\nYeah well that's obviously not very surprising right like you know whether I Would never harm\nTo seems there may be people looking at ...\nI'm sure they didn't receive then use our I'd happy faces I'm sure that was like something that caused a you know international backing especially that you are you know when you try to\nCalled NSM at that as a temp that's not really a great day for you [noise]\nAh but that's also like you know obviously like that the Russian an additive old ways you know whenever that cause I never there's an accusation is oldest denial it's always like you know\nOr they look at the uh the investigation they always say there's no blue ... over you see although we did see you know the ... pictures and all of these things so that's that's not really surprising thing\nBecause you would not just as soon as I said I Do find it um punished that it it it just creeping into everyday life and the things that you think we could practically due to to to push back not necessarily finding things but within how we live our lives that allows to push back against this than\nI think that's a very good question and I think you know one of the things that we could do as citizens and our daily life is back to something we call digital and hygiene\nSo very small things such as like you know a a changing your passwords often backing up your data being lifted the kind of like vigilant and care for of how you deal with your uh online life like the same way that you did with you know for example the safety of your house right he wouldn't leave your ... open\nAnd I expect that you know you are safe so kind of like back this nice minimal things\nThat would I mean there has been some studies saying that if like people collectively like you know kind of ended up getting back to this um adage that hygiene you could limit up to eighty percent of the size of the crimes and then the focus would be on the more complex the geopolitical levels that require like the sophisticated level of sophistication\nAnd all that geopolitical level do you see any sort of any move towards some sort of regulation of cyberspace\nYes while a that's a very good point I think you know what happened yesterday should be put in the context of what's going on at the international level so late to this this month Russia is planning on submitting Jude Joffe does it use and\nDo the U.N General assembly a one on basically imposing code of conduct for how states should behave with a to get a you know each other and decide to space but also one or two I suggest thing and you cybercrime convention due to place one that has been on 'em and demanded by the concept of Europe\nSo obviously there's a lot going on on the international scene that has not been linked in the media to what happened yesterday\nAnd I think um so the Russian activity and like you know they wanted to supplement the but also they want to come to the negotiating table from the position of power\nAnd that has actually been said by as senior advisor to president but then saying that they ought to paying something in the information every now that would lead them speak to the Americans as equals so you've got that on on one hand and also the western states obviously they're trying to push back against these out his religious so they wanted to kind of\nShow what the Russians are really doing and then try and get the countries you know that are no you know or Russia or China or like with the west the states that are in the middle of the un formally undecided kind of like you know do as their side so you could easily argue that point\nThank you very much for the company they were to attack May of ... house you're listening to the b._b._c.

called betraying big brother the feminist awakening in China and she's joining us you know do you do in Bristol in West in England at least welcome good morning\nGood morning thank you so much for having me\nDescribed the feminist five ... a bit more about the\nShore um well in twenty Fifteen there were a number of feminist activists I'm In several different cities in China who wanted to celebrate International Women's day by handing out anti sexual harassment stickers\nAt subways and bus stations but before they were even able to to carry out that activity\nThe Chinese police carried out a really sweeping around at a rest in multiple cities um arrested feminist activists and they ended up focusing on five young women in three different cities\nUm and brought the five women to Beijing where they put them in detention in the same detention center\nI'm and held them there for thirty seven days and and the jailing actually productive at an enormous global outcry I'm an at which created this global diplomatic pressure I I'm ... ... so the government made the unprecedented move of releasing the women\nIt was on President wasn't as you can ... the unexpected\nYes because the women look like they were on course to being criminally prosecuted and facing a jail term of five years or even more um but but the jailing of these women just angered so many people inside and outside China and it it ended up galvanizing the feminist community and in China in particular\nA much more broadly defined really are the ones who made headlines for the reasons you just described how much would they be representing the day to day lives of Chinese women [noise]\nWell this is the thing first of all um these are just five women and they were almost randomly selected by the authorities to send a message to other young women who are increasingly attracted by the cause of women's rights and feminism\nUm but actually the feminist community was even at that time much larger\nAnd um ever since the jailing of these five young women more and more young women in China has been drawn to the movement and it has just been growing 'em in momentum and continues to grow today\nLiterally to bring my guest and have a would do as well I'm Emma may be a question to lead to\nLose I lose it and I wonder if that is going today I mean how how can we see this in China now what is the effect of me to kind of on the ground\n[noise] yeah well I mean it's so interesting because originally when made two went viral globally I thought that that it can't take off to that extent in China because there's so many obstacles\nThere is very very heavy Internet censorship there is no press freedom so unlike in the U.S where\nOn the news about Harvey Weinstein in you know sexually abusing all these famous Hollywood actresses that was broken by news organizations but there is on the news organizations in China are basically now propaganda outlets they're not allowed to do this kind of reporting for the most part\nUm and then then finally there is no independent judiciary so any victims of sexual abuse and China have virtually no recourse and yet made to has really taken off in spite of all of the obstacles\nAnd and today you still see young women emerging all across China\nUm across sectors even across class coming out with their accusations their personal stories of sexual abuse\nFor me to post to being censored him on\nWell they a lot of them have been censored but it's not a blanket censorship on on the made to hash tax so\nThere are definitely stories that are getting through 'em and and also the feminist activists themselves are very creative and imaginative about finding new ways to get around the censorship\nOn for example one young feminists when when uh me to hash tag was being censored um really aggressively one activists came up with the idea of using him oh jeeze\nSounds like me too and Chinese so she used a rice and Bonnie emerging made to\nTo get around and and at at work for a while but then the number then it'll get it right Patricia\nI'm I just wondered whether this movement to begin to manage it by the fact that I'm trying to start some Chinese farmers have changed so much with this with one child policy and that because there were probably fewer women but in more than ... than that then they might have been a generation of whether this had played into it is it's all\nWell I think it may it it's really hard to tell it at this point if there's any direct correlation it may have played a role because there have been studies that show that um when there's only one child and that the child has a daughter\nThat she doesn't have to compete with her brother for parental investment\nAnd so she may be better educated than she would have otherwise been had she had a brother or more\nBrothers why do you think we all ... apparently suit troubled by these semi when you look at communist ideology that doesn't necessarily say to you that you should be what region of the women campaigning for equality or does it\nKnow of course not and this is why the jailing of these young feminists and twenty Fifteen provide such outrage because the Chinese government itself was founded on the principle of gender equality and it's written into the constitution of the People's Republic of China\nAnd in the early communist era of course one of the mouths of domes famous sayings is got women hold up half the sky so that was what the Chinese people were taught\nAnd ... the first several decades in the in the fifties sixties and seventies um and women were assigned jobs and they were a there was a lot more a gender parity in terms of pay well everybody was poor but\nBut there wasn't just a huge and growing gender gap which really began with the onset of market reforms in China\nUm but but we're we're the onset of market reforms it means that the gender discrimination against women has has grown and financially and that's one of the grievances that the main grave and said these young feminists\nThank you very much for coming on a letter home Fincher just started me to say thank you very much to

[noise] [noise] [noise] but on the road on for your windows or look at the ... and so to an empty the which is very lonely\nThank you for doing how typical would you say is that of OJ or the bicycle or what do you think learning a feels like\nFeels like it I did I\nLeave you know he had well we're in today what they think the opposite of letting in is is that what would you say\nEverybody saying this happened is I've been is the opposite of learned their lessons happiness\nJak king you're listening to house check from the BBC with me totally a Hammons today we're discussing the results of all study the b._b._c. lending us experiment and professor of mine way liberate to one of the team he's been analyzing the data is with me\nNow we've jak these he seems to be spending so much time on his own but I was interested to see that in a study not everyone thinks that loneliness is about being on your own today no no\nWe had a sort of participants believing deadline and this is about being on your own but all the rest associated with very different things\nAnd I'm surprised to see the full ... percent of the people who responded\nTold us they think that letting us can sometimes be positive not seem surprising when it's such an unpleasant feeling\nHere so this is a little bit like a social first I'd say so when you very very Thursday it's not pleasant of course but it's there for a reason it's there to tell you you need to drink your body is is aching for that drink\nAnd you do it and it's gone I'm learning that says a little bit like that in the sense that yes it is painful and it has to be painful so that you pay attention to what's happening in what's lacking\nBut as long as you respond to it by re directing your attention to others and to your social connections it should go away and it should be fine um so it's not necessarily negative and in fact it can sometimes be positive because it it leads to an anticipation of social connection for example\nBut of course where it goes wrong is where either you don't pay attention to those signs or your cons because for example like jak as we heard just now you you have no ... no sufficient for the Latino sufficient resources to actually be able to connect to others\nNow this was a label study and people from all over the well chose to take part did you find that people everywhere experience learning is\nWell the short answer is yes we did find on in us in every country and in every age group all over the world\nIn terms of age we can also say that the H trend that we spoke about earlier was the same in every country the only minor differences was that in some countries the slope was steeper so there was a bigger reduction in in in us a\nAcross the lifespan than in others but the trend is always they are but we also found that culture can make a difference\nNow there were nine countries where we had enough people taking part to make some comparisons\nAnd levels of loneliness were almost the same and the u._k. to us from India I was interested to see slightly lower levels in New Zealand now this isn't a representative sample of calls but I wanted to know whether this made any sense to talk to my taste Lucas and from the university who hails from New Zealand as thought his mental health and young people\nThis isn't the first time that um this is being high losses since excuse healing talked about the proportion of people that we're experiencing loneliness\nAll the time most of the time and it was around treat the scenes and then you see a launch population by some New Zealand quality of life we buy and that computers to a previous see if I Am from the u._k. was about six percent of people so it's interesting that the research now is reinforcing this passion again\nI'm why do you think that that might be slightly lower levels of flooding us and use it and because they don't say there isn't any it's just the levels are a bit law\nI have a few theories one might be around the composition of the coaches and New Zealand for about a food of people come from ... um cultures\nIn particular motor coaches that the indigenous population in New Zealand and I think that it's the positive influence perhaps of of the ... was coaches on the majority and use the European culture\nUm in terms of conviction and the portions of of working together and support each other another is is maybe around uh the proportion of one person households UC ... has a slightly lower right to that than the ... ...\nAbilities that John groups such as sports participation which is the only doing well and and maybe it's the climate most of the population will be napping with on and which means that they aren't really hip extremes and temperatures so these are going to be warmer summers and mild winters in most people close to the coast so they could be some sort of relationship around\nBeing out and about and engaging with the beach and spending time outdoors which is more difficult in countries when they were going to be quite harsh winters\nOr way they are really hot summers periods where it's difficult to be outside because his extremes and the temperature\nOn the march explained the connections that people can create more easily\nCaught instinctive study looking perhaps comparing the north and south fought on gymnasium because of course and then also you can go oranges and lemons and and you know that the climate spokeswoman than it is in the south on onset be interesting to see if there was a difference when it came to letting us\nYeah yeah and also in terms of rule communities and but then I think the rural communities and in Britain and elsewhere in the world will save the ... the ... convictions and closeness with neighbors\nIn the research when we've looked at people living in\nGenerally independent couches wet people are more reliant on themselves and proud of being with aunts on themselves compared with the interdependent cultures within a more collective as to people rely more on family and friends one\nOf the things we found is that um people in the independent cultures value that romantic\nRelationship small they make more of a difference whether they failed ... than they do in the ants dependent cultures where people may have family in a white family to rely on as well or not is just one person that we might do it I was wondering what you would see in in New Zealand that what what would you how is they marry ...\nModi coaches can exist in terms of how it would be structured in terms of ... which is ... ... the biggest social group right down to find out which is the extended family units and people will have the connections obviously with the what a family but also with the ... with the ...\nI'm also with the place so even if

year\nThat's the death that you don't trading goods and he wants to get it down or preferably eliminated\nThe trouble is that most economists don't think that trade balances whether a country has set up as well deficit all determined by trade policy most will tell you it's about spending and saving a country which spends most of it and we'll have a deficit\nThere is something else that President Trump is doing that he doesn't appear to think is linked to trade policy tax cuts\nIn fact one way of country can spend more and save less is the government has a deficit in his own finances now the economic relationships are very complex but it's certainly possible that lower taxes and increased government pouring could mean a bigger trade deficit\nIt would be very premature to come to any conclusions about whether Donald Trump has been good or bad for the U.S trade deficit and there is another debate to be had about whether the deficit masses very much into\nWhat we can cite is that it's bigger than when he took office that is what the data shows that could only aggravate his view of the U.S as a victim of bad trade deals and by trading behavior so we can expect to see a lot more
