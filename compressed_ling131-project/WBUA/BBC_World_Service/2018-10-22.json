R.\nUsing frontier economics or the guy that gets stolen graduate schools\nThey have a using stuff that vaguely remembered from the undergraduate days yeah so the economics or the searches that rather better than the economy of the eighties nineties in the early successes\nThe financial crisis highlighted the extent to which what was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen did you call them was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy students were with a mismatch between what they were learning and close ... there was seeing on the news as those banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nAll watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there were similar a sense of students thing very complex and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics Tom says a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis and Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas\nAnd one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which has seemed to weigh a financial crisis was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become\nWindy calling is the most widely used university textbooks in retrospect she admits these books ... subjects that we usually important in terms of understanding the crush things as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had to spend a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks which we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy side or the one published in\nTwo thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system and this it was very typical of the way on that correct comics is taught in universities around the world\nAnd has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think that was true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics class rooms remember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we all depend if they get bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration filled by students and the teachers around the world\nHas given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these windy and many others of building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionate about and so I have to put my own hand up yeah I ... the court charity\n\nBut will it different curriculum being [noise]\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper calls the tune bankers and politicians found it convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's models allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\n... and the comics professor at Stanford University in the U.S she's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what people want to hear well turning a blind eye to the bond who even criminal behavior by bank because that can threaten them financial stability\nThere is definitely a problem it is a very very shocking they remain really fantastic early in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end ignoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding sentences and all that deception and fraud and all the excessive\nEndangerment sets in tire early unnecessary it's just taken as a given it's just what they accept the system\nAnd does she think this has changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is more about you know very shockingly you know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big oil and crisis just wakes you up because you notice it\nAnd then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did\nMy best can we prevent it stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance record numbers on the ... unrealistic notion that democracy is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the wind belief that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of might say conservative economics seems Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood\nThat wasn't true I think it'd be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices\nBut somehow in the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives I'd miss used his ideas even more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work in the seventies and eighties\nAdvances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will have often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of an invisible hand and supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys and sells things in their self\nGovernment intervention everyone will be better off just Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by them to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple ... just that somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOf theirs didn't the fact is that the people who wanted to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes at in Dr needed their students\nThe markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\n\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the heart of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were signs only works\nIf you imagine all humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to the economy can be counted journalist Katrin muscles book who cooked Smith dinner argues the traditional economic\nTheories and methods only makes sense if you imagined humanity be self centered\nSo unlike humans is almost a different species in fact\nSome economists have given the species name Homer economic us\nHome economic it doesn't have any feelings at least they failings and not relevant to his economic decision making he's that sort of rational big calculating brain that is always acting additive south in chest\nAnd all of a set of characteristics or characteristics that we have been told to view as a male\nAnd even more of it is sort of all the characteristics that economics guys to great lengths trying to excluded from these models like\nEmotions family the faulty feelings compassion and altruism and all of the things that we have been told that these are not economic event event and not anything that we need to studying economics days like ... to the same things that we have been torched view as female and there'll be the after the Chrysler people were saying\nThis greed is good philosophy and this very\nNarrow idea of what human beings are not

World Service my guests today has become one of the world's leading public intellectuals suits focused much of his attention on identity how we humans see ourselves and others through the complex presumes of race gender religion class and nationality\nFor Kwame Anthony Appiah the drive to dig deep into such questions comes from a very personal place\nHe is the child of a so called mixed marriage his father was a lawyer and well connected politician in pre independence gone to\nHis mother was an English woman of Eris the classic stall Kwame Anthony Appiah was a gifted student who went to Cambridge University and became a professor of philosophy on law at New York University He is a gay man who's married to his partner of more than two decades\nSo his own life is a fascinating example of how complex and multi lead our sense of self can be\nAnd yet the way we humans define ourselves and define others often tends to be focused on division we use race religion and the class to separate us from then increasingly in this young century the politics of identity seems to be fueling conflict and hate\nSo is there an end to this preoccupation with group I'm tribe\nWell Kwame Anthony Appiah joins me now\nWelcome to talk physically there you have spent a great deal of your recent professional life thinking about identity and how each and every one of us labels ourselves so let's start with a simple question how do you label yourself\nA little bit on who I'm Talking to a taxi drivers are usually I explain that I'm half a gun and enough British by origin and that I live in the United states that's the I gives me three countries to talk about in terms of some sort of national origin\nTo you when you describe where you're from and and the sort of ... identity although ... are you thinking that you're sending signals to your interlocutor about about who you are\nYes I think I'm sending signals I think that sort of as it were weak signals some faraway planet or something because because they don't tell you as much as I think many people assume\nUh they they will so I I grew up in Guyana and my father was going to end but that doesn't tell you very much about how interested I Am and gun or it doesn't tell you how much I Know that got us as I Am ... years and so on many people that would be more informative to know what the nationalities you know if if ah\nBut I end up pretty quickly in a conversation I think you move on the the stereotypes into into more detail and then it doesn't matter so much that it's not all that helpful\nWould it be too simplistic to say that in in all of your work on race religion will create as you put it on gender and all the different ways that we can identify\nOurselves into identify ourselves and others your conclusion is that frankly we're all so complex and so unique that almost any label we apply is in some way or rather misleading\nThink that's right if you take all the big labels that you know the race religion nationality I'm even toss\nIn all of those there's so much diversity within them so you know men are also ... met another all the same man is very different from one another women are very different from one another or people in Britain a different from one another people in London a different from one another and a million ways\nSo that being held at somebody to London of them actually give you a huge grip on or anything a very important about them which doesn't mean that there are moments when ... isn't hugely important that people\n... so you ... I mean this isn't just about Donald Trump won Glenn other look at the populism and nativism in Europe where they are very low income Matthias L Vietnam I interviewed on TALK recently initially a new political Victor Oh about an hour you can look at a whole host of\nFrankly you could look beyond the shows have Europe to to India where the current government uses nationalist and polarizing cultural messages\nIt does so but the point you alluded to earlier you ultimately are not ... I Believe that the trajectory of the human condition is in ... in that pulled into ... toward a more universal list a more humane understanding compassionate\nSquare that with what you see well uh\nI I guess because I'm looking at it over a longer horizon than just\nFive or ten years old penalty as I'm thinking about how much things have improved in these respect or in many ways over the last century I'll say for example\nThink about the massive improvement in the condition of waiting thousand people in many many countries over the last century and look at the massive reduction in a racial or discrimination in the law in the United states over the last hundred years look at the edge of\nThe increasing coming together of Europe at the same at the moment of these moments of nationalism and putting Brexit one side which one has to do um Europe is way more unified in the United uh than it was in the in the nineteenth century\nSo uh or even in the mid ... century so I think older they say if you look over a long enough horizon you can see the general tendency is in the direction that I Would regard as up\nOne area where I can see that you would find solace would be in the way in which certainly in the western world\nSocieties and cultures view a gender issue has been particular sexuality I mean your your uh uh a known for very long time in out gay man you took advantage of America's change of the law so that you could marry or long term partner\nHow far can we go\nWith the notion that human beings are now free to choose their identities in ways we never even thought for not just in terms of\nOf sexuality but even in terms of of basic gender where now there is a a very powerful movement to to change the way the binary way we see men and women are a lot of people who find themselves ... binary there are others who are transgender ring and society slowly appears to be moving\nTo to accept them in New ways where does this end\nWell I don't think he ends the ... there are two things at the airport but where it doesn't it doesn't then with the disappearance of identity we are reforming object assisted by not getting rid of gender altogether I ... I can ... I Believe that I live along all into the remote future\nWe'll still have ... it'll be more complicated than the old simple binary system but there will be men and women and some people in between\nNow and there's the question is where the self\nIdentity and because the interestingly I I'm I'm blushing between different spheres but but I I'm mindful on how to not so long ago we spoke to a woman called ritual dollars ... who is white parents age but identified them indeed became an activist on behalf of the black community and ... and\nLived a life as a black woman though when she was challenged about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\n... being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black\nWell I think she's a very good case to think about because you ask what's the relationship between self ... and and another I think you have to think of these things as a matter of a negotiation you count simply declare the meaning of the euro and race all on the air and races a special category you need to\nSee if you if you don't like where it's put you you need to persuade the well to change that is what trans people have done\nThe trans people have done what Rachel Dolezal didn't do\nWhich is they've created a movement to allow them to be what they want to be in our system they've asked us to change the system have I'm happy to respond affirmatively to that request and change the system I don't think it has any harm to me to buy masculinity\nTo adapt system in that way and even if it did a little bit of how do I am asking them the I'd be happy because it's obviously very important to them\nIf racial do they'll have could have provided a could've made these arguments and decided to people in the gum the thing and if you could have done it in a way of a little bit more straightforward because what she was actually doing she knew involved\nConcealing something that other people thought was important that she didn't think it was important and that's an interesting fact about that\nBut unfortunately a black in America doesn't belong to her and so the only way can be changed in the direction that she wants and I'm just I'm willing to listen to her arguments visiting it that way\nIs if she makes the arguments creates the movement and she can't do that on our energy has to do with other people have to persuade other people\nIn this interview and indeed in some of your writings you'd have been very consistent saying it's not my job to fix the society is simply to understand then explain how societies work to my fellow citizens now I I get that\nBut do you have ideas which you can share with me as as as to how to overcome the lies that currently under paying our identity\nWell I think the most important thing for us to overcome and to the extent that getting rid of the lies helps I'm In favor of that is is the the moments when identity is lead\nDivision that's the thing the ones that can fall so that I think some things can be said or but these are the things that are known to social psychologist one is don't close yourself off people\nWho live with people of diverse identities tend to be less than people did that and said don't allow yourself to be channeled off\nInto a world in which you only are among white people only among Catholics certainly among 'em\nStraight people and so on open your eyes open your social experience do people have all the major kinds\nAnd do things with them that are not about race or religion\nOr or sexuality but there are about soccer or about to go to the movies are about a in a building something in the community together what's together with\nPeople because I think working together with people of diverse identities makes the identity is less dangerous and then frankly if you have
