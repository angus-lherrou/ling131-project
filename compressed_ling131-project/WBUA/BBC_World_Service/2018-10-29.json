[noise]\nBegin this half hour and ... and the crush of a line air plane carrying more than a hundred and eighty people playing disappeared into the sea shortly after taking off from the Indonesian capital Jakarta and a search and rescue effort is now under way up in speaking to our correspondent ...\nIn the last hour and a half or so vessels that the Indonesian search and rescue agency owns have reached the area where officials believe the plane had crashed into those waters off the coast of cut out one which is not too far away from Indonesia's capital city Jakarta where the plane originally took off from\nWhat are the search and rescue agency which is responsible for these sorts of operations in Indonesia what they've been able to say is currently they believe they've found debris from the aircraft as well as possessions that they believe belonged to those on board but at this point they still haven't found any survivors\nThey both are sent helicopters to scour the seas in the nearby areas to look for any people\nAnd charisma I understand that the crew had asked to return to base shortly before the crash are the rescue officials or any officials and Indonesia reading anything into this as to the cause of the crash\nWell it's kind of what they do say that they can confound the cause of the crash until they find the flight data recorder and obviously that's also something that they're looking for what officials have said is that they believe that the plane crash some thirty to forty meet us into\nThe sea so they're looking for any remnants of the airplane one aviation analyst told me earlier today\nThat from the flight data that he's analyzed so no official confirmation of this analysis I have to add them and what he's been able\nTo analyze he says that the plane was traveling at a very very high speed when it made him packed\nWith the water it's not clear what that would have done to the condition of the airplane but he also added that from the flight data that he analyzed the plane looked like it was in trouble from the very beginning he said that it had struggled to find some sort of\nLevel balance from the point that it took off now\nThose reports that you were talking about the pilot had asked to turn around soon after takeoff that's being reported in the local media we don't have any official confirmation of that yet all officials have said though is that they will continue to look for that flight data recorder which hopefully will reveal more information about why this happened\nEncouragement give us an idea when do we know about line air and there are safety records will\nAir is Indonesia's biggest budget and line it's the airline that you would typically take to travel from one part of the archipelago\nTo the other it has hundreds of flights every single day but it also has had a very patchy safety record I think it would be fair to say I was in Indonesia a few years ago covering the crash of ally an air flight\nWhich crashed in Bali luckily for everybody on board miraculously in fact there were no casualties from that particular incident but\nThe safety record of this airline has certainly been spotty to say the least over the last several years however aviation analyst have also said to me that\nLion has taken safety most seriously over the last few years and has invested in safety procedures and that's been a statement that come in from the company itself saying that they are working in full cooperation with the Indonesian authorities to find\nAs a congressman she doing Thirty years she wasn't within the elite of the president parliament's you was someone they always held strong views sometimes controversial view and he had his a group of loyal voters or only enough to elect him congressman\nAnd doing Thirty years she remain like this to the point that when we had this car wash up or we should basically where two week a great part of the political establishment he was one of the most vocal voice against the workers' party that was touched by ...\nAnd this hour of someone that's who represents a something new\nSo do you think the vote for him was that he has voted for Mr both an hour or was the vote against the leftist workers' party\nI think it's partially a vote for ... above anything else they vote of rejection towards the workers' party and he was the candidate stepped in ... the most and in the most efficient manner does rejection towards the workers' party\nThere are also many concerns that some people have for example he expressed admiration for the dictatorship his comments against the algae V. T. Q. community who made racist comments about slave descendants why his presidency going to lose and with all of these coming from concerns that people have\nOkay I think that all those concerns are valid these were appalling remarks probably from an individual who never thought that he would reach where he ... I Believe that the president institutions and the president political environment is strong enough to avoid and to prevent\nThat ideas like this are transformed into public policies and I'll do these remarks are are terrible I Believe that's hardly they can represent anything practical in terms of a presidency because of the strengths of their president legislative and judiciary system\n[noise] now those who voted for him but as a vote against the workers' party justify that a single the we want a better economy from Brazil and he's our best option for that well\nHe gained a lot of strength and supports particularly with the president market when he chose total gadgets to be his ministry of finance oh look at it as an economist that is very respected in Brazil and he's someone who has very liberal ideas of how to conduct the economy\nSo she was able to bring this trends and also twin boarded the possibility of economic recovery and economic growth in Brazil\nYou advise companies in Washington about Brazilian issues and I'm just wondering in your conversations what are you telling them or they encouraging signs are warning about something\nWhat I always tell them is that was always a parliamentary system against guys that's presidential new system\nOr the president parliament is probably the most powerful parliament in the empire of Latin America\nSo the key decisions or they go through the parliament so the key aspects to observe in the relationship between the executive between both ... and his coalition base\nThe be the case that this relationship give ... give us a ... month sure when you go because uh if his relationship starts to tremble all little bits and show some lack of communication then they must be concerned about the ability of the government to deliver\nCan't go the other gal at their Brazil analysts on that big win at four giant most ... the country's new president but also big challenges had [noise]\n\nCouple of years as being what feels like endless bad news about plastic pollution with pictures me floating beaches and trucking animals around the world now some two hundred and fifty organizations including businesses accounting for twenty percent of plastic packaging ... globally\nAssigned a commitment to get rid of the so called one use plastic in the next seven years that's plastic he one time and then just go rattles ...\nCountry that has a very real interest in this is the Seychelles which relies on his blue season Christine beauty the tourist dollars\nBut which is struggling with growing mountains of plastic somebody said how much of it by those tourists and some which flights over the sea from other countries I spoke to Vincent marathon vice presidents at the Seychelles weed out the conference with the announcement was made this morning\nLast year we had Seventy two thousand tons of waste and all of a sudden percent don't this is plastic waste\nSo you appreciate the manager of the problem we consume plastic but we do not produce any and yet we have such a large amount of plastic we also received a large amount of the sea as marine debris\nLending on a show is coming from other countries\nAnd other regions that is affecting our pristine beaches\nAnd also and they want to hold refund this is unacceptable for the health and the cleanliness of ribs and beaches in line with us to stick their image\nI look at one recent report from the state news agency sign that said vote on ... picked up one point two tons of debris on the beaches are just won the island or something ... island um is this the sort of thing as well as harming the environment is pushing tourists away so many so many people depend over their livelihoods\nBut they're not pushing tourists away but they have the potential pushing pushing tourists away but I must say that we have a number of enjoys a mirror of NGOs and I'm happy to announce that the U.S out very much into V. they are aware and conscious of that\nShe sees our water from plastic so there is a constant battle by the NGOs\nTo support the government is doing to read a country of the of the plastic that we ... ourselves for just about that lend up on our beaches\nSo this measure that's just been announced to get rid of the single use plastics a plastic container say they had a huge once and can't be recycled how much difference do you think that will make to you\nWhether it will make a um a lot of a difference because we we fight we bear the brunt and only if we have a twenty percent of those words in plastic ... joined up I think it's the beginning when\nYou make any because they're still the deepest sense as you say you haven't made a very small steps toward sounds like a massive problem\nAverage and it begins with a very small steps we have done exactly that and we have a winning the partners like minded partners who haven't joined us and I think the effects far reaching beyond the twin deepest\nAnd to have a who have joined in and I think there is a lot for us to get from those\nWe're sure that others will join me because we all appreciate that plastic affecting the half of our planet we'll appreciate the fact that he does not only profit that should shift humankind but also how we protect the health of our planet which is the only one that we have\nA defense of marriage and vice president of the Seychelles trying to give it a global perspective but if you look on line 'cause he's also pictures images of\nThe kind of damage plastic waste is doing to his country say show\nIt's almost good night for me and James ... on new stay down payment is what's coming up on where they're coming up shortly underworld\nSaid well we're going to follow up on that story I'm going to talk to Ellen ... who is the around

blood of celebrities in the blood of non celebrities in refugees in made into little cubes and then made into big cubes\nAnd put it in a steel frame and the point is that the blood is the same now you can have your own opinion on conceptual art I don't know how I feel about that I Know I think that's the point if you're ... you're supposed to feel uneasy yeah it'll make you think does conceptualize it makes you think or do you think it's just a clumsy way\nOf representing the bleeding obviously there's a problem in the same uh you know it's it depends but anyway I'm going to talk to my question about that and it's certainly got a lot of backing the international Rescue Committee and the others are saying that this is going to help them raise money and it'll suddenly race consciousness on the issue of refugees\nSomething to listen at Fort definitely ... along with other stories on world up to that many banks it's goodbye for me and changed here on Tuesday thinking mark

World Service Brazilian economist Gabrielle elicit they was talking about where the free market reforms could work in Brazil there is a cool a precedent for this in Latin America and warned that Paolo judges will be familiar with\nOkay with me here judges studied economics at the University of Chicago in the U.S in the Nineteen seventies and at the time she call goes economics department was well known as a sense of for free markets theory led by the influential American economist Milton Friedman\nAnd it was in the Nineteen seventies that a group of Chilean economists later dubbed the Chicago Boys because they do say studied under Friedman\nSets about making rather cool free market reforms to chilies economy under the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet with dramatic consequences or find out more about what happened from ... as\nA journalist and film producer in Santiago in Chile she recently made a documentary called Chicago boy's\nEyes were very young when they went to the U.S and the fifties they learn something that they they're near before these is open market and free market economy when they came back in the sixties they try to implement these ideas\nThat they learn from Milton Friedman but nobody heard them they were too extreme extreme in the meaning that they're free market we're going to ... everything and that people would will suffer a lot so they could go ahead with their abs of steel and equipped at\nA leading by the military and Pina tick came [noise]\nIt wasn't a fortunately for them to apply all they know that they get in their states under mixed on treatment a guy down in ...\nSo that the who and the takeover by a cause to Pinochet that gave them the opportunity to enact some of the theories that they learned about free market economics in America\nRight because they didn't have any support among the tradition not politicians ... so they knew that they they may carry we're going to be strong enough\nTo go ahead with their extreme economy policies so they saw these as a window to get into power and to apply these extreme ADS being supported by the military guns\nWhat what were these extreme economic ideas what kinds of things were they doing\nThis long days they thought that the state was mostly on usable that the power of the economy should be in their private hands there is one phrase that they said when things been known to everyone they don't belong to any one\nDay we a distrust this tape so they wanted to have a small state as possible so what are they successful they were very successful a gate came to power with Pinochet more or less the same day two years later they wearing\nGovernment there's civilian side of that the military dictatorship\nSo they control the economy in history there finance minister either social ministry and they weren't able to implement all their idea backed by the guns from the military at some point\nThey're pouring tea layer raised to an unbelievable amount maybe eighties we we had more than forty percent of the population without a job\nSo people are really suffering we have people living in poverty we doubt houses without shoes on these was because all the national industry went to bankruptcy\nSo it was a very very extreme way off implement their their idea bought by this the force by by their guns or the military if anyone wanted to complain the military came within arm's and they stopped any kind of protest on the street\nThat was the I guess the show um impact of these radical free market reforms\nSome people hold up chili is an example of free market success though in the longer term the economy was very prosperous and more prosperous than other economies in Latin America\nYes these is very interesting because it's too\nWe became the richest
