I'm such a method of death\nMaria say much has made this suppose romantic and tragic and care ... isn't that later tax like Shakespeare but what do you think it was any suicidal made you've really about the loss of her lover whether considerations more political\nI think the Romans certainly see it as an act of suffering and grief of the death of Anthony in nephew so much as an act of pride\nAn attempt to escape what the consequences of capture would be because she knew that if she was captured she would be taken back to run drank through the streets as rooms conquest impulsively then executed afterwards so that that seems to be\nA political act and whatever weight was done you could imagine that uh queens who gifted with the power of self representation\nWould've ensured that she died in a way that matched her authority as a root of all the great for the kingdom\nThroughout the program we've tracer complex tangle of mess and village mentioned pure fiction\nLater over the historical facts it's a Christian I wanted to you spend a lot of time in Egypt and I believe you're just come back from the do you think there's any chance we'll never discover more conclusive ... who are we destined to keep wondering about the truth of huh\nWill think research and archaeological research and particularly will go all we will keep on reading tax to try to interpret tax and trying to find archaeological evidence\nThere are very important an ongoing ask original going all that you know like ... parts of which has been submerged by the Mediterranean soldier or Discovery Channel going on off the coast in order to find out all the monuments\nIn recent years time and again our colleges have unknowns that said we're we're just about to find over have found that to all the ... and to me\nWell that's not true of the research still goes on but one should warmed or what are we looking at a with thinking that can be ... and ... are buried in the same too is that likely would include ... I was a real Egyptian queen\nWe might also be locking in finding some new Egyptian factual evidence which could help us in explaining what really happened in the last ... hours moments before the\nJewish we've seen how difficult it is not a gauge our way through those myths and straightforward inventions about Cleopatra so do you think she's still someone we should take inspiration from which should just leave her dressed quietly in the desert sons of Egypt\nI don't think we can leave that to rest because there's so much Cleopatra information ...

I'm probably not going to win this last round my\nI I Would say that's the safest bet I know\nAnd in fact I Would say that no one less thing to this program is likely to win the lottery I Know the BBC has lots of listeners but I'm going to go out on a limb if you are listening to this program and you win the lottery called me up and prove beyond wrong\nYou know what color ... and ...\nCalling us up and she had the money that's what I was thinking you know exactly because you know complete six billion dollars to get a little bit I've repeatedly and I think he said and they read it [laughter] it's not that he says he's actually gonna buy a ticket say you know statistically things has no chance but he's not falling out advice and they have is maybe there is is that what they see us as\n\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

office was I guess it's not\nDesigned to help people out to the gym\nI can get some kind of get stuck in all sorts of places I've been stuck in St Louis and had to look at the same job of peaches for about twenty minutes is helping them by tricking that brain\nWas\n[noise]\nHello and welcome to well hats and stuff yeah back to this is the problem we meet the people trying to solve all sorts of problems with innovative\nAnd mind bending nations this week is no exception because disillusioned with looking at that point about manipulating people's brains playing tricks on them to try and solve some\nPretty big problem [noise] ... yeah you're right my bride old our brains that like the mound and control center of the human body down in charge of over\nBoth really functions we need to stay alive and I was just to think to learn and dream in temperature what we feel and controls on movements so what if we can trick it to make a ... in a different way\nIs it like when you sit in a bus and the one next to use thoughts to move and you feel like you moving backwards even though you actually know moving into\nThe kind of thing we're talking about ... to collision and it's an every day example of your brain being tricked will be it by accident but now people Johnny wearable tech to try to trick our brains for specific purpose I'm wearing one of them now it's this responding I've had mine on for a few days\nAnd I have one to which you gave me about ten minutes ago and it looks like a watch and you feel the way it it's it's like it's pulsating on top of my wrist what is he doing\nSo the response cooped up all and it's essentially putting fake ... be on the wrist if anyone wearing one and if you've listened very carefully you can hit the device being the rhythm of a heart beat on my wrist right now I can have it\nIs currently be saying about the five beats per minute and us quite a slur post strike\nAnd the idea is tricky my brain into thinking that I should be calm there's ... that allows me to pick different settings and comedy minds on keep calm\nBut I can pick two different rhythms on that show ... five beats per minute now if I wanted to even calm I say ... beats per minute I could do as well and so it's all about allowing you to pick different rhythms to see what we would you want to be in a particular point in time\nRight and the one I'm wearing is on a different setting hold ditch the coffee mode debate because a lot faster than yours and it's vibrating on my wrist and making me feel some sort of bought into my mom says well what does he meant to be doing to me yes our responses during different\nThings well mine's trying to make me more calm yours ... heavy be and you must be a little more nights the bull ... to be more focused more love the really high ... on on the high intensity so the problem the divine strength so favors to for\nI don't know when it's going to happen I can be health wave on the field with adults and suddenly I suddenly feel they and the coordination and the energy going back to my left side which is like my physical side um and I can literally\nNot be able to move I can get ... I get stuck in those sorts of places I've been stuck in St Louis and had to look at the same job of peaches for about twenty minutes [laughter] and I've been stuck on and\nThe station in London ... station phenomena cruel to them because I couldn't get on the train\n... power she was diagnosed with Parkinson's ten years ago\nIs freezing after sites and that sounds scary yeah they they are very scary however health type stop and London thinks they might have come up with a solution to get people not now moving again the solution\nRubber device that goes around\nThe shoe underneath and then often around the he'll dot ... Popeye sets up ... with a company that create devices that help people with the general newer logical disorders so we've got the product here\nAnd I mean first off this machine you know it's not it's a shoe attachment directing traffic is only use as a mechanism for securing the actual books which is on the top of the\nSo ... says she's talking about quite high tech there about the size for much books and there's one on each phone now when he switched them on a laser beam projects on the ground as shoot green line a few inches in front of each but\nWe'll have a guy I Try and get on and I say have a swat I'm Sorry I did I get off and have a walk and then you can guide me as to\nWhy should be placed in them so this is who've been reading strike foods I've ... I've said that the touch when I'm On my she is um how that changes coming out as much\nYou can see when you put your left foot on the ground it will have to listen to some guy\nFood has found that the less\nOffice where they must\nBe places they switch on and off as you take each step forward\nYes so when I put my right foot forward a small horizontal line about ten centimeters along with a pair of few inches in front of my left\nSome quite cool and it's fun to laugh but I'm Wondering how they help people who have reading of gates happy so\nYes so behind the solution is not just these she works closely with professor ... blue ... who is ... ... puff scientific advisor and and you're on the just the\nEssence of Parkinson's disease is that the so called ultra metric by which\nIs defective if people with Parkinson's you and I can walk without cultures the paying attention to it that will traumatic it'd be it'd ... lost to people with Parkinson's\nBut you can actually literally trick the brain by by pulsing that ultra metric by which which is more or less to start engine of the brain by consciously recruiting demoted areas of the brain so what the losers basically do is offer an external visual trigger\nForcing or allowing the patients do very consciously take a step forward and stepping over the laser beam\nAnd in doing so they buy post their defective optimistic partnered\nRight okay I think I get this for people that have Parkinson's the will to my way of moving and walking which we all take for granted if damaged so having this visual trigger helps the rain received those messages in a different way\nYeah another really good way to think about it is generally ... patients don't have any issues will care style as\nDust because the status going up which acts as a visual cue obstruction by policies that effective power fight the sensory illusion of the lasers walks in the same way it tricks Brian by constantly placing a key\nAnd from out who as we had a bad idea has had freezing ... episodes in supermarkets and Raul stations this device is pretty useful\nIf I come down in the morning without she's now can I can manage to says okay and then I get to the corner the kitchen and I\nFind it really difficult to stand up and to get my feet move things that\nI Will have to pulling my leg some holding my leg and putting it on the phone for dragging myself along the the unit and then it gets to the capital and I can't stand up straight to fill up the capital and and getting from the capital to the sink and back again it's just a real asset it's really exhausting\nAnd then to have to going to get the milk when I go to take it with me is all those things she's on it still hard what but it makes it possible to do those things instead of almost impossible\n\nSome flight delays and she's asking them have\nPeace of mind yeah she told me broadly speaking she can now go places like the supermarket with the knowledge that you can get out of a freezing I said if she knows it's going to happen however there are still occasions where episodes suddenly come on without\nHer the medication to what the name and\nIn those situations even if she's got the shoes and by she constantly calm put them on and she says era of limitations as well\nI Can't really see them very well outside clientele than if I'm On an uneven set aside the grass all that kinda fits in Haiti place and that they set his his flat\nYeah I was going to ask about that I imagine it can't be very easy to see the latest on a sunny day\nYeah now did mentioned to me that when she goes and will do in the field is one of the time she freezes quite a lot and she caught and freely shave lasers on one of the drawbacks and she felt a independent of peace of mind would massively increase if they were more visible does\nSo it's not ... but it helps or\nDo we know how well they swept for other people with Parkinson's sort of study was done and it showed the freezing of gay episodes decreased by forty five percent\nFor those participants of medication and when they were on medication the effect was still positive it at the decrease the episodes by about thirty seven percent however that was a really small sample size only Nineteen participants in our study\nAnd that's no and I wonder how do these you know they do they make his and out to a lot of attention to yourself\nYet definitely that was an incident in one of the uh the models of this ... someone in the Netherlands ... on a train on it caused a lot of panic people food it was a weapon yeah from what I understand what puff\nHave rarely refined products it's on to address some of those concerns but it is who is going to generate attention ... she's in public and they chose attention\nTo something people might otherwise wants to be quite private [noise]\n\nSo these two ideas ... and ... and she [noise] both of them are about manipulating the mind to make us feel old act differently than my own for the way we can take the brain fall out of the ...\nYes it's definitely a growing area what's happening is wearable tech startups like ... she's a kind of tracking you're a scientist labs and that means that the solutions are reaching the real world a lot quicker\nPreviously they would have been but a lot for a long time so it's definitely becoming more prominent not kind of coming together of start ups and you're a scientist and professors and you're a scientist so I've been speaking to us at this very likely we're going to see more of these kinds of solutions in the future\n\nIs fascinating and Q A ma and things to all of you for listening to all tax\nIf you want to see those lazy she's an action go to our Facebook page we've made a video about them and if you want to get in

example\nThere are a number of major sporting goods store is that said that they would no longer sell assault weapons so that was a very big deal we also saw among that list of a few dozen companies I mentioned that offered discounts\nAll but a few pulling their relationships um Delta Airlines and United Airlines told us they wouldn't no longer offer discounts to enter a members who wanted to fly down to the annual convention\nIs there any way of measuring the financial impact on the end All right all of these moves\nIt's hard to know exactly how these companies pulling ties impact and that are as finances we know that they are complaining of financial woes in court documents but it's hard to know exactly what that entails\nBut I think one interesting facts of that like I mentioned earlier is if you look at the end are a spending in these twenty Eighteen mid term elections they're spending far less on candidates that we would have expected them to go all in for\nNot much does appear to be true recent findings in early October showed that the n._r._a. was spending less than two million dollars that shit on political campaigns one tenth of a spending it\nTo elections we didn't try exhaustively to speak to the n._r._a. for this ... business daily from the b._b._c.\nThey wouldn't make a spokesperson available wheels they failed to get any formal comment from most of

was a petition and trust that had some fifty thousand signatures on it [noise] but what we've already watching was the conversation on our our social media channels and they must have twenty thousand

seeing and what we're following primary in our social media channels [noise] so what did you do precisely\nWe spoke to the vendors we reached out to industry partners and on granny trying to get a feel for this before making a rash decision [noise] the the vendors that's more impacted were long canyon vendors off our shoes\nEthics were posted two hours then says ask them holding company [noise] so they were very round people\nUm that was the alliance for us would have been impacted by our decisions\nRight so I mean essentially ... the prime move you made right was to to to stop selling on your shelves products made by this um this to outdoor ... which\nWas you would not setting firearms or ammunition yourself Mr out during does manufacture those things so you you basically cut them off as positive you'll offering to customers until they stopped manufacturing firearms and since then Mr outdoor I Believe has got rid of it so far on manufacturing business\nThey've got it up for sale I don't think it's being sold yet\nI'm just make an observation here we approached you but obviously we approached a very large number of U.S companies who found themselves goes up in this boycott of um of the n._r._a. or and gun products in the wake of the Parkland shooting you were the only one who agreed to take part does that surprise you\nProbably not because as I said that we looked at this or the ... this was a social decision for us not a political idea ideological decision whereas I think in the U.S and his former politicized\nDavid ... of NBC in Canada so how much have moves like this really hit the gun lobby at least in the pocket as mentioned the n._r._a. campaign spending has fallen dramatically this year but ... doesn't think financial muscle is key to the raise influence

really didn't have money that could have come for Russian sources and that's the dark allegation reporting on in the American media in recent months\nAnd their difficulty is that their sources of funding or rather finite and there's a long term existential problem\nThat fewer and fewer Americans are interested in having guns the typical gun owner in America is an older white male\nAnd that generation is frankly dying off back in the Nineteen sixties one household and to head at least one gun in it today it's under thirty percent of households and\nThere's an interesting phenomenon there
