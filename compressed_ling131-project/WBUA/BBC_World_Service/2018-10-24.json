penalize our state owned enterprises because that's a huge part of how they operate one\nOf the main functions of the WTO they have a lot of tunnels that they're looking at international trade the U.S has actually been withholding appointments to various different terminals\nWell this is so you've got the United states and the one hand\nThe WTO doesn't shape up and then on the other hand making it really difficult for the world Trade Organization to function by blocking the appointment of judges might who who do all the education so that sounds inconsistent they would say that this is part of the way of forcing the issue\nForcing the negotiation and we saw the former head of the world Trade Organization amending Pascal let me say\nSay what you like about Donald Trump by him launching the trade war with China and threatening to withdraw the United states he has done what many people said needs to be done which is to reform the WTO\nThat was independent research just Stephanie\nYeah quite an undertaking there tell me thanks [noise]\n\nNice to have the last few days you'll be familiar with the caravan of thousands of migrants heading from Central America tools the U.S they reach Mexico now gaining numbers in attracting political controversy as they go the size of the group is growing from around the thousands it's more than seven thousand according to the United nations estimates\nPresident Trump has turned the caravan into a major domestic us political issue to accusing the migrants have been criminals among other things\nFor their part the migrants said many of them are parents with young children seeking a better life away from the violence and lack of opportunity and in their home countries one of those in the Taliban is twenty nine year old horse they'd gotten as at one time yeah\nFrom Honduras he's been speaking to news day about why he's on the move\nI'm twenty nine years old and snow for me it's been\nThree years without a job it's ... it's a sacrifice and sometimes I didn't have money to get tiny foods I'm truly scared if I'm honest I'm afraid because of this journey is not easy for me this is the first time leaving and I have ... fear but when I remember the necessity we have\nNot just forces me to continue and even if I Would like to go back I Can't\nKnow because the third retaliation that the Honduran governments as promised us sing with anyone who returns to Honduras risks jail for it up to four years\nNo that's my fear my fear to starving to death that's my fear the only thing I Hope is that Mr Donald Trump opens the doors to us that sense because it's been too much sacrifice to get there and ends up with nothing we're not going to steal from we're not going to do anything it would be like God's Grace but he can help us\nNuts or has it gotten as ... uh well I've been talking to Daniel ... a reporter for the political news site in the U. S. and\nI asked him how he saw President Trump would react if he could who's his story\nI guess I Would say that the president if he makes the case then you can't\nBe allowing millions of people from desperate countries because you enter a border and then you know when is it going up and so\nI think you know Trump he was elected primarily a in some cases a on a anti immigrant platform in twenty sixteen and so he's carrying out his\nPromise to not illegal so uh he is not that we should have a heart policy but he doesn't always carry that out in terms of showing me clearly clean\nDesperate situation\nThat sort of a policy line he's rhetoric and so on clearly plays very well to his base with these midterm elections approaching false do you think it works with the rest of the country particularly perhaps undecided voters\nI think a lot of moderate voters\nThey don't like when Trump uses false statements to back him self up when he was talking about\nYou know unknown middle Easterners you know we in America where a pluralistic society and so a lot of suburban Americans were moderates they don't want to use this type of you know racially motivated\nFear mongering that is not even true and you know\nI think it says to his small sliver of his base which is still you know thirty percent of Americans\nBut for Democrats for independence for even moderate Republicans you know whatever Trump says on the caravan or immigration policy in general may or you're not approve of or they don't want immigration policy to run out of\nThe country by a Steven Miller who is very hard right anti immigrant\nA senior policy adviser to\nPresident Trump is also included a Democrat caravan tried to pin the blame as they were on the Democrats is is a topic that the Democrats than just simply trying to avoid in the run up to the midterms or conversely I wanted to kind of ... most possibly\nHelp them in the sense that it might motivate that base perhaps even encourage Hispanic votes is to come out and vote for them\nThat's a great point I think the Democrats don't want to be talking about this issue\nPolitical party has a great answer to immigration policy you know we've both presidents of\nDemocrats and Republicans they have tried to tackle immigration reform and they've been stopped a in various efforts and some Democrats want to be talking about health care and the economy and Trump's character and invest in the president they don't want to be talking about immigration but\nThat effort to split the tree and I jumped in terms of what this is a democratic Karen and when are these types of care if it's been happening for the last couple of decades as\nDaniel ... with the Politico at news sites\nAs quite a lot of coverage and this uh on the BBC Web sites a beast needs to call a ... a video made by a correspondent highly ...

improve the efficiency ineffectiveness of monitoring system so you've got a hundred and sixty four countries around the world all trading together through the difficult to keep an eye on what's happening now right everything's technical now\nAnd that brings us into the second point which is they need to modernize trade rules for the twenty first century so we're talking everything from digital trade\nTo international investment state owned enterprises that's code for China by the way\nUm and the third thing is that they want to safeguard and strengthen the dispute supplement system to right now it's really tedious\nLengthy and inefficient to try to resolve disputes between countries which is why we're in the current situation we're in which is that the United states and China are breaking the world Trade Organization rules and having their own private trade war\nOver all these people that are meeting in Canada obviously we're trying to in the United states not being

Britain to be a middle sized middle ranking nation that is no longer super charged by its alliances I ate breakfast is doing very profound damage to Britain's ... place in the\nWorld I think there's a danger to let it nice and we've got to make sure that it doesn't end in order to make sure it doesn't uh we do need to reach an agreement to the next few weeks with a new which is neat surely an official and not mutually harmful\nAnd all those some voices in Iran's government policy or very critical of the prime minister my view is you've got to be a hundred percent behind or otherwise you weaken the and the guy is a physician\nParliamentary arithmetic is very tight and we ... we have to back up all the way to the point where I Hope and what will probably be the last minute we ended up with a deal which could determine our future relationship with the ... you and make sure that we do know\nSuffer the consequences that such a major uh described\nPoint of all this is the prime minister is being manipulated by the almost impossible pressures inside Iran policy if one yeah if one looks at her positions on things like the Northern Ireland backstop\nWhich the British Government had signed up through this notion that they will always be a safety net whatever the states as a future trade agreement between the u._k. and the you they will always be a safety net which ensures\nThat Northern Ireland and the Irish republican will not have a hard border between them that guarantee offered\nBy the British as long as your dollars last December it now seems has been taken off the table because Theresa May ... get hit by the ... allies in the Democratic union his party\nThat uh I think you'll ruin them is a I don't think that um she's a day being ducking and waving I think had great quality\nIs that the reason the is a unflappable and she doesn't get pushed around now there's no doubt that every day the poor prime minister takes in the last of incoming fire for many angles are mostly from those who wants a very hot breakfast breakfast or the new deal a tool but she doesn't dodge and what she's doing she's saying very clearly\nThat uh the union of the United kingdom the full conscious of the u._k. must be held together\nAnd that the peace process behind a Northern Ireland mustn't be interrupted by treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the United kingdom\nNow she has stuck to that but the problem we've all just to try and find a solution which square the circle between the principles of the ... and the principles of holding\nTogether at least ... square if I may end up just to because we are done by Irish foreign minister Simon coat and he said yesterday that will be no withdrawals agreement without the Irish banks stalk facts don't and ... story so all of this\nShuffling of papers and on different positions for different people in the end it's quite simple\nTheresa May is he a ... year position as he is the breakfast tears who appear to have a a means to stop threes and made from from making any concessions to Brussels based it over here there is no way of making this work\nI think that will be a way and not stable to analyze it I'm assigned a cave and he's very smart and I'm In a very thin line did essentially has the same objective as we do which is that we don't want to undermine the northern Irish peace process we don't want to ... between northern\nIreland and the rest of the island of odds and ends up essentially so the more or less is the ... but the ... the point to that kind of the law says it doesn't address the problem is it's it's still a problem so you know people can argue amongst themselves and an adult pollsters in positions that doesn't mean that the ones that come in any way to let the\nChemo gonna former cabinet minister said the other day this policy the Tory party all\nPolitics is now on to quote existential string friendships between colleagues have been irreparably damaged because all these arguments\nOver bricks the languages become toxic including talk of from Brexit fears of killing his own is for the prime minister carrying on new since we're meeting so she could hang on a cell phone knife being turned in her body want on us is going on inside your party\nI think briefings using disgusting language like that and just to be condemned to to me I quite agree that some people if you like a sense of decency and decorum is getting out of control\nBut the point that your party giving the atmosphere the toxic poisonous culture within it now\nDeliver a ... here in Britain ... deal actually I think it can because I think that in the next few weeks if the prime minister gets a deal and comes back to parliament with adult chemistry of all this will will change and we will have the votes in parliament which I actually believe would vote for a deal and I think\nWhen I hang on this is interesting so your vision of a deal it's a deal that she's done with the end you're twenty seven year old telling me I can get through the British Parliament but it won't have the support surely of some of the people I've just referred to with the language that using so presumably you're believing you can peel off something members at least to the opposition Labour Party is that it\nNow I think we'll pillow for lots of those who are making noise against because I think in the end I'm In a it is probably will be the the the new deal that's on the\nTable and they will pay check as all of a sort of\nYes ah that is my belief and I think we should then supported\nI don't see how your policy can survive that your former boss well yeah there's I drink more Morris Jones and he says checkers is akin to a suicide vest being wrapped around\nThe British nation you'll respond so that was one of the most disgusting things I've heard in politics you said this is the end the Boris Johnson if it isn't now I Will make sure it is late so I put it to you that if you and people like Boris Johnson who used to work for our war with each other\nEven before this check his deal is put back on the table before parliament is the final deal with the Europe your policies finish\nThat thought is was bigger than the events that has to cope with in the case of ... as much a journalist as he is a politician says sometimes he uses this flurry language and what was happening was that he was clearly intending to go into policy conference in ... with a wish to undermine\nThe prime minister on race you are listening to finishing off and\nAnd that's all you can ... back in ... in order to try and just get in to back off I had to party comfort in the end actually that is what happened and I think the prime minister uh we'll be able to deliver this I think talk or by people challenging to a much exaggerated\nFinal four if you are wrong if parliament rejects the bill that three of them may brings back\nFor you want the best option then is it a change of leader in the ... on a different kind of bill is it a general election or is it that people are so cool people vote another referendum on Britain's relationship with the Europe including the possibility we actually staying after all\nWhat I think you know to have a what they call of people say you need to act upon them and to make it possible and that ain't going to happen at the moment but I think that if a deal with put to parliament and that ... is ... woods cools fundraiser on Seventy than anything we've been discussing today from your face you have no idea what\nWould I guess it would be we'd be getting it's a completely on that ... what happened and that's why I wanted to happen which as well as I as one of the older members of parliament\nAppeal to my policy to stick together or to stop I'm having a guy that the prime minister all the time and to realize that you know if we get old Israel and we might end up with the ... oval plus lay the government led by Jeremy Corbyn which is like having Fidel Castro in Downing Street\nSurrounded by ... we have to weigh in that but I thank you very much for being on ...

American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nThink that's because there has just been assumption that it is very easy for a small number of people to donate a lot of money and then in effect by the government's\nWatch Beto O'Rourke and other candidates that except small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government that is elected only by people making small donations even campaign finance advocates going back to the Nineteen sixties\nThey said that there is absolutely no way that they could win office or on small dollar donations that's changing\nTo run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign powered by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls and turn people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because\nThe architecture wasn't there for people to just play ... and make a quick to nation but also you're saying that the money is actually only part of the strategy here it's almost like you can't buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them\nIn terms of boots on the streets\nThat's exactly right they're making an emotional investment to a campaign and because better or is asking people to build a movement with him he can then asked them to knock on doors to text their neighbors and ask them to vote for\nThe most remarkable things that I think better or works campaign has done is they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially run by the campaign but they've asked their supporters to set up their own offices and they have eight hundred and sixty two campaign offices run out of garages apartments\nFront lawns that's artificial intake points for people to come and volunteer and help turn out to vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system\nHe's having his volunteers and his supporters in effect running large parts of his campaign on their own if he does when it was suddenly send the big message across Washington that's right what better was doing win or lose is showing that you can run the campaigns very differently than anyone else has thought possible I\nThink the true test of better works legacy will be how different democratic presidential candidates\nTry to emulate what he's doing mostly spending is thirty eight million plus on\nSo far he has spent thirty percent of his money just on digital expenditures that means running ads on Facebook on Google on recruiting other donors and supporters\nThat many it was a it was a similar tactic approach by the Trump campaign was it not\nYes the two best spenders right now on digital\nExpenses are Donald Trump and better at work when you have better spending so much of his money on investing in a digital program that is something that is very unique and the Democrats are frankly catching up on to where the Republicans were last cycle\nBetter ... of course his car he losing going to the opinion polls by on a percentage point also do you think that as opposed to the extent that fundraising is a symptom of sentiment tendencies he asked them to think the polls are all\nThe polls that have been gotten so far in Texas I'm all university found that Ted Cruz's ahead by eight what I think the equation is whether or not better work can turn out to voters that are not being picked up in the polls Ken you reach voters that are not going to be picked up on in\nAny traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial to the Republicans keeping them majority losing it\nBut despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way of them and\nGet out and vote in the mid term [noise]\nThat was their ideal I Am proud to injure news are forty minutes president here of our country nano ... [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one and anyway it is important to stress that well Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been better stalked from previous years\nWhich means that spending between the two parties over all may end up being fairly even so how might this translate into success at the polls\nDoes the money even matter that much Donald Trump off rule under spent Hillary Clinton twenty sixteen but still one\nMuch academic research at a recent us just that expensive TV advertising campaigns are not always that influential and votes as somehow should campaign to be focusing should they be spending on online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies through his Wesleyan Media project tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so\nIn order to be able to buy advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach\nOlder voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nUh what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very officially with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so does\nTV advertising still work it\nDoes work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent\nAnd have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence consistently the poll numbers move in that direction so if you can out advertise your opponent you can move the poll numbers and the closer you get to election day the more likely that means you'll get more votes\nBut what we also know is that those effects don't last for very long and so the the spending that happens very early in a campaign you know paradoxically is not going to impact the outcome of the race all that much\nUh and so campaigns are in sort of an arms race which is why they sort of an irrational arms race for why they spent so much money early in campaigns\nSo that they're not out being outspent by the opponent but that's being done to neutralize any short term effects which might have some impacts later on in terms of how much money can raise in the sense of the euro viable campaign [noise]\nUm but at the end of the day campaign ads matter in small ways and and then not very big or long lasting ways but you don't want to lose that advantage of the election is likely to be close if it's a fifty fifty race and then you lose by half a percentage point and that's because you decided not to spend the last\nYou know half a million dollars on ads you're going to be you know you're you're going to regret regret it and so that's why campaigns do what they do\nSo will basically keeping our eyes peeled next two weeks but the votes as being absolutely bullets with the TV sports wherever they may be\nAbsolutely and voters consistently say that they don't like these things\nBut campaigns don't care because they they want to make their message known and they want to advertise their opponent and they don't want to leave anything on the table and so voters in in competitive\nDistricts in states and I should expect to see a whole bunch of advertising online and on TV and on the radio or in the next in the next ten days\nProfessor of government Mike friends separates to oil this also ducks political advertising we've been discussing we'd do wait to see and none of us as\nMuch manipulation on line meant by trolls for example ... foreign actors\nMay have influence this election that could be the subject for another business daily we shall see but regardless both parties including these midterms among the most important of our time it will become it here on BBC will serve is of course but for now\nI'm a button and I do this message see tomorrow [noise]\n\n[noise]\nI like to talk of already coming up today

they tap\nOn the ... such as beverage bottles will have to be collected separately and recycled as a race have Ninety percent by twenty twenty five\nBefore we came on our rights but to mark ... a material scientist at University College London he explained the staggering contrast between how long we use these everyday items for another life span in the environment\nThis material will last hundred years in the ground and in the nation but it's only meant the last few minutes and you'll hands [noise] it's kinda crazy situation that we found also in the projections are if we don't stop doing that will be more plastic in the ocean than fish by twenty fifty\nThat statistic alone you would think would have made us look at this a lot earlier than we have\nPeople have been willfully blind to the industry of known for a long time\nThat these plastic for not being recycled no company wants to take the bus neat because that would then Disney on page than making the others like competing against you know he's been out to start off with mine for many people you put it in your recycling only open and you think well that being taken care of but no it hasn't been taking care of\nSo now with this ban which will be presumably implanted in all the European Union countries what will be alternatives be and how long do you think it'll take before the ban is enforced across the

think that the twenty Twenty one goal that the European Parliament has now imposed is too ambitious\nI think we need to be ambitious I Know that there'll be lots of pain in the industry but there's some plastics that are quite easy to just get out of your life and I think that we should all and strive to do that\nWhat would you suggest that we should eliminate immediately\nWhere you don't need a plastic full the I mean a lot of the folks are given to you without anyone really thinking through by the it's not going to be recycled wasn't everyone like I Do bring with them famous no cutlery they have it in there by that is done no way\nI Am deeply ashamed I have a plastic fork in my salad currently as I speak to you know so it's all things that we can do immediately I wanted to do what you think is the real problem that needs looking at now as well which is just the\nLevels of consumption is there a complete re education that needs to happen\nI think there is a re education about people not accepting the stuff that is completely ... and it's just simply consumption for ... like a classic book unlike disposable cops on notice likeable but\nI think actually doesn't stomach change that's about the whole way we run the economy to have to change and that will take longer that will happen soon but it has to happen in my view if everything we make\nWhatever the weather's and shampoo bottle or a car or a mobile phone or they will have plastics and by the way someone needs to think about the end of life and they must always come back and in the cycle so it can hold of me\nAnd in my view should be illegal to sell something where you don't know how to disassemble it and put it back into the system\nYou're asking for is a complete overhaul and the way in which we structure our economy because that last point is pretty radical\nIt is radical but the alternative is equally radical which is a complete ... nation of the season our environment and not just the truth of the way in which are linear requirement I say linear by saying this would basically takes up on the ground we pump it out on the ground we make products which are amazing an ally especially in the west for the wonderful materials for them\nBut then we have NO PLAN about what to do with all that stuff and of course the economy is all about taking the among the most stuff but we haven't even watch out what to do with the stuff we don't want anymore and we will just end up with an environmental catastrophe if we do know rethink that linear economy\n[noise] serious thoughts that from a ... a middle snake who is a material scientist at the university at University College London\n[noise]\nFocus on the west and women has skewed our ideas of what buff should look like according to scientists who has found huge variations in the shape of the best canal between women from different parts of the world\nThere is such a little skeletons of women from different populations to see if they were any patents in the shape of the ...\nAnd was shocked to find that the medical literature is dominated by a particularly European view of what women's health services looks like\nThat speak to lay or Bessie who is a biological anthropologist at the University of real Hampton in London Welcome to the program I I Wonder how surprised us by what you found\nWhen I was quite surprised by the extent of radiation that I found I knew that it was going to be some variation because at that some ... some ... early Nineteen hundreds Nineteen Thirteen Nineteen forties\nOr when they did some X rays of women especially pregnant women to figure it out if there was a defense independent shape and they did find some but they were focused mostly on European Americans and African Americans [noise]\nSo what I did was um enlarge the simple to undercut the global on diversity in bad shape\nLike I said I had to tell us what you found you studied three hundred and forty eight so needy three hundred and fifty cents from twenty four different populations what would the differences [noise]\nWell if you look at the shape of the can on not putting some perception African women\nI cannot is very different from what you find as an average in some Native American population for example saying stop sign or African women it is more for some time it's actually deeper back to front than Haiti's wider side to side\nOr what if you move to Native American population for example you find that its largest side to side\nAnd shut lower back to front so it's a complete the opposite\nAnd shape of the ends I said they cannot wear the babies had thoughts descending\nOn St ... this knowledge has this lack of understanding today has actually had a negative consequences for women\nIt's possible that some evidence from the Nineteen thirties again the same period in which there were um ex same women there are also following up what's happened after birth and they did find that\nPresentation at birth depending on the ... the woman was coming from but also there is some evidence that some of the movement\nThat wearing posted a baby gives him first said we're not ideal for the shape of some women a minority women especially safe ... uh she cannot based on the European NATO\nOh not a sub Saharan African woman that might actually be right and it's actually the baby would turn in a different type thing and if you try to drive the baby was the first I've been a specific that action based on your mother you will actually harm to a baby and monitor that actually has up and\nYeah so what do you expect now to happen with the information that you have now\nI'm ... researched just said well let me healthy yes I'm hoping that as some idea of the variation that we're seeing women all over the word will be afflicted in textbooks instead of just basing\nUm everything on a simple motto of what we found him I said European women so some knowledge of variation of

one of the reasons they been able to retain\nA such power internationally and Washington despite the fact that the Saudis are played a a\nA role in nine eleven many people feel a\nWe have one former

outrageous murder\nThat they may not shed us values as you described them but they can only do help the U.S economy if the U.S led to walk away from the ... they have with the U.S but only about a hundred and ten billion dollars and many many American Jobs\nSurely the president of the United states has some strong case to make to protect as jobs\nYou know I expect the same argument is that they they're in the u._k. because there have been plenty of weapons supplied from the u._k. to the Saudis as well uh there has to be a something that is more important than just the next dollar of arms sales ah and\nThese arms or to someone who gauges in this kind of outrageous conduct is time at least to suspend those sales pleased that the Germans have done that we need to follow the

times he's at the conference\nWhat is the ... ... what is the competence expected to say\nYou're supposed to be speaking about five thirty local time with the prime minister of Lebanon sensibly they're going to be on a panel about economic development in the region and how to make the middle east you know more of a global powerhouse\nBut you know everybody sort of wondering if you point to address the situation with ... as you know a few people did earlier in the conference yesterday\nHow would you characterize the atmosphere than\nThe fact that there were a lot of withdrawals doubling boycotting reference a there are a lot of people here they're expecting about three thousand for the week up there if there have been some people who have been recruited filth of the faces but\nYou know certainly a lot of activity it's a little bit more subdued than it was last year when there were robot milling about and a lot of the big name executives from American banks here but you know I think there's definitely a lot of ...\nWhen you talk about the fact that deals actually all being done it does sound as though that there is a kind of potential re calibration of engaging with Saudi Arabia but ultimately that the color of money will prevail\nI think that's probably right immutable sort of depend on how the next few weeks ago as more evidence emerges a you know they did science a memorandum of understanding yesterday or you know and I think it's also possible that we could see the Saudis are shifting from the west to east and in other directions there's a lot of Russian\nUh business leaders here there's a lot of people from Asia the parts of the world though you know for the ... which direction to feel go\nOne of the leaders who has decided to to show up his ah the the needy and stole his prime minister of Pakistan Enron ... he made it very clear that engaging with Saudi Arabia was was imperative for his country\nYeah that's correct I mean Pakistan and the thing you know and I couldn't I'm afraid I'm going to end a prime minister speaking pedal yesterday where he got to be talking about Pakistan potential even for investments that came from the trip you know about six billion dollars poured though I think uh you know there was that when\nI I Wonder whether you think that the Saudis are lost in tiny on irony when we when we hear that to the eagles classic

in the middle East that he says most recently as ambassador to Yemen under President Obama\nHe's now the middle East Institute in Washington DC welcome to the program I I Wonder what you think about a well Mike Mike Pompeo has done so far would you like to see\nSome more extensive of responses to the Saudis have down to ...\nWell I'm certainly and and the administration itself or the president as well as secretary Pompeo said that oh this was a first step and that they intend to ah pursue a further steps as as more evidence becomes available to them so uh I I don't think that this was the end of the story\nWhen you say you don't think this is the end of the story I mean do you feel that they will be a just a wee calibration of the U.S relationship with weeds ... or ... or will it will it be much much bigger rupture\nWell ... my my view of what what I've said before is that I think that we need to distinguish between um between Saudi Arabia and Mohammed bin some on and and in my view or this is primarily not a problem of the U.S Saudi relationship as much as it is a problem of\nOf the U.S relationship with Mohammed bin some on and the other question about what direction he is pushing the country\nSo uh I I think that the focus is going to be primarily on on the relationship with the the senior leadership as opposed to looking at a country with which we've had a very long and close relationship for a over Seventy years it's\nGoing to be quite hard one to sit next to reason it because uh most President Trump and his son in law Jared Kushner aligned them\nAbsolutely and and uh you could see that ah you know President Trump was struggling with this whole issue early on I have no doubt in my mind that they would have dearly love to see this whole problem go away\nUm uh but uh but certainly you know I think that the level of anger both in the United states in the United States Congress we heard from congressman dog it earlier as well as internationally a is a is clearly forcing the president's had to do more\nGeneral ... senior U.S diplomat in the middle east a thank you very much for joining us lines we had some problems with the line and yet but a great to
