to use their mother tongue and the second official language in areas where they make up at least ten percent of the population Russian is widely spoken in Ukraine and as a first language for millions\nInto national guardians of democratic standards except the drive to consolidate the Ukrainian language but there are alarmed at attempt to downgrade rushing in the public sphere\nLast month

called the sheriff's department\nThe autopsy report was back\nAnd they told us that the medical examiner had voted for homicide and the death was caused by sixty Asian and that was probably the most dramatic and traumatic moment in all this was realizing he had been killed\nOther time equals death did spark a debate in the U.S about police interactions with people with disabilities but the deaths keep on coming\n\nFor ... to look into the case of a man who was confronted by police in front of his or her and her\nAnd police to see if he was carrying a weapon actually it was a piece of steel piping but they shouted instructions for profit and he didn't in the end of that confrontation the man\nWas shot and killed problem was he never heard the instructions for the police were giving him as one neighbors around was shouting at the police couldn't here there's instructions risk death [noise]\nOn those stories with words\nI fully issues and kill a man is just so\nWe say it's unclear whether the two officers involved heard what the witnesses were yelling\nMyself and my daughter were actually screaming at him you know that he was staff now you can hear anything\nThey both discharge their weapons after Sanchez didn't respond to verbal commands\nPolice say they went to the home of ... because they suspected his father had been involved in a hit and run incident with someone was injured\nSurveillance footage from the house across the street from my deals shows that at one point he did run towards officers that then walks away again holding a pipe\nMoments later shown was killed [noise]\n\nI came to the window after the shots were fired\nAnd I lucked out and saying [noise]\nYang man and the officer\nWho vote was clear speaking to neighbors like Regina Smith was the ... century is as well as being death will somehow learning difficulties\nI just ... sit with him\nAnd I was like what can he had done\nKind of a person wants to have a special needs child and have a staff\nAnd have a camera and\nYou know as an elder void that have a like a child\nThe question many had was why he was holding a piece of pipe we met the navy by Kevin ... who encouraged him to carry it\nYou see me going up and down the street was one on one and you can buy the house and health stiffen you smile\nBut it is five and the cat is the ... why were you kind of say\nThe dog and the people around here for many many dogs scare me\nAs an older cases we've heard about the been no prosecutions of the officers involved we spoke to the Oklahoma City police chief William city you said the offices killed my deal Sanchez in self defense\nNobody disputes that they were yelling that he was death nobody disputes that that some of them were yelling he was death civil war yelling he can't you know he doesn't understand he doesn't understand well that could mean he doesn't understand English but he understood who they were\nYou know that's why we were uniforms\nHe may have none of police officers but if if he was definitely a learning disability he may not know\nHow to interact it's our job to be able to respond to situations in a manner which creates the best possible outcome you can't look at that situation I think this was the best possible outcome under the circumstances of that moment with what they had to work with there was the best possible outcome\n\nAlready this year right across the U.S at least a hundred and thirty people with a range of disabilities physical mental and intellectual or come from two have been killed by police officers in hundreds more cases it was never determined person killed had a disability a tool\n\nBut what does the officers involved in taking the life of someone with a disability and her her her nine hundred that thing in Oklahoma City we rode with sergeant Corey new now as you went to patrol you reveal too was a moment Fifteen Years ago that changed his life\nI was involved in this critical event where am I had a subject he was armed with a knife outside of school and um\nI was forced into a situation where I didn't have any other choice but to to shoot and kill the individual\nAnd we were outside of school shootings armed with a very large ... she wasn't responding to my instructions on how direction and\n... incident was over I was able\nTo be told that she had a history of mental illness I didn't know that at the time I didn't understand what was going on at\nI was at the time you you you felt you had no choice to to feel differently about that even\nNow I don't feel differently about it now\nOutside of that event outside of the pressure cooker outside of those milliseconds of the officer has to make a decision that many people have the benefit of of looking back at that with ... minutes if not hours or days to contemplate whether they would have done\nAnd then they charge the officer because they didn't do the thing that I Would have done\nSo why does it happens so often with so many people with disabilities being killed by the police will firstly old police here are of course armed and they face members of the public who want to the tourists late in places like Chicago's south side\nWhen we talk about police killings in America the biggest stories of the last couple of years the full surround is always the Fox massive race riots\nJust because we're talking about disability I mean the race over the falls flat how they do a lot of the cases we've looked that way people with disabilities having children interaction\nIs not partly because of the highest police presence in those areas the highest central violence but also according to this issue\nFor a long time to to the police or they come into those areas [noise]\n\nSouth side Chicago is predominantly African American has challenges with inequality and crime and just one of the most heavily policed areas in the u._s. it's seen many instances where people with disabilities have died and interactions with offices the complaint from many that\nIs the police too often command and control Shelton commands and physically dominating especially when someone doesn't immediately comply\nAnd that can include the use of lethal force the problem is because we've already heard some people just cons complying [noise]\n\nKansas Coleman who has self has cerebral palsy works as a community organizer with young people who have autism schizophrenia and learning impairments she sees a clear reason why so many maybe injured or killed in interactions with offices\nIf they knew encounter police then it's a scary situation um they know this price and they never seen it starts out with a guy in a or an ... like why are these lights flashing these loud\nSounds what are all these things may force of control and body like I have to Charlie is often I used to that then I'm going to respond in a way that would look as if I'm being defiant\nLarry ... who watched his son get repeatedly taste on the horrific police body can footage in nearby Milwaukee can identify with all of that\nThere's times when you know you couldn't touch Adam he got really withdrawn or he'd get up\nI cited you know what I meant so always knew when I dealt with cameras stayed back from them and let them talk you know what I mean if I went in there and\nJust use my authority as far as I'm your father this is it just didn't work\nVery traumatic told me his son Adam often had delusions and who is the nation's he feels when they burst into his apartment and confronted him in his own shower the police could not have done a worse job of handling that\nThey escalated and the point is if Adam was going to want to visit a motion on things is that when the police came in and he looked at 'em\nHe might have not thought that was them and buy them calling them by the different name he was stake in this area\nAfter weeks of trying we finally managed to speak on the phone at least to the district attorney John Chisholm who'd ruled out of them did not die as a result of the actions of the officers who teased him numerous times\nThey're not doing this because they wanted to harm Adam ... it's the exact opposite right there but it really looks like it doesn't but it does their their their expression tempt any number of times is that they were there to help them but they wanted to get him out of that\nKept saying Joyce has he takes us they tasted\nRight right because they had to get them under control so that they could get them to some medical attention\nYou're saying that it was not unreasonable to they tasted\nThat's correct that's not based on their training and the decision that they have to make is is what's the appropriate means to get him under control food they can get him to the medical attention at that point you\nAdded

also the source of the clean hydro electricity that Powell is no way but there's a paradox this country is still a major producer and exposure of oil and gas on the real story this week where debates

the University of Trump's say well conceivable I Want to begin by asking each of you how strong would you say a new ways green credentials carry it has ...\nWell I Do believe that although we have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention what the\nVarious political parties have done the wreck the several years transforming that the transportation sector that we have here in in Norway\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across Norway and that's something that the I Believe that we should be quite proud of Ken Goodman says I'd read last month a fifty percent of all new\nA a major leaked towards a more green society\nEspecially when we know that the transport sector is a big country be thrown into the field to credits yes so\nFor me I think it's very important that we have an active policy towards thinking new technology that drives the green shift and still has the oil and gas sector because it gives the money to do all the research on how\nWell the the green technology development\nGay Sunday so I think the because of oil and gas we can't afford to be have a huge impact do make the climate better global and we do the job abroad or we will be drop inside nowhere and

thing\nTo fool not safe from all the panel these green credentials their ... are you going to agree\nCarry this because he is not a view shared by much of the Norwegian public that actually that's a new way does this we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from no way we take it out cleaning from the ground and where the good guys and all\nOf this I think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries are in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big and that transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on importing false ... in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of unusual energy and that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in Great Britain it's happening in Germany that's going to change the markets to which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far as you\nCan sense should the Norwegian government be grunting new exploration licenses for it and places like the ... seats in the ...\nI Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about it because if we have to and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the bar and seek today they will be still be producing and twenty seventh day twenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero\nZero climate summit shoves can Goodman says well\nI think we have to see it on a great to scale because if you're going to shut down all the power plants based on cold in the work\nBut it or not oil we're talking about yeah first of all\nMy point is that if you have replaced\nCoal plants root for example gas or even oil there will be more green in the postal world my point is that if we want to make the verdict greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with\nUm when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway or have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worse agreement society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah ...\n... Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the vibrancy because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited have long county or and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the strategy and we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw on the ... when I was next sense and and I came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said no China should do something about it\nBecause they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and I feel if I was in office\nFor last week and that was a summary of the whole conference it was saying that Norway is the bad guy and put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and told them I was going to say well we are the richest country in the world why can't afford\nMaking a plan to get a false I feel good sunny\nStuff would look at the time frame\nBecause ... says well it could be draining on two twenty Seventy yeah it will it will be like if you base your numbers on ... hey it's natural Energy Agency does have to still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noise globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based\nIf we go to do a big big job we do to increase renewables about six thousand percent\nAnother huge huge job ... on on\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nIf if they think more locally and regionally about the way we plan with energy I don't think we will be in a situation that he's growing up with that we have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy futures here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nYeah I should think that we should sign sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of bringing that new technology to the market and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical cars it is it is in ... with in creating a market for new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation and I was being so there\nBecause of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security as of supply will come from renewable nuts to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this explorations that we've talked about there's only two developments and then to reach the Arctic oil and gas fields when the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries were really a growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of towards ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields that benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you were an engineer in in the room so I think you would rather studied renewable energy at our university which accounts\nFor other than oil actually we had developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it\nCan't government's fault no most of this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift or even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expansion and the amount of time sector because they were picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down the coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to wonder why don't you think you've made out there I Know but it's ... it's it sounds like it doesn't expect sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a clown how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my\nAnd that is why I I truly believe that that ... and the ... now in the energy sector is really happening and they just happening\nIn other countries that the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds of of a new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well with the coal fired power plants absolutely\nBut my argument if you will see now that when you have and then she will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWell that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new each gas say twenty five cents of Europe supply because actually that pulls away a little bit from Russia\nGave does it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the support city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas it's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian got an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the burn she comes from her first comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than ... wanted to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that region energies playing some people might not reasons of buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave policies that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to ...\nIn there and see they have drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this expression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the parents see\nAnd I don't think it's necessarily get that Norway goes to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nYou've ... that is according to the carbon projects and if you see the court and Brazil has been originally exists the summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high in Europe I guess we'll exclude colds we've recorded lay on what you mean by that call them price the\nPrice you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy by\n... there's a market inside Europe and the prices have been or to fishery low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe to a low cost when those prices starting to rise then you go to will push out cold enough push out renewables\nBut he still would have to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing nobody in Germany they are afraid they'll be able to carve impressing no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd seems to be a new energy so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity than coal fired no gas fired power plants are they are actually competing and you mentioned Russia and\nThe situation in Europe and in terms of that and I mean\nObviously Norway can't we can't take Russia's place when it comes to two guests and an exporter of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're gonna keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments but\nThis is about what kind of you do we have for your past twenty states and Europe is committed to have hero come get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector off the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't says how little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way relatively poor country Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people in my class or the way in which treats citizen says the fact that it gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on\nIf it were on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... the underpins this country that's going to keep the wealthy but with no way somehow lose some of it stasis is no way\nAfraid pot from some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you painting as far too short picture because no it was a will for states before they all came\nNowhere made a welfare state based on industry when hydro power on maritime shipping so we made the welfare state long before we discovered oil and gas remember your along the coast in Europe or to have this the only place in Europe\nWhich hasn't been any comment during history because we're always has easy accessible proteins so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food going on and thank God we didn't have an ability\nWe we have again it's hurry and society [laughter] I've been looking\nAt a lot of history and one important objective and an incentive is supposed to keep in moderate pace of extraction\nAnd when they hit that limit that sat in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years\nAnd then the ten years afterwards the almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states but we also have this workforce that we can use for other purposes so I think tying ourselves to tightly to oil we should ...\nBut but I guess I think what I'm asking is is somehow psychologically has allowed no way to punch above its weight can\nI think we could just up the oil and gas tomorrow in it wouldn't have anything to do with our views on ourselves because\nInsurers anyhow I mean we have we have a well for a state\nThat's actually very clever because we have this big

the BBC this morning for a special live NPR coverage of the ... of Brett Kavanaugh nomination to the U.S Supreme Court\nThe weeks of talked about having a are about to peak on Capitol Hill as the Senate is expected to discuss a procedural vote on the nomination which could be an indicator of how the full Senate will go the full Senate vote could come tomorrow and now to NPR's coverage it's nine thirty this is WVU are\nSo there is a possibility that people could change their minds down the line and I will say that that like I said is quite rare we are expecting some people including on you know we're still waiting to hear from Senator Susan Collins\nAnd we may hear from her at that time so it's one of those things where we're going to have to watch this throughout the day to know exactly what will happen on that final vote which will come sometime on Saturday because Senate rules require that they ... about thirty hours after they finished this procedural though today\nAnd David Greene is co hosting our coverage this morning Kelsey I you know I Wonder\nIf you could talk about how different this moment feels I mean in terms of the procedures and and what we're watching play out it is very familiar you have senators from both parties standing up and being very passionate and talking about how they feel and and there's this era of of disagreement but then these senators you know they all know each other they get along I mean you you've been reporting on how\nThe culture of the Senate feels very different right now I mean to this day and an all this context feel different\nOh absolutely this has been one of the most tense moments that I've seen 'em up here in the capital when as I walked into the Capitol today there are barricades set up ... not normal um there are barricades set up and there are more police you and then I have seen president on for just about any vote of any kind\nIt it's just become one of these major flashpoints of the tribalism that we have talked about in American politics for the past year or so\nThere seems to be driving people in both parties to their corners and as much as they are still getting some bipartisan work done they passed appropriations bills they passed a bill they they are doing those basic pieces of governance\nBut as soon as they leave the floor and even in these speeches on the floor they will talk about how unhappy they are with each other how ... the other side as well still getting just the basics the government on pushing it if they can continue to do that or if they fight flowers them far more negotiations down the road\nLet's turn to to uh or other colleague Scott Detrow congressional correspondent who's in our studios in Washington Scott David so it tell us what we're going to be watching and listening to hear a head of the ... we have Grassley I think Diane Feinstein is going to be coming out but but what what exactly are we going to be watching\nAnd we should say the vote when it begins at ten thirty or could take a very long amount of time we don't call it there's not a hard time living on Senate voted could stretch out for a half hour or more\nBefore then we're going to hear from four key voices in this debate we're hearing from Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley right now his counterpart the or the ranking Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein will speak next she's played a key role in all of this she of course had that information about Christine Blasey Ford\nFor many weeks before sharing it with other Democratic senators Feinstein said\nShe was trying to respect for its confidentiality request not to share the information but Republicans have repeatedly pointed Weinstein holding that information as one sign that Democrats are didn't necessarily want a fair ... airing of these these\nCharges but rather waiting for the last minute after that we're going to hear from the two leaders a Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer\nAnd that should bring us right up to the point where they begin voting\nAnd and one question I have gotten to know you've been covering the politics around all of this has has this debate this impassioned debate that seems to be gripping so many people in the country has it changed the dynamic heading into this midterm election in terms of momentum on on on both sides and both parties\nWe think it has and the question is will that last remaining month to month can be a long time especially in our current news environment like years and somebody pointed out that anonymous ah op ed from a Trump Administration senior advisor was about a month ago so I don't remember\nI remember that the vaguely remember something in the past about that yeah\nBut you know NPR actually had a poll that we know got a lot of tension within the political world showing that the enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans has been all but a race for mid summer until now\nAnd a lot of people see the Kavanaugh fight as a key reason a lot of Republicans\nFeeling feeling a under sees and you've seen a shift in the way Republicans talk about Chuck Grassley on the floor just now talking about Democrats are targeting Kavanaugh saying the fix was in ... Republicans have gotten more and more aggressive in painting this as cabinet under siege\nA compared to the early days where they were saying Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be\nHeard let's go back to the floor of the United States Senate where Senator Chuck Grassley is continuing and perhaps beginning to wrap up his speech and listen to a little bit more of that\nSexual assault even under the lower standard of proof she concluded quote\nA he said she said cases in credit really difficult to prove\nBut this case is even worse than that Dr Ford identify\nOther witnesses to the event so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or fail to reach corroborate them for the reasons discuss below I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor couldn't bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy\nTheir preponderance of evidence standard and the whole\nSo we have thoroughly investigated judge Kavanaugh's background in addition to\nThe prior six FBI fall feel feel background investigations were the interviews of nearly a hundred and fifty people who are known judge Kevin on his entire life\nThe committee also separately and thoroughly investigated every credible allegations that we received\nAre more than twenty committee staff members have work night and day over the last many weeks tracking down virtually all leads and at the request of undecided members the FBI reopen judge Kavanaugh's background investigation for another week\nThe FBI interviewed ten more people related to the latest credible sexual assault allegations and the FBI confirmed\nWhat we Senate investigators already concluded\nThat is is there's nothing in the supplemental FBI background investigation report that we didn't already know these on corroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by a judge Kavanaugh\nAnd neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI\nCould locate any
