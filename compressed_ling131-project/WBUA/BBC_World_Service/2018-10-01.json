global repercussions were immediate ... economist and senior year in advice and\nIt took a very very short period of time for the crisis to spread throughout the entire world economy\nAnd the image

necessarily the right way to do with the Franklin Roosevelt had a different idea\nOn march fourth Nineteen thirty three what he said\nLet me ask my believe that the only thing we have\nThis year was absolutely\nThat started at the heart of world capitalism on Wall street itself or so that have made it even more frightening because Wall Street has are not very frightened when terrible things happened to poor people but they're very frightened when bad things happen to rich people\nThe extraordinary thing about the financial crisis is that it happened in finance as this is the most

regulations and laws as much as the people are to blame\nI think there are two so some things that we have to think about\nI'm pretty sure that must've been things going on here which was a fraudulent too close to it but the truth is and this is I think really frightening thing\nThat much to the war is legal in a way was frightening about it is that we could get into such a terrible mess\nWhen people were doing things that can be very risky\nBut taking risk is not illegal taking risk ... ... the financial institutions that full so you could say and I think I Would say that the real problem was that what was passed the legal turned out to be spectacularly dangerous\nThe financial crisis was the first crisis to highlight the underlying weakness of globalization\nBill many benefits increased integration and it does lead to unprecedented developments and progress in many areas however it also leads to new vulnerabilities and into dependency which is why more cooperation and

you\nJust remind us sat why does the government wanted to demolish it\nThere's a few levels you have to understand here the the the reasoning that the government is giving is that it's as simple

Palestinian authority is and ah most world leaders forcibly displaced saying that protected population in occupied territory\nTook great for each of international law and on the geopolitical level it the location of the village is very very important um it's it's in a place of the west bank where if\nThe Palestinian population is removed and Israeli settlements come in to replace them where this

record is twenty sixteen an El Nino year when the conditions in the Pacific ocean put a huge amounts of extra heat into the atmosphere there was all points of remarkable weather event this year started out with a ... thing and I didn't mention that twenty eight team was going to be combat\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all but so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThough that impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty eight teams so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of the system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out or around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually will captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey sticks jobs gr off tossing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the first version was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yeah fine up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks of lead nights among annual averages fu ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann that ... these global averages early parts of the climate story ... ... the ... the masses to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we sort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages\nAn earth to continue to increase it and\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise from melting ice sheets et cetera\nBut climate more generally refers to the statistics of the weather in those statistics can be the averages because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes and so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes\nAre changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time on our television screens in in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless Oslo to watch to be cautious weather of some kind of group does happen every yeah\nOf course you know write that one and I think when I went and not necessarily harming our what we can protect either I mean why do echinacea or any of them are and I think this summer and it's right\nTo eight different or something that will quite rare and is now a relatively call in and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world as the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived periods of heat to heat waves\nThe atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods at the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you'd take extreme drought you combine it with extreme heat\nYou're going to get wildfires so the science there is pretty basic as I said before it isn't rocket science or as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is defective climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream in a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger an apple two ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the high struck the jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks they also put another high over Siberia with high heat that and over North America\nWhere the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California with seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Margot mind\nCalifornia is getting warmer in warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um it's getting a drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress um the summer droughts\nAre so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires in what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season the California Winter isn't\nNow California appears to have\nA perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was the Thomas wildfire last winter in Southern California only this summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some other wildfires that broke out\nSo California now has in essence a perpetual fire season in that an indication of the\nThe profound challenged the climate changes already\nPosing to\nProvide for our historic um Oregon the largest fire forty now bigger than the size\nThese are the conditions\nLift inexperienced fine then yeah queen David some fire experts at the University of California\nCompounded the tree stressing effects of long term child was enough rain in northern California last winter to stimulate a search of bras gross to add an abundance of drawing on the growth which fueled foster homes\nSome parts of California we had a hundred and eighty percent\nOf normal for graft production so I think a lot of fire people were thinking you know this just isn't looking good and all it's going to take is an ignition on the right day with the right whether to cause a real problem\nAnd so when the Carr Fire started I was over here I live on the coast and suffered from some of the hot weather and things like that but\nPretty immediately that fire was raising Harris and my husband actually went\nUm I I think we're all feeling tension that we're not used to feeling around fire in California we've had it you know the last ten years we've had unprecedented fires almost every every year every other year but the Carr Fire felt different\nThe Carr Fire affecting a major residential time walls and it's so terrifying but the big one was to find the Mendocino hills actually a parent finds that started on July the twenty seventh ... only finally confirmed extinguished last week\nThere was the ranch fire and the river fire and those were burning near to each other on the north and west sides of clear lake which is one of the largest lakes in California\nIt was during the height of the summer said the hottest days over a hundred degrees solid winds blowing through those areas is\nJust all the right conditions for fat tire spread and extreme fire behavior and so this payers grew so quickly\nThey were sometimes burning twenty thousand acres in at twenty four hour period or or more maybe\nThe the rate of growth made it very difficult for Cruz to to get a handle on it and they ended up burning four hundred and ten thousand acres and I we all have heard that that's the biggest fire in California history I think that the next biggest was last year in Southern California at two hundred and eighty thousand acres so\nA very large area\nOf course it's not just being heat waves and fires well California bunt in Canada south India they have the worst monsoon fighting in a hundred years\nMild

your why the movement has been around for a couple of years but you on you so the fact you're from scoring virtually zero in the polls will let that ... owned by the way and give us we'll let you know little bankrupt lead for language and they want to figure out what all they want to get to is this\nThe only country in Europe right now where the left in its more radical form is actually doing\nWell or at least gaining traction with a significant part of the population is in the United kingdom and if so what makes an you know the u._k. very well want in your view makes Jeremy cool Britain's Labour Party different from so many of the other left movements in Europe and across the world today\nWhat but it has had a lot to do with it because ... has been a slap in the face of progressive independently of what their view about Brexit is what I mean I was gonna say labor party view and breakfast is extraordinarily confused so I I ... down fusing issue if you're not confused when you're facing a confusing issue you're fanatic\nBut given the opens position on bricks that remains even off the Labour Party conference unclear I Can't see how bricks it can be the driver of the moments when I'm Down to what you\nSaid it was it create the ... in this country that British democracy and its role in the world and not be taken for granted it means to be invented let's look at look at the the bright side\nThis gives the people who have Britain and opportunity do what they consider their position in the world and I believe that a judge me has been doing a very good job\nAt a recognizing that the last ... years of privatization of moving towards a business model that effectively tied to the economy's growth on two bottles on the housing bubble and on the city of London and he's closing a reassessment of they\nEven with that or is interesting and so you would say because you talked about the last generation of politicians in the u._k. who in your view played that sort of near liberal economic ... you would say the Tony Blair was nowhere left of center politician would you\nWith us from me on the one hand he was because he gave a lot of money to the national health service money that they thought they said stop the national health service off but at the very same time\nHe did it by aligning himself fully with the city of London turning a blind eye to the private money man thing of the private banks and creating the circumstances that lead to because I was in an eight and to the collapse into ... and the night so\nI'm all the the the current shadow chancellor of the sticker here in the case has made a big speech where he's painted a picture of a radical economic program including just one example the man the tree imposition on business in the u._k. ever needs to have\nTen percent of ... given to the workers in the company the dividends would then go to those workers and\nThat would be a cap on the amount of dividend to be received by each worker on the access beyond that would go to the governments are actually been a huge huge corporate tax rate would fundamentally change the relationship between the states and the corporate sector in the u._k. in a very sort of left of center way\nDo you really believe the British people are going to vote\nFor that I think so and I'm very glad to have a a John Macdonald put forward there have been proposing some McDonald about in the program we eras things you've been saying for cyber opposing it precisely that with one difference\nI've been proposing the creation of a social ... fund where the ten percent of the shadows after every IDEO or capitalizing by corporations go into the public will fund\nAnd then the dividends are distributed to the former universe some basic different whereas\nThe Labour Party is leaving them out amongst the workers we need those corporations but what I think is very important to remember this is not even need the money factor yet this is part of the Labour Party conversing may go into the manufacturers hope it does it is a very interesting discussions are that we must have even thought it must have\nAbout the division between competition and labor but it differently statement once upon a time when and that sort of spoiled the machine the machine belonged duster list and then the investors who claimed that profits of the machine produced for the company\nBut these days of Google and Facebook when every time you such and your Google Search engine for something you're providing capital to Google and no one is getting a defense for that except for Google we have to reconsider property rights over that intensive capital and live that everybody is the only party in the world that he's doing these\nOkay so for you definitely UK labor party represents a beacon of hope but throughout this interview you've been saying we must do this we must do that and I've been pointing out that actually in the real world and the world of politics and opinion polls your ideas are not gaining very much traction if we leave aside the United kingdom so I Do is\nIs there any way I look at some point say to yourself you know what that my credit politics doesn't what we're going to find new ways one labor MP ... say she said recently and there's no such as that we need to topple the government and we can't do it on the ballot bumps we will do it with a general strike by working with the trade unions is that your kind of full\nOf what's actually it's like there's no legal last time I checked illegal immigrants high is right now that your view on when you're all kinds of politics needs to go\n... ... let's be very clear to because these are dangerous times with their eyes of extremists around the world and we have to be very clear in our language and the the way that we support democracy so to answer that actually I'm going to quote from with some church for\nThe Democratic process is a pretty awful it's pretty nasty but did the best of all of this and we have to be prepared to defend it with our lives I think that this would be the ... faithful would answer to your question now where the strikes are part of the political democratic roses I Do believe

I Believe in our hearts as long as our hearts he made the decision to happen who's learned\nWas that before did or\nDid have a better place to be very ... [noise]\nWhat happened to the villages was last year I Will you probably haven't\nWith that he wrote an nervously hopped into a car and vanished talk of full three locations around the ... in this area villages evicted from their homes phones with little or no compensation perhaps the real question\nIs what all of this is full ... actually deliver on the dream of showing and the new green city\nPrevent the em some again from the University of North Carolina\nJust is a really top down planning project in that politically that has high profile you\nHave studied over the last two or three decades all of the range of these infrastructure project caliphate GM is another one isn't it a port in northern China champion by Hu Jintao or a former prime yeah but it's come to nothing I mean there have been white television as well as success stories in China\nYeah tell the din wants to become an ecological zero sort of an emission poster child but it didn't really succeed\nAre there are many reasons behind it but a shoreline this case just keep in mind that we didn't the next couple of years I think the government definitely has the capacity to relocate many of the state owned businesses\nTo this new area so it's a little bit different from the other big new projects in China this one is really read top down\nPrevent the young ... and that report came out a year ago nobody seemed to be happening just then since those days are the government has issued more plans for the development proven that does seem to remain slugs\n... city planner for ... and new district uh he he ... he's the city planning and she said that they will range of environmental problems in the area including a high flooding risk and poor access to transportation this is what he's in the speech\nIf these two problems and not to be solved it will be like building a ... no rubbish tip you meet the ... the government props up for this new town\nWell gay real will ... is the Shanghai bureau chief for the Financial Times he went to the site recently this is what he so\nIt's definitely still early days for this mega project I visited when they were just completing the centerpiece of the first days the film on public service Centre and that is a kind of mini city within it and he then include electric cars charging stations and\nSensors are facial impound recognition twenty thousand sensors around the whole city is a future hotel that include human being free check in they planted thousands of trees around the center but beyond that public service Centre it's still quite\nA quite barren with basically still be able to lead an elementary surrounding the central service center\nWell George magnet is still with us to discuss this and indeed the wider infrastructure plans of the Chinese government\nIt the point is that the China has this record has done for twenty thirty forty years it's been just spend it wait three rocky times it will spend money on the big planning project and it's gained a large dividend out of doing that\nIt has a historically on something changed in a two thousand they actually use the financial crisis in the west starts to sink ripples through China um\nAnd uh it was actually a time when the Chinese economy itself was actually going for a little bit of its own kind of tipping point\nSo really what's happening in the last ten years in particular I Would say\nAbout the the Chinese government has actually relied on infrastructure for two reasons one to offset downturns in the economy so every time they called me looks like it's looking a little bit wobbly um you get ... to build more infrastructure intellect more money to infrastructure projects in provinces and local governments\nAre on the other is because they they really believe this um the rhetoric about a urbanization leads to you know better growth and she's just she huge contentious issue because some of us believe actually the sequencing works the other way round that actually you get better urbanized ... from having good growth model\nCars actually if it was a simple then every would you need for groceries just build big cities\nLots of ... ... a declining yields from building more things you can't go on building things forever and it wasn't always give you the same return to the ...\nYes you can eat and I think again you know like so many things in everything is so new on so if you look at China's a residential buildings and its infrastructure of population\nOf course it still some way behind Japan a soul in Asia or you know American cities and European cities but um you know as new kinds that kind of famous British economist wants that in the long run we're all dead\nAnd what we have to be concerned about really is about the missile allocation of capital in the short term which actually can lead to you know empty apartment blocks ... and I'm actually quite a lot of problem\nAnd it can also lead a goal to huge amounts of public debt ... how big is Chinese public debt well\nUh it is about the end of two thousand Seventeen was around three hundred and fifty percent of its national income which is just over three times as big as it was ten years ago\nThat sounds like a very big number it is a big number I mean we don't really know to be fair where the the there is any magical number at which point you know a crisis ensues but certainly the the miss allocation of resources the cumulative increase in\nDifficulties which smaller Chinese banks are facing um funding bad loans in other words they have to raise deposits and\nIf they can't raise them from households they are raising them from increasingly a novelist Harlem uncertain short term sources and I think these things are contrived to to bring about kind of some uncertainty now\nYou've written a book called red flags I mean how much jeopardy is China or in from ... another ex\nWell I think I'm trying to justice and the only problem joined the faces that it's also facing you know kind of a confluence of lots of problems aging and you know technology um currency stability and so on the difference that I think uh the last few years of made is that ... governance system has changed China\nA ... now I'm not clear whether the intensely autocratic society with top down guidance and control is the\nMost efficient [noise] that's it that's all we have time for Joe ... new
