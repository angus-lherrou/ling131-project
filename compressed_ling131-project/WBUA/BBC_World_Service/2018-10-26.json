tactful when it comes to ... said what kind of strategy when you've been ...\nTom's got such a drive in such fact is that he's already owns the next thing so easily decided things so I tend to yeah if I really feel strongly about something then I Will come through another chef will the manager or something\nI'm always die from pi tasting horn [laughter] so yeah I'll I'll put my ideas through somebody else sometimes\nYeah I think they're really really clear about what they're doing yeah times may tells me that she she just want someone to listen and kind of support be there for her yeah\nAt home me and my daughter like a real good would've freed bar for the game is um she's looking for us\nTell us or them she has to make what the cost more small typing and under the ...\nThe guy on the line he gets as well I think that there's a lot more people involved and tasting the food so a dish that we might change\nWill take good six months to get a she asked in the restaurant it's not like oh today ah we've got a whole will stick at all does none of that not only is it just about the customers it's about getting it right every single time\nIt was very difficult to Indian food because you have to go to the Berlin striped with the spices and the parents here you're introduced spice ... start middle and then so you have to be practiced remain the consistency ride them to strike every time you do it\nWhen it comes to cooking as high and your partner's just sick of this at the end of the day when it when it's the weekend when they have a day off and they came to getting the case you know ... bath\nI cook in the kitchen to survive but I Know how to cook a book Tom conned help himself cooking on econ help himself fiddling and ... doing extra bits and bumped so ... is that's a new ... busy could find a value\nAnd move into the sink [noise] it's not a woman thing 'cause I'm a very good welder Tom ... well [noise] um but I there's a presence in the kitchen you tend to kind of move towards way you'll best suited and unfortunately I think\nIt kind of really into cooking for you then you know do you think you are less good cook\nI think I'm a little bit brave a book because then all that all the time to kind of a nice treat when they do it's not like he's in real time pushing everyone out he knows what he's doing but he had any shops one meal [noise]\nSo I'm I'm like keep it going all week person to sing for my baby bully and an ... yeah it doesn't spoil it it's not like Scott nice kitchen\nWas that you ... do you cook at home or does write me come home and and they some cooking\n[laughter] we don't have any hard and fast rules whoever is home cooks so or whoever's home or not\nTired [laughter] that's all [laughter] about\nYou Sam do you do much cooking\n[noise] so when we have family gathering or friends gathering may is willing to call for everyone\nIn daily life actually I Do cook for myself but very very basic because she comes home very late but if we have leisure time during we can we do enjoy like\nA very nice date night at home and then she will call for me because I Would spend three hours\nTo cope a really nice steak salad but she only take like thirty minutes so I was like I'm I give up so you do it\nI remember in the early days I started trying really hard and doing the cooking thing when he came home from work and even when\nHe when you've been eating nice food old I eat when picky stuff\nWell what do they eat yeah when they were heading chefs half guilty passions today tend to the instant NATO's and crushed in front of the television when they're hiring\nTomes code meet a guy he likes lots of kind of ... just called me was\nAbout ... just she tends to them junk food or quick fixes when she gets hired\nFriday nights we may be right from scratch loving on every Friday night she told me to make up for her\nDo you make it for her like ... or you know like she's almost coming home and\nYour your tax mainly all home when ten minutes [laughter] skinny ... through tax me yeah I'm\nSo tired I don't want to come home and do anything she didn't say oh can you please put it on the plate I'll go for me what hard [laughter]\nIt sounds like all three of you give your partner is an incredible amount of support to enable them to stay the soles of what they do I mean that you actually put your career is very successful stopped her on the sides to help the tonight than some of these restaurants at break that was I had lost a few years but lost it many more or you know you had\nThree and I did begin to make was get after about three is a there were lots of scope does in in the back offices and things that haven't been cost yet because we couldn't afford it\nUh but yes support with massive with especially beginning we had very little money and very little time and I was front of house ball I'm an architect ah accounts and\nOh job lady I wanted him to just be able to cook\nAnd why why do you give up your writing\nCareer goals for awhile to help him with has what was your mind\nI find it quite difficult to create if I have it on tidy drill and ... and that and also his motivation was to help me make on compromise though so\nI didn't have to worry particularly if mortgage had been paid all the electricity bill or anything I could just carry on making great stuff\nIt was an investment of time and I didn't feel like it was giving up because I think the the more things that you do in your life is going to give you move store in narrative to you or\nWhen he was supporting Tom too she becomes such a successful chef did you feel you were doing some saying notable to buy an aging someone to produce such good said did you was that ... that you believed him or he was doing\nI lose just supporting I didn't think he'd be that good I Know I didn't feel like there's been no but we were just digging in scope to the again you know we we clean the windows would needs cleaning worshipers we need to Russia as what we do\nSome if you are listening to the best describes all the help and support that she has told me he was saying well we do you relate to that cause you yourself up your own job to help me out more\nI Need to quit my job to be a freelance to support myself in order to help her to open the first restaurant and I got to do my freelance work from nine AM to like\nEight PM so finishing all my work and that out how to help her out to do the branding and everything like brings storming\nMaybe until two AM so continuously for six months in crime ones is crazy that time was crazy and then when ... her restaurant just opened like I finished my work is six PM and then I go to the restaurant at the reception and a server\nAnd working due to am I think that happened continues for six months for me I think that's incredibly good experience because if I don't experience that I don't understand what she was doing a show of they do really need a lot of physical and emotional support\nI'm with you on the males and the time\n[laughter] and I go on the porch about you what kinds of sacrifices have you have to make some rye made to base I successful because she's won a very few female Indian chef ... on the u._k. restaurants saying this and say\nWe put all our money in the restroom sorry Hungary investor behind those and they were just up pressure on both of us to make good Indian food and uh so it's not all the money but I think definitely does not even for the money I think the most thing is that you learn Mr mum\nSo she's only been in the evenings to walk to dumb like last year we saw dome undecided that ruling open three days a week now\nShe got a lot of media work outside the restaurant you have to travel a lot as well so she wants to spend more time with the children and so we go to restaurant children and me\nAnd my older yeah [laughter] yeah I was for her [laughter] I'm not a couple of pieces and then like that's um\nHome of Boston's

joins me now on the line from Kabul welcome to how to\nThank you Steve that to be here we speak of course after the parliamentary elections would you a shame that the\nWay those elections works out with so many Afghans are facing the possibility of going to the polls because of insecurity and the lack of government control of key parts of your territory\nThey Bruce Lee exposed ever thing that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban are and there is precedents of attacks on polling stations the Afghan people defied all of that in came out to vote I think that speaks for itself on what the Afghan people's verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life\nThis was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the Andy SF\nUh I think they did a tremendous thing a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community or were much larger scale than we had this year\nLet's look at reality I I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those three or ... million Afghans who didn't go to the polls in face of Taliban threats I Do not belittle that bravery for one second but here's the reality of your own electoral commission and\nSay that at least a quarter of polling stations across the country didn't open because of security concerns we know the whole swaths of territory including Kandahar\nAnd the guy's name a there was no voting because of security concerns of course there may be some more voting next week we're not quite sure we know that your own a transparent election foundation and the country found that the biometric systems were not working and many of the polling stations which were open\nAnd if one takes all of that the guy's a plus the dozens killed and more than a hundred wounded around polling stations one has to conclude\nMe personally as an African to know that we failed our security forces from a policy standpoint and I'm dedicated me and the national Security Council will be working to resolve all of those issues\nI issued a statement to our people\nOur security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices in our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of services that our soldiers in on the frontline deserve they have not failed us but I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to ...\nLives and their families you know what I'm mindful of them have mindful of something that Hamid Karzai's former president said as he was leaving

who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life either from Nathan forces all from your own Afghan forces unfold waltz because this is you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Afghans we don't\nThis is our country if it does not winnable we have no other option we are in this country and we have to live our lives and protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show is to tell you and and your viewers that\nThis is not the Afghanistan that you only see it through TV there is so much more to that context I understand that there is only so much news\nA space for one son and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is a transform country whether you look at it physically or you look at it socially I'm a ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country\nAh grew up in the war our aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nTo help us along the way they know that your investments in this country has not gone to waste yeah that's where a war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves it's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a it it it takes more than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks to reason with support who are being helping\nAnd equipment and training our security right is to provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe we don't have so much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support of allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand of them\nBut he clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing mood in America is privatizing the U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke recently so Eric Prince formula that had the Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action\nHow would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contract to force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our our life we're fighting terrorism and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now\nIt turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's\nAsk gun and why is all my ... he had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know that those talks were taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nWe knew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations\nThe Afghan government has the initiative on the peace and reconciliation process we held two major conferences here in Kabul called the ... process to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire wet well\nUntil you and I'll and I'll I'll you know just because we have no idea I don't think it's\n'cause it's about who really is driving\nEfforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports that sources saying quote ... that I have these meetings with uh the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly met them\nOn Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government ... meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one confirmation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detail than what you see in a news report\nAdjust because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ... you didn't know he is very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't want to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban\nAnd it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided that far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own any political process with the Taliban now the Americans seemed to be saying no\nWe're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident\nUh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are uh in ... I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process\nOf guns do own and drive the peace process and that's the only way for success\nIt's not that we we want the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be ashamed that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm are asked by a ... it through a process where I don't that process and it's very clear\nA final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMissed the national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's rights to a stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell well the Taliban contend elections there more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite death threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place and Afghan society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and see where whether the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that dry fear can they provide governance and and the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a ... and then in a democratic process and let the Afghan people choose\n... we have to end of that but I Do thank you very much for joining me on hotdog\nDistribution of BBC World service in the U.S has supported by Elijah Craig bourbon and crafted in small batches for a\nFull flavored sipping experience forty seven percent alcohol by volume Elijah Greg Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey parts town Kentucky think wisely drink wisely and buy for X. dot com empowering traders to seize opportunities and currency markets since Nineteen Ninety nine\nFor X. dot com it's your World Trade it for X trading involves significant risk applause\n\nFrom Boston University this was Ninety point nine W.

U. P. propping up Theresa May's government and have enough control at Westminster where\nTheir views have to be considered seriously by the British Government in a way that they've never had to do before\nThat was freelance journalist Amanda focused and talking to my colleague ... ... you're listening to business daily and today we're exploring the issue that could and Britain's Brexit negotiations\nThe Irish board a lot of history of division explains why the ... has become such a sticking point for the Brexit negotiations that's been old to a parent\nIn the British Parliament this week went pro breakfast and piece from the British prime minister his own party\nHas been threatening to try and ... that has been lurid talk of a political assassination of foot with Theresa May ... anonymous sources of cool the killings on she survived so far\nBut the border issue remains so how might it be resolved if indeed it ever is I'm joined by all UK politics correspondent Rob Watson\nNo it's been a tough week for two reasons maybe you could see it outside of ... how she felt this where you see you're\nAbsolutely right you could say that most weeks and I think those ... on one level she has some good some bad days in terms of a ... relationship with her I can only describe it as a ... divided conservative policy\nBut I think ... doesn't change is the big picture which really does what rather grim and challenging for her and that is\nHow long enough to she got a deal about Britain's withdrawal and future relationship with Europe that somehow satisfies your feet brawl divided conservative policy which doesn't want any businesses in the u._k. too much which doesn't put a Boulder Northern Ireland and and and that was enough which sense as far as the ... twenty seven\nSyrup you've laid out a complex set of of conditions that needs to be filled that older different policies that needs to be satisfied but I actually the parameters of that is a fairly clear on because Europe has kind of pretty much light down you know what it needs to see how Smith the\nIran ... writes that I think in many ways that's why we are in the horrible fix that that we are in that if you like there's a contradiction in the Bronx of projects and ... you is prepared to offer I mean if we're really going to strip it back to basics Justin I'm if you\nIf you think about what the what was what was leave all the violence it was taking back like quote control of ... those laws and um money well it's quite tricky to figure out how you\nWith the European Union and not have a bold and northern on its\nUnless of course the European Union was to say guess what you can actually have a book deal you kind of something special we will recognize British rules and regulations\nAs in hot equivalent ... and that is why we are in the fix that we're end up basically Britain has been saying we'd like everything that we used to like about him being members of a you none of the things that we did like\nIn the ... was saying was she gotta be kidding\nSo what we're seeing is the ... middle of a negotiation about how much should they should brinkmanship how much of that is both sides kind of holding out for the best deal they can possibly get how much compromise can you do you think it's possible within their positions that the two policies\nI think some of it as brinkmanship a dozen things that you felt like compromising much cause that things will hang on a minute you know the people who voted to leave it you'll mess\nYou clear it up and he clearly Theresa May hasn't got very much room for compromise given those are much mentioned divisions an apology so I guess what's going to happen as a flat so rarely if someone put a gun to my head was to say that that will be maybe they'll scrape together a deal but one that\nPuts off all those issues that we've been talking about just a more exactly will the future relationship\nBe what will happen with trade what will happen precisely about the border so they sort of settle on making sure that there is in chaos next march march of next year when Britain leaves the European Union but all those issues who's going to compromise has the future relationship because of what\nThat that'll get sort of kicked since that transition period between next march and the end of twenty twenty\nBut listen if I Can't agree again if they're struggling to agree just on the divorce agreement just on this withdrawal agreement then how life is it that they'll come to a final settlement they'll come to\nThe the we get enough compromise between the two parties to come to a settlement that there'll be able to actually find some kind of a deal for ...\nIt's a fantastic question ... and of course it's it's one in a way when when he was good at is what drives ... people really enthusiastic about Brecht said crazy they think hang on a minute this these talks transition could go on forever and ever\nBut it also all those people who would have preferred to remain in the European Union saint who say this this just looks like a recipe for kind of chaos and disaster Britain's sort of in the European Union but ... so they're not not prospects of a long long process pleases neither remain as an all leave us\nOkay let's just go back to the issue that these programs about the Irish border they're struggling to a great for the withdrawal agreement this divorce agreement how are they going to come to a sacrament in the in the longest I bought my assessment of the border look like who's likely to compromise

... not quite clear about it's a it's a little bit of a mystery why the Reverend Richard Charlton frayed bill Richmond is also a bit of a mystery because\nHe himself died not long after bill Richmond left America and the rest of his slaves ubiquitous to somebody else he didn't for any of them so why was he allowed Richmond together\nIs a little bit mysterious he with his parents\nThat also is something that we don't know I mean his boss is no record that in the parish registers I have a theory which is the bill Richmond was a mixed ethnicity\nAnd I think it's possible that maybe the Reverend Sharpton himself with somebody from his household may have been ... father ... might explain why he allowed bill to leave all gave him his freedom but that is only a theory\nAnd so how did he make his way when it came to ... because it was a while before he started getting a vote in books he wasn't it\nIt was I mean initially he was in the past the household up in the northeast of England and El Paso you'll have to say it was a sort of uncommon lily and the lights on and kind and generous man he insured the bill was educated that he was given a cost in reading and writing he will say that had him a friend to still cabinet maker as well say bill actually lots of trade so they were\nQuite a few blocks systems in Britain about fun but I think that what many who could read and write

and so on an instructor the off the books and he was seen as one of the best books and she says of the day competitively he didn't actually stop medical boxing until he was in his forties which I think is quite extraordinary did he have Italian family\nYes the married when he was living in New York share in the Seventy nine teams he married a white English woman called Mary ... very much about her but we do know that they stayed married throughout the rest of his life\nOh of course was thinking about you know the possibility that we might find his remains and I guess attention then turns to his ancestors and whether there are and he's still alive\nYeah I Would absolutely love to know so far I've tried everything I come to find somebody who's related to bill rich but I'm drawing a blank the traces of his children die ousted about Eighteen forties or fifties in terms of public records it's possible that maybe some of them emigrated abroad\nAs of yet so I'm not found a living relative a bill rich but\nIf we could find living relatives\nWhich put some of these series to the test in terms of his parents' age I'm trying to discover more about his genetic makeup\nSo what would you want to happen to his remains if they are found or would like DNA Analysis to be done if possible much there is always talking about that he might be related to the Charleston family they're all members of
