have left and right and their impact on democracy on a panel this week in the studio with me hit Adrian popped professor of politics the University of Kent\nNine or ... a novelist and journalist yes among lecture on government at Harvard University in Cambridge being bother Gopal electorate in English at Cambridge University welcome to you all I'd like to begin ... each of you\nWill seize identity politics what do you mean by it Priya\nIdentity politics is I think a ... that has been given and is used to describe\nPlanes for civil rights claims to full citizenship and planes to social justice and identity politics\nIs I think a somewhat ... which has been given to them on equality and full citizenship and to social justice and I I'm not happy with the um because I think it's used in ways\nThat are very questionable and that have less to do with identity of a sudden than with questions of justice\nWe can talk about that's a little bit more Adrian past what does it mean to you that's politics is really about individualized identity individuals are small groups very often focal minorities that's how I arrived jogging for quality and inclusion and democracy but I think there's a danger that\nDifference is now elevation of a commonality that we're stressing Everytime makes this different from other individuals and groups and we don't talk enough about the things that binds us together citizenship\nHumanity the fact that we inhabit at the same places that maybe we are part of the same work places and also the same communities in and countries so there's a problem I think in mass its response to individualize and but I think it's\nKnow a collective response yes among you know to me into politics his crops two very different phenomena that are going on at the same time it's a lot of confusion stems\nFrom mixing goes up so in one hand what we're seeing at the moment is a lot of a minority groups claiming equality claiming riots in the face of real historical injustice an ongoing discrimination and on the other hand I think we are seeing\nAnd sort of movements but as Adrian just said I sort of trying to re center the basis of liberal democracy from being about individuals to being ... about groups as ... elements of the state line of trying to [noise]\nI think the term ... who here's around the idea that we are defined by our power relationships and that who we are is primarily dictated by groups into which we were born in that way I regarded as anti individual for my own heart\nIt's not healthy to engage and picked him on whether you up like a wise or whether you're a venue message or any gender and sexuality whatsoever\nThat real victims those real oppression exploitation\nBut the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affect everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... or ... or is that\nThat doesn't ah to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have some you know recognize the vets exactly in fact what\nThe tea movement did they said look\nBusiness love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what heterosexuals want and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit with them will just society would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big stick\nA very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin American stand up comedian who was enough with a wide them out and go into sort of dramatic last week and a half no spot is\nUm I was amazed by the way in which the movie which tells in a mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial marriage\nStarted to be attacked from the left\nSaying what isn't it problematic that this round protecting this has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden invest debate the right was saying\nWho has if you find somebody who you've with enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and was parts of the left\nBut some of food that was problematic exercise leaving me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what society one ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage where there's more contact between cultures rather than one where everybody has to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation those I knew the picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably ... identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the ... has come up\nI find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value is\nThe way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... like a kind of cheesy a wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left on my life\nWho even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of hierarchical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheets about all falling in love and living happily ever after moving we don't want that takes into account a button all Hollywood wrong call\nNine eleven would bring you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on that issue they'll GB T rights and the way that's changed but feel free to comment on what pre as well I think\nThe what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian\nAnd all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful illness on a an an ordinary social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party and there's somebody across the room you're white person there is a someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani budget\nYou're gonna think twice about approaching them or I dig it lies why because you're afraid of saying something wrong because you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect\nThere's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful Asia\nIt's the intolerance that line will just mentioned it's also a political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together somehow to differences defined was more than the cannot see of course they're real differences out and that should be celebrated\nBut they also they're coming out and she says her we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus that shouldn't be warm\nBut the memories simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow from everything else and that's the way that's what you said on\nSaturday on strike and I I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I for the hand wringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example of the only example that would get unless black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by big lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo so let me give you a couple of examples the first one I wanted to make clear but I think a lot last night in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to an understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think of as one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and the this is a a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers are those are true\nBut the majority of people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the relatively small portion of the oval American population\nBut as black so I think actually this conversation would be a more fruitful and we'll put it to the education is if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice\nBut you know what if you are a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go out to parties you should also be worried because actually there's white\nPeople got shot by the police as well I Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this high off ... people have never lived in multicultural multi religious monolingual states this is new new\nSituation that we find ourselves in why is it so difficult to negotiate now Adrian\nOne of the reasons why I think it's difficult and I guess is 'cause a lot of institutions and practices that used to build bridges between clause between ... and other\nGroups in society some fee no longer functional physical policies trade unions churches synagogues temples ... some of them may still be growing but on the whole these institutions that bridge building institutions and institutions in the community is I'm not working and I think that's why people feel\nThis is a sense of powerlessness is a sense of of the ... and then they're holding on to something which can be a centralized and I think the problem with this uncertainty is by definition exclusive\nBriefly ... I think mass migration has something to do with it we're talking about minorities but they're very large minorities which means that collectively they have a larger voice and then of course technology is an amplifier Russia\nWhen it's not you disagreed with premise I Do think about the search for you all democracies in the world with founded on a mono ethnic ... conception of themselves and find God who started to challenge that we now live in societies which most people embrace the idea of it the more ethnic societies that that is something that I talked to quite new Korea\nI think we have a situation where a very small number of people in the world have a very large proportion of the world's wealth\nAnd one of the ways in which that are addressing inequality and the upset around any quality is putting a false and indeed authoritarian narrative out that\nWay by its minorities and black people and women and ... people and gay people who are ruining lives with their so called identity politics and that means we're not looking at the people who are actually uh you know responsible for inequality and suffering\nOkay pledge to think about that thank you for an outside panel being bother Gopal yes among Lionel Shriver an Adrian pops we have to take a short break but just to remind you do let's just say what you think of the program or any ideas the topics you'd like us to look into you can email us that the real story at BBC don't handle UK or treat me at\n... and if you enjoy the program we have a podcast you can subscribe to just such a BBC the real story in your poll coughed up\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

who happened to be wide\nAlso you know will rebel against the status quo and and who are we to tell them to somehow that I didn't see much as less than half of all this how does not like that and I

do methane cycle belonging and and they were going to place to people to communities incomes as much as we can all today that feeling out of politics I only got to\nThe obvious question that footage and that has been loaning so who onto wet and ease positive reasons right into the politics that actually it is people expressing a sense of on the longing that actually that that identity that was that the fool whether it was the nation whether it was the town whether it was the religion didn't express who they were\nWell you had a noted about how there are these are the rise of the extremes and um I saw the same thing in Northern Ireland or after the good friday agreement shouldn't saying on the one hand and the ... on the other\nTook over completely and they were at the far end of the political spectrum and the middle just dropped out they became tiny little no account parties and I think that's because Northern Ireland was a place in and has been for some time\nThat thinks in terms of group memberships very strictly\nYou're either Protestant or you are Catholic and it's not an especially religious distinctions it's a tribal one in fact that's a boring observation\nIn northern Irish politics but this that's what you get because when people are mostly adhering to their try then they want representatives\nWho are going to put their case most forcefully and advocate for their interests not the larger interest but their interest and that's why you go for extreme\nIs there a ... here though is the people who are advocating for this old political policies because as you say they shrill voice is a very clear that on the door of all in some ways it works if you'll never end the remote the in India and you\nA pre ... the idea that an overarching Hindu history to India Hindu view of India\nIt winds bodes well one of the problems is that especially if you've got a large country the idea of simply identifying with that country is a bit unrealistic\nUm in the same way that asking people to identify with all of humanity is laudable and lovely but it's just not the way people work and where we do naturally I think as as a species break up into what are often very competitive\nClumps sorry I'm confused I thought tribalism was the problem now we're being told that we have no choice lots to the tribal it is a problem but I Would just being told that everybody wants to be tribal they can't identify with larger groups it's a natural\nTendency of people to especially when the larger amalgam is just a bit too big to get your head around to break into smaller groups and we have to deal with that I'm not going to go away\nBut it but it's politics happens because those tribes are bad but although tribes are okay I mean I'm very\nBad at all I don't know I mean I think the question is that I think clearly humans do have a natural instinct to care more about people who have close to them as possible so that starts off with a family at some point it becomes village it might become a particular religious ethnic group\nAnd the question is how do we deal with this in ... the society in a productive manage\nA one on such which I've ... been quite attractive to growing up as a Jew in Germany is to give up on nationalism altogether to try and overcome any kind of need for conduct of belonging\nLook at the politics of the last twenty twenty five years and I don't think that's realistic because actually specially the age of globalization nationalism retains an incredibly powerful force and so now it seems to me for the best response\nIs to try and domestic hated behalf wild feast\nOf nationalism to try and claim it for ourselves to make that inclusive to say that either hire\nA collective uh it is a level of you know the kingdom of looking at states uh but obviously we fight for inclusion of all different groups under the common identity ... how do you make that journey from being a cause and pulled us and a member of the metropolitan elite to being if you like a flag waving patriots I'm ...\nI think patriotism if I might just come in here is something where if you love your country with all its faults and all its you know adopt a size of its history but if you love your country and you're left with people of your country or wherever they from you can also respect patriots who left that country it's a question of mutual respect\nBut I feel like the other hand around so badly anxiety saying that you love found that it isn't our conceptual what's wrong and loving your country and its people are accused of other people of identity politics but I'm saying that you're not just because you remember your posts to nationalism I imagine you are and your your your\nUm your national thing\nThey can my country for the majority\nOf Hindu majority lets them so I look at nationalism that's something that has served it up as in the anti colonial struggle with today has become a very deeply dangerous beast\nWhat is the right response would be a pie into his end looked for it is the order nationalism over Congress party but sad but we're all Indians are respective\nI'm not going to eat that he's not he's not true and it's not as though the older a form of national lives in the Congress talk he didn't have an ... elements to it the one hand though it is our days of areas of angry as well as looked at what\nAge and if if I can bring you back then in a sense that there is a we we do seem to be making a distinction between figure identity groups saying that a national identity is a good thing but an identity that takes and single mothers with one leg is not necessarily such a good\nThing well 'cause I think the problem is how do we build bridges between all those groups and sometimes you need something more overarching can build a bridge you know we can be worked as we can be people of of a place like a village or a city we can be lumped in us we can be people from Manchester\nBut also sometimes that national element is still within the grass 'cause it's bound bound up with culture with language was if you go one step further that kind of cosmopolitan and they spoke about that can doesn't have to look can be a bit abstract I think at the ... isn't that option I think a lot of people feel European\nBritish or German or French but I also feel they have a little ... as a possible\nThat that's a very simple guiding questions yeah which is how do we manage to sustain a common life in a country like the United kingdom with its great diversity of people here\nAnd the answer is that if everybody identified primarily with the ... national trying to say I'm Jewish I'm\nA Hindu Muslim I'm black and brown then we're not going to have enough in common in this country to live to gather productively and peacefully whereas if we pack our sense of collective pride and the level which coincides with the actual ...\nCents doesn't everybody carry multiply and of course unless you're staying in between the identity is what she choose for yourself on the ones that have foisted upon mostly\nDo in the people like ... like Martin Luther king emphasize that I Am black and at the same time I'm an American and the way that I fight for the cause of people who share my identity is to emphasize oh common interest ... emphasize the ways\nIn which discrimination against this group goes against the ideal of a ... a member of the counter vision which says let's celebrate some national identity groups to such an extent and let's demonize any form of collective looming above the level to such an extent that we no longer have what we need in order to sustain a common\nLike that's a bit of a false distinction because one can argue that the version of British national it's something\nThat led to breakfast at which is a big nationalism\nWas on the paint by a sub nationalism that anything less nationalism the way the Brexit vote broke down there's\nA correlation between what you would call some nationalism that ... nationalism and British nationalism which led to breakfast and so again either you know I don't think we can have the ranks that singled out and didn't exactly in the in the ... while I mean it\nIt actually quite a lot of people in cars not did vote for breakfast I I personally am not expecting that majority ... right but but but I think what what you see here is different

Paris in fact he was such a respected authority that during the war the Nazis\nThe wind that got to verify the wiki diluted Weinberger refused and so the Nazis pills that his connection to but last month to Seventy is a painting from his collection to women and a garden by Renoir was finally returned to Sylvie Christie's in New York\nThe ... you know say that the Morgan bank and that's where the Nazis stole them most of them were found after the war that we're still paintings missing five her new law including the one I received back in New York\nWhere you will wed this one particular painting had been missing all alone\nNo never I never heard about this story the war was a taboo subject I suppose that's when my grandfather died you would never expect we could find his paintings so long afterwards and he died I was Fifteen\nSo I was very young and I had no idea about what happened\nAnd I discovered many things after my mother died\nNow I must say that I've got tons of questions but it's only five or six years ago that I was told that\nThere were a paintings that belonged to my grandfather ... was it it must have been quite a shocking revelation [laughter] yes it was a huge shock\nAnd awe after a few weeks I've been told that that vi was investigating on the property of the painting and the American government decided that it's your painting so they going to give it back to you so I was a yes\nYou did not know that it belonged to you I mean has it made you more curious to go and look at what other religious property there is that belong to a grandfather\nWhat we know actually above the five other paintings but I've got an everyday life and honestly I'm not living with that kind of idea I think I'm already been very lucky to get one back\nBut you can't do it when you you can't keep this particular painting\nUnfortunately not because the French government compensated for the paintings so as I have it back I have to give the government the money back\nWhich means you have to know what I think to raise the money to do that\nExactly yes yes\nI'm quite disappointing view I mean so keeping it in your family is no longer an option even though it's being returned to you\nKnow it's not an option unfortunately of course I Would love to keep it because it's a huge symbol for me and my family but that's life\nSylvie ... said the painting had been on a Seventy year old is he from South Africa to London through Switzerland in New York before a gallery called talk west in Florida booted from ...\nPark west into and sold it to a private collector and money trying to spot it was not see lose it off it says it promptly compensated that ... that the gallery is now in ten seeking compensation for subsidies\nWith no luck so far pulls sweat is the Louis park west calorie\nSubsidies were selling it at auction so they can try and obtain their relief from wherever gave it a piece to them\nBut the idea that it's part of course the truth you know suffer the financial loss when we are required in good faith from southern ... they're represented the provenance of the piece to be on blemish them without question\nPark was paid good value for the peace so everything about purpose transaction where subsidies was arm's length in good faith ... park west\nWould have had no notice no knowledge there's no wasn't any red flag whatsoever there would have clued park west into the fact that this was actually stolen from the Weinberger family by the Nazis database\nSomewhere that tells you which pieces of art or stolen or considered you know suspect in some way\nIt's thankfully there is unhelpful either database did not list this season to solving on\nIt it's a common occurrence I mean does it happen quite a lot that you come across pieces by famous artists who he kind of wonder where it came from\nNo no return usual and it's my understanding that the Weinberger airs only became active after twenty times\nSo presumably some of these will say the same thing it was not listed on any day today so holiday to know\nYour presumably their relationship to the piece goes back to at least Nineteen Seventy five looks markets sold to suffer these auction in March of Nineteen Seventy five in London and then it's sold again through subsidies in December Nineteen Seventy five in Johannesburg\nSo they certainly have a much longer relationship with this peace what they knew when they knew it that's for them to answer not us but our view is quite simple they sold us a piece that was stolen and so therefore they should reimburse the perks\nPulls sweat so to be told us they did offer it to reinvest ... calorie for that Renoir but the auction house says ... calorie refused that offer and that it's linked compensation to other items is purchased\nLucy incidence is worldwide headed restitution at Sotheby's his department dealt with that particular new to run well\nThat was a document that mentioned this work as having been looted from if I'm like a family in Paris during World War two\nBut that document miss described the painting as a landscape with a woman sitting down and of course not always the painting which we're talking about can we realize there's not a single woman sitting down but it's two women sitting down\nAnd it also has different dimensions to the paintings defined burgers listed as missing\nSo they made to material mistakes which actually made it impossible to match up the painting which was offered for sale by Christie's by Sotheby's and by an auction person quit slums several times I've been really took what you mean struggling\nStill bitter trained by someone who studies rent was it seems like such a smooth technicality whether or not this one woman to women\nIt would seem so from his point of view common sense but Renoir was wonderful artist but he was also prolific and they're all really a very large number of landscapes all of which is like the difference\nAnd that was basically no flag to suggest that this is the painting\nWhich divine but this last\nJust as a profit from restitution for example do an fees from options to cash reimbursement to the ...\n... ... one of the things I told my colleagues when we're pushing them to do more and more research on paintings if the best way to lose a clause is to expose them to not talk to a plane from World war two era\nSo we make enormous reference to protect talked Ross and to basically protect the market by doing research before paintings ...\nShowed that the stuff that they lose money when it has to rescue outlets like this\nI Can't generalize for suck me where we find a situation where a painting was just a piece in the world war two [noise]\nAs a matter of policy we tried to bring the various parties together and it's not a question of profit discouragement trying to the right thing to be less hatred towards sacrament however long\nLucien Simmons at Sotheby's and what about the victims even though it took Seventy is
