Somalia is woman cannot consent on their own body so if I Want to do any procedure I have to wait her husband are rather someone else to sign to\nEducating her and telling her like I'm here for you did you get your body you know you can do it it's just\nDifferent Activision work we do in within the conversation talking to the woman so it's it's a lot actually I go whole holistic you just asked whether it's your breakfast I usually ask my patients do they have you eaten you\nBecause she sometimes forget herself she has ten kids and you have an even eaten you know the ... the spinning maybe she was starving more than twenty hours\nA day could could you take us into your ... when a female patient in one of the things you've taken into consideration and it comes to diagnose him I think for\nMy last eleven years since I went back home my view is completely change because I got my education from Russia and now you spent several years here but a couple of years in North Dakota\nAnd you go back home with this western mentality of you know time of the time and this is what we should do and we push our patient as the paternalistic way of telling him what to do what's right\nAnd one patient I had really she transformed my view and from that day on the way I see the woman in Somalia and how I interview and treat them it was completely change\nI had a patient who came she really a leading in flood level was very extremely they know in the condition in somebody we don't have blood bank so we have human ... so you need to call everyone who has the exact today that the blood and and draw divide so we used ...\nHours looking at ... and ... and she's good to go on a number of ... you cannot have the children you have to wait you have to do this given all this patient education and I'm leaving after four months she's coming back again leading okay so she had another miscarriage yet\nAnd I was so if you're going to you know starting breach inherent you know you want to die you know what to do this and by the time I was walking away from her bedside she just hold my hand and told me you know I have six or for the children I just to get my second husband if I don't give him\nA child he was just to leave and we will start\nI was frozen and shocked you know this woman is just putting her life to risk just save our children\nFrom that day on I just my view become more broader I started listening an approach my patient more holistically where they come in from is not only being an efficient who or training to what that turn for my clinical skill and approach\n[noise] once you come back to some of the other cases and challenges you faced take all the first ones off skew point about your work focuses on the fact that men and women experience some diseases differently and cause for his own because those treatments were designed for men not women might is that\nWell science has really been based on a very male model and not go down to not only clinical trials\nBut the early ways in which we do research so if you think about the cells that we use we don't pay attention to the facts of the cells if we look at the animals we use in research they are far more frequently male animals\nThere's a real sense that using female animals makes research more difficult because they meant straight their menstrual cycle\nAnd that's the reality of women\nSo much of our science has been done on a male model\nAnd even when the laws changed in the United states in Nineteen Ninety three to include women in late face clinical trials you're still dealing with the issue of the science on which the clinical trials was based being based on a male model\nAnd can you give us an example of a disease that affects the sexes difference she\nSure let me just give you heart disease which I'm a cardiologist we see and cardiac disease that women are more likely to have a different type of laying down a plaque\nOr the hardening of those arteries and the heart that tends to be more evenly laid out across the vessel which makes it more difficult to diagnose\nWe now have the tools to make the diagnosis the issue is that we don't understand why we actually see that difference\nSo if you don't understand why you see the difference question arises\nDo we have the right therapy and I think those are questions that need to be asked there are other disorders where we're just beginning to understand some of the differences in biology women are more likely to develop Alzheimer's women are more likely to\nDevelop depression why is that we're beginning to see some studies began to point to differences in the biology but not yet something that's actionable and I've only giving you a tip of the iceberg but the good news is that we are learning these things but we still have a very long way to go\nNow Dick are you working and somebody at a country that has seen almost two decades of civil war and up until recently there was no central governing authority [noise] one of the greatest Barry is too sick to treatment for the woman in you'll catch everything you can watch\nIt there because when you don't have any situation where you\nDon't have lost to follow you know the\nBrutality happening to the woman his body and all the way they delayed the way they don't allow him in type of surgery\nBecause the man said so or because of a narrative declined to fish and so if you're a woman and you're married from one client and you learn from other so you become an object of the\nRivalry between the two clients and they will not allow you to go your own house for your woman effected by this plan rivalry\nDefinitely affected in many levels\nBut if things not improved with the new government [noise] not yet the whole\nSystem is run by a World Health organization the government is very poor didn't do enough money to invest in health care still everything you focus in its among tuition and infection where we'll neglecting their diabetes and chronic diseases so it's still difficult it's still hard and one thing that\nThe health care was proof for the last\nCouple years it's the family\nCharge spacing so that's the one area we got progress and we educate much mothers and we'd give the injection we have delivered all hospitals the injection is an birth control bill so we're pushing on that site and I'm very proud to have those\n[laughter] point teasing translate you research into into biology how do you translate that when you're working in the type of environment that geckos describing\nYou're really thinking about whether or not only the disorders or diseases that affects women\nBut also what is the context of that disease\nSo for example if we were to start to think about lung disease\nIn certain areas for example in Africa and other places at one of the main cause of pulmonary disease pneumonia but also chronic pulmonary disease or cook stoves you see what the end result is but how do you begin to understand and unravel\nNot only what is the cause of it but how do you change practice and practices so connected to culture and to use those structures within a culture change behaviors and that's something that doesn't happen overnight\n... anything to add to that you're right it's just cultural change and also development change you know government to test to change it not only hospitals and medications you just talked about the stove housing\nSanitation plumbing old that includes the hell have been a better environment it prevents a lot of disease is\nOn the sports that making women's health priorities are we talking about on the conversation today would talk to pull ... Johnson a cardiologist and women's health experts and Dr ... doctor who together with a mother and sister when a hospital in camp for many women and children who were displaced by ... in Somalia [noise]\nPutting your ideal she's in has healthcare cheese\nPie in the sky because in most health care context it's not practical to implement such a nuanced approach we're not\nTalking about adding additional resources on the front line\nAlthough sometimes I didn't necessarily what we're talking about is an approach of looking at health and health care delivery through a gender lands using the best science but also the best understanding of how women are leaving their lives I Would actually call that really good medicine\nAs opposed to something that we can't achieve\nThey could do you think that you deliver the haves and have health care\nAbsolutely the woman needs more time more listening more comforting because of the word role of men and women change so she's not only the mother and caregiver of her own children she's also bread winner in the house so she has so much stress\nTwo you're listening to Ninety point nine WB you are from Boston homo Boston's largest radio newsroom now did you point something WB your wages Bertie heated on point one WB UH Brewster and streaming of WB you our dog or W.

mistake\nThat the need for the ... say that because this generation of bad is getting lost we're living in I'm a new lease and a a via not seeing a A R people repairing it around us so that's why we

of repair business as an engineer anyway [noise]\nThere are many the best shot said this although this is out there to pick up the bed there's a big market nearby it's at all in the corner\nHow'd you get away from harming other businesses you say you're taking a long viewed away from us\nSo in this back and say you have potential to better not such a thing along with us along with wall India's a it's a it's the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better they are not taking their business over the\nCourse of their lives much point to go ahead what we find that obviously politicians are but it is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nI'm what we find is that people and all that kind of the day they called the full to take something along to a professional repair uh\nI'm guessing assessed tends to be told to calm be retired\nSo what we do is we do at least the assessment for free and then maybe we say we're taking it to retire so we take some of the expense and the person who's going to the professional repair or knowing that it can be amended but are we in RIMPAC company time have those issues\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get to repair back in to our daily lives is that a professional repair she'd become cheaper and now for many people repairing professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor\nAnd labor is in fact tiny so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that's labor she'll be tax lower so that's a professional repairs have become more attractive\nIn in more cases and that would enable professional ... around there basically and um [noise]\nI don't know of course there will be different or labor costs in different parts of the wealth or what you're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the planet [noise]\nAfter listening to have\nOne thing I wanted to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work it just costs were alone people going out of their way to get stuff from ended in the first place I'm for whatever reason a lot of people just don't think like that as I found out when I paid a visit to a landfill thought the other day I have a listen to this [noise]\nWhy what becomes of today and I'm checking some topics I made a half [noise]\nThrow this is the golden ... yeah yeah he found that if I Can't say yeah I mean you say hardly broken beyond repair rule I don't know if he's he's so frightened ... holes in Mexico but he's not what I what I Wonder what someone could replace a missile pose\nIt might be able to tell you and I believe in ... just I just think it's just easier to get rid of it so they may they might have been able to take is it is it the time as well during the time yeah oh yeah I've got two kids that don't have to run and that just because it's raining here sometimes it's just not practical exactly [noise]\nWhat's in it that way for the camera stuff covers with cameras stuff you know when you put on a limb and the\nYeah um yeah that will be on the unfortunately I'm to the point where they\nBecome used because they got fungus in general things wrong with him so that you buy them because you ... is that you could you write that there's not really much more than it was an ... to take each patient's cleaning around would cost a ridiculous amount of money it's a perfectly good about the outcome of putting it just\nComes down to the fact that that's where ... in perfect working older about twenty quit or ... or somewhere like that I'm sort of ... was a real Harry ... ten times that much so you've got your you briefly\nTo say we're going to put them in the world is with all of us has been no I've already been out for not looking to grow bigger\nWe should really be doing things to reuse things but it comes down to practicality if disarming says she proceeded\nThen you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if the new companies going to be generally cheaper than they would have given any desperate a joke [noise]\nSouthern a couple of issues the race that I Wonder you know ... people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but like often gets in the way they're too busy I just don't have the time\nYeah obviously people are pretty busy that day to day life\nInformed community of people around who are very conscious about this and vitamins that that saying that you know we get in sometimes we get very who's just phones because people want to do that bitch in ah in their surroundings then so that the things they are actually doing a lot of that sort so that things don't go to lunch and\nMust you know I Wonder if you could kind of a ... some of the people here in this RIMPAC cafe you what kind of preaching to the converted they have a reason because you know they're already on board with the environmental movement without ... how'd you get the other people have you ... the other people who\nAs we heard from the people look at the tip of ...\nWell that's the challenge of course but we hope to get them into the ... when they have

campaign as an activist before we came up\nTo ... and that includes the people who started lush so obviously there's a whole host of things that we care about and we built a business that suddenly
