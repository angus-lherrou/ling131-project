the case that these two gentlemen me being one of them really didn't want to concede a loss so we both made crazy decisions to do what ever to to get to wherever it was it needed to be getting too\nThat's John ... he's an extreme biter\nAnd that sometimes involved crisscrossing the continent without any result two or three times\nTwo years ago he took part in something called the they gear a twelve month birds funding competition and the U.S we're rivals tried to check off as many species as possible my site or science\nI took a hundred and sixty flights and I don't mean legs I mean flights if you can imagine almost half of the days included a flight from a starting point to a destination point\nI think I drove a hundred thousand kilometers I've made a wild calculation of how far I Walk I think it was around six or seven thousand miles obviously didn't fly home to Australia so uh I was on the road the whole\nTime but I guess if you did the math eight hundred and thirty five birds that's an average of nearly three a day that's not too bad\nAnd it's it's obviously quite competitive in when you're in the middle of it are you aware that other people are catching up on you\nKnow this was the first year that it was very competitive usually it's more of a gentleman thing but it got a little bit intense there was so little time for enjoyment or have to admit\nI had three days off which I spent in a hotel room crime\nWait a minute crying and hotel room when I started this call I did not expect it to take this tiring after all this is burning\nIt got to a point I think is around November ... yeah it was just about nervous breakdown time for me or didn't crack but could have because there was a bird in Alaska that had a radio transmitter and it and so researchers have told me that this great not was\nUp near Nome, Alaska and I just come from Alaska gone gone down to a Texas I'd miss the bird so I flew back to Anchorage and then no I think there were five legs to the flight\nJust you know that's around six thousand kilometers\nAnd I got out of the airport got on the Internet and my associate back in Australia told me that tragically the bird was being now trapped on his way back so I knew the crack at that point\n\nThat's a ... of almost twelve thousand kilometers for nothing\n[noise]\nWhat was the motivation that was driving to such crazy extreme\nI I guess in my situation Ah yes I Am obsessed event competitive but you got to understand that I was\nOut on my own I mean so low and my whole world\nWas seeing the birds getting to the birds first pushing myself but I could also feel the hot breath of a competitor behind me so I just slow they got into the mindset that you know I didn't want to do this whole year and ended up in second place\nIt's fair to say that this is that the extreme end of the extreme John acknowledges that incredibly he's going to enter again next year only this time he's going to take it slow enjoy that part\nBut what this does that is that if the conditions are right the things that attracts you to something like ... are starting things like anticipation ... can also be the things that push you over the edge\nWe have to distinguish between people who take up an interest in birding as an recreational pleasure and people who become holy absorbed in doing it so that it becomes really the organizing principle of their lives\nThat's Dr ... from the University of Hawaii again I asked her what makes people like John prone to such extreme behavior\nMy desk that would be genetic temperamental traits things that are enduring persistent probably in significant part biologically based on the way their brain function the way they process information sets\nAnd life experiences help shape that direction and also long or ability to going way overboard you keep doing it even if it's very costly to you and in terms of family work time relationship

therapies that it makes you feel good you know are up and vote and all my life and every time I come at you sit down the road from ... to ...\nAnd you just you just feel a great sense of ... such\nA

I'm not agreeing that taboos but I think\nOften dangerous aren't as risky the one that's in in a lot of conversation now in terms of writing is the idea of cultural appropriation who's allowed to tell what story and I mentioned that because while I don't have any rules about what I can and can't do as an artist\nI I'm sensitive to watch a few of offensive to me and as a writer living in South Africa who came here in Nineteen Ninety two I Am an African you know I I'm a citizen of this country but I'm a particular kind of citizen and so I\nFind that there's certain stories I approach with

thing when we don't feel comfortable joking about it and things like the impact of tend to be violence of things like homophobia are so huge\nThat we can't even risk to try to minimize the issues because you give a green light to people who would act out that bigotry in ways that tend to be harmed people\nSo I think that it's necessary for us particularly in just the things we're maybe we're making light says so comedy for example but it's still navigating the taboo would look at the difference I think people navigate taboos in ways that show where we stand as a society about the issue
