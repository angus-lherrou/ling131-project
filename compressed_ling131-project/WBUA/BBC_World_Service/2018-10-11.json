what you think is it the halls of the relationship between Washington and react\nThe heart of the relationship right now is they're both at the strategic element that you mentioned in terms of\nSaudi Arabia being a powerful force in the region that counters that Iran but here are deep economic ties and a lot of those ties though are one sided at this point Saudi Arabia has a lot of investments in the United states and is very close to the United states economically\nBut that being that the relationship is much more important for Saudi Arabia than it is the United states for for example this how do you have to take their currency the risk\nOut to the dollar a this out either actually the largest in order of are in the world are they buy a lot of that the United states but that doesn't make them\nThe most important\nA purchase or arm the United states of course American defense contractors sell more to the U.S army than they do to Saudi Arabia but these these ties these economic

know that Saudi Arabia is a very wealthy country and the wealth comes from the oil industry so in in in the context of the world I mean how how much can the Saudi economy influence the U.S economy so\nIf you want to put the Saudi economy into kind of local contacts Saudi Arabia the G twenty country but it's really more of the border it's nowhere near as large you know kind of me as Canada or the United states or Germany for example to a while it is influential in that it is up there\nA lot of that economic wealth does come from the sale of oil it doesn't really have a very large non oil GDP now working to try to change that but those changes are slow and so right now with\nIts influence is mainly an oil up just hadn't seem kind of influence that it used to a Nineteen Seventy three when it's control over over oil was able to say critical eye America's economy\nAnd and European economies right now that's not the way or the oil market looks today there are lots of other sources of
