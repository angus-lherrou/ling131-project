a hundred and forty thousand miles for the pets or\nWhen you're over and you drive a car a hundred thousand miles per year\nOver five years you need one electric vehicle or two and a half or three pets are and then you take a driver out of the equation\nThen the cost goes down further three or four times so you combine that on them an autonomous and electric and you get ten times decrease in the cost\nThese satellite powerful arguments you'll say this is starting in twenty Twenty one you know you're saying to three years away you're saying there's a storm coming if there was a storm coming we would see the beginnings of it now wouldn't waste\nRevolution that you describe happening we do\nAnd if you look at the cost of an electric vehicle say that Tesla Model S last a hundred thousand dollars just in two thousand and fourteen and now you can buy a Tesla model free for fifty thousand dollars so it's come down by a half\nAnd sanctions are going to be cheaper than buying a Petra car\nBy about twenty twenty for half the market and essentially by all of that market by about twenty twenty five now car companies aren't getting it after denial for the last few years they're all announcing that they're investing tens of billions of dollars\nInto an electric vehicle an autonomous vehicle technology so it's all happening\nOkay the electric vehicle revolution get autonomous vehicles self driving cars may well be a lot more than three or four years away this huge regulate tree huddles not to mention the technological hurdles\nA man and a ton of vehicle and a lot of these cars are ready and yes there are regulatory hurdles but that's another genius improving explanation in several countries are investing regulatory from China\nFor instance there are many cities that already investing in making self driving technology happen in their cities\nBut with autonomous vehicles that is not just about persuasive technology you need the public to be happy to see these vehicles on the road that it may take a long time before the public's persuaded that self driving cars are safe\nNot correct the main adopt or a ton of must have knowledge evil will be ... will be ... cents a list of the world\nWhen they do they're going to purchase millions of cars at a time and they're going to offer consumers a product which is going to be ten times less expensive than ownership of cars and consumers are going to start trying it maybe once and maybe twice\nIn once they get used to it then they can adopt it interrupts our car\nWhat about the worries about an autonomous fickle plowing into a prosecutor that kind of issue it's always raised when this discussion happens\nWell humans kill about thirty five thousand people every year a ton of vehicles are already safer in many ways than humans so that's a narrative that's driven by the income parents who don't want to see a ton must have an allergy to disrupt\nTheir products oil products natural cars and so on\nSo I tried to you said you think there's a storm coming back how quickly do you think this vision of robo taxis will destroy the internal combustion engine\nTen years after ... already and approved by regulators which we expect\nTo be twenty Twenty one the individual ownership of national cars will be up suddenly it will be over\nHow much of this is driven by your desire to see an electric revolution because you're anxious about climate change\nThis is purely gonna happen for economic reasons we've turned the numbers this has nothing to do with climate change just says a disruption\nDriven by people and companies making the right to economic choice\nSo Tony ... believes the revolution and transportation will happen regardless of any environmental arguments\nThis he says is all about cold hard cash and even the oil industry the industry most likely to be up ended if Mr Sievers correct recognizes that radical change is already underway\nIn transportation [noise]\nThe I guess we're going to pay ... for about three million vehicles today to between a hundred and two hundred million vehicles ... votes so that is a very high rate of growth\nMatthew ... is vice president for new fuels including Alex ... at the oil and gas companies shower so would you think that is that because we're going to replace traditional fossil fuels outcomes nothing hardly know quickly if there's a high a new show in changing the\nFleet around the vehicles can live on the road for\nFifteen Years or more in the case of heavy duty ... goal so the trucks and other modes of transport these nice it's a very long lived indeed I'm not so easy to electrify through by first with electric cars I mean there is a very compelling argument when you marry at a\nTon of us vehicles and so they're not going to transfer it was a service that could be a powerful driver of ...\nI think it could happen quite quickly in parts of your major cities where he went on a lot of the list as we've ever had a college guy must have someone like this you think could transition greatly cities like London San Francisco both from\nSingapore maybe show high I think electrification is here already but it is likely to scale within the next five to ten years what his hardest to coal is the\nCoast and I think it's also hard or too cold the degree to which brought those rules will really take off from will like technology really deliver on the problem is but I think you have to keep in mind is probably an open model and I think we're going to see different\nWays of the courtroom ability and the countryside and indeed different parts of the world I don't think it's possible yet to imagine to hold of it will you know following the same ...\nWhich I mean as a representative of one of the biggest fossil fuel companies in the world is a huge challenge for you is this is the end of your industry isn't this supposed to challenge an opportunity I knew you were going to go to John ... who lived through the ... first\nI mean we're all living in a world where oil which is the dominant transportation fuel will be gradually substitution by a range of alternatives one of which is my first book could also include hydrogen renewable natural gas but that's in the context of a market for oil is\nStill growing maybe no here in London or in your ... but in India and China for example the demand for oil will continue for another decade or two\nBut when it because they're in the ... position to leap from the whole thing off and they they could say right sort of panels electric cars you need the grid that necessarily the power stations they could just go straight to electric couldn't they well they do any of\nThe great unless of course one simply because it's impossible to imagine vehicles of the sky charge solely from\nThe sequel to me we're going to ... falls in the world so the residential\nSolutions I guess part of the argument is video sharing vehicles we ... need to invest because maybe you need to three hundred million vehicles\nThat just use more intensive maybe we should have them I think God indeed it is possible but my impact vehicle sales because pickles are going to be much more highly utilized 'cause they all being shed but helping to round the clock and therefore energy you might not necessarily decreased but he's not going to come from\nYour own mind business which is on your own company all my business and find out a little I mean all my business is actually gas the longer term future for the energy system\nCould be based on gas and renewables so we aim to train through the transition we have a growing presence in renewables when you say that transition you sound as if it's definitely\nComing do you believe a transition it's coming it's already happening\nMatthew ... of show well the latest production figures from Tesla suggest that is like in the company yet despite the antics of its charismatic CEO and says gene ... even if Tesla fails tomorrow you don't mosque would have succeeded in his mission\nThe transition is going to happen with or without Tesla and in some ways tests or has achieved its mission because\nThe electric car was dead before Tesla now the wheels are in motion here and there's no stopping the electrification movement duty or grandchildren will look back on the internal combustion in the same way that we look back at the steam engine already kind of old fashioned technology\nAbsolutely I mean we have a picture up at our office of the streets of New York city in Nineteen Seventeen twin horses reached a peak and the roadways and I
