R.\nThe real difficulty at the moment is not it's just you know the last time that there's an outbreak in a conflict area a and said the security situation is is very tense but that\nThat the other issue is not there is a lot of community mistrust as more but significant pockets as a community of people who are resisting I'm a ... who are quite skeptical of the of the virus in their response and making the health why is that that was very difficult is that the mammoth\nYes because we heard about these um the red cross volunteers who are trying to swiftly remove borders being attacked\n[noise] absolutely uh you know there's there's it's quite common to have community mistrust and then they voted on break it's very scary virus\nA wet people there's a lot of people dying to oversee people that are very scared but I think you know the specific see what this outbreak is that it's\nHappening happening in an area where there's been decades of conflict and so there's a lot of tension or in in the community I you know just last week Eighteen people uh last month sorry eight people were killed\nIn an attack by an armed group on in Danny this week four people were killed in an attack on the city as well and so people are very uh very SCAD an angry and there's been a lot of protest\nActually being done yet at the moment ah against rising insecurity and as a result of that it's making the response is very difficult and I'm I I'm being told that every day at the moment\nAt teens how teams have to stop for a few hours either because it's shooting a around the city because of protest\nAnd this is hampering the response\nOr the tracing of contact with people who could be at risk uh it's it's making vaccination a slow\nProcess slower and also making the burials uh the burials more and more difficult than that is really a key\nPunch in your belly responds uh because uh it is a virus that is that is very contagious I ... on on someone who has\nDied in through the

you will not particularly vigorously when Louis was talking about how we usually this disease is spread\nYes and particularly around the area of safe burial is one of the most infectious things is a dead body unfortunately\nAn of course was a loss of a local culture in a local\nOf practices that involves quite close contact with a dead body and so in pasta outbreaks who've seen that this is an incredibly efficient way of spreading the virus and that's where it's it's crucial took a lot about the bird as quickly as possible but of course it's very difficult stirs up\nIf you can't get access to the communities and of course the other elements as well as this\nIn building and unfortunately again you can't use the usual measures which you're we rely on to control these outbreaks which is that they're very simple measures you you identify people who are infected\nYou isolate them and then you monitor the context of those people and if any of them becoming cited you isolate them and by just doing this isolation ... contacts monitoring can very quickly bring an outbreak under control because you can't do that\nIf it's in a in an area of great civil unrest\nAnd the coolest wet actually there is distrust of modern medicine absolutely\nAnd and this huge mistrust and again we've ... we had some of the ways that there's a very effective vaccine works really well in the in the twenty fifth outbreak in guinea which is really what it was a given its first opportunity\nAnd this is a very effective vaccine in these sorts of outbreak conditions but again you needs to be able to get into the communities you need to have than willing to be vaccinated so this is an incredibly challenging time\nThe world Health Organization is saying it may be another three or four months before this latest outbreak is brought under control just how bad could things get in that timeframe\nThe worry is that there are cases which is a a cropping up in in very disparate parts of the the region so so the moment the outbreak comes around two hundred square kilometers I'm not saying the whole of the areas got about her infections but there are little so sigh of outbreaks\nAnd of course if you spread your resources every great geographical area it becomes incredibly challenging trying to do something about it so whether it's two months three months or even longer who knows at the moment\nThis question one last one is ... this is a disease which so far has been largely can find to places like fifty a seat but the the worry is a way that it's going to somehow get on a plane and then be spread around the world how big a risk is that briefly\nThis there is a a risk that it can be taken to to other countries as we saw in the twin cities you know break but then is unlikely to spreads too much unless those places haven't got great health infrastructure\nJoined us and we'll come back to you during the course of the program the says we can from the BBC well subsidized five

that that changed sleeping following the outbreak in the ... on the first of all ... and the Democratic Republic of Congo Wilson I test\nWell the world Health Organization now says the outbreak is at a critical juncture due to the\nIssues with security in the region the now spread of a launch a geographical area of cases of Ebola and also resistance from some members of community to the health care workers that are going in the so the ... and there are a hundred and eighty warm cases and the hundred and Fifteen deaths from the disease\nAnd has been a little bit of an increasing the number of new cases being identified but he's been very difficult rates get\nReally definitive figures on what's going on because of the violence in the region is making it difficult to do the basics including testing people who are suspected cases to see if they actually do have a boat\nAnd the security situation is making it difficult to treat the it was a lot of that\nBut it it's hampering lots of things happened don't just getting to patients but it's also hampering the process of contact tracing so the way you stopping Ebola outbreak has you identify case and then you find every single person they've come into contact you and\nYou mentioned trying to do that anyway in a busy bustling city or a remote part of the country is difficult when this conflict happening at the same time it's almost impossible say it's a very difficult joke\nThat the teams from the world Health Organization other agencies half of them and\nThey're also facing resistance from the local population eve frequently see this in both cases people not wanting bodies to be taken away and buried safe because the remaining infection rates they want to have their usual ritual is Dick burial practices and so there now\n... the teams that are doing the burials in order to protect those people you know what to do the safe burial say there's a lot going on but it's making this particular outbreak quite difficult to handle and it's more will help organizations Hayes is now preparing for managing this outbreak into twenty Nineteen now\nAnd so patients who do have the disease all their any treatment setting and\nAs you remember from the big ... outbreak in West Africa suddenly there were these handful of cases that were treated with experimental drugs things like the map and monoclonal antibodies that attacked of ours well now they are actually being used on patients\nLike on the day that being diagnosed with it but are they getting the drugs in this like this ... been about fifty or so patients who've been given them but these are those experiments with drugs that were talked about but never really used in the last ... outbreak really being used on the front lines for the first time\nSo in the end we should be able to find out whether these drugs really do work\nWill have a lot more clinical information about whether or not they work it's worth pointing out as we always do the\nThe way that you're going to talk about the outbreak is by stopping it from spreading from person to person and this is an interesting aside and will hopefully be incredibly useful for anybody who's called the disease which doping it's spreading is the way you're going to talk on but Robert\nThanks very much James now next we'll talking headaches and we own a cause that like\nI get

dangerous levels of climate change we know if that were not happen then for example if we could expect reductions in yields yet other changes in diet of people that might make them on healthier\nAnd also it might be harder to really implement some of the adaptation measures like building I dance and all that that would be needed to protect yourself from the impact of climate change so if we go on on our trajectory would be protected might be an underestimate actually\nLast spring been from the Oxford Martin program on the future of food\nRenewables all the big weapon in the fight against global warming was looking for any source of electrical power that doesn't put CEO to into the atmosphere I don't think really fast making a cool to have well generational ready and moving suicide by twenty twenty three according to the latest international Energy Agency research\nHarvard University's David case max solar power and in a pair of widely debated papers last week found full with wind power suggesting that by changing atmospheric behavior wind farms can add to global warming he's at me through his logic\nFundamentally should do with the simplest thing in science which is conservation of energy and\nSome of the simplest ways to think about wind turbines think about every winter biased being independent from every other stuff you know how hard the wind is blowing you can just think of how much power I went to the next and figure that wind turbines are all independent of course they're not all independent and the and\nThe atmosphere is one big heat edging it's driven by power from the sun and that power has always connected so if you take a lot of energy at one place there's less energy somewhere else\nThat's really the core things conservation energy\nThat sounds to me like if you're going to take energy from the atmosphere venue gonna be cool to get down but that's not quite the argument from us\nThat's a very good intuition but in fact the issue here is really the mechanical energy so of the energy that comes in from the sun only about a third of ... percent goes into mechanical energy into the wins almost all the rest of his heat and the energy of evaporate water\nSo that direct consequence at that point three percent is almost irrelevant\nBut it's indirect consequences huge ... of course the wins move around he each and moisture in the atmosphere so if wind turbines affect the wins it's not that direct\nPatient at the energy and the wins matters that's hardly important what matters is that by changing the wins they change the flow of heat in momentum and that in turn can\nRedistribute heat I'm active and have some kind of climate consequence\nSo effectively you're saying that the climate downwind of the wind farm might be all said\nYes and they're now lots of observation\nFarms there's at least ten studies have shown with satellite before and after that the ground around large wind farms warms up\nAnd that's because there's more solar energy coming through this because you don't give a cooling effect to the ground from the wind taking heat from the soil well most of the it's\nA it's probably neither of those things it's several different factors but I think the most important single reason is that at night wind turbines increase the mixing of the lower layer of the atmosphere\nAnd especially at night when the atmosphere is quite stratified when you have warmer airline above cooler when you mix that up you tend to warm the surface there other impacts but that's the simplest\nSo you end up at night having an effect is that right then the biggest effect is it night yes how much of an effect on me I can understand that too you know that could be a bit if it's weak king but that wouldn't be with publishing well I mean\nThe effects in the region where large wind farms are seem to be warming sort of nighttime warning of order a degree centigrade or a little bit more something like that\nThe issue really is how to think about the benefits compared to the harm so winter vines are immensely better than coal and we have to be carbon Massey Energy system this is all about choices we make as we ...\nI suppose what I'm saying is one when I'm On a global scale I supposed to have a big effect you modeling is for lunch numbers of wouldn't phones\nYeah but one way in front of us and have a big benefit either the right way to think about it is to think about the tradeoffs between benefits and costs nothing to strip for wind power is true for any kind of interesting\nSo one wind turbine does a very infinitesimal amount to reduce global climate change by making clean energy and so a single wind turbine very slightly reduced as climate change over the whole next century over the whole world\nThat one wind turbine also makes a very slight direct climate change\nIs is just slightly dancing the benefits of wind farms are what you know it's all together\nI don't think it wipes it out altogether I mean if you're talking wind versus say current call generation which also has huge air pollution impacts\nAnd given the very long time scale of us have to in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community began to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we do carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density is a winter brown and raise basically how much power you get from a single square kilometer of land with wind turbines and\nPeople have suggested some very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts per square kilometer\nWe've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet\nAnd we get a number it's more like a half a watt per square meter and that's\nYou know a factor of between a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWill not simple because I Know that your interest in solar power and I believe that the ... ... square meat or you can get from some of the power of bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more was per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only them often would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will you have environmental and social impact nothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be in a free\nBurning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that but as we transitioned we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power what have you and the big important are finding I think that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than a land footprint of wind for the same generation and in addition wind has this climate impact and these climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that that there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard's David Keith roughly feathers that with these new thoughts on wind power you can get a sense of how ruffled if you look at this time going on at the Keith climate there's a link to his papers by his blog site via our Web page BBC World service still comb\nThat like most Scientists David was happy to talk to us because he wants to publicize his work in the process of science goes something like this find something out ... everyone else about say why publishing that the house\nBefore the digital age publication was generally done through a profit making journal in a hefty volley that was delivered to your door by police we still call them papers but in the digital age and with increasing emphasis on open sons that mobile is breaking\nIs to count the lawsuit in the states against the science sharing site ... skate complaining about violation of copyright as soon as you who's been rumbling in Europe for a year and ... has been following the disputes he told me this about the participants\nAlso is the biggest science published in the world publishing over two thousand scientific peer reviewed journals\nAbsolute jars if there's a discipline his son so have more of a ... oh yeah that\nDefinitely also there's no small company you know like you say if if there's a ... they also they probably has it covered\nThey are a big commercial ... that's right the other policy to this complaint is the American Chemical Society you know that's the membership of academic chemists and research chemist that's\nRight yeah so that was a big for profit company but you know the American Chemical Society does have subscription channels it requires researchers to pay to access content which is essentially its business model\nOn the other side of this is this organization called research gate\nYeah research get is essentially an academic social networking site allows academics to share their scientific papers online basically that's the purpose of it most of the complaints and\nThe complaint is against the article sharing practices of research case so what else did they and the American Chemical Society are alleging is that research Kate is not strong enough in his policies and allowing pay will tend to be uploaded so essentially they're saying that the uses of research gay or uploading\nScientific papers that normally we would have to pay to access", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018",
