evidence but the fallout will not go away and cook possibly even intensify\nAs the details become more publicly known\nWhen you say fallout do you mean the fallout between the United states and Saudi Arabia the international community and Saudi Arabia or the international economic uh and financial community in Saudi Arabia\nI Do think it it includes all of those areas particularly the the United

all can\nKill Hampshire many thanks more business news coming up on Tuesday in the next hour\nAnd a is twenty two minutes past the another sweet Harvard University in the U.S is\nFacing a lawsuit Bruce on behalf of Asian American students who failed to gain admission ... is the policy\nBest use choose to adults to give disadvantaged groups a better chance of getting in\nThis means that they're not less in just on academic ability the Asian American students say they were good enough to get in with kept out because African Americans and Hispanics have they shown sees boosted by some direction racial balancing it's cool\nThat we hear from someone in favor of affirmative action in the moment but first the testimony of one student Kelly not civil\nI come from an Asian acting background and a student at Harvard and I think they should have credit Wright's chicken is university and that's the kind of like say how many other Asian Americans will have to come I think that when you look at the case has affirmative action\nWe should be looking at whether or not affirmative action is right or wrong but try to have a family of action is impacting different ... and the point of time and it actually has been any support community that has historically been under represent get extra day it seems like it's found Asian Americans right now as it looks like hardly\nAny national policies are discriminating against Asian Americans systematically keeping that embrace Lauer heightened stay like Microsoft fireworks like I said of how it affected me that I think the interesting thing is to look at it on the aggregate\nAnd how the Asian American population have been increasing in an ACA rapidly but the amount of Asian acting admitted to higher ground has been saying around the focus on that I hadn't yes\nSo they have the idea that the stocks don't speak to Gregory Davis who's a grad student at Harvard and who's in favor of the affirmative action as it stands Gregory thanks for coming on what's your reaction when you hear arguments such as those just made by Kelly ...\nA ... a her stance makes a lot of sense and I I'm happy that she's here um but I think she's mistaken about what the point of affirmative action is the point of affirmative action is not actually said to\nMake a underrepresented groups uh be more pressing the point of affirmative\nAction is to increase diversity increase the benefits of diversity one\nThing that's been does not have been talked about as much in\nThis lawsuit is what it means to have a critical mass here at Harvard and many other colleges and universities across the country there are a critical masses isn't quite frankly Asian students um don't have to walk on campus and feel like they're necessarily represent this other group\nUm or that they have to speak for every person from that background um this is particularly true of Chinese um\nStudents are are students of Chinese background however for African Americans for Latino Americans for indigenous Americans as has not said this is simply not\nOkay so you're saying that even with the ... of action as it currently works in in in most areas of higher education I mean you just tell us about your experience but just before you were ... you were UCLA and one of the complications to this fact is is that in California\nAffirmative action isn't allowed so what was the effect on the view of walking into Klaus being one of the very few African Americans I presume ... that's how you felt\nOh absolutely and it was the case um I entered into a class of about two hundred and fifty are entering law students and I was one of twelve African Americans um this is and\nThe state of California which is as much more than just a four percent or ... or ... three or four percent African American and this is an environment in which I was you know in classes debating highly intellectual and highly\nSocial issues that involve things like raise 'em in history and I was one or two African American men in the room the size of a huge effect on my ability to um\nTo judge the issues to be able to voice my opinion without feeling like I was speaking on behalf of everyone\nI can see that so it becomes it becomes personalized it becomes emotional and of course what you'll you'll have to study principles and argue about\nSort of intellectual ... or ... without being muddied in that way [noise]\nI Wish that was the case yeah unfortunately it very rarely happened that\nWay for example in your class with and not one or two Asian or a Chinese and Marilyn how did we should define them or have they all Reggie managed to establish numbers in the education system that means that they have support in critical mass of that kind\nI Believe they do now this is not to say that that aren't underrepresented sub groups within an Asian Americans are among the immunities or Southeast Asia and Pacific Islanders students I absolutely underrepresented um in all sizes of higher education\nBut if we're going to talk about Asian Americans as a general group um they're representing well both at schools that don't practice affirmative action in I argue schools that do\nAnd why would that be\nThink there's a lot to do with the caliber students applying um the number of students applying I'm In ... heights I gave the applications are obviously I I think\nQuite a harbor a one interesting fact about this entire lawsuits are not discussed as much as that I'm twenty two percent of the entering class of Harvard every year or roughly Asian American but also try to ... percent of the application for Asian every year\nWell there you up affirmative action two sides of the student argument is ... that is being taken to the court case are taken to court or against Harvard University at the moment I should say is a little bit of background in this um many places um and you had that for example California actually bans affirmative action\nBut Harvard as a private institution or because of the state level and under its own a constitution decides that they want to do that that's why they go ahead and do\nThis if it's a private institution that they can make that goes on you know less than ... do you have to be in a state where you can have affirmative action uh and uh many people are interpreting this is a really significant court cases\nOver the legality of affirmative action in many of the ... not just\nIn the academic sphere and I'm a there's lots of accusations about who's on behalf of whom and who's wearing a tool divided along sort of community\nAh backgrounds no I'm Talking about clubs in Britain that would be a class issue a rather than a a a race and the ... election issue off at home more so

University of Kansas welcome to you know let's start with painting\nAt the end of the nineteenth century ... made a magnet for so many people within the last ... ... and beyond I mean I think many of our listeners would have heard of pages of crowds to compose among other painted claimed the rights of the stuff I'm like\nWell the father of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud but Katrina first let's getting like deer from you about Vietnam as a city and its people\nAustin in Hungary at the turn of the nineteenth century was modernizing very fast and the ... a short period\nThings the changing uh especially the Indiana the city grew enormously but also new ways of transportation or implement that like to try and train cars\nAnd ... came into the House's new ways of communication and maybe in sharp contrast to that the institutions antisocial ... did not that that that quickly\n[laughter] so I Would see that from a perspective now a century on from when cross ... there's not much has changed when it comes to trivia\nAnd celebrity typical settled and it seems like a perfect remark on the ease with which journalists politicians all business people mixed fact and fiction Crouse commented real choose or those that can be invented ... controversial pronouncements made by politicians that truth is not really truth comes in mines\nAnd one can only imagine what he thought through social media and the Internet today but cross was very focused not just on particular issues and misuse of facts but also on sloppy language now tell me why was this so important to him he was he just being a pet and\nIt's a complicated question as in many issues when it comes to cross um I think that it's important to say that there is a caricature of cross as a kind of linguistic purists someone who only saw models of language and figures like Shakespeare gr to ensure there are many of whom make all sorts of appearances and crosses writing from early on\nAnd someone who believe that everything that's been produced since then it's just pure swell and I think that um this image as the misrepresentation I think that would misunderstand crosses views on language\nI'm and its relationship to what we might call something like ethical life\nOr to put it succinctly cross saw language as deeply embedded are intertwined with the moral character of its producer of its writer so if one wrote ... and I think a writing sloppy leaving crosses my crummy many things that could mean\nNot including a comma due to editorial oversight or to reproducing cliches for the purpose of digest stability or to imposing abstract rules on language rather than letting kind of language and thought who constitute or co form one another\nThis for cross his own indication that there was something deeply a ride in the morality of the author or more likely\nA one could say of the morality of the society in which such language could be received and produced so critically\nUm and I think just as a small anecdote to illustrate when I'm Talking about one of crosses more humorous pieces are set of pieces is what he calls a kind of translation and quotes of one of his journalistic contemporaries man by the name of ... million heart and\nCross calls this ... into a it's a reference of course also to the invented language Esperanto\nThe peace or the several pieces consists of multiple pages of hardens excessively floor pros juxtaposed against cross his so called translations of these phrases into more accessible direct language\nAnd cross does this I take it that what he's doing as he's exposing some of the ideological underpinnings that are in heart in language but that his language actually obscures and so this is kind of one example of how cross seeks to relate\nSloppy language to either hidden do publicity or moral failure or on a grander scale political catastrophe\nSued by sloppy language he doesn't just mean literally bad grammar wherever he's talking about all of them that and they have yeah and he's on schools are full of illusions two classic works of Jim and Jim and Shakespeare as you said and he will say continue the brilliant tradition of German language aphorism\nWhich basically short pithy often surprising and funny expressions of a tree or principle you've heard a few these already\nAnd Chris started including the Indy ... from about Nineteen oh six and lights it published them in book for several times but he himself was aware of the limitations\nAnd aphorism coincides with the trick it is either a ... year old woman half truths\nThat Vienna also had a prestigious fits that tradition something that I think was particularly important to crash in fact throughout his life he gave hundreds of one man shows it's only Katrina white was say it's so important to him\nWhen I think at a had a really ambivalent relationship to the U.S yet that he wanted to become an actor at first that didn't work out and and he very much disliked modern development for instance I'm\nThe director max Reinhardt ... famous that caused this time in Germany especially um he developed they mentioned ... Shelly on productions\nAnd contrary to cost you kind of embrace that yeah 'cause it's a blender but what Christ imagined or was it ... or just to stage\nEdit pieces to shorten them and and make gloom for for the stage but to really stay with the grandma itself and nothing else\n[noise] so the picture on getting of crafts than is before the war is someone who is surrounded by lots of ... wants his\nFriends and someone but at the same time he's a bit of an outsider which which is probably had a choice and pulling the others circumstance I mean this is fascinating like logically I mean I read that he feels like a double outside in Vienna because he was born\nIn a small town and what is now the Czech Republic and they can simply fool and and also because he was Jewish\nI think ah to kind of reiterate one of the most points he he despise the idea of being associated with any particular group\nOr be that ethnic religious political\nUm I think that you saw dangers in complete media you know absorbing oneself and those collective identities\nAnd I think he was especially opposed to the idea of being associated with a group simply because one was born into it simply because Kraus was born into a small bohemian town or because he was born Jewish and I think that's partially explains also crosses lifelong I Would say fairly\nDeeply ambivalent attitude toward his own relationship maybe you'd better said to his own\nJewish identity um but just to give another camp across as thoroughly boost wall but his sympathies in his early life lay with the aristocracy and then as he became more politicized much more so with the working class so in sometimes never with the class to which he\nI'm officially belong in making this is one example of seeing crosses outsider status at work\nFor all his public pronouncements criminals was ... men and kept his personal life to himself but we do know that is great love ... not hung up about ... and patron of the ... based in a small shot so about a hundred miles south across his base in what is now the Czech Republic\nAnd the only country in the ... what was the relationship like\nOne first and foremost it had to be a secret relationship um they met in Nineteen Thirteen one yeah before the war and as he didn't even that Daniel CD as he called her she inspired class to write poetry\nAnd he also wrote 'em over thousands letters to her chewing decor sister relationship the relationship lasted with interruptions until his death\nAnd maybe it's especially notice he ... he had his hands full with a his work you just mentioned that on nine hundred and twenty two issues of to fuck it but I didn't see that Danny's case he really sat down and wrote like every other day and very novel that ah\nThe herd lettuce to him my loss um we don't have them\nBut we know from his lettuce did he shows have very different kind of personality and in them he's really love the I think he would have wanted to marry her she would not\nShe wanted to maybe properly another aristocrat\nBut she's still kept having a relationship with crowds continued to meet him to travel together and you can really call them one of the most important um women is life although ... quite a few so that he had this lonely image isn't true yet actually quite different love life I think\nAnd incidentally herself she provided a quiet place to rest and worked for him and she may have inspired some of the grounds who's best a lyric perjury here is the end of ... to a wrinkle in you\nTend to well remembered line praying a suit to rest muscle so that this final trace of globally grace may remain mud\nAnd even the crowd was usually suspicious of new technology an interesting fact is that he did by a calm fairly early on in Nineteen fourteen and soon when he was so taken by the pleasures of driving she became one of the first female holders\nOf a driving license in Austria Hungary but the carefree days of muttering across Europe was soon ... by the outbreak of first world war and how crowds reacted to the war is the subject for the second part of this for him from Vinci will say this will be back in the ...

country what his great love seed money still resigned as it became independent Czechoslovakia\nYeah well I think I'm going to go back to something Katrina's had early across had been effectively against the war from from very very early on and more so than probably Ninety five percent of his contemporaries but his position toward the monarchy has actually changed quite drastically over the course of the war\nFrom what we could call earlier support of the institution to becoming actually arguably it's most ardent critic\nUm I Would actually argue that cross the war was dragging on especially did not only really anticipate the outcome of it was but that eventually he really desired it because he knew that it would bring this sort of decadent aging and what you saw was holy and moral institution to ruin\nThat is a very institution that actually him who is the war on a subject from the first place\nIn the first few years of the post war period he became what a scholar Edward Tim's is called the quote reluctant Democrat that is to say that cross was always a bit hesitant to fully endorsed the political changes that were transpiring\nWhat concerned cross initially was the economic misery after the war that led so many to become actually ...\nFor something like the good old days are kind of you know make Austria great again even though as cross repeatedly said in various different ways that it was the monarchy that's ultimately responsible for bringing the war which is ultimately responsible for the misery so we're also sort of again you know in his kind of enlightenment\nAttack trying to connect the dots are better than they were actually being connected by many of of all students citizens so I guess to to put his finger across embrace democracy and even for a while the Social Democrats although that relationship became more ten us as the twenties went on\nA but he kept an eye are very keen eye on the reactionary elements of society as they were developing even from early in the Nineteen twenties so specifically the clerical side of Austria\nBut also so called fringe parties on the right for example even the one that hit the represented and actually it's very interesting that I Believe as early Nineteen\nTwenty three out earlier cross was already paying attention to the swastika and already knew who Hitler was and so that's I mean as far as foresight goes are very few who had their finger on the pulse as it were\nAnd we will turn to his view on Hitler in a moment but in the new much smaller Austria that resulted from the ... of the European ... after the war\n... continue to expose what he saw as greed craftsman is and and the stupidity of his fellow citizens but he did keep an eye on the developments elsewhere to end in Nineteen Twenty one\nHe published what was to become one of his most celebrated articles promotional trips to hell no this was prompted by an ad but it's in a Swiss newspaper the trips to the battlefield from the company and tell me why did he watch about this\nWas a witness ... promoted motivating toys as you said to the um as one of the natural fields pie extending off that meant comes to build riots accompanied by coffee cake to places where millions died\nThis kind of battlefield tourism or as you could call it kind of meat packing all the ... of the press a ... a lady supported the ball\nAnd also conveniently forgetting all kinds of mystifying all the horror and atrocities the suffering that happened in that place\nAnd all that I'm kind of as a tourist packages for money [noise] constantly dislike too isn't in itself but in this context it was especially horrifying for him in his text and by the way he mostly test sites the ads and uh it was also at text he'd like to eat a lot\nWell let's head cramps himself reading from his school about trips to help and you don't need to speak German to have the band he suppressed rage in his voice\nFor one of the game when I got a cane and fun and I think he made over if you had any longer\n\nThan a man's feed me not to\nFeed you want to give you know what I'm seeing\nNow when Hitler became chancellor of Germany in early Nineteen thirty three cramps seeing for once lost for words literally in the whole year there was only one very slim edition of ... you know to that with just four pages\nIt contained cross his funeral or ration for his friend the architect\nIdle Lewis and a ... million\nGrounds did publish a three hundred page explanation of why he felt on and so she won't tell me what did he say\nTo answer this question we have to go back to Ninety thirty three is that Hitler was named German Chancellor in late January Ninety thirty three and drive off diverts in February Ninety thirty three [noise]\nA cow started to ride and research an essay a text about the contemporary for him contemporary Nazis seizure of power in Germany relativistic from Vienna\nAnd he wrote this ah three hundred page essay until a late September Ninety thirty three and to prove that are already did a printing proves and he even wrote in handwriting corrections on the proof but then I decided against publication and\nWe can't think of the reasons why I did not publish this text that he coats the victim but bogus knocked filled vote per se not so one reason is that he didn't want to harm the people that he mentioned a in this essay and of course uh [noise]\nUh he did not want to get himself into danger because at that time it could have been really dangerous for him to publish a text like that for example with streak a famous found all suffer and member of the Vienna third call\nAt that time both killed at the stairs of the Vienna University by a crazy young Nazi\nAnd more over he thought that his mode of thinking and writings over than service mode of thinking and riding most just not appropriate adds to capture\nThe violence or the unbelievable violence that both going on in ... in Nineteen Seventy

of our people through healthcare so this is nothing radical uh the history of our the Democratic party has been progressive always has\nI mean it's just like I said Social Security Medicare Medicaid\nThis is just the next logical step I think it's progress\nOr is it ... as you might if I ask you a couple more questions [noise] All right how young\nThey can campaign volunteers campus votes we get the view of the wise old them out of the Republican Party how do for two congressmen and to to ... he says the bacon Eastman contest has national implications\nSo think about this race for the house seat here as a bellwether indicator\nNot only of how things are now but how they may be drifting\nOver the next two years seems to me that if done bacon the Republican nominee winds here that will be a signal that the composition of the voter be that Republican Democrat male or female\nRural or\nUrban or suburban is still leaning objectively moderately to the right\nHere with race at all as I Am I had this point in time you've\nOn the doorstep congressman seems to be winning hearts minds on votes but would it be enough for victory when the broadly conservative state like Nebraska send the progressive punk fund to Washington a question for the support says she's just spoken to the donor\nI Believe that there is potential for our movement based on current political standing\nOn maybe I should say whoa versus I Believe [noise]\nHope rather than believe for the moment on the doorstep from Democrats here in my humble\nJoining me to discuss illicit drugs on MORNING whose political reporter Omaha will Harold and roses I Want to stop at the store you have in the paper today about money which is almost the boys key in these races or Eastman started from a low base but she seems to have the fundraising momentum\nYes so Eason raise one point two five million dollars just in the last three months which tripled the amount of money issues raised before that\nUm she\nHurt her her money is coming from individuals all across in the district and all across the country she's not taking money from corporate tax\nOn and on the political action committee right so so if a company formed a committee to give money to candidates she won't take it she'll take money from unions and from other candidates but she won't take it from corporations so once you've had a million dollars is a lot of money in this district in a quarter on its\nPuts the race on track to be the most expensive ever um and it it really gives her the resources to punt strong in the last month or so\nAnd it's interesting you say a lot of the money's coming from outside of the state does this suggest that national factors all in play\nOh yeah so um [noise] this is definitely\nSeen as a key race for these kind of progressive groups to prove that they can play in in in swing districts like this Nebraska's pretty conservative the district to as he put it out is pretty purple\nBut if and if she can win that means that other progressive candidates in swing districts will get kind of more establishment support 'cause I'll point even and say well she won I can do it too\nAnd we are with ... with geographically right in the middle of America we were in the state it's very rural you know to to the west of where we are now it's\nUm a place which don't elect Republicans for the for the White House again and again and again what about the current income but I mean we don't ... I don't have too many people talk about Donald Trump here but what is the Trump factor in this election\nWell so that's an interesting question and a lot of weather bacon are nice and winds is going to hinge on that Trump was just in town in Iowa right across the river bacon spoke on the same stages hand on Trump kind of gave him his his endorsement um [noise] I hear a lot of people in the last thing that they're really mad about Trump and it's going to inspire them to turn out to vote\n'em but I also hear people on the right thing that they're unhappy with how the Democrats handled the Kavanaugh saying and that might inspire them to vote so I think this may end up being a referendum on Trump and we'll see on November sex what the people say\nAnd in terms of calories and getting the nomination apart from the national picture differently locally has is is ... how is this part of the breath to changing the to the extent that the someone like who gets the nomination so that's\nAn interesting question the demographics of Omaha had not changed um I Would say that the national party has certainly made Medicare for all raising the minimum wage all these things she's pushing a much more normal thing for people to say her whole hypothesis is that in Nebraska\nI'm was nominated moderate Democrats and they've lost because their bases not getting excited well and so her hypothesis is that she can get the basics cited because this is what democratic voters really want to see some briefly one of the polls suggesting at the moment ah most of the polls I've seen have all of the ...\nBut the polls\nSeem to have Ashford up to in the primary and she beat him a former congressman so she has shown that she can really turn out people who aren't used to\nI'm voting ... thanks very much from Nebraska back to you Roger\nSo Jamie ah It's Tuesday so it must be Omaha just briefly tell us what you're getting ...\n... when we come from trading on the ... house seat if we're going to look at the Senate and gubernatorial seat in a state we weren't familiar with ... which comes in I was back in January talking to folks\nIn the district of swung she usually from record bomber twenty twelve to Donald Trump and twenty six thing going to be honest and whether they still like the president ... the the Trump ... is in ... we will be in Wisconsin next year on these\nThings come it's army joining us like that from Nebraska look forward to more from team use out in the U.
