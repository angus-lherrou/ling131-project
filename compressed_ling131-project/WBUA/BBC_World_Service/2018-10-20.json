World Service number if you like the program and we'd like to hear some more of our recent shows that are available hug cash wherever you get your podcasts from [noise]\nToday we're trying to find out the truth behind a video about men spreading that went viral in Russia and videos that according to a European Union website was in fact a piece of propaganda staged by the crime and\nBetter now check one two Oh yes a lot about a lawsuit either that's Josh Russell you had that testing the microphone\nFunny thing about him kind of leaves a double life by day he's a systems analyst\nNights he becomes a Russian troll ... to\nKnow yeah I Do it totally for fun I live in Indiana it's cold here right playing video games at night and if you don't have TV it's sort of what I usually do\nAnd uh at the current moment on into hunting down these Russian trolls\nAnd just to be clear he does it's totally free as far as we know he's not on the payroll full any security or intelligence agency that's just the thing he goes out of his way to identify social media accounts that are deliberately and openly stirring arguments on line\nThis sounds like the kind of forensic work that you'd expect security or intelligence agencies to be doing but Josh has a background in programming and I see he\nUnderstands social media and he knows the mind a patrol because well he used to be a troll he got a kick out of pushing people's buttons on line\nA room uh\nHaving followed dozens of Russian for all accounts having studied that'd be have yet ... isn't a great position to tell us what information warfare looks like in real life\nAnd he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of this man's spreading video\nThis really really fits it'd almost perfect example of the pattern that you see these Russian trolls or or the Russians on social media take over and over and over again they're\nGoing to either create or take a piece of controversial material they're going to release it onto their\nState funded media social media platforms and then they're going to start talking about that piece of information right\nBut I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context of politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked\n\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is\nThe ... he's a research fellow at the center for deep still future at the University of Southern California but more importantly he's a big star wars fan [noise]\nWhen Star Wars the last jet I came out last year some ... with the casting choices you see never before has the star wars film had so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles in fish is gone some fancy evening\nAt the same questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at director Bryan Johnson\nSome of them actually behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we call ... ...\n... somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nAt the state you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying three weeks before the election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kind of have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's something else that doesn't really matter\nLet's stick to digest that it's not the divisions haven't always existed in society seek the style was example whatever people's thoughts would about the constant choices there would always be some people who would agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... all rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives ... infiltrating these spaces and sending up the volume as you were those disagreements and of course a fractured society is a society that struggles to take action\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what does your does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media in the context of conversations about the me too movement and so on\nThe ... is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments divvy do gets picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative\nIt's only down to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided\nIf you are sympathetic to honest points you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repels\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that a rabid conservative writers just spinning out of control\nOn the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias then divvied year will only ... days in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of this senseless political correctness brigade in action [noise]\nSo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program Ken we conclusively say that ... video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ease campaign against this information suggesting if you're looking\nFor a smoking

and he's storytelling style\nHis latest novel my name is Adam first published in twenty sixteen has just been translated into English it's about the forest exile of Palestinians from the homeland after the foundation of the Israeli state in Nineteen forty eight\nI asked him how much of the novel is based on actual fact\nVoted fiction no in these days of this story that to the days of the get the ...\nThere is a lot of reality but not not that ... that threw the background is it is they get to a an ... that in Ninety four to eight\nAnd the conditions are very well described in the book which are old leave but besides that the characters all the characters are fiction and the the how to book moves such\nAs a point during the book and you referred to this several times the theme of silence so the imposition of silence on people what are you getting at when you focus on that specific no actually actually silence\nIs part of ... all the big through in my experience is that the victims are and there are times but it's Rome than they are silenced by history because the Palestinian story was never hurt but there was another story which was covering it\nAnd for the world which means you're all the other story was bigger because it was beautiful made that story that is the whole coast was done by Europeans\nAnd so the ... book is your dad was and how you can make citations speak how we would take\nThe fragments of words you know the mother of of of and I'm used to speak in in fragments and fragments foods and hit the could lift demeaning from the fragments of her silence and the whole book this I mean\nIt does the ... with the silence this ... of understanding silence\nAnd the making from silence\nLet's see it meaning for position and also the third thing about science is you know you know\nWhen is it a gate to the Jews of your of where we're not very well respected because they went to there's this like sheep's this is the term was because it was in

be nothing this dude and to mean that you are recovered enough to cover it is it's something that's\nWhat about breaking the silence\nUnit but actually the silence is is is that which comes afterwards it come from ... and do you think about the size of the groups and the science of victims\nWe've come out little by little ... and ... for Mr woody and this duty is I think you know history does it and by the victors\nThe victims that only resort is threats to ... and ... is more powerful than history\nThat could be applied across the ... of course the more victims were able to tell their stories\nI Know what I meant you know the book is shaking vision stand with can be anywhere in the words\nIt can be ... you know and the second volume scary knowing that it'd be cool for an English it to be in two years you would see it just seems situation I must be about the the the numbers\nBut the situation where victims find themselves is very familiar with an old as humans we have ordered

something very very important is that even with the dominance of his ... ignition industry Korea does I go to university says there are people who are my other my mentor so I see myself in in the\nLebanese Russia ... ... ... when you go to many novels or the program left that notion of silence or they have much to chime with what he was thinking about\nIt I mean I think one of the things that he is trying to do it and he says he's trying to give voice to the victims that are written out of history and I think that that uh the world over the world and there and I think that in some ways retelling stories such that the victims of the Holocaust are not made to be cowards are making out the Palestinians\nHe ended up being expelled or remains or do we tell their story in ways that allows for them to be incorporated very incorporated into the stories we tell about our past\nIt's been something that actually I'd ask what has been doing since the Nineteen seventies at night almost every novel that he has written as been concerned with the questions that's\nHow what the place through these people ... taken in history and his long although he himself has not been easy it's long been concerned that the question of Palestine and many of his novels or that Palestinians\nAnd the ... it's a story about the the more impact it has obviously absolutely I think um you know ... ... ... narratives um which is what stories are incredibly important and in fact we\nSee every day we engaged in the battle of narratives and when we forget and the problem is always that\nUm the ... or the right wing as a for a long time have been much better in telling a story than um liberals 'em and certainly in the past twenty five years was a difficult how to tell the story\nThat narrative

an unassuming sore from the outside very simple design and what I saw of course when I got there in the morning before it opened was people starting to line up and we saw that across Canada people lining up outside of these new legal stores are waiting for it open to be among the first customers of legal candidates in the country\nSome of them said you know they'd been waiting for this for forty years for fifty years and\nYou know other said they never thought they'd be something like this and the lifetime so when the store opened a cat in the morning first customers walked in you know big cheer corrupted and throughout the day as people were coming out they were showing off what they thought they were really just excited to be part of of that day that legalization in Canada\nCanada goose is only the second country all the Europe wide to to legalize cannabis legalize why this decision well they didn't even by\nThe Trudeau government is that prohibition has been a failure in their view the Canadians we're still heavy users of the drug especially Canadian use minors teenagers and so on\nSo they said look we're going to try and bring in this new strict control regulation framework instead and enjoying so they hope to reduce what they see as a failed system with a more effective is the one that keeps drugs out of the hands of miners profits out of the hands of criminals and and would reduce it\nSome of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use\nYou talk about strict controls that are regulations will still be in place then well just briefly what it looks like what is legal status\nThe country depending on the province the federally an adult so that's about Eighteen or Nineteen years old depending on where you are will be able to\nPurchase from a license producer\nAnd possess thirty grams of the drug and dried form or its equivalent in Cedar oil form and you'll be able to use it again it's a bit of a patchwork same someplace and you'll just be able to use it in a private residence and others like Ontario for example has most populous\nProvince you can use it a sense the the same way you would if you were smoking cigarettes huge youth tobacco that's roughly what it looks like now\nIt is regulated so a you have to buy it from a license producer it's still illegal to buy it on the black market\nTo possess over thirty grams there actually is a new infractions around selling minors which carry a charge up to fourteen years in prison\nNow of course the Canadian Medical Association journal called it a national uncontrolled experiment not everybody is thrilled with this development that\nNot everybody is thrilled a lot of especially health organizations health groups putting out press releases urging a lot of caution so there was that organization that you know that an organization representing psychiatrists warning about use of the drug\nFor people under twenty five so their concerns around developing brains issues around mental health a society representing gynecologist an obstetrician saying there was a growing body of evidence that there was risk of using the drug among pregnant women concerned about the development of the fetus so again\nBoth organizations were saying be cautious make smart decisions\nNow we're hearing a lot about a green rush up all the possible boon to the economy that this development could have more to people thinking about that in the months after legalization\nHere in Canada I mean one of the headlines you saw almost every day it was just talking with the stock prices of some of these big license producers just rising and rising and rising a lot of speculation a lot of people really interested in joining this legal market they give you an idea Canada statistics agency it's national agency\nCrunching numbers they tried to figure out how many people used it what kind of market there was any twenty Seventeen they found that Canadians used or spent rather\nAbout five point seven billion dollars on candidates\nMost of that was in the black market so that just gives you a rough idea\nAnd of course because Canada is doing this and it's a it's amongst the first to do it all the countries will be watching very closely with they absolutely\n... and across the world is just been a bit of a shift around the attitude towards marijuana we're seeing obviously\nCanada is taking a very big step of the kind of a bold step I was in it is an experiment into this full legalization model but a lot of in the U.S of course a lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drag on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states\nAnd we're seeing other countries bringing on line medical marijuana frameworks for seeing other countries looking at decriminalization so having this experiment in Canada seeing whether or not the Trudeau government is able to realize the goals they put forward and if that is a successful thing I think\nThere may be you know obviously other countries looking at that and seeing how that plays out I was Jessica Buffy in Canada and that's it from the will this week from now if
