Donald Trump's administration unless you Nikki Haley the ambassador to the UN is to step down it's not clear why but the announcement was a bit of nothing\nJust a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we've solved a lot of problems or one of the process of selling a lot of problems\nWere work at what has happened is for the United states on foreign policy now the United states is not\nFavorite thing if we say we're going to do something we fall when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was saying that our country to pay their share I mean whether the ... the main thing they did the fed and all of\nThat um is highly is one of the few high profile but in in the administration of former governor of South Carolina she had been a critic of Donald Trump but once you go to jump she became loyal\nAnd a forceful and voice for the president or an also kept lines of communication open at the un ah she said to be close to Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner yesterday at that press conference she described him as quote a hidden genius that no one understands that there's still a baby sees Pete ... in LA what does she go\nShe says she's going because she has been in public life for a number of years now and she simply wants to step back from it she says she doesn't believe in term limits in other words he doesn't believe in indefinite rose in public life so she wants to step back\nAnd let someone else in to do what is honestly quite a difficult job with a tensions between the U.S and many other nations at the moment just look at the relationship with Russia with Iran the run the all of those issues and of course North Korea as well with\nNikki Haley has been absolutely central to in terms of sanctions against that country it's a it's a tough job and she said she wants to step back from it and give someone else a guy that's going on so the speculation is that she is a very ambitious political animal and perhaps one day she my my son for the presidency herself\nWhat is she ... she left on very good terms but she always agreed with Donald Trump had she\nNo she didn't always agree that indeed during his election campaign she initially didn't support him but they have become pretty close she certainly echoed his\nAmerica's first message chip perhaps as it applies to what was the domestic policy but on the international studies you know she was a quite a strident critics for example of of Russia on Syria of course at the un but especially on\nRussia She she seemed more inclined to criticize Russia whereas the president's might stay\nQuiet she has said many things that clearly that the president's agrees with she was fiercely critical of what she claimed to be on the global the anti Israel biased over the United\nNations she supported the shutting off of us funding for the UN's Palestinian refugee agency in terms of the detail of a lot of the policy she was echoing what Donald Trump\nSaid but equally she was a single minded person I think it was part of a the agreement when she got the job that she could speak a mind than she'd be more than just a figurehead\nAnd who of course it's got to take a place do we know till\nWe don't know you asked him will know according to the president and a few weeks time there is ... the number one name at the time for the lifting the poll Dina pound is a former deputy national security advisor to President Trump\nAnd according to some reports here she was approached in the last few days to discuss this

country that have been quite vocal about sexual harassment and the me too movement does not hide it it's every way even in body weight and and you know in your in your experiences on the ... what's your personal observations\n[noise] um the thing is because I started we\nSaw in the like really independent films and\nI also started working with a lot of uh women golfing directors and women filmmakers like Brooklyn but Sarah gather on and a bar with Nina yard of a it was a little different for me um I did encounter some\nAre kind of you know uh in in the windows in the beginning when I came to Mumbai [noise] um and I sort of a always avoided um that sort of group and the people who positive and windows to me and I never worked with them I never ended up working with them\nI always ended up working with people who later became friends and then I kept repeating working with them\nSo up to be honest I avoided a hug did act gossiping out problems\nAnd it's not the way you deal with them is to avoid working with them to do where you vocal against these people that are passed these characters yes in the beginning\nI just said that okay no thank you I work with some other people because I I I don't I Know with a ... or something\nLike this but if you know the thing is it's never did it it's always it comes in I'm In a suggestion and when I got that suggestion I just\nI just said that will get fine I'm not going to need that person anymore\nAnd so in the beginning in the first one on to yours if my career that's what I did and then in the industry everyone has a

even want to be in their phones because they know that it's not going to happen with me and uh\nSo I ended up working with people um I continuously ended up working with people repeatedly working with people who became friends and who really meant professionalism and walk and jobs there was no pressure on you know and that was the all out\nAnd that was your way of dealing with it and they have some of the editor of the news a miniature told the BBC so many allegations have come a have come out now and something needs to be done about you've had the time and again when it comes to sexual harassment in India the ... are you confident that something will be done about this I think I think it's\nGonna take dime but what is a wonderful is that the young girls are really really courageous it wasn't like that then you know back Fifteen Years back when I started working\nLike I wouldn't uh come out in public and the presidency that also and so I tried to do that with me and that's I'm not working that's on so right right I Would just say okay like forget about it I'm not looking at that person because you might try to do that I because I felt as they're even in in in when during a session\nSo I said okay fine I Walk with each other a lot of people right but did not want to because it it's such a boy's club now what has happened is that the young little girl as I read I Am so happy that courageous empowered they're saying that oh you know so and so did it\nAnd I'm I'm really glad that's happening so there's a ripple effect because now when I'm sitting with a lot of friends and you know what the lord of the the guy slob they're like oh my God this is like scary ... everyone is scared okay be careful\nAnd ah and my stage in my career I really don't even know who is

Hong Kong welcomed home to ... you are one of Europe's very few female moms but you're also a writer a social activists want do you see is your most important role\nActually ah I'm not one of the few that are actually quite a lot of female in my arms around the wealth also in Europe so it's a myth that seem like ... it's a totally new phenomenon will have a we have female in ... in China since the Eighteen twenty and us and Canada in Germany they have a very\nLarge community for female in mind having a house in the book that the ...\nAnd ... they've started a mosque also with ...\nAnd ... they have also communities are and also they started a sense of ice that makes theology where they're in the future are about to educate a new generation of the night in mines in Switzerland as well in that somebody\nElse out so hot and then also but we're within the scope of his boss community of\nWorldwide Muslims and it's still an extraordinarily unusual thing to be but it just I just wonder whether for you it is the religious practice that's most important all the social activism that goes with it\nIt's both actually that was shutting off got\nIt is only ten percent of the words that would do in the mosque because we have the friday prayer but besides that Ninety percent of our work it's centered around human rights work\nRecently I had a lot together with the group of activists than than my nine thesis of Muslim reform based on his land Nick principles of justice\nAnd this guy faces are of course when the fight to service female moms today it is still too many Muslims as something very rare and and strange and before we started the last two years ago and then not\nThe majority of lessons and then like they didn't even know that scene in moms was a possibility and why it's because we have normalized these patriarchal structures within religious institutions for decades\nSo you see it as your job in the marry a mosque to espouse a sort of feminist version of Islam right\nBut the but the thing is how do you do it how do you deliver your criticism I always think of my criticism in a very nuanced a form and I think that's really crucial the thing is here that I'm here to create an alternative I'm here to surf\nAnd your generation of Muslims in Denmark and abroad who have some acute needs when it comes to and Islam and and how to practice Islam and the twenty first\nYou're talking about radical change within your face and we're systems in the streets you ... frankly biased\nWas the sound is you're gonna have to I don't want to do not\nWant to be friends with the Saudis I was talking about the conservatives or the tradition in this because the majority of Muslims in Denmark are traditionalists or conservative and\nTo do ... do you agree with this is a really interesting words that came from a President Obama's former State Department envoy today in communities around the world of them as a farmer pundits\nAnd she said this at the end of her posting off to you know considering what you eat in the Muslim world she said\nOf sound influenced she said it's pernicious and universal in each place I visited the hobby influence insidious presents the U.S must do we sort of the U.S must disrupt the training of extremists in moms do should be concerned about the way in which the Saudi money I was\nIn ... new share that concern a lot and\nThat's that's why I have a ... as her in a tip we want to create alternate says what to disseminate\nEven as his on his arm in Europe and abroad and we're not only is halting this is about creating change on the ground and if we look at the changes that we have made so far let me give you an example then assess a T of interfaith marriages today\nMuslim women cannot marry outside their faith unless the men converts to Islam unless you are cultural Muslim or you do not\nReally practice on so this is actually an acute dilemma and we have couples coming from Norway Sweden Denmark and friends even UK to get married and then my mosque because we are able to serve them and we are\n... the Koran with a focus on gender equality allowing lesson women to marry non Muslims\nIn Tunisia they change the law last year in December Seventeen so now it's also legally possible to marry outside Islam for a woman it has always been a possibility for the men because it's stated clearly in the Koran that a muffin man can marry a Jew or Christian or non Muslim\nBut the the opposite is not stay the candy but he does not stated either that a woman ... so we use that as already Timothy\nBut you go to another problem there are many people in Denmark a\nPolitician's if the rights in the far right secularists those who have a deep suspicion of Islam and all of its forums to look at you and feel that you represent a danger because you you appear to make\nIslam more acceptable to a Danish minds when in fact they say many of your core attitudes are just to sort of aliens to Danish values as the so called Islam is\nIt's a very little minority or having that we're getting that said\nWell let's go through a few of the specific points about you you claim to the beginning of the money among experimental the founding of the most you said you were going to have mixed friday prayers then you can also no that's not ... I don't believe you do a mixed ... lead\nWas true but I didn't back off when you create a community people come and then join you that's a policy democracy so the majority they voted for women's mosque\nOn friday because they wanted to to establish a magical fear with women only where women could say what they want and express themselves and in the beginning I was really\nI was very sad about him back home flooded I didn't back off I accepted that the piles democracy you had to let the majority of when you have to uh I have to make the constitution because the confusion is vital\nWhen you want to create change you have to understand the art of flourishing\nIf you burn all the richest behind you cannot be a bridge builder who so I I really ... that\nBecause we have a women's ... only on friday and all other days it's for men we have men coming from different countries to pray because we have centered in the middle of Copenhagen as the only mosque vary but in my life my point was that if you want to create change would have to do it slowly and ... and we can do the real revolutions\nMike the interfaith marriages given women the right to divorce we can do these things\nBecause we are actually unsafe theological problem because nobody can criticize that if\nYou are making such interesting points I Need to pick a way of looking at it now your philosophy is fascinating move slowly you say never bone you'll bridges ... by that way you achieve change\nWhat I'm hearing from news but it is a very delicate insensitive balancing act let's just take one more example I think a number of things you a quote unquote your political opponents on the run through would go on your stand after that a crisis over the cartoon\nIn a unit was posted in ... I think there was a fight it first came out with the top two became a sort of litmus test in Denmark for whether you are supportive of\nFree speech that he wants to build opinion whether in the case of many Muslims in the country you should that be offensive and us about cartoons you trumped all else now it seemed to mental that was that that some\nThat's not my quotation I'm not\nQuitting but this is your quotation you said\nFreedom of expression in your view must be used more delicately said when is the dialogue democracy the cartoonist in this case is claiming to establish that sounded to many dangers do you actually are defending the rights of Muslims in Denmark not to be offended and will not defending the rights of the cartoon\nNow not on the other hand I with new on saying that debate I said that we have to understand we're living in a globalized fault and if you're living in a globalized while you have to yourself what do you what you want to have a dialogue with people and you're not talking they said that they once in a dialogue with my son ...\nIf you really truly wishes a dialogue you have to understand you have to ask me sensual question what is important to you and why freedom of speech is an essential value to the majority of Muslims in the world\nAnd that sacredness of the Koran is also and the Central Valley too many muffins and the well so we we have a group of friends who have different principles that they value at the same time so my point is that we have to understand that we have people among us who have\nA values who are essential to them at the same time so it's not a matter of favoring the secretary of the crime over freedom of speech it's a matter of understanding that if you want to enter the dialogue you'll have to understand that people they have different principles of what is valuable at the same time\nAnd and I I I Do a ... century throughout this that that you are trying to find a very fine line to conduct your work and you're like yeah but you've written a book and it's all about how you want to see a\nSort of a feminist take within Islam and I understand a lot but you say at the end and they're very searing the onus passage at the end but we said this comes at a price\nThis is not easy and we have to pay a price if we really want to fight for our principles and values and you paid\nA very personal price which you reveal at the end of the book test it cost you your marriage yes to a man who you you kind of ... is a good man but he was of Pakistani Danish origin his view of his religion was different from yours\nHe felt that you'll find for what you believed in was dangerous to your family and in the end it seems that ruined your marriage wasn't worth it\nYes it was worth it because I think that there's so many people they won the revolution they support the revolution and they want the changes\nBut they just don't want that delta or their wife to be a head of the rather the ship and somebody has to be ahead of the revolution so to me it was not a matter of choice I didn't make a choice\nBecause I place myself head of the revolution and it's impossible to withdraw when you're just started it\nBut that has a cost that goes beyond you your husband the coolest your children your wind the family that must be something that weighs heavy [noise] of course it does of course it that's when you were at peace with the decisions you have taken the fight your fight I'm at peace and\nLive for our children are very proud of what I'm doing and\nI have a family who who really supportive so I'm at peace\nTree uncommon fascinating and thank you very much for joining on hold\nThanks yes distribution of the b._b._c.
