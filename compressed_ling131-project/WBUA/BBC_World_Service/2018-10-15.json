in the United states of America is a country where\nAll the citizens are equal under the law and\nShare a sense of common purpose shared values do you believe in that\nIf you're asking me to I Believe in the ideal of equality shared values equal citizenship\nYes of course that is a part of the current tradition a of of of a western liberal as and\nThat's not really the issue that we're facing now however it's a matter of whether the values that we press fast actually have any reflection in what's happening or in the United states one of the things that was so disturbing\nAbout the cabin I hearing is just watching um the institution that is so important in maintaining those ideals basically being a over override with pot politics with\nUm impartial impartiality being rejected as a measurement of of a qualification for a judge so those of us who are really concerned about the distance between the ideals and the reality of American society are willing to strike at this point over the direction that the country is going in\nBright and it's interesting to me that you and made it a point to the the sort of toxic process around the\nAppointment or the nomination first that's an appointment of of judge Brett Kavanaugh to become a justice of the Supreme Court and we will of course around the world watched that play out in Washington DC and there is there for a temptation to see that the Trump presidency with the Kavanaugh nomination a whole host of other\nThings too has in a sense create seeds divisions\nHas sort of opened up wounds that the one that before but but that can't be true kind of I mean he he's perhaps more brutally expose them to but the preexisting\nWell of course the name of the United states is a a country that built on some tremendous ah violations of some of the very values that it's representative of so you know a flavoring I'm a genocide\nBeyond your own group whether it be women or whether it be African American you know to build a winning coalition you've got to go national and you're going to obviously you include man and you go to include a a range of of ethnicities so how\nDo you go about building booze coalitions that cooperation\nSo I I guess I have to roll back for a moment and just in just that you know as you mentioned you're familiar with my writing in my writing the hope\nIs to talk about the kind of ... coalitions that are necessary in order to realize are a state of values and object is um there are many applications of intersection Eli across any number of differences and cross any number\nOf forms and discrimination one of the points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago I was to say that the failure of the coalition between anti racist and feminist was one of the factors that led to the elevation of Clarence Thomas\nAh over in as against the claims that were made by Anita Hill\nI'm the what I argue there was that there was a common history of anti racism and feminism found and the fact that the very term\nSexual harassment at the very knowledge meant that sexual harassment is in fact discrimination was largely set forward by African American women plaintiffs\nWho are experiencing discrimination when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism into ...\nBut but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights campaigners have looked at the history of looks as you say the failure of the times of of white feminist to make common cause with the black ...\nI'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says I find myself at the end of my into into sexual feminist road it's time to ... back into survival mode the dumpster fire and live by a ... feminist agenda and I\nAm I mean I could just laying people\nWho actually say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much grouping is\nUm respond to moments like these by showing that there are a few individuals um who think differently of course we don't all think alike\nI'm so having a quote from someone who um is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of of white women it's not surprising I'm often frustrated by that as well\nIn fact I'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe doctors lazy Ford there is a far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean the gender isn't significant that doesn't mean the patriarchy isn't working sure it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time not wanting to describe the problem\nI I get I get the into sick now the argument that you couldn't bring different groups of press people together to make common cold and that can make a very big difference I get but\nI guess what I'm I'm moving to orders are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out a tool to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be the ... the majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way you do you see that you can use your arguments and your powers of persuasion to make inroads among those groups if we pull groups\nWell many of us are I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side of the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that\nThe civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was a multiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the differences\nI think in fact uh the last week opens up even more possibilities are every thing that we've been seeing suggest that many women are particularly those of that fifty three percent that and that in fact voted for Trump\nOr may be rethinking that but let's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nDo you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the president they feel about Iraq Obama 'cause he's with the midterms coming up is going to the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know the whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and it'll be the Americans not his own\nFrom every demographic do you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need\nListened to and be mindful of cause he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect Brock Obama actually Washington rather cool enough he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWhy they can stop for president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements a\nWith a ... on on a range of issues some of them having to do with the the failure to actually even have a rhetoric um that identifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities\nAnd I had took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but then excluded women and girls but that was a minor\nI'm sort of difference um within a broader reality and that we are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he\nTried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support them votes of uh the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania\nI'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's in good reminder of the fact that this isn't an inevitable dimension of American pilots\nAnd I'm just a final thought on that as we go into elections that we're in an election season or the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive coalition that is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nUh the ... democratic votes as you said a clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the poultry liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale white\nWith the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino support says that again in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and ... group based politics is he's a very complex\nA complex set of relationships and the attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I don't I make the complexity even greater I'm the most normalize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones that gave the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a\nUS Senator who are with suffered a Democrat or to the elected from Alabama and a generation or they're black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges how can we not only use black women\nAs the wheels on the bass but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agendas\nThat actually speak to them as we can figure that out will probably be able to figure out how to sneak across the working class can black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political global mobilize\nA coalition that's what we're looking for in this in this election will see\nWe will indeed seeking really Crenshaw thank you very much for joining me on hold to\n\nDistribution of BBC World service in the U.S has made possible by

malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data\nAnd in particular data about you I mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth in the last several decades\nStill people as it Saturday panic about ... someone else's harvesting that dates are particularly if they're getting a free service and Rita and if it's a social platform or something else\nHad their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely anyone so\nWhat is the onset of its emphasis architectural weakness well\nYou're seeing people like Tim burners ... served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put the control over the data about you that you generate in your hands period\nYou have got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you you may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person wants that her corporation wants her government once with us\nWe're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential\nAs Tim burners Lee has publicly not only develop these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have this\nSort of the most simple level it is forcing Internet users regular citizens lead your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than opting out is is now kind of gently being posted\nThat's absolutely correct and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you relative to other humans\nBut right now you're in danger if you share your data from insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happen to them that are bad in their future\nSo I think the European Union in some ways is further

and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of analysis especially at Twitter data and the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so for example\nThe Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on online I very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by pots\nYou know I did a quick search this morning and found one tweet by Trump that was promoted by sixty percent box but generally ...\nPercent of the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or did they say of comments on line is that\nThere is a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with the deliver intent to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left and the idea is to divide those two groups of people further and heart in ... by their beliefs are that in order to change their behavior and specific way it\nIs extraordinary and then you just take a moment to think about what that means if you were to transform Twitter or Facebook these platforms into a a physical community we'd be standing or in a crowd of people Seventy percent which would be machines\nYou know it'd be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk about people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the way I'm kinda like living in the Truman Show\n[laughter] it is sold in the living dead might be another movie but I I just people presumably understand that they still don't understand that I mean you and another political commentator without having that conversation and I'm telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably because they're still talking to each other or at least they think\nYeah I mean when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that\nOr box or algorithms whatever they might be\nAnd the retreat them they'll use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them the way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire and then normal people get involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on off and on what's trending on Twitter or Facebook\nAnd those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially an architect id by a group of fake accounts\nOn social media\nSo you say the mainstream news meter of complicit in in that eventually as everyone else\nI Would love to see a major media company out them take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to make as a media company but it hasn't yet not yet\nBuried under ... who suggests a variety of on says to fixing these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like block trying to help verify people's identities on the Internet\nI think one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block chain generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with the reliability pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the ... is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all those new they're connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is so\nDecentralized yeah there will be in a decentralized the kids know trying to do it\nSee centralized but it's also you can't delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you\nCan see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did the interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which we could at least improve the architecture the social social platforms absolutely yeah are you optimistic that this is going to ... that we have a way through because ultimately we will go live with the Internet is not going to go away because on invented\nCan we I'm very optimistic I think we we live in a really interesting time for the Web where I think we've outgrown the architecture of the Internet but the good news is that people like him are coming along and really really care about and focused on how do we reinvest like what is it looked like to reinvent an Internet that actually built to do\nWhat it does today there are a lot of people out there that
