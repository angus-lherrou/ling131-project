China and runner I go to copy of today's Sunday Times newspaper here with me and he writes about the corruption charges against the Interpol president in China\n[laughter] that's right and many will know that he was arrested last week in Beijing and is now being put up on bribery charges in China but it's part of a much bigger story which is a crackdown by Xi Jinping the Chinese leader\nAnd his Communist Party government's own not just corruption but actually political opposition as well so the two things come together\nAnd that enabled by one very interesting phenomenon which is really big in China the gruesome alteration intelligence ... so\nThe state is using tech for surveillance in China\nMuch more than any other government in the world you might say it's almost a kind of trial run for a soldier surveillance state in which everyone's behavior is going to be monitored they'll have little ID cards and on those not just\nThe financial details or your rent a criminal record but also things that you do in the neighborhood may be recorded so there's a real social change happening in China and this\nAnti corruption stories just one positive yes\nBecause I read an extraordinary thing on the news was yesterday and this was the the the the software that isn't in in the hands of the Chinese state was going to be used to target the credit rating to lower the credit rating of anyone found smoking in public\nThat's right it's what's called social credit in other words if you do things in the criminal but or in some ways against public morals could be crossing the road wrong place almost seriously of course criticizing the government that will be on the record and you might find that for instance you turn up at the railway station you want to buy a rail ticket\nAnd you'll id cubs sorry you didn't have enough social credit points to actually do that it's a completely new way of controlling the population and it's going to get bigger and bigger\nRope to you mentioned earlier in the program about your research on race based immigration in some West African countries how much debate do you see about this in the country is concerned\nWell it's race based citizenship causes so the countries Liberia and Sierra Leone which I'm we're formally\nUm slave sort of a slave history with those two countries where former ... from the United states and Britain Kamen founded these countries as a form of\nEnabling black people to own the means of production and running their own state of affairs um and so the two countries have race citizenship clauses that basically stay only people of negro descent so effectively black people can be citizens of Liberia and Sierra Leone\nUm and what's fascinating for me about this historically is that you know the Westphalia and his thumb says uh or or sort of use whiteness as a reference for citizenship white and it's a male in this as a reference for citizenship but what these countries are effectively doing and you can debate whether or not it's right or wrong\nIs that they're censoring blackness as a reference for citizenship and for me this is incredibly revolutionary\nBecause it basically states you know this black lives matter movement black lives matter movement and bringing to the fore that black lives matter um and black citizenship better than it should be the central focus point for having a discussion about us citizenship there is a debate particularly in Liberia about whether or not it's important to aggregate applause\n\nDentist that he thought people were crying and shouting I go down and looked at him line they're leading such confusion no one knew what to do\nIs killers have never been brought to justice protected by an amnesty law after the Nineteen Ninety to peace agreement I spoke to the American journalist gene Columbus in South Salvador\nIt's mainly an atmosphere of great joy and celebration they're having two major celebrations tonight in different places one being the ... the jewel downtown\nWhere he gave those Sunday homily that made him so famous the other is little chapel on the grounds of a hospital for people with terminal cancer which was the place where he chose to live as archbishop and it's the place where he was murdered while thing mess one night\nThat will be people who've never heard of Oscar Romero who is he was so important\nHe was the archbishop appear in touch with her the capital from Nineteen Seventy seven to Nineteen eighty and these were the years just before the twist\nAnd he was he was really be loved and respected because he spoke out very strongly about injustices that existed here and at\nThat time the country was under a military dictatorship so that was pretty risky thing to do and in fact it ended up costing does life he was shot to death the day after\nHe gave us Sunday sermon directing themselves specifically to the members of the armed forces and saying to them you do not have to obey and the moral order to go out and and kill people and that did not go down well with some of the authorities who killed him\nWell it was for the most part people from you know on the government side the military or were recalled these death squads although it's really important to point out\nThat there was a growing leftist movement here today actually grew into a a guerilla movement that launched the war\nAnd when they did when they committed human rights abuses archbishop Romero was very quick to condemn them too so he was even handed if you will you make a mistake and are you do something wrong and you can count on him denouncing you\nFor it in his homily the following Sunday no matter what your political position was\nHis killers of never being brought to justice why not\nWell for a long time after the war ended in Nineteen Ninety two there was an amnesty law and with that the case couldn't go anywhere now the country's Supreme Court has overturned that ends the law and\nActually this week in Rome the leader of the Catholic Church cardinal roast the child has has said he thinks it's really important\nThat there be a trial because he says the wounds from the war has never healed and the only way for them reading to heal is for the country to find out what the truth really was about his assassination and then for justice to the applied\n[noise] that was journalist gene Columbus speaking to me from El

did nothing for the southern African countries they accused him\nOf being a racist Jimmy Kenya teaches media and communications at the University of Malawi and told me why he backed his tool\nGandhi had most in Malawi has no connection to our country is still a dollar in Africa and it's interesting in the listener is I've been to publication was about a quiz show me his stance on Africa Africa's not getting about he was one way or the other interesting\nYeah a lot of people will be quite surprised to hear this but except perspective that much in recent years more is the evidence somehow McGahn deep being racist [noise] when\nYou look at the relations in Malawi has quite a large Indian community and the most of them run businesses and of our business owners and there's always been sort of conflict between\nIndia and business owners and allow in weight as the Indian or many of them allowing doesn't leave him ... doesn't really socialize with a list or the ... malaria and community so from my perspective there's a context to that argument\nAnd yet there is a significant Indian community in Malawi ... unless you've said you have the Indian government building this conference center [noise] he is the\nPoint from in the gum and destructive is more or less like how they argued in gun away the gun in government was forced to take it starts to get my to my gun from the rest of the argument the van was that it has been sort of cardio relationship and there's been good a diplomatic relations between that country and India just an argument that as being made in\nMalawi and here we're talking about is that you something that is going to stand in the middle of Malawi his commission will copy to all\nOf them are certainly be a sign of tolerance if you want to have this statute build a sign up not always moved on yes\nYou could I get from that perspective but then when they begin to think about what a ... completely different thing by ... you're telling future generations under kind of shows that he had somebody that I Do my ... it'd be\nSo if not in the hot and the guy who would you like to have a statue of\nThis why do they still have my lawyer so useful for me just to name one goes on but I think it would just like the ... started ...\n... ... who is one was a part of an phone you're struggling this country had to British national didn't take us by this things actually up in ... it's a terrible struggles people are struggling indeed brings out ... pretty much every country and I'd have to do something about it wouldn't be looking for something\nShe mean Kenya from the University of not always as statues are a bunch of things some say I'm broke tell absolutely I think what's interesting about this case it it really is it comes out of this outbreak Seventy colonization pan African is a movement across the continent where people are looking at colonial structures\nStreets I'm ... and just recently changes names that you saw teeny to go back to the indigenous name 'em and even the roads must fall movement at the University of Cape Town with black students talked about it pits that make violence\nUm whereas you know racist policies across the university needed to move this uh the statue of suffer roads with a sinister colonialists I'm across the southern African region so I think\nIt it's it's a bigger kind of conversation that's happening across the continent in academics basis but also at national level round the U.S needs to that to what did you make of it\nWell first of all I Hope that uh the the speakers what's it going to um campaign to have the name of the city of land time change 'cause I think that's nothing and ditched his name but I'd say there's two reasons why respectfully I Would completely disagree with his position\nThe first one is that he said the gum do you have nothing to do with Africa in fact ... having spent large parts of his life in South Africa\nAcross the whole of Africa and Kenya in South Africa and elsewhere Indian communities would deeply involved with liberation movements the African National Congress of course very closely involved with the Indian National Congress which for independence to India\nAnd remembering the liberation was cosmopolitan existed across confidence not just within Africa within India is very important and the second even more important reason is to do with non violent resistance that we've done these great contribution to independence movements the idea of mass\nKnown violence in our current terribly violent era\nI think that's the contribution that's well worth making of course ... reprehensible views when he was younger he moved completely does gates there's when he was older and rejected cost racism and so forth so understanding how ... developed means that they're not saying that human beings who deserve respect\nAnd gum has much to say Africa as great African leaders like Monday law have to the entire world\nYeah it's interesting isn't it though how one person can be viewed differently in two different places ten seconds each\n[noise] yeah I mean I think you know I I hear the the points that are taken I think the the concerns across Malawi are um are valid again coming out of the colonial sort of an African is anti racist movement um but yeah you're you're absolutely right that that the power perspective isn't it Ronald ten seconds from you\nI Would say the ... and ... should be placed all around the world and plenty of other figures too\nAbout the final word Rona miss a professor of
