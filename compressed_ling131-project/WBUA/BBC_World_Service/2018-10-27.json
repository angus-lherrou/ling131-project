I guess\nThe only one we wrote about something that was not through to re suddenly see a spike in Google Search traffic\nSimone didn't didn't find success when watching about stories that were true he found a substantial number of people from all interested in fate nice being found out and from something that was an accidental discovery well from us and it seemed became something of an obsession the chase was on\nThis reminder you're listening to trending on the b._b._c. World Service and another reminder we have a podcast to download us take us wherever\nWe can next we're tracing the parallel stories of two people on the opposite sides in the world of fake news over in the U. S. it's Christopher Blair he's been described as one of the most prolific writers effect in Belgium Martin shank fact checker who's made it his job to expose the fakes\nTo tempt fate nice hit the mainstream in a very political way which is something of a problem because now it's used as a weapon to bash not just completely false things made up like the ...\nThe conspiracy theories misinformation spin mistakes opinion and even completely truthful reports that people just don't like\nSo needs to be very clear here we're taking the politics of it we're looking at the original meaning of fake news completely made up stuff the stories that Christopher Blair rights and that Martin shrink to bunks they have absolutely no basis in fact\nRight but despite those being false ... maybe because of being felt they had a huge appeal they get people to click\nNow we had any uh how ... was making a substantial amount of money for life and fake news so much so that he was able to give up his day job and do it for a living that's one side of fake news that we know is lucrative\nFor what I Want to find out if it was the same for the trees hunted it's just not check his make the same kind of money\nSo about a half of my income right now comes from running through the lives of these stories have\nLess say are you able to handle those in\nEuros books I guess the symbol of that comes from a the advertising that I make only stories\nNeed stories in fact checking website that mouse and co founded it's essentially a blog and he makes money the same way fate and you try to make it by advertising\n[noise]\nNow my anyway I mentioned ... space that page and the patron of that has Henry tensions stresses Kenny from South puff yeah\nWell here's the bat but that becomes rather than there were two justifications Krista ... says to defend his writing especially he says oh here's my thing is satirical\nWe've run out of our way if you've ever she ... she refers to market of satire to make sure that everybody knows this was a real\nWhen I ask you if you've been to my Facebook page have you seen the profile picture show recording dressed as kind of McCormack because we're so often\nSo what he means by that is and it should be obvious today to visit the page that it's not serious and he writes stories all the time about Hillary Clinton dying even though she's very much alive\nAnd to be said for him if you look at his Facebook page monsters help does it just became of that says what he had to provide you with information you can use to continue being informed as a conservative feel comfortable with please don't\nWe've ... nice it will only says ... says that\nThere are still going to be people it doesn't matter how much you're you're much you scream how many times you put satire on your page there are still going to believe in the store going to share my Facebook page has entertainment website it does not say news media on it anywhere and it never has\nAnd the other case and ... his face the pages and Web sites\nBut any so I think we should note here that most people won't make it to Christopher ... Facebook page they won't make it to any of his website to see any of these disclaimer as many won't even click a link if they see it on their own Facebook feed\nWhat they'll do is they'll just share the headline and from this perspective histories don't look any different from any other fake stories that are out there\nAnd he is the second like CrossFit that justifies writing an offense that fake news he says he's actually true Democrats and liberal ... played\nOn what's known as a liberal for all\nMy purpose online is to expose the modern American conservative\nHe says he's doing is associate infiltration of right wing ... snake conservatives looks cheated okay you better explain that I Know it sounds weird but he's very open about the fact that he writes isn't true precisely because Chris just said this demonstrates that people have taken Sherrod\nWho are by and large are right wing Republican Trump supporters\nYep sit plus says this demonstrates that thing up Steve head or evil or militias\n[noise]\nSo any say in the timeline of the story of fake news we've got to about two years ago right Christopher Blair's making money writing fake stuff Martin shank is making considerably less money debunking it but after the U.S election is suddenly a huge outpouring of attention on so called fake news\nAnd it's not long before the business model of fake news comes crashing down\nOh I

stalking each other and slipping messages on line for so long question marks and finally talk with a little help from us\nI don't I'm not contending with Martin I'm contending with any of them I Hope

I'm One of its dog Jane Fonda you've heard just they're planning to follow up for the me too era Hollywood needs no reminding of goes to the allegations faced by film producer Harvey Weinstein\nAllegations he denies the BBC's market economy has been discussing these issues with Jane Fonda she began by asking how she first got the idea for the film nine to five which also stars Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton\nOne of my friends was an organizer of women office workers she would tell me stories about the kinds of things that they were facing is that they had to put up with and finally one day I said I Want to make a movie about this and then was my idea to cast ...\nHow much convincing did they take to take a year\nTo convince ... to be in a movie which is pretty amazing given that nobody ever had Dolly at a movie before\nLooking back on the film do you think it stood the test of time absolutely\nThe issue with me too movement which began just about a year ago is very much front and center and of course nine to five very much dealt with the issues of\nSexual abuse but not just that also the fact that uh the character played by Lily Tomlin would train young men and they would be promoted past her\nAnd the salary differential those dealt with plenty of material and when it comes to making a seat for which you and looking into it yeah well it's different now in a way it's worse the sexual harassment still exist\nThe men being promoted past women still exists but now many of the workers will be\nSubcontracted which means that where do they go when their wages stolen by their boss where did they go with their fired because they're pregnant 'til we need a new movie whether the script will turn out I don't know I hate to get my hopes up too much\nAnd when in the wake of Harvey Weinstein the allegations that came I found him did that's present personal dynasty you about whether to speak household knows\nNo I've never had too many difficulties speaking out\nWhat was important for me me too was the survivor's coming forward and telling their stories and being believed\nThe time's up movement is now what are we going to do about it like having more women on boards of directors having women and more positions of power but right at the beginning of time's up we in Hollywood received a\nA wonderful letter from seven hundred thousand women farm workers you know it was really dear sisters we understand what you were talking about and rising up about we deal with it every day in the fields\nAnd it was a transformative moment and a lot of us realize that if the time's up movement is going to be successful in the long run we have to stand shoulder to shoulder with our sisters that are less visible if it's even harder for them to speak up because they will definitely lose their jobs\nI had read that do you yourself have known some of the allegations about Harvey Weinstein trio offenders enter a cat but haven't spoken as well no you can't it's the survivor that has to speak because this was\nIt became public that Roseanne I told me her experience and the experience of other women as well and but she was too scared to come forward but she knew that had had affected her career that she had rebuffed him but I I couldn't\nSpeak ... think fits the whole controversy around ... ... and his appointment as a Supreme Court justice do you think that can be seen in the context of the me too movement in the sense that Christine Blasey Ford herself was willing to come forward and speak about it\nWell Anita Hill came forward and spoke about it before there was a ... movement in fact African American women have been coming forward and speaking\nAbout this long before white famous white women in Hollywood had been doing so but I I think the behavior of the old white men on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd how they were too scared to question her blessing for directly for fear of hearings away Joe Biden and others who questioned during the Clarence Thomas hearings so they hired a woman lawyer to do it you know that's a cop out right cowards\nThat is because of me too they knew they had to be a very very careful\nAnd so they were careful for a while and then of course Trump insulted her and been lives on her and then people followed suit and what ensued after her when Kavanaugh himself testified was just a horrific

is of course limited to two of us could take the problem is that the Central American in southern American region is is a suffered decades she was the Cold War the instability\nOr which was partly um

Ashraf are our guests ear on weekend\nLet's focus on this now because each day the political divide in America gets white or it's a fairly well worn phrase that now politicians pouring scorn on each other\nAnd the president repeating his dislike for the media not everyone would have thought the atmosphere would become so tense and so aggressive that it would inspire apostle bombing campaign\nThe suspect accused of sending fourteen devices to predominantly vocal critics of Donald Trump has now been arrested registered Republican an audience Trump supporter fifty six year old says a sale ... now faces five charges including mailing explosives and threatening ex presidents\nAnd that I think is the part that is being threatened by the rise of a populist politician like Donald Trump\nHung on democracy only a good thing when people voted in a way that you'd approval\nNo I think it's a good thing pointed is constrained by checks and balances and buy a rule of law\nYou know people can make last of choices but their choices to not a include for example the depriving of minorities or you know unlike individuals' of their equal rights than a liberal society so that's really I think the issue in front of us\nWere linked to see between demanding dignity and identity politics\nWell I think that the basis of modern identity politics is this feeling that we all have that we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized and that's where we go into politics because we want political recognition that uh\nThat we are the group that we belong to the religion of the nation the gender ethnicity than race that people with those characteristics be recognized as equal and I think that propelled a lot of politics in the world over the last couple of hundred years\nYou recently got a voice mail from a supporter of Donald Trump didn't you\nKnow so did she was very angry at what I had written because I said the American constitution does not define who we the people are\nAh she said yes it does it says that it's the people that fought in the American revolution and their descendants and people that came later a including you are really trying to take that constitution in that country away from us I suspect that she doesn't literally mean\nThe descendants of people that fought in the American revolution I suspect that something like you know we white Europeans are the real owners of this country and people that aren't that way are somehow you're not part of the national community and by the way she told me I should go back to Japan which I you know what I\nWas born in Chicago so it's not it's as if this is really an option for me\nNow that will be people all over the world and not just support as a populist leaders like victim oil dining Hungary who you mentioned in your book I'm like the alternatives to Germany movement that you also mentioned that will be loads of people who who who listen to you and think\nWhat Californians view you know what an liberal Californian view your day mate\nHas passed you know the days when liberal elites democracies rude and go to all the money you know it's all of a tough how'd you react to that\nYou know I I think one of the biggest issues is the fact that we actually live and de facto multi cultural societies and if one of those groups you know says that basically where the gonna we're gonna be the dominant ones you're just setting up a situation of of perpetual conflict\nSo I think that there's actually a good reason to have a liberal order meaning liberal in the sense of\nBeing open to people uh you know that are different nationalities cultures of religions and integrating them into a common framework by which they can make democratic decisions\nUh collectively ... and that's really what's at stake and what's being threatened I think by these people that are you say here you know not tell for him that that are rooted in one particular place or one particular ethnic group\nIs a clear majority of people in the approaching midterm elections in November in in the U.S vote for Donald Trump or rather vote for the Republicans\nSurely that democracy is black and Latino people in large numbers cast a vote for the Republicans if gay people vote for the Republicans that is democracy in action isn't it\nIt is from Chrissy an action or and I go I think that what it's going to threaten is not democracy per se is going to threaten liberal democracy\nOr because I think that Donald Trump has been trying to avoid accountability by basically attacking any institution that gets in his way and at the moment that's\nRobert Mueller and his investigation over the connection to Russia it's the FBI it's um [noise] the Justice Department and\nI think that if she gets a a perceived mandate as a result of the way that people vote he's going to you know go after all of those in a way that he's a little bit frightened to right now and I think that's not good for American institutions because the institutions really\nAre built around the separation of judicial power and the independence of courts him dependence prosecutors\nFrancis Fukuyama and the title of the book is identity they demand for dignity and the politics of resentment what's your take on identity politics suit black\nYes it's really interesting isn't it because it's the talk of bites democracy and I think it's in some ways a merchandise democracy it's about saying we're not comfortable with the extremes but what we've got in the middle ground it doesn't feel as if we've got anything stable to stand on\nSo I I think that balance between wanting to be able to have the freedom but also wanting to be able to ensure that we've got a quality I are always going to be tensions that that worked together and work against each other and the same in the same set a sentence\nSo identity politics ... is really saw shifting sons in terms of where we place ourselves within that spectrum and everything that has a spectrum becomes really interesting when you look at either ends at as extreme and people gravitate towards the middle where we find\nUnhappiness with it and that for won't say effectively how the freedom to go back to the extremes which then become uncomfortable then we moved to the middle\nIn motion effectively in politics is really interesting\nDo you have political beliefs F cell based on your identity\nI'm not sure I Do a show up my identity is a multi faceted and so my political beliefs but I think this issue Shia is is really I'm very profound and I think a front is so ... started the debate which I Hope will be grab like people will likely\nOne of the assumptions as being that I'm the end of history that doesn't western liberal democracy is the way food we are not going to do it if you saw the ... it's not going to go away\nWe'll that even though he's so new ... indeed and history history tells us anything everything has a sell by date and if it is if we do think it's the best system that we need to understand it in ... and ... and change it into management fashion\nThe tension that sue spoke about essentially the tension between the value system of liberalism and the democracy there which says a holding every people decide what they want now the value system a it is powerful the system\nFor which the ordinary people are often divorced ordinary people the people that suffer economic deprivation most that a few disenfranchised from the legal system and the ... and it is these these people that a hundred by extremists politicians who are anti democratic and in the longer term\nSo we do have a big issue here which does need to be addressed and thought about but much more widely than academics it needs to be understood by societies if they are to preserve and cross but in a democratic system otherwise\nIt's very fragile one problem assume we're wrapping up the program here I'm afraid is that a liberal democracy isn't the ban of which is fine as lots of beef up\nYou know there isn't the passion surrounding the neurons of liberal democracy is up or you know there is um and I think that's part of the problem the fire comes in the extremes and the damn pens as they go towards the middle ground which is actually viewed as being safer ground\nAnd that's the ground you stand on ... [laughter] they regard as a hostile Ashraf ... black have\nBeen a guest on this edition of weekend many thanks to them to come back again soon and thanks to you for listening we all we can we live from London misses the b._b._c.

treaty\nIt's very clear that the United states and uh I live in a way to think that there have been serious violations of the treaty by Russia but equally the Russians think that aspect of the United states of nature posture in Europe and the deployment of missiles in Europe\nHas in effect undermined the treaty of other ways so there's a balance of accusation if you like but I think this is much more about rules and with uh the world should worry whenever a rule is dismantled more than anything else\nChinese intermediate range missile development is arguably the biggest threat for the U.S

United states wants to be strong position to confront China and it feels that way the limited treaty the IMF treaty dealing hardly bilaterally with Russia that it is constrained\nOh we do think less
