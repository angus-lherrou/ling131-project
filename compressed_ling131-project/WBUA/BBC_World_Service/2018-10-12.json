climate change came out with its latest report I won't be hearing from one of the office and they move in\nEssentially the report said we can't go on like that and if we do that danger the stabilize the F fly that cities cars and buses and everything else around me is going to need to be powered by renewable\nBut is that possible what's that going to do to the economy and can we have the kind of flows we've got used to say oh well we have to get used to something else\nMaybe something less dynamic him what does that mean the politics cannot lead is way down to make the sacrifice that well there is a pretty tough questions that are going to get back to the theater now nice have had all\nThe panel is Laura Diaz ... professor of climate change policy at Cambridge University\n... he's the policy director at the Grantham instituted climate change at the London School of economics Julius Steinbeck I he's an associate professor of an ecological economics at Leeds University I'm Molly Scott K. to an end of the European Parliament\nFor the u._k. green policy thank you all for joining us before we begin I Want to introduce one more pests than and nuts Yuri ... he's one of the office of this week's I PCC reports and he's with me here in the studio\nYou read the report cool for the well to aim to keep the rise in global temperatures to one point five degrees Celsius but that's going to come at a price\nHe's the world's on track to meet anything like that target festival\nTo clarify the report doesn't call for anything the report on it was a question that the government has asked do you see\nIn two thousand Fifteen in the Paris Agreement on it was clear duck two degrees of global warming was not a safe level\nAnd governments wanted to know what the difference between one point five and two degrees and how it was possible to limit warm into one point five and now just report clearly shows that there is an important difference between warming if one point five and two degree and also shows demeaning\nCan be limited to that level\nAnd say just to be clear is the well I'm trying to do anything like that\nThere to report is also very clear to rural is knock on track currently the pledges of the countries that they have submitted under the Paris Agreement lead lead to increasing emissions overtime and two twenty thirty whereas a mission should be decreasing very very steeply or by twenty thirty\nPainted the picture wall saw the consequences if temperatures rising above and beyond one point five degrees\nSo between one point five and two degrees for a few critical systems of Europe it is really important for\nExample for coral reefs are two degrees of warming we don't see any scientific evidence that they will ever survive\nAt one point five degrees of warming it is still possible that some of them survive also for for the rest of your ecosystems there is a redo your shift in the impact\nOn forests and other systems and finally also for humans the difference between one point five and to a degree of warming is about more than four hundred million people that are more affected by heat waves\nNo everybody but clearly people do I think I think they wouldn't if they knew the consequences if they knew the real cost of it that they're actually putting things and you know\nFive flying is one of the most environmentally damaging to phase one can possibly have in terms of damaging the climate and if people saw that saw the direct consequences between their action and real pain suffering harm but isn't that how do you\nShow that people especially at the so far we've just talked about rich countries where people live very comfortable live how do you prove to them that there are real consequences of their actions because they don't necessarily see them\nI think those consequences are becoming extremely visible uh Simon on American by nationality\nRight now hurricane Michael is I'm currently pounding on on Florida and causing a lot of damage last year Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico and you know these things are not in a speculative future they're happening right now a\nBillboard so it's important to people on the ... the talking and climate change does not mean we have to have a reduction in living standards in her life has deprivation let me give you an example an aviation it's now offer much quicker\nA more convenient to travel by train between London and Paris than it is to fly because you don't have all the hanging around at the airport\nWhich are all from outside the city centers so ... and a lot of cases will be able to replace short term slides\nWith other alternatives I think this is the important thing we need we have the opportunity here to restructure our economies\nSo that people have medical legal aren't they don't spend as much time sitting in congestion worrying about pollution we can design a world that is both lowering emissions and one in which people living standards Ohio\nLords he is just to think about who if we bring about these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in the sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing from\nFrom switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy is something that maybe in two thousand five to ten some people were saying that these ... these days we know that there are some costs however\nShort term clause doesn't equate long term\nCleveland policy I'll give you some examples we know that the increasing it next to see the price of things that you can't another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people for a larger share of their income is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no\nLosers what we can say is that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be put in place to compensate\nFor these short term law office but who's going to pay for that as well so uh you know government programs is the role of garments to think about the distribution of impacts of different policies\nI Will give you the other example we also know that the fossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training we've uh emergence of these other high technology sectors\nThat we're seeing in maybe the case that in the long term there will be better\nOff so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to meet to get the short term\n... cases I can just bring you back for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise and the two degree Celsius rise\nDC isn't elements of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rise when I look\nTo sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started in the terms of ... we're seeing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition the we have been able to use the Paris Agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable finance area\n... pension products have to be aligned with at one point five parents to get for example I can see that and I and the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and they imagine a world that is climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not\nYou know it was just want to us too is that when asking the question who is going to pay to for this one really should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on the business as usual trajectory one does\nThis reading an investment in a safer and sustainable growth and when asking the question was going to pay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already recount observing today\nThey're projected to increase significantly already rich one point five degree of warming\nAnd withdrew degree of forming this is not in the far future this is um one point five current levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees yet again about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who's going to pay for ducked\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefree managed and they have to be carefully managing managed so that the ... the poor of the impacts of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare\nLaurie wants to come back and\nYeah and I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have Ninety nine countries we win evil feeding tired Seventy three countries with auctions fifty eight countries that are that have other places to see that when you both and thanks to all of these work over the past three\nYears or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly so he's making it easier\nReason to label called them prize for instance the greed\nNo but do is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to realize and there's been um scholars\nAnd partly because high and working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing that renewable energy technologies which has traditionally being\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications on countries indication they're beginning to be competitive\nSo it's these investments ... it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have been doing is not enough as they say the reports he's reminding us okay um but I Do think this points out he's made all their report about making sure that the most vulnerable\nOr not it's not just necessary\nFor ethical reasons but he's also necessary for political reasons because only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYeah so when we talk about coffee is important that we remember the global economy is not stopping and there are three big trends are going to happen\nRegardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty cents even down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two\nThousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double ninth street shortly and we'll be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we make the transitional no we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at a ... rates of\nAbout three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next forty years they all trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of\nWhether we continue with our current growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nFor we design all cities more effectively says that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing a to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that so I Want to wrap up this how fast and now

problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nLet's hear from Myron evil he works for think tank called the Competitive Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he may have Monday's IPC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects\nOn the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is in slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is\nAnd I believe that they're claiming it's it's been him in a crisis because that's their charge from the United nations as well but I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to serve the say can you imagine anything that decided to say that would persuade the administration but it needs to take this last there's\n... no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are are pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea Steinbeck and with us effective leadership isn't this the last\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and the abuses science to argue for the fact they use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have the view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nBillboard what's to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line and South Korea last week and they have not discern that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how ... how do you decide your date and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I wanted to say\nI I'm importantly when President Trump gives you the reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states the ... the United states is in long term decline because it's simply cheap to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the points the facts are becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having here\nIt is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with\n... left behind communities including coal mining industries and we need to talk of the so called just transition giving people other jobs he's\nPart of coming up the solution here but the uh the other thing is I I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is big up because of sea level rise and as a good chance that the warmer than average Waltons and the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people will say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S having gone we this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut my sixty percent by fifty percent some programs fight to the ... the route investments\nThat three thousand a million dollars a year mark\nSpending you know carbon energy technologies but Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are actually something that brings bipartisan support\nWe've talked ... about the first world the very developed well let's see if we may\n... to ... the world that a growing I won't speak to treat the group that he's a professor\nOf environment and developing in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joins us today from Cairo's streets I won't talk about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing fast but also a country that has taken\nIts climate change commitments fairly seriously just described with some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda that's much more to talk about\nRenewables but at the same time they just give you a small example in the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not linked fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that happening studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have a huge savings in health\nAnd so uh that it's a good reason for taking action on a fossil fuel and doesn't this\nCome back to the politics because in the cost Indian governments have argued that a country that's growing is simply not policy of it wasn't part of the industrialization process that if you like caused the problems of climate change\nAnd therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beat in Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five at that time the developing countries were arguing the knock must take action fist\nNot it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it it's no longer a Bible argument to save that going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world have to quickly try to figure out ways to bypass\nThe mistakes of the north and you'll be talking about the fact that we could perhaps ...\nTried to convince off ancient funds to stop investing in fossil fuels but the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those muscles\nOr the investments to the south and that's not a very good idea to shifting the problem is that right and so I don't think developing countries should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels they should try to bite off that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think\nFor a country like India that demographic that this is more difficult or easier to push through as an idea\nOf a democracy is a force is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to this is ... ... relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand\nI think that there's a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd I think that if he can get social movements going in India because ultimately it's the farmers in India that going to suffer our water comes from a snow fed mountains and that's really going to lead to major challenges the mountains stock to melt the snow starts to them as in the mountains\nAnd so as a consequence if you just try to look at\nThe agricultural sector in India the postal sect in India\nThey were really suffer and there's a reason to dig dead views into account\nAnd try to read visit our energy storyline\nJulie assigned book uh so the big reasons for India to make changes similarly big reasons to China to make changes do you think China may ultimately find it easier to make those changes because it's not democratic\nChina's been going for a sort of both and strategy of growing all energy time said once but I think\nAny kind of well run country any kind of country that has a government that cares about his population will in fact be pushed by that population of fat population as well informed enough about the risks that are

correspondence Laura ... to the interview\nWell when it comes to had knowledge of war president moon is the son of North Korean refugees so when it first questions I asked him was was this more personal and political for him\nAnd he said that he does understand the pain of war the separation of war I you know as I said his parents like North Korea Nineteen fifty three they never sell their family again and he said one of the reasons why he wants to be president of South Korea was to help prevent war returning to the peninsula\nAnd for those who listen to little Advil knew that the the fighting here on the Korean Peninsula ended in Nineteen fifty three with an armistice never\nA peace treaty and now both north and South Korea would like to see some kind of end of war declaration and so that they can work towards the peace treaty but to do that they need to not the United states and the U.S is unwilling to do so until North Korea makes real concrete steps to disarm and give away the nuclear weapons\nThat came out in the middle here to try to mediate between us and North Korea has been at president Moon Jae in\nAnd he has had three summit with Kim Jong un this year and he says that Kim Jong un is committed to complete denuclearization\nAnd that he understands that that means dismantling his current nuclear arsenal box president made admitted that he hadn't talked about how

states approach current United States' approach will maximum pressure they've been finding out for that but in the past they have looked to kind of more carrot and stick approach is so incentives to North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons\nAnd he may be looking for president main certainly has it seems to be traveling to Europe with the hope\nThat European leaders can help him mediate between the United states and North Korea to find the allies in his path towards peace and I think that's one of the reasons and that he's heading to Europe and the next week\nAnd how is he being judged so far by the people of South Korea\nThe overwhelming factor has been his relationship with North Korea and has a developing of peace remember he came to power last year\nAnd just as the war of words between Donald Trump and Kim Jong anywhere at their worst I mean this time last year and North Korea had psychiatric ... nuclear test on ... threatened\nTo resign fire and fury in Pyongyang and many fear the Korean Peninsula was once again on the brink of war so he has been seen as somebody who has been pushing for peace and his poll numbers do go off after any summit with Kim Jong un\nNo more they have actually taken that one site and said we'll have to wait till the market settle down a little bit ... thank you\nUse it from the BBC olive 'cause you can come to shop ... wrote questions are being asked about how an American Ron Charles you sit up to provide an education for girls ended up being a place where a number of them was sexually abused as that\nYeah the more than me educational chatty was founded by an American women ... who raised millions of dollars and it was even gone to a building or by the then president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf my Twinkie fourteen however a number of guns had come forward and edging they had been raped by the organizations main coordinated Macintosh jumps and\nHe went to prison or later died of aids but the fact that the charity will still able to operate ... despite the scandal on good people in Liberia now one month to cover the story you know your long investigation on Tuesday was really\nYoung he's behind the film an optical release just today but pro public er and tied magazine\nSo the organization was funded by an American who came to to Liberia and wanted to help the most vulnerable girls in a community called west by when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier was welcome\nI wanted that raising money internationally and he was the one who was on the ground selecting girls often managing scholarship program but sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed many of the organization students according to their statements police\nHad been raped by the co founder how old are these children so the girls told authorities that they were as young as ten when the ... began\nAntenna girls reported their stories to the police and the end but many other names are given to staff at the time as many as thirty according to an internal charge to talk\nOf you know how many girls will actually reduce the number\nTen girls testified in court against Macintosh on one of the interesting things about it is not there was never a negative repercussions there was never an acceptance by the organization that they may have played a role in the crimes that are the Macintosh Johnson was able to commit against girls that were in care\nSo when the rates came to light\nThe organization essentially said that this was a community issue according to our investigation to minimize the role of the man who had been a central mountain dark and isolation had an intimate relationship could find or they didn't acknowledge the extent to which they hadn't power to him and then they simply said well this is a Liberian cultural problem and there was never an acceptance of the fact that perhaps the organizations own operating\nCultures in a challenging context may have contributed\nTo his ability to access interviews young girl demand ended up in prison and went through a trial but the trial ended in Judea and what our investigation reveals is that when he died he had aids\nSo it's possible that the girls would be raped will actually affected as well\nThe challenge with the story is about ... Penn girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also has victims so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named dozens victim spots indicted tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so it's a very sadly there's that there's a strong public health issue within the story which the organization really failed to confront and a meaningful way\nSo what's happening now it seems like it's just business as usual as the school continued to operate you know if there'll be any changes a tool to make it harder for the vulnerable girls to be taken advantage of\nI think that after this took place that's certainly true that the organization sought to to strengthen its policies and sought to prove it's hiring practices and implemented the whistle blower policy because one thing I didn't mention is that actually that was five months elapsed between the first staff member learning that Johnson had raped\nOne of the girls and actually the rates being reported in which time\nTwo girls were the first time according to their statements to the police so definitely the organization type the policies but almost immediately after the ... came to light the organization ended up with the rising international prominence in the six months afterwards because of course the Ebola outbreak in Liberia at that time subsequently ... who's the head of the organization was named attain person with a year\nWithin six months if these rapes and her organization coming to like [noise]\nAnd that was

trust in traditional media immune response to the New York times story ... is a sign of a mood deep rooted Monday's\nBasically since the rates crisis you've seen trust in the meantime ... in the most important institutions that got the comedy you've seen trust collapse\nTheir various reasons for that cleanly the single most important one is the sense that the crisis was brought on us by the political and financial establishments and that the way in which was resolved was unfair many people left behind in those responsible was\nPunished as quickly so you have that's basic sense that everybody's\nIn it for themselves anyway a sort of numbing belief that\nNobody is behaving well anyway [noise] and then very specifically and perhaps why this particular story consenting Donald Trump has had a little impact as he has there is a loss of trust in Egypt and an unprepared and us to believe actual empirical\nFacts a loss of that's possibly does come from\nBut there is a sense now that there is no particular reason to believe the established me general ... stood in some ways it's almost paternalistic to think that somebody like the New York times during the huge investigation is more to be trusted than anybody else that's I think he's a big sperm\nYou experience that the time didn't you when the ... brothers collapsed essentially that was a light bulb moment for you and that's something you've written about in your swan song for the as the\n... yes I had this extraordinary experience while I was in New York covering the crisis those two blocks away from the ... it was a very exciting time by coincidence I happened to have a\nLot of money just landed in my city pregnant 'cause I just sold in apartments in London I went to the bank to try to move money around to make sure that I didn't have money left in ... deposits\nAnd once I discovered was that many people from the wall Street's officers around me were doing the same thing that they were moving money around accounts to make sure that they have this much money as possible\nProtected by the governments and Deposit Insurance and the place was full of people and smart suits trying to a shovel and money around to protect states\nNow that's looked like a bank run technically it wasn't they weren't actually taking their money out to them but it looks like a bank run and if we hit strides publicizing this it would've been a very scary moments at the time all I was thinking was\nIf we publicize an image like this than we are going to get in trouble because this is going to look in responsible it's great to look for say where infighting panic\nBanker on basically inciting a bank run\nYes exactly which is one of the things you've got to be very careful in the financial ... any bank even if it's very well run can you get into trouble if there's a lot of confidence in that you've got to be really really short of what you're doing before you say that there's a bank run\nSo does it mean to you didn't report it at the time\nI Do not report that the time it didn't particularly the recipients needs to say\nI'm ten years on because we have the anniversary of the crisis I thought it would be an interesting I'm excited to talk about an ... by the ... level of invective and the anger vis erodes the opinion against the ... you know at least\nFor one five to one against very powerful sense that the mainstream media can't be trusted if they're not going to tell us the whole truth\nSo people sort of you with holding crucial information that they should have had access to if you've seen in that ride a responsible report\nYes precisely so the idea of the traditional media sources like the F T where I was at the time of the New York times acting as a responsible still set of being your reliable source that you can go to for information is as if they ... at this point I think if this were to happen again ten years on\nIowa somebody else would have seen what was going on taken effect so and it would have been out there on social media ... now regarded as ... as a base line of\nAcceptable behavior since not just the two thousand eight financial crisis is also social media that has created this lack of trust and\nThere was a loss of belief in the financial establishment combines with a lawsuit belief in conventional media these days information gathering is tribal people read the information they're interested in there to read from so we'll see if they don't care about\nAnd when you put the two together what you find is that if a\nGreat and wonderful traditional news source does a great piece of investigative reporting it can still cheerfully be dismissed because there is a sense that everything's through the financial world is corrupt anyway and you don't need to trust traditional means you have to tell you things are\nKind of makes you wonder what would it take to budge someone's opinion on President Trump I mean is something as big as a serious allegation in a big global Iraqi needs to have a lot of New York times saying a sitting president is effectively\nA tax cheats not the implication of newspaper whatever denials era\nIf that makes no impact would\nI find it very hard to imagine there's I mean he made the famous comments about shooting somebody and Fifth Avenue and people would still vote for him he was kind of right now yes\nIt's hard to see what it's which change opinion at this moment and given that opinion is so polarized and people derive their information\nFrom particular associates I remember I sense out of tweets Donald Trump is delighted to tell everybody how wonderfully stock market performances so since that street simply comparing how he had done compared to Andre bomber and pension and it's a done

sorry\nBasic straightforward factual information about how much stock markets as recently as an will still be treated us like you got that from somebody liberal\nBecause there is so much talk about a post factual wills but it was so suggestive of a sort of near lesson\nYes it's very difficult to talk about this in ways that are very very mixed it there is a lack of trust trust is very difficult to five seats functions very difficult for finance for first\nAnd there is a lack of preparedness to believe anything that you don't already believe also trust others to work in all of U.S interests it's very dangerous\nJohn ... of Bloomberg of course the real test for President Trump will come in November when the U.S holds midterm elections but wow there'd be no in Egypt political repercussions since the New York times published its allegations against him earlier this month\nThe New York state tax department has considered it is looking into the claims and New York city officials have said they've joined the investigation to tip the ... is a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush the\nBig issue is this is a state and local level investigation and the president has no power to pardon at state and local level it's the New York state attorney general and the Manhattan prosecutor her going after the Trump entities in New York\nAnd at that level he cannot do anything so if he really is facing a serious investigation there he's going to need cash\nAnd so that's why I think there's a very good chance that he won't run again because what he really needs and wants to do is to launch what they're calling T. N. N. which is the Trump produced network to take on C. N. N. and I wonder you know it's just why he's meeting with Kanye and you can see him beginning how to set the stage or\nAnd he's going to say look I Won the prize I did everything that I needed to do feed that done that in there done that and\nI mean I have a much bigger more huge platform as he says which I think he'll be right about because actually having that kind of a media platform will be more powerful than the White House where he has genuine constraints\nBut if he's doing his own news network and that's what's in the pipeline for him I mean if Fox News is on his side he's going\nTo have it you know he'll do everything from reality t._v. too political talk shows and it will be outrageous as you can imagine but I think the key thing is the world of journalism is paying so much attention to the Mueller investigation which is actually yielded relatively little\nOr no attention to the state and local investigations which are much more serious threats New York state penitentiary is not a joke I mean is it or not white collar prisons so that threat is a very real thing\nAnd as you say these are state investigation wreck he has no say over state if it was a federal investigation and he's a ... is a federal investigation less so in a way he needs to worry less about that and worry more about\nThe tax investigate oh I think ... that is right and I think it's also very interesting one of the things that Brett Kavanaugh has specialized in was the fact that the president can pardon\nAlmost anything at the federal level and now he's on the Supreme Court okay so now we know this is the situation but state\nIs a whole different thing to the ... the from news network I stick with a dependable BBC but then I Would say that from me and today's produce Lawrence nice business dating back again at the same time among the\n\nThis is NPR News we're funded by you our listeners Oxfam fighting for a future where one hundred percent of\nHumanity has the same basic rights to end the injustice of poverty does it Oxfam America dot org slash one hundred and artists for humanity's greatest party on earth tomorrow celebrating creative teams at the expanded epicenters grand opening tickets that greatest party on earth dot com\nFrom Boston University or listening to the point nine WVU are FM Boston home of Boston's largest radio news rum Ninety two point seven WB wages were eight eighty nine point one WB wage Brewster and streaming W.
