I Know we sold out of the Bible\nI Know I Know but you know what they have nothing right now like it's very difficult for artists to go there and tour 'cause it's not worth it like in the economy side economy side but also people are afraid to go out during the night you know to concerts and so they try to make countries like early during the day\nSo they don't have to be exposed to like you know at eleven\nPM leaving the theater so yeah for me was also surprised that it was sold out even though it was during the night but yeah they're they're they're just like a craving for talent and for people to go and sing for them\nAnd when you are an all just from a country produce highlights you at the moment full sadly all the wrong reasons uh-huh do you feel the sense of pressure to perform to writes about it to sing about it took to put some sort of message out there about the situation back home\nOf color pressure at all I think it's something that we actually comes naturally that we want to talk about it that uh as I said because my family's there I'm not I'm really far from the token I say that yeah from the situation because I talked to them everyday and they're living at you know\nSo I think it's something that has happened naturally for us to talk about it or to express how we feel and it's more about missing\nMy family missing the beautiful beaches we have they're missing the fact that like if I Want to bring people to go on and see where I'm from they they don't want to go because we're what they see the news and uh\nIt's not too pretty [laughter]\nUm so but yeah I I'm hopeful you know like I think things are going to get better because they have to and\nAnd one last time people are working you know he was young people young people with a smile on their face your very happy to be there and working for a better better Venezuela and that was very touching for me\nThan the good times would smuggle redrawn large\nHigh you had if you really have to visit it's not because I'm from their release you all go to admit that yeah I Know a a really beautiful I think it's perfect weather we have actually it's maybe Ninety degrees the whole year\nI Know it may sound bad for you is actually very uh it's amazing because we have to win the uh the food each grade people are happy all the time Everytime I showed pictures to people there like what the hell are you doing\nHere [laughter] take me demagoguery drawn a letter is growing in London for the first time of the E F G London jazz festival the twenty fifth of November just some photo brief words from you both but it's an interesting insight into into somebody performing abroad because she has to be ruled by law reflections on family she was missing was going to go back home\nYeah ... ... what are the ones that are called Marta attention when you're talking to her when you started to touch on the developing political situation it was the coded language yeah I remembered that from the years of military dictatorship in Brazil\nYou was a coded language there are things that you wanted to pass it but you couldn't actually say here because you were a fresh you're worried about what would happen to family exactly yeah she's got family there so she was word\nYeah yeah I I think it's interesting that she said people to start for culture is of course a might cut I got used to be ... and ... only allies see any I mean I actually have a friend living there and um I Can't understand that the concert was sold out a\nVery aggressive and both of them to do well listen we're going to hear a bit more of her music [noise] and say thank you to both of you for joining us this morning let's trying\nTo get I\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] distribution of the b._b._c.

professor material science and electrical engineering at MIT lakes is where it really does move the field on\nThe term wearables if you just think about it was really developed to describe something we don't wear what we where we call clue\nAnd that really sets the stage for really what we've been focused on here which is really getting technology into the things you actually where into your clued into the fabrics and into the fiber themselves and that really is what that that's a part and and what makes this point in history so special\nSay are we moving beyond that will find strands of cup of a way for them to like a black T shirt that you just buy from the local store and then sold ... onto a piece of ... which I've done in ...\nYou know in order to deliver and make technology happen you need to have an insulator you need to have a conductor to get signal in and out of the most important material the most important class of materials that really enables all of the technology that we know of today is\nCalled the Seventy and until very recently literally a few weeks ago\nThere were no real reports on how to get semi conductors into fibers and into fabrics\nAnd without semi conductor is your phone\nIs not smart at all [laughter] and without semi conductors we don't have computers now without semi conductors we don't have displays and we don't have communication\n[noise] and so um what I wanted to focus on is the importance of getting semi conductors into fibers and fabric as an enabler of functionality and enabler of\nYou know I don't like to use the term smart or we could leave that to describe humans but certainly something which is highly functional and technological and the day\nThe revolution happened after all because we go good ah I'm growing components transistors and ... wife was acidic or how many do you say far as to say well now you all doing that in fabric\nAnd so the essence of the paper that just came out about a month ago in nature was to announce the emergence of a a Moore's law quibbling thin fibers\nAnd so we benefit over the past ... years from a Moore's law in the in the semi conductor industry uh we're by the basic functionality chipped grew exponentially overtime\nA you know every Eighteen months it it essentially doubled of what we're seeing now is that a similar processes is happening in fibers where the basic function\nOf the fiber is going to grow exponentially over time and we're going to come to expect\nA very high level function and functionality on the fiber level or would that in turn enables us to do is to think about a fabric now as a system where each ... each each fiber each yarn entails we're encompasses in it a multiple functions multiple", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC
