... isn't a great position to tell us wanting to mission wolf that looks like in real life\nAnd he turns out there were a few telltale signs in the case of dispense spreading video\nThis really really fits it'd almost perfect example of the pattern that\nYou see these Russian trolls or or the Russians on social media to take over and over and over again they're going to either create or take a piece of\nControversial material they're going to release it onto their state funded media social media platforms\nAnd then they're going to start talking about that piece of information and you'll see them\nJump onto like Youtube video and they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior accounts\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these times man's spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it and as we do provoked very strong feminist and anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats pornographic he mentioned that ...\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context of politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked\n\nThat would cut myself as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat's Dr molten ... he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly he's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the un yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of evil and good and balanced\nWhen Star Wars the last jet I came out last year some ... with the casting choices you seat never before has style will still have so many women in ethnically diverse ... think prominent roles and fish is gone some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at directing Ryan jumps and\nSome of them executed behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nThere were sixteen out of nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been around for at least you know a number of years and the Russian trolls have been served themselves in American discourse\nAll kinds of situations at the states you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit farfetched\nOn a daily basis regular Americans will go about their business and start carrying free weeks before the election\nAnd so if you want to get to those people you kind of have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's\nSomething else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer tactic that's the kind of idea just a generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet's stick to digest that it's not the divisions haven't always existed in society\n... example whatever people's thoughts would about the constant choices\nThat would always be some people who agree and some who disagree but if ... all rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives infiltrating the spaces and sending up the volume as you were\nIf those disagreements and of course a fractured society as a society that struggles to take action\nAs yours as anger leads to hate hate leads to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace as a very very easy way to start uprisings\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what ... does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media in the context of compensation is about the me too movement and so on\nThe continent is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments to video gets picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative\nIt's only down to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided if you are sympathetic to honest points you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repels\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that are rabid conservative writers just spinning out of control\nOn the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias then divvied year will only consent is in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of this senseless political correctness brigade inaction [noise]\nSo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program Ken we conclusively say that and as video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ease campaign against this information suggests\nIf you're looking for a smoking gun here then we don't have one but what we can say is that whatever the truth is this whole episode says when he fits into a broader pattern one very similar to people studying the way Russia drives it's the ...\nCampaigns but at the end of the day does that really matter does it matter to know whether or not and as video which raises a valid point I suppose is an active propaganda\nWell I'm going to let John Walsh the rushing troll hunter we spoke to earlier on um sometimes\nMy real in goal here is to get people to be a little more conscious about what they decide to share on line and get people to maybe understand the sharing this piece of what looks to be on verified information or this\nViral retreating is very viral tweet that confirms your political bias might not always be the greatest thing to just take like a couple of minutes and look at what\nYou're getting ready to do before you do it\nSo as we've said before think twice before you ... ...\n...

I Wonder whether you now know that it's the mother's voice that he's effective and not the fault it's not a male voice\nAgain is it's a it's a very good point and it was my research didn't pick up the evidence there no meat so just to make sure that we have a correct\nAnd so what we found in our study is a ah\nWe used a female voice we didn't use the mother's voice and I think there's more work to be done to see whether or not not always needs to be inside female and I suspect was it just needs to be a voice that will be my my suspicion there's been some work done in coal ah with colleagues in Australia around different types of voices to be\nSo it doesn't appear to necessarily need to be the mother always um plus which is a voice that that seems to be the thing that triggers the children to wake up\nWell given that to what extent do you think then they should change the way that we think about fire safety I mean should smoke alarms now have the human voice in with the noise of the

where there are young children what we certainly know is up smoke alarms without two boys don't does wake those children up so what we're\nNot advocating is that people shouldn't do smoke alarms it's exactly the the the other at a different message people should you smoke alarms but they need to be aware but conventional smoke alarms may simply not wake their children up so they are going to need to go and wake their children up themselves\nBut when you talk ... when you talk about what you are advocating what happens often a research paper like this do you then got an advice um our hospitals you know you go to schools you've got to talk to parents how does it work\nFor the work that we did hear it on the um absolutely we we began to a piece of work with um our local city council um adopt a initially was to raise\nThe awareness um around the fact that conventional smoke alarms one wake up children and so they worked with her to prepare documentation information about them went into all of their lives or two schools within their own deep I think there's a wider peace here though because I think that there's a a a challenge and to be thrown out to those who make smoke alarms and\nTo address that issue the issue is really serious and I and and\nThere's there's there's certainly not the underpinning research to show that we do need to use a different type of sound in order to have
