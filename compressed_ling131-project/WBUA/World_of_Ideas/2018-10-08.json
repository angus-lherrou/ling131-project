democracy in the west we begin with an introduction by Center for the study of Europe director Kathie Joe Martin\nI Am really thrilled today to get to introduce Sheri Berman 'em and cherry comes from us from um a bar in college at Columbia University ah sorry the ah someone that I have no desire for many years now so I'm really excited we can persuade her to kick off our um our term and what's\nOf a rite oriented populism in Europe um so Syria's gonna talk about um populism and the future of liberal democracy in the west\nAnd um her research interest include European history and politics the

dictatorship from the ... came to the present day as forthcoming from Oxford University press\nSo I'm not going to I'm a I think more about serious accolades are as many as there are it would take us all day but I think I'll just turn it over to the thank you so much again for mayor and thanks to all of them by the way for joining us really happens the but I'm\nWell thank you Cathy and thanks to all of you for hosting me here\nI'm going to talk about this incredibly um [noise] optimistic topic today um populism and the future of democracy in Europe and hopefully you won't all be crying by the\nEnd of the ah under the conversation so for anybody who reads the newspaper which I assume since you're all hear all of you do um you know that there's lots of talk today about democracy being in crisis right so there are a whole\nVariety of organizations out there whose job it is the kind of analyze what's going on with democracy to kind of tell us\nYou know what the trends in the world are and if you've been looking at any of these reports or reading the newspaper media coverage of them again you would get this idea that democracy was in prices right so Larry Diamond is probably one of the\nForemost experts of on the state of democracy in the world today has written the world is in the midst\nOf a democratic recession\nFreedom House again one of these organizations whose job it is a chart what's going on with different kinds of political regimes in the world entitled it's again it's twenty Eighteen report cover of which is right here obviously quite you know sort of evocative um democracy in crisis\nThe economist intelligence unit it's similar report um twenty Seventeen democracy index report is entitled democracy continues\nIts disturbing retreat despite the kind of apocalyptic visions that you know you sort of would hear from both the media and actually the sort of more sophisticated analyses and so it's not true that democracy is in crisis everywhere\nAnd now all of a sudden or seen these changing demographics and they're concerned about again the way um whether or not their dominant position in society will continue in the future right and this is of course layered on top of\nDramatic cultural shift that started in the Nineteen sixties right which sort of eroded traditional mores and traditional values leaving lots of people kind of very concerned about their societies right people who feel sort of\nAgain like the world is changing in ways that make them uncomfortable and were they're concerned that there are no longer going to\nBe you know sort of um [noise] uh in charge of uh the way things are going um okay\nI don't want to spend too much time on these things but again just to give you a brief\nSense of what folks are thinking again another type of explanation would combine these two right say okay look there's economic trends that have been going on their social trends that have been going on and in fact the best way to understand populism is my thinking about how these kind of two things in Iraq right and so he the argument would be something like look\nWe've had maybe backgrounds economic shifts and these have made people particularly again white folks much more concerned about their status and they turn around and they blame immigrants or minority groups for all of these problems when in fact you know there's other lots of broader things going on right so again economic\nSocial demographic trends this is kind of the way that I think most people have\nTalked about it again just to look at some of the evidence particularly for this question about social change there is definitely again some evidence you will see that people who voted for populist parties are more likely to blame 'em you know immigrants or minority groups for their country's problems [noise] um\nI actually want to suggest that this kind of focus which is again I think the dominant focus both in the academy and in the media is missing something really important if we want to understand populism over All right so what we need to remember right is that um\nDemocracy right is supposed to be responsive to its citizens right and so while it's definitely important if we want to understand populism and if we want to understand what's going on his liberal democracy to look at these broader\nSocial trends and economic trends we have to understand that ultimately right\nPeople believe that their parties and their politicians and their political institutions more generally are not responding to their needs and demands right when they're not listening to what people concerns are and when they're not helping them solve problems right so it's not\nIn other words mealy the fact of change economic change or social change that so politically significant it only because it's\nPolitically problematic if people believe again that their governments their parties and their politicians can't deal with that change that they're unable or unwilling to help again mitigate the effects of that change deal with the consequences of that change et cetera\n[noise] right so what I'd like to suggest is that if we want to understand populism we have to look not just at sort of these broader changes that have been going on in the economy and society but how or whether again political institutions have responded to them\nOkay so there are lots and lots of snow in fact that our political institutions or I'll talk about political institutions in Europe\nUm actually become much less responsive over the past generation much less able to ring citizens' concerns up into again government and it leads are being much less kind of responses to what citizens actually think\nAgain are the challenges facing them their communities and their societies were generally so the first thing to note is that there's been\nA very significant decay in political parties the strength of political parties in Europe right so here's just a little chart obviously talking about um party membership right so there's been\nA very significant decline in the number of people who actually belong to a political parties right the point of parties is to link\nSociety with the government right and some membership in a party was away again to send information back and forth for citizens to get involved in the political process\nFor it leads to transmit down to again society what kinds of things they were thinking about what kinds of policies they were considering and again for citizens to transmit up the feet the food chain so to speak to politicians into government what they were concerned about but we don't have\nVery strong membership parties in Europe the way we would have had a generation ago Allie ties to civil society organizations most often mentioned here are ties to unions but actually in Europe you had political parties with strong ties to other civil society organizations again as a way to bring citizens\nInto the political process and to transmit information and concerns back and forth\nUm declining ties to local level activists again parties would often cultivate people at the local level and bring them up through the parties they would spend their lives there sometimes for better or worse very much less the case today and leadership with many fewer ties to the grassroots overall\nSo Peter mayor who's perhaps the most or was he died recently the most influential students of\nPolitical parties um wrote a great book precisely on the decay of political parties in Europe some years ago and he wrote the age of party democracies pass for the parties themselves remain\nThey have become so disconnected from the wider society pursue a form of competition that is so lacking and meaning that they no longer seem capable of sustaining democracy right of time society to the government in some way that was truly meaningful\nOn the most um uh citizens of turned from being participants into spectators [noise] um\nThe most notable decay in the political party family of course has been the decline of the center left\nI'm much more significant those Klein of parties on the center right although both traditional again big parties on the left and big parties on the right of center right parties would be I'm often Christian Democratic party is in Europe both of these parties have declined\nRight um but the decay on the left is even more so so you can see this here and in Europe today for instance there's only on left wing parties in power in Spain and Portugal now why should we care particularly about the decline of the center left\nIf we're interested in populism and I'm dissatisfaction with democracy well historically the center left social democratic parties Labour Party parties that we're supposed to champion the folks who felt\nDisadvantage by capitalism at risk left behind who felt again disadvantaged in some way and so that was a historic role of these parties they were supposed to champion these people and bring their concerns into um the political system I'm\nCenter left parties social democratic labor party is also their role sort of during the decades after the second World War was precisely the kind of pushing chain tried to help citizens um to protect citizens from again economic risk to stay the destabilizing effects of cats\nParties I think again it's not just particularly notable but I'm particularly consequential and obvious thing that's happened right is that you've seen in many recent elections part up people who would in the past\nHave voted for again social democratic or labor party flew into these populist party so there's this kind of direct transfer of voters\nRight from the center left to popular party so in the recent German election\nThe AFC the alternative\nUm alternative for Dutch fond of the the sort of right wing populist party did particularly well against up among I'm a former STD voters um in fact ironically perhaps although I think not ironically there's clear ah I think reasons for this on the\nEighth ... all the puppy right wing populist party ... proportionately more votes from the far left party then from anything else right and I think the reasons for that are probably that what this is really it's a protest against\nThe system or against government right so if you could from voting for the far left to the far right it's clearly not the ideology of these parties that's drawing un it's the fact that this is a strong protest a sense that again the existing I'm\nPolitical parties and the existing government are not responding to your needs right and so you're going to vote for the party that seems most likely to kind of press this kind of um criticism\n[noise] same is true also in the Austrian elections in twenty Seventeen a lot of folks who had previously voted for the um [noise]\nCenter left party the social democratic party fleeing to the populist party I'm missing half of my ... year um the Swedish elections which just happened same kind of thing the\nFar right populist party is now the second largest party among the traditional supporters of the social democratic party even among unionized workers right so you see a lot of this going on in different parts of Europe\nSo to cave political parties particularly parties of the center left other things that are worth mentioning again to think about in the European context um so the first is the European Union\nBut again what's interesting and worrying is that the trend has been going down pretty much across the board so admittedly for much higher levels and places like Scandinavia\nBut still going down which seems to indicate again that people feel that these institutions are not working as they should and\nI think is very troubling right because the quality of democracy has to be related to how much people\nTrust it how much people have faith in it maybe that's the better way to put it in so the fact that these trends have been again going down across the board even in high truck countries leads us to think that there's not only something worrying going on here but that this is again a sort of cross\nNational trend um for the particular policies I mean this one of the interesting things is again if you look at different countries um\nParticularly on the economic front\nIn countries that have done relatively well over the past whatever ten years so the obvious cases here would be Germany Sweden which I just mentioned a places even like Hungary right which is not even a democratic country anymore now there is definitely economic suffering and all of these countries there is no doubt about that\nBut all of these countries have done quite well economically over the past year actually pulling the better case in Hungary Mullen has done very well over the past years in comparison particularly to its counterparts in Eastern Europe\nUm again you've seen the rise of this dissatisfaction so clearly there's something else going on here it's either as I said initially which is very hard to get it was to fix perceptions\nRight so it's not so much that individuals are doing worse than any great numbers but their sense of kind of risk of change or of divisions in society has grown and this makes them uneasy um\nAs far as the social stuff is concerned here also it's complicated right because there has been places like Sweden we've seen dramatic social changes and a sense again that governments are just not in control of that process and then you've seen the places where there's actually very low immigration again someplace like pulling would be a good case\nBut people are hysterical about threats to their national identity so it's very hard as I said to connect either direct\nBroad changes specific government actions to this\nBut what you do see over and over again is that when you ask people who have voted for these parties what they're concerned about\nIts again some general sense of risk\nThey often tend to be extremely pessimistic right again even though they themselves have not suffered economically even though they themselves may never see\nAny immigrants they're very worried about the future of their country's again national identity national culture and they're very concerned about the way the world is changing right so it's this general sense of kind of again\nPessimism unease\nFear of change and again the sense that their governments their parties and politicians are just somehow or another not in control of what's going on that seems to be again what the data indicates is the most pervasive thing that kind of joins these folks in different places so\nI Would push back then a little bit 'cause that story seems to me a bit different than if government institutions\nUh I think it's more something to do with social relations of production to use the old marshals term or our class relations so we have this period where we are getting a an increased polarization between rich and poor is happening with the industrialization\nOf the industrialization is rising it and then we're way worse than that with some of our government policies\nBut it's happening crossing danced industrialized world where people are feeling a less secure and there's a lot of kind of comparative relative disadvantage\nHere so even if I'm doing okay as long as I feel like you're doing better I might feel kind of irritated by that because I feel like I'm not enjoying the benefits of of the rise and and and it strikes me that um there is a a politics of of discontent\nAssociated with these this changing class structure that uh that is independent of\nThe actions of governmental institutions so I just wonder what you think about that\nSo I mean let me be clear it's not\nThat I don't think that there had been important let's say economic changes that have changed you know sort of class structures and you know relationships between workers in business and all those kinds of things on those things have actually happened but again it's the job of government to kind of\nHelp deal with those things right so again when I when I said before I Want to clarify\nI think it's very hard to identify particular policy or\nType of policy choice that can explain again populist voting or dissatisfaction I think what does seem to very much\nBother people right is the sense that governments are not in control of what's going on right so if they feel that their societies have become more divided if they feel that they are more at risk even though themselves they are not suffering economically right if they feel that there were these changes out their\nWhatever they are technological economic their governments are not in control of that seems to make people a lot of people again\nEasily dissatisfied and frustrated and therefore have a greater tendency to vote for parties that are sort of anti establishment so again\nI think it's important to think about the distinction between being pissed off at particular policies and being pissed off again at the sense that\nTheir politicians and parties and governments are not responsive now the whole point of that you know like okay party membership and other things has declined is that\nPart of the issue here I think clearly is that there are simply less ways that people are tied to\nTheir politicians parties and governments than they would have been in the past and their politicians and parties are also less tied to the grassroots than they would have been in the past and again maybe people are even more familiar with this in the United states if you look at the Democratic party for instance\nTotal atrophy at the grassroots level in many places in American political parties were never strong as European parties right European parties especially of the center left had very strong ties to civil society organizations very high memberships\nVery long term cultivation of kind of activists and these kinds of things really atrophied and so what this has done is kind of separated again parties and therefore governments from the people in a way that\nDidn't exist a generation ago and I think this is part of not only why governments are less responsible but why people feel that they lack these kinds of again ties to their\nYou know to the establishment that they might very well if I had um a generation ago and that might have given them an Avon you not only for expressing their concerns and getting involved but for making sure that people you know heard the demands of of you know a wider range of groups let's say okay so I have one more question\nAnd then I'm going to turn it over and so how much of this has to do with a with a behavior of political elites and other kinds of ... so\nPart of me thinks that we're the part of the problem ah we're a little off the raptors of the post industrial age\nOr were the ones that are kind of gobbling up all the resources and uh and praying on a people who are in the one down position or the ones that at the Democratic convention are standing up and saying America's already great we don't have to make and granting again completely tone deaf\nTo the people in a in the kind of were the losers of globalization and industrialization so how much do ... and this kind of urban\nOr rural or a court for referring cultural ah differentiation matter to the story\n[noise] so I mean I'm sure you're asking a question because there's been obviously a lot of writing about this particularly in the American case right the idea that\nThe sort of cultural lead has not only become increasingly distant from people in some parts of the country but kind of disdain for all of them um I think there may be something to that but I think that if we even sort of narrow our focus to something more empirical and in particular in European context\nOne of the things that you can just see empirically right without having to have a judgment about this is that\nThe folks who are running political party today particularly on the center left and this is probably\nAre now much more different from their voters than they would have been a generation ago\nThey're much more highly educated they have much different views particularly to get back to your point on social and cultural issues than their voters do they go to different again educational institutions they have different kinds of you know whatever background and so there is in fact a growing just sort of empirical socio economic distinction between\nThe folks who are running parties and their voters much more so than they would have been a generation ago\nAnd in the United states you can see that also simply because now even more than a generation ago to run a campaign means that\nYou have to partially because of the atrophy a political party you have to raise the money more on your own than you would have a generation ago which means that even if you yourself are not wealthy you must have those ties\nYou must be willing to listen to those kinds of people you must have those kinds of again you know sort of networks and connections and so the the perception\nThat elites are much more different than average folks is not incorrect even if we want to put aside judgments about you know which which social for cultural views or you know whatever\nUm there there is actually growing a growing divergence between again the the sort of socioeconomic strata that\nA leaf political east come from and um you know sort of I don't know your\nAverage voter whatever that means okay so let's take some questions here yes go ahead please Hi um I'm I question\nI'm sort of two parts first you mentioned that there's a lot of decline especially in um Europe and the U.S in the Democratic um quality at the beginning but overall we are seeing trends um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "World of Ideas", "city": "Tisbury", "day":
