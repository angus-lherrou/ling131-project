they'll look on look back on and judge us by\nI Want to address one proposal that's been discussed for several years a massive barrier across Boston Harbor besides taking decades to complete a barrier bring its own set of serious ecological issues the fact is we're all here in the city we love because of a naturally sheltered harbor\nRebuilt Boston on it we cleaned it out\nInstead of going off on harbor we need to work with it shoreline products more feasible and more effective ways to increase our cities resilience we have to focus on the most vulnerable areas on the flight maps the entry points for water into our city\nHere you see for playing channel in local park\nThere under water in the storm and they also started flood patch that run deep into our neighborhoods from Chinatown in the south bend to Georgia certain rocks very we have to take action\nTo protect our neighborhoods we need to address unique conditions at each point of offshore and create Taylor solutions responsive

enhanced access in enjoyment of our waterfront\nToday we're releasing climate ready plan for South Boston and joins an existing plants east Boston in Charlestown\nAnd now we're launching a plan for the downtown in the north end as well as the entire Dorchester shoreline\nTogether these plans are for cultural resilience solutions spinning off forty seven miles shoreline\nThis is our vision for resilient Boston\nIt's a system not of barricades where the beaches and parts and trails and open space that are elevated to block floods and enhance and unlock opportunity it costs for sixty seven acres of new space in a hundred and twenty two acres of revitalize open space on the waterfront it links to our emerald necklaces\nPublic access and world class design it's an invasion of a city more connected to our waterfront into each other I'm excited to share our vision and our progress towards achieving it let me take you on a brief journey down the waterfront\nIn east Boston in Charlestown

Boston was born the gateway to Boston's future\nIn South Boston or New Jersey and plan shows how climate action can bring a city together\nThe conversation is often about the seaport in fact new buildings are being developed at high a high standard of resilience including seaport square\nWith Amazon and other companies will be located and projects like a hundred and fifty seaport boulevard expanding I have a walk it's older building stock that we need to be more worried about and it's the planes on the shore where floodwaters enter our city that's why last fall I announce our intention to create a signature resilient park system\nAround four point channel\nWe're working with all property owners around the channel to make this plan a reality it's the kind of collaboration will be

started to make it a reality we've made investments with large community conversations\nWho've completed projects and were increased resilience on every stretch of our waterfront but there's no partial credit for this for this project\nWe have a lot more to do we need to do it together at each point of the plan there are challenges\nMultiple property owners multiple jurisdictions funding means the Hubble walk alone touches three hundred and fifty six different properties it just sheer resource initiated obligation\nWe can't let these manmade hurdles hold us back\nThe risk is too great and the opportunity to go I mentioned what major storms have done in other cities considering what's at stake in Boston I downtime financial engines are at stake\nHundreds of small businesses are at stake many thousands of homes are at stake billions of dollars of public and private investment and property in infrastructure are at stake\nNo project we take on today will cost anywhere near as much as doing nothing\nUm you know I think it's important you know Boston is is a city that that that is a leader in this on the international level along with Eric Garcetti out in California and in in Los Angeles and other mayors across the United states America so we're going to do everything we can I think regionally here we have elected officials that are here today with us\nOr that represent city of Boston outside the city of Boston\nOr we need to work collectively together or the ... metro mass coalition we really have a main focus on regional is Asian I Would have done it on economic development we've done it on housing\nI we've had conversations about the climate or we don't we're not we're not worried about crossing boundaries and I think the plan that we laid out today can help cities and towns are that are connected to arson up and down the coast of already had conversations with me address going Salem\nAnd in in um in what they're doing in Salem and protecting their harbor waterfront there I'm In working with a Tom McGee inland are so we're having these dialogues up and down the coast to preserve and protect our shoreline or we still have working for us here in Massachusetts in Boston on on the on the coastline\nSo it really is important that we work collectively together in in partnership with the legislature with the council with the governor of this this is all of us together on this is all of us moving together and I think on an on an international level people certainly looking to Boston\nWe have the climate summit here in Boston ah we had managed that came from from China or from from England\nI'm from from America United States America from Canada on so we had people a lot of interest here in the city or looking how we're going to do resiliency moving forward together\nOr we certainly have the political leadership in the brain power to tackle this problem so thank you for that questions from the audience for\nA ... in a ... grader\n... says voters on his record a while but I don't ask us on the other partners and seeing where you say they are so process\nOf one was ... and if you look to New York and the problems they have a Sandy it was sort of the problems with the utilities with the mass transit and with the highways that were serious problems to the uh the failure of the of the city to be able to handle that storm\nHow are these agencies are in in the utilities working with you and where they stand as far as the prioritizing for these issues\nYou know we're all in this together and they know that ever sources in the room today and stars in the room today a water and sewage is in the room today are certainly have had many conversations in the speech I referenced the blue line flooding\nAre working with the state and the trust is a Seventy pollock and in the journal managing betray a we have to be in this together uh there's no point of protecting\nA see a storm surge into the city and and have it be crippled because of our utilities go down so we're working very closely with all of our utilities as we continue this plan down the road\nWater and sewer is working on plans right now in the city of Boston ah continue upgrading our systems and being being prepared for ... for storm surge so you can't do this this is all of us and today today's college to all all of all of them aren't as in the city of Boston it can't just be one aspect that has to be all of us working together any more they read your\nIs very high bar for both of my Jose for school [noise]\nI Apologize for my heart in this I was working on the spirit of resilience he was one of my young people who would not let me go\nA ... I got here as quickly as I can I'm as a part of the south Boston community on there was one\nThat you so much for giving us of very vivid\nUm image of what our boss in the city Boston can be one of the things I'm curious about is the cost of the beaches actually waterfront property for our school community we could actually see it from the school\nSo I'm Wondering what is it that our students can do now well how can we prepare our students who are going to inherit and become a global leaders moving forward\nTo actually take on some of this work so that they also embrace the potential that you were laying out in your vision\nOr they give us the mountain and let me before I answer the question let me just tell anyone the school and they want to hear\nIf you want to visit an amazing school go to the ... school in South Boston are just walk in the front door you will feel the love and and the life led by the principal all the way down to the teachers to the Paris to the to the kids is an amazing school community so please go down there [noise] um\n[noise]\nWe we we are in the early phases of redesigning multi park um so we will make sure that the parks department reaches out to the to the Perkins and gets the kids involved in the planning of the park\nOr as well as working with the state and the elected officials on how we're going to manage cautioned beach on one side of the day boulevard on the other Saturday boulevard multi park and how we're going to make that connection so that we can have a resilience and more open space a in better open space for our young people in for older people\nBut also how do we make those connections so we will reach somebody reach out to you today\nThe un originally from South Louisiana on your own rich stay much more than ... trade but part of the Katrina\nWas dealt with the problem was the federal government had not maintained a rare responsibilities to things that they would do on the ... ... what are what are you seeing from the federal government in terms of what how they perceive their role\nIn working through was obviously a problem\nWe have a person is occupying the corner office that uh says climate changes fictitious and it's not real um we have a partnership obviously and the federal government under the Obama administration had Gina McCarthy who is from Boston who is the secretary environmental fast who didn't incredible job um you know\nI think the federal government at some point needs to realize that they're writing these big checks after the fact um especially what's happened just this year alone when you just come up the coast and you see what happened in Florida last week and Caroline is a couple years before that and and what's going on and so we're gonna continue to to work with femur and try and get them a better partner\nOr we don't have the same situation that that you had in New Orleans ah with with the with the with the dams and the dice that that that that were ignored we do have them in Boston we have a couple that that the states working on now\nDown in the north end area down by the Boston Garden so we're working on that on that program or the state's really leading the efforts on that to make sure that that that that levee as is protected and that the Charles river doesn't ever a rush into the communities\nUm but I don't see a real other than our delegation ah I don't see a real commitment by the federal government today\nAnd I think that that that is going to have to be hopefully after the elections that happen in a couple of weeks hopefully we'll have more people that are like minded or the report I referenced earlier today or that that was that was put out last week or is that climate change Israel and then by twenty forty we could have major problems in the world\nUm those are real and when you look at the flooding that we've had 'em in two thousand and Fifteen we had a record them with a hundred and six inches of snow we set a record or this year we had the most Ninety Ninety plus degree days on record in Boston this year alone I'm so there's something going on there\nSo we need to be prepared and you know even right now absent a real strong partnership and the federal government that doesn't mean that we don't keep moving forward we have to keep moving forward we have to do a lot of work has been done to by the way let me just be clear a lot of the work on the climate has been talked about in the city for many many years in this region for many many years many of you in the shrimp\nHave had that conversation so what we want to do is kind of pushed that conversation faster and it's sad to see some real solutions faster as we move forward\nLeaning Monica ... Blue Cross Blue Shield at Massachusetts [noise]\nThe ... the ... the the report and the resiliency adaptation strategies that Boston planning far\nBut within their applied they also have faith that change can happen now and I guess where I carry it to land is there any policy regulation at the city of Boston plant can act to further the mitigation opportunities that we have and they're drafting carbon emissions\nShe's for example the city of Austin just than to a\nFood waste from entering down into\nUm that's a loaded question and they could probably sit up there all day and answer it um when I say a loaded question a good way uh you know we're certainly uh we've we've um we've committed to become a neutral by twenty fifty I'm ... head of the space that was originally planned\nUm we're at the end of this year a plastic bags we'd been in the city of Boston\nWe have to a community choice or energy plan that's going on now and we're going to be what people can choose I work in that process right now\nUh we're working on we we did a pilot program at the bus and plenty of development and see for buildings in green buildings and and to reduce emissions um\nAnd as we have a whole list of of of um action items that we've done I'm In this plan is not about the futuristic plan the ... we're working on this play now if you go into this plan right now and now it's a little different than your question\nBut in the north end a link only put ballpark is actually ended design right now we're designing that uh we're designing a mock we park right now what we've been in the process of making full designs and multi part\nAbout the seawall barrier that's in that's in east Boston is is is there we built it would put in this year's budget\nAppears proxies to mass ports working on right now so a lot of what you see on the map is public investment that's already under way some of it is and the bond bill on some of it's in different ways of payment formula is\nSo we're looking at ... you can't just do one aspect to not to the other or we have not looked at ... uh we we have done a pilot program in Jamaica Plain or we have not looked at a full um composting program across the city of Washington", "show_name": "World of Ideas", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "22"}
