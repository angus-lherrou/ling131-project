have learned from him comes from her work and announces Dutch career of course is about much more than one writer at your first book and subsequent project to test she's a theorist and historian of racial literature leading scholar\nAt the literature of the Haitian Revolution and it's very important on my resources was dollars of Haiti and he should print culture is engaged at present on a collaborative project entitled an adult education revolutionary fictions without further ado then\nLet me introduce professor doubt to the podium for talk has called Haiti's darned about to end the blockade lending [noise]\nThank you very much for that kind of introduction and I just wanted to thank professor was like for inviting me here and for reaching out and being so interested I'm In this really relatively little known a Haitian author\nI'm so that divide Jay ... is one of the most prolific writers from early Nineteen century Haiti and I often find that the best way to get to know him it's so really sort of jumped right in and hear about his writings and\nUm be able to sort of experience his words so I'm going to start in a moment with a series of quotes um but I kind of categorize that will give us a sense of um of the sort of vastness of his work the kinds of projects he was interested in\nUm when I first began to uh be interested in the Haitian Revolution I didn't really stop there Eighteen oh for was just the beginning for me I wanted to find out what happened in Haiti after each you know four and I began to read Haitian writers and I came across them and divide pay\nWhose name kept popping up sort of in passing by there were there was no book on building democracy for example there was not there were not very many articles on his writings that sought to analyze them for example from a literary perspective and there was very little information about who he was that the person\nBody is very interested in\nHow freedom and equality should be replicated overtime and various other places now of course you can see why his writings would be people would fear them in the Atlantic world because\nUh the powers that be in Jamaica and a story I'll tell you a little bit later can very well see that even if I may never mentions Jamaica once which he doesn't get to see how his words have application\nIn Jamaica someone bringing the text there that would be a sort of countless edition but his defense\nSovereignty is two pronged because he has to\nJust send it on the basis of the revolution remember later he'll say our revolution is being misunderstood people are saying that we're just cutting people's heads off and burning fields and there were famous images circulating all around the Atlantic world sure you've seen many of them were black people holding up white people's heads on ... and by the hair\nUm so he's got to change understandings of the revolution he has to encourage the belief that the revolution was righteous\nHe says I'm far from wanting to dispute the rights that other nations have had to render themselves independent\nBut I dare from without fear of being contradicted that know people have had more right to liberty and independence than the people of Haiti\n[noise] he also needs to defend patient sovereignty on the grounds of the monarchy mentioned that only Christopher they instituted a monarchy and Eighteen eleven this was complicated because of course\nEurope France for example is bouncing back and forth between different system of governance we have a monarchy in England\nBut at the Americas are moving in an opposite direction a to quote the ... of course there's the United states with us republic but on the other side of the island so or rather the other side of the island but his Haiti at this moment\nWe have a republic that ... claims he designed to replicate vat\nOf the United states now this is also problematic because even though the United states was touting itself as the beacon of liberty and equality of all taken very well see that they're not because they still have\nA slave to Africans are lots of slaves and the United states and Slovakia points that out he points out that it's not necessarily the case that a Republican is better than a monarchy because we don't see the end of slavery or in the United states so this was sort of his\nOr for propagating a monarchy on the one hand but on the other hand he pointed out that really want a lot of people had a problem with with that Christophe with a black king [noise] he says there you have with the French publicist the journalist the creators of colonial system cannot digest one would say to your then\nThat a black king is a phenomenon that it's never been seen in the world\nWho will therefore rain over the blacks if the blacks cannot be kings is royalty such a privilege that it belongs exclusively to the white color so his defense is from sort of multiple aspects\nDown to monarchies are ordinary a normal to well are you are only against us because um we have a black king\nSo strange that writers have pointed out so those who mention ... a writing in passing usually and talking about other phenomena um in in black Atlantic fought\nHave pointed out that it speaks to issues of the enlightenment that not simply on arguing against it but that certain facets of parties writing actually reflect enlightenment fought for example the way that he questions his interlocutors and then proper and and then provides an answer right sort of sort of way that he constructs his argument\nUm of course abolitionists thought that had already been sort of um popular in England and Eighteen century England\nUm and the things that are we're more familiar in our world for example negatively chewed on and post colonial theories\n[noise] so ... cents rally to ... post slavery Atlantic World has caused scholars like oh lord enough we tip to compare him to bed on democracy skill I Wonder what he would think about that since he wrote monsters you to David Walker sort of his fiery language I'm Julian Lloyd garrison\nUm then there are those who seem comparisons made direct comparison to the writings of from ... particularly in black and white masks and in the rest of the earth\nAnd I've actually written about ... in connection with him and he said there who wrote about sauteed and one of his plays and jump off south has a little known essay called colonialism is a system in which he sort of talks and uses some of the similar kinds of arguments I'm not happy with using\n[noise] so\nIf I'm sort of trying to get to know that hey I'm Wondering how many people knew about his writings and the nineteenth century outside of Haiti ah people especially even beyond the British abolitionist community that\nWas a many British abolitionist writers have visited Haiti um print Saunders for example lives there for a while and started school and put them to pay in the north of Haiti\nAnd um I found that I mentioned so what I had initially thought of as well this is a person who is really not that well known it turns out that he may not be that well known now but in another era\nPeople definitely seemed to have considered and understood and unknown about his writings on three separate occasions his writing appeared in freedoms journal for example in Eighteen twenty eight in English translation\nI'm Jason ... Smith and his Eighteen forty one a lecture on the Haitian Revolution mentions ... in passing and quoted from the colonial system unveiled\nW ... voice listed by paying his nights you know five a select bibliography of Americana African American or\nA lane lock in the ... group things up his past in Nineteen twenty five or ... several essays main Miller who was a playwright and Carter G within half to write a play about the Haitian Revolution and the place you wrote was called ... daughters\nAnd it was published in a book or four plays in Nineteen thirty five and ... is a character in play I was also interested in\nWhat's your Haitian say about about taste today and beyond um\nAnd I found mentions of him in a test of Haitian literary history for example do ... has a history of Haitian literature and the subtitle there ... or the black soul\nAnd he has to sort of very poignant phrase even if he doesn't go in depth and developing works because it's sort of like a\nUm you know he gives a couple of paragraphs each writer he's describing and he says one does not know history if one does not know latte thought that's that's a serious charge\nSo I thought I should keep on going and see\nWhere I can take this and I would find passing mentions it in for example in silencing the path to Rio uses lattes writing to talk about the ... see I'm but I'm Still wasn't finding the kind of in depth articles and\nNo book about him that I find someone who was this prolific in this important to early Nineteen century Haiti um would half\nSo I thought we're seeing black Atlantic thought why doesn't read well our talk about him in the book in his did let me split your they nag color will partially that haven't published the colonial system unveiled yes Eighteen overweight so I think okay and ... read that work maybe that encouraged him to write but\nWe all know so it's we lead and they said saint Joe a type of ... other uh early effort is fork writers than Jupiter him and Britain Hammond\nUm didn't mentioned saute either and I was interested to find out why is that is there some reason other than perhaps they simply don't know about ... if if that were the case I thought well that's pretty easy to fix we can you start writing articles about latte and we can see where it goes\nBut in trying to figure out who uh\nWho voted was I found my literary training bumping up against the kind of training that I needed to actually think about who he was and figure out who he was so I was trained as a literary critic\nBut my first book with the literary history so I had already had to sort of figure out all of these skills about black history and how to trace the reception history and how to sort of lay that all out and make arguments about it\nSo I found myself those were the things I was most comfortable with literary criticism and literary history so I thought let me know vice hey that way first\nAnd so that even though it's sort of seemed backwards here that I Would start with biography I have put these points in the talking on a slide in the order which I came to them which ended up being quite fruitful because\nThere are seeing when you are studying someone's life that don't seem important to you because\nThere's nothing that jumped out about them that has signaled their importance but because I was so mired ... works already some of the things I found in the archives when I went into his biography led me back to the readings to understand them in a new way\nIn the way that perhaps if I had to figure out who his parents were and his parents engine if date of birth before all of that I might not have um have have linked things in the same way or as immediately\nSo that's what I set out to do I'm going to read and analyze the work sons can attract the reception history in their own era and up until today and then I was going to research into his life who he was um in in by using archival documents\nSo you'll see that things don't work didn't necessarily work out in that order because I started to find out that through reading the works I could figure out a little bit about who Vijay was [noise] and\nAh I it also led me to sort of categorize the writings of new so when the first list they gave you I just put them in chronological order\nUm so I decided to go try to figure out who William Hamilton is and you can imagine that that's a pretty common name there was a Alexander Hamilton so there was a lawyer Scottish lawyer oh I found a lot of ... William Hamilton's\nBut when I saw this memoir on the cultivation of wheat in the tropics my thought maybe that's my guy oh and it was from Eighteen forty forty and lo and behold he\nMentions his talented and lamented friend ... did the work and I\nThen subsequently read many articles botanist articles because I learned from a going into the Kew Gardens\nIn England and to their in their um archive than any application for Radcliffe traveling fellowship William Hamilton mentioned that that was his evidence that he should have the fellowship that he lives in Haiti that have lived in St Lucia and that he'd been to Jamaica\nUm and so he talked about him in and that and he often use ... writings including in this memoir on week in the tropics to bolster his arguments for ... and\nThere's three pages in this war on the anti flea on on why flavors wrong so he pulled out in there as well but then there's other he's on some very like I said that in the columnist only um you know\nThe family likes these crops because those are the crops that can enrich them but we eat is across that can feed people so we need to basically he's making sort of an anti capitalist argument and he uses his writing to do so I'm sort of astonished and now\nI'm here I have read all of these worked for my first book on natural history and how natural science supported the ends of empire and here I have a guy who this application got denied by the way I'm [laughter]\nI I have a Boston is who is now making anti slavery and the imperial arguments now of course it's Eighteen forty of the English has already abolish slavery so maybe he feels kinda justified on that end but treat you Eric Williams thesis\nAnd capitalism and slavery he says\nWhat Brazil let's take away from the Caribbean let's think about Brazil which is part of a\nWilliams's thesis is that I Will listen is we're very strong against slavery in the Caribbean but I'm Free labor they didn't really speak out against it in fact they argued\nFor cutting forms of slavery in Brazil and South America and you see that in this application he says I'm going to Brazil I'm totally fine with that right he's decided this a Caribbean it's a kind of slavery free space and a\nFace that should have he called sort of like democratic labor to a certain extent but these don't extend into Brazil so we sort of support fans of empire but not fully but of course of trying to figure out who he was\nUm and I say this is like the most accidental history I think maybe anyone's ever written [noise] I'm In the Jamaican National Archives cause health and said he went to Jamaica and what do I find\nBelieve it I find mention of Thomas Stratford who is indicted because he brings back vile taste reflection on a letter from there into Kingston\nAnd the indictment on this role this register is thirty eight pages it's the longest indictment why is it thirty eight pages because whoever's writing this in dieting\nFrench and vendor original translations into English this indictment is written before Hamilton's translation comes out in March of Eighteen Seventeen because we're in February of Eighteen Seventy [noise]\nUm and the the indictment is completely activist in parentheses it'll say that you ... percent person called Kristof wicked defied or of all humanity Christophe right I'm\nI'm thinking surely and this is not the basis for him to be convicted and in fact he would be convicted I'm In February of Eighteen Seventeen for writing or publishing several we can scandal is malicious additions and inflammatory live all\nThe evidence for that the passages that were being quoted\nI I it was it was astonishing I thought they were going to be the passages where he says France and the columnist and their ... terrible and horrible and cut off all their head and because those passages exists\nThe principal passage with the statement of black humanity I've been tempted twenty times to throw away my pen lot taste that I feel humiliated I Am a man\nI feel it to be so in all of my being I possess all of the faculties\nI thought reason strength I have every sense of mice a blind existence\nI find myself obliged to refute plural arguments absurd ... just to prove to men like me that I Am they're equal [noise]\nSo when I found mention\nThe Stratford case into Jamaican newspapers the royal beside of Jamaican St yeah go 'cause that's um I learned a little bit more he was convicted of yes bringing so there's just material and into Jamaica but without malicious intent\nStrap herds defense was that some French housekeeper and Haiti must've just flipped these books into his or this book rather into his suitcase into his belongings and then he had no idea that they were there but what do I find when I go looking for him in Haitian newspapers\nAt the palace he's mentioned in the August twenty seconds Eighteen sixteen a article he's mentioned in August twenty fours and remember he doesn't leave until the next into the winter\nSo he's there and he's living there for quite a long time um he's having a lavish dinner he's sitting at a table with guess who ... so I sort of\nIt's interesting to me that he uses the defense it just him a a a lesser charge fees you have to pay a fine\nAnd he um only have to have the jail sentence to the jail time that he already had served while he was waiting for his trial [noise] so let's bring to the final heart the biography some now I'm really interested in who latte is and\nBecause I have kind of done some of the archival work I understand where I Need to go to find out um two years so I go into the national archives of France in the ... the outer sees a archives and Exxon put all because of course\nUm while I had ... days associated with Haiti when he was born in Haiti was a French colony so that's where the civil register of of of the all the people born in the colony to free legitimate first would be [noise]\nSo we just average does named actually as John ... rather than pump a Valentine black tea and I'll tell you in a moment how we know for sure that that's the case um but\nIt also establishes date of birth it was exactly what he had sent an atomic clocks and letter it established his parents' age as legitimate and\nHis legal status is free now James McCune Smith when he mentioned him in Eighteen forty one it said a former slave he was a slave for Twenty years before he wrote these writings\nBecause remember how important it is for abolition is to say here's a formerly enslaved person who is now writing but the um the birth of the back of his most certificate the record actually shows that not only was he a free person of color but his parents were married he was born of legitimate birth\nI'm it lifts the names of his parents so ... I bet you lost his mother and his father ... civil register I also found the um marriage certificate his parents which gave me even more information about him\nThat his father was from Juliet is France in Normandy but he came to the colony and Seventeen sixty nine [noise]\nUm it establishes his mother as\nHaving been a free woman of color so now this was mentioned in the I'm In the back to his little certificate because she's now a married woman she's married to a white man so theirs is not mention of her parentage in that document it calls her a scene that's your house\nWhich means that she was illegitimate daughter of a white planter who talks about to be a famous white plan through named PMT ma who is listed on the document only as a witness I'm because he's married to someone else\nSo ah it links and bought a mother and his maternal grandfather's ... to the system colonial Dave Wiley I remembered that\nThese were names that were mentioned in the colonial system unveiled and so he actually did tell a story about his mother beyond just saying she was the African woman\nTo a nice to meet you need you mom just exactly how she's referenced in her marriage certificate um he called her the natural ... of ... a plant or for mom and dad are currently a property owner in France So his ... his grandfather had fled from revolutionary France or Haiti back to\nSo after describing how many saved an infant slave name little hall from being thrown into an oven by her own father ... grandfather so he's not only mentioning his parents his telling a horrible story about whose grandfather is without naming him as such\nHe said that his mother this lesson to praise his mother he says virtuous than kind Mimi you are no longer but you enjoy in our hearts eternal blessings as a reward for your good deeds your friends your concentrates your name and your virtues for the ventilation and the friendship of all kind insensitive hearts\nSo now I'm sort of very very interested in in finding out if there is other reference as are many of the other people he mentions in this worker they are they people he\nKnew but I thought it was also getting me very close to ... understanding how to answer the question um why don't more people know about ... specifically about the colonial system unveiled\nAnd with how popular of a writer he was in the nineteenth century and up into the twentieth century being mentioned by\nUm famous African American historians and writers why do full translation the colonial system unveiled until twenty fourteen were never Mercer cook one of the reasons that his name is known patients with that um along with Langston Hughes he translates the Haitian novelist ...\nA ... who is eight and to masters to do in Nineteen forty seven so there were translators around who could've undertaking this work um Arthur Schoenberg also another one I think partially", "year": "2018", "show_name": "World of Ideas", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "15"}
