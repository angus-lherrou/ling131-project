the study of Europe titled Russian influence operations in the digital age\nOr speakers Dr ... David him Ruben Stein fellow foreign policy at the Brookings Institute an adjunct professor of European studies at Johns Hopkins university we begin with an introduction by tonight's moderator Boston University assistant professor of history Alexi Perry\nIs my great great pleasure to introduce Dr I mean and play a clause I\nI like to welcome her to be today she is the David and Ruben ... fellow foreign policy at the Brookings Institute as well as ads and professor at European studies at Johns Hopkins\nOn Russian foreign policy on us to Europe Russia relations are\nAnd the author of a two thousand Fifteen book the dark side of European integration that look specifically at the rise of far right political parties and Europe\nA doctor play a clip has written extensively on Russia or in the Washington Post and the New York times the Atlantic foreign affairs Wall Street journal and she's also a frequent commentator on Fox News CNN BBC and elsewhere\nUh she earned her doctorate and sociology at the University of California Berkeley at she isn't a tremendous scholar and a dear dear friend so without further ado I mean\nSo thank you uh as Alexis a mentioned a well I've been working on most recently is the subject to Russian influence operations of Russian political warfare\nOr and that's because I think the twenty sixteen elections as all of you are well aware I was very much a watershed moments in our country variety of reasons but one of those reasons because it really thrust Russia into\nUs politics and the very direct way and what has been revealed since then and now it's been almost two years since the election\nIs that the Russian government carried out will we now understand to be a multi layered\nMulti lecture and multi year influence operation against the United states\nAnd we were all taken by surprise\nBut we really shouldn't have been\nA long before the U.S operation Russia tested in these very similar tools of influence in Ukraine Georgia and other countries that the Kremlin sees as part of his legitimacy of influence and so it was really a matter of time for those of us watching that Russia's foreign policy develop\nBefore these tactics were deployed against the west\nBut if we can go a little further back than the immediate last ten year period\nThe Soviet Union had a strategy of political warfare called active measures there's also documentary collect measures which I recommend to you\nI'm I'm In it too so that's one reason that recommended [laughter] ah but it's actually quite a quite a good documentary uh that gives you a nice overview of so we'd like to measure than Russian influence operations today\nBut I have to measure sought to destabilize western democracies from within and undermine western influence subjective across the globe\nToday under a president approved and the problem has adapted these old strategies to the digital age but I'll talk a little bit more about that later first I Want to go back to the Cold War and talk a little about what active measures actually we're [noise]\nSo during the Soviet days the KGB developed a toolkit of active measures to try to undermine western societies discredit political leaders and diligent demise western values abroad [noise]\nWhat I mean by that is in the United states and also Europe completely dismantled any government agencies are initiatives to try to counter so reduction measures\nSo we used to have something called USA and the United states information agency\nOr which tracked him monitored a Soviet propaganda narratives about the United states and it would try to counter them or it would decide a suit inter agency process at what point should there be a present the presidential level of involvement or secretary level involvement in sending a message\nTo the other side they got to cut this out this was something famously the Reagan did a with Gorbachev\nUh about the HIV disinformation campaign that I mention where this was actually hurting us how this woman the abroad and was convincing people and he said look if we're going to try to have the same time just regular was working with\nA Gorbachev on\nYou've got to cut the south and supposedly they did they stopped funding this maybe the damaged already been done\nBut we've come in and dismantle our ability to do this a and we've also refocus our foreign policy efforts and resources since especially nine eleven and non state actors so we really couldn't throw the ball will war on terror and we lost sight of ... for potential other threats\nAnd this is how we found ourselves being very surprising twenty\nSixteen\nAnd Wednesdays broader changes that describes Russian active measures have adapted to the new opportunities and these changes that are present\nSomeone new such tactic and again it's not new there's elements of old is digital disinformation where there's no single narrative\nBut a fire hose of false hood a rapid barrage of false and misleading stories\nAmplify the various online entities so we used to be the work of intelligence officers or ... propped up newspapers editors et cetera um isn't that much more easily done with automated bought accounts were trolls on line\nAnd then these narratives and messages are amplified by Russian state media and even Russian officials and they undermine the truth representing alternative false narratives\n[noise] and again it was long before the U.S election\nThanks for some foremost in Ukraine but in Western Europe as well so a few examples\nSince July twenty fourteen and Ukraine this was directly after Russia illegally annexed Crimea and started the invasion of Ukraine's east of the boss\nAnd there was a small Ukrainian town called ... uh which was overtaken at one point by Russian backed forces and then taken back by Ukrainian government supporter forces at the peak of the fighting in the summer of twenty fourteen [noise]\nSo on July ... Russian television aired interview with a woman who claim to be a refugee from ...\nAnd she said that she saw something absolutely awful she said that she saw Ukrainian armed forces heard residents so central square of ... and publicly executed small boy and his mother and crucify him while making the mother watch [noise]\nThe woman described with tears in her eyes how the town watched as the boy was now to the cross and how his mother a fainted and was entitled to a tank\nAnd driving around in the square and well she was also killed Ukrainian investigative journalists quickly found out that this wasn't true because we found other footage of the same woman in a different guys telling different stories I'm On\nDifferent Russian uh outlook programs and then they also\nWant to interview the the ... the the night of grand needs to sit on the benches and every single square former Soviet for any former Soviet Republic and they said did you ever see this no when we were talking about is there a London Square which is supposed to do with this happens ... no there isn't\nA so very quickly the story was bombed in Ukraine but the damage has already been done the images already everywhere\nAnd it's just something that happened in Ukraine or other former Soviet states January twenty\nSixteen Germany ... leaves that case which maybe someone you've heard about\nSo this kid's dominate the headlines and and in fact the German public discussion for about two weeks at the beginning of twenty sixteen and this was a story of a Thirteen year old Russian German girl who have gone missing for about thirty hours\nAnd it was first reported by first Russian television the official channel of of the Kremlin\nAnd the story was that she had been raped by Muslim migrants\nTo sort of very quickly turned out to be fakes the girls came home said no no no this didn't happen the German police were able to quickly salvage ship in with a friend that night that she wasn't supposed to be with but\nBy the time is an association was happening this was the story the fake story was intensely reported in Russian domestic and foreign media including German language media including media operations specifically targeted Russian speaking diaspora\nIn Germany and ended up in diplomatic tensions between Germany and Russia ... the Russian foreign minister even refer to unofficial remarks\nYou know how awful must be in ... in Europe and in Germany where do you have such atrocities paraphrasing\n[noise] so what we see here is the development of a ... a kind of cycle where a fake story is quickly propped up on social media starts to friend on Twitter may be stunned hops silver to Facebook because it's being shared by Facebook users\nThen you have Russian foreign media foreign language media like Archie splits Nick are reporting on the case\nAnd then right wing groups get very angry about and pick it up\nAnd eventually have demonstrations are organized using Facebook and in this particular case there there was a set of neo Nazi groups that picked up the story um and eventually there was a march in Berlin protesting against\nA German Chancellor and ongoing Merkel's migration policy which of course has become very controversial in Germany\nSo this is how this works and what happened in the digital space has real life of facts in in the real world\nAnd again I don't think I Need to go through what happened in the U.S elections only probably already know that uh but when we saw was very similar to the other two cases I describe we saw the Russian government set of false Facebook accounts Twitter Instagram account\nThat according to the Facebook disclosures and well we have the full grasp of what\nThe impact actually has been a nice about one point two million users and it was at full factory the hired about Ninety employees to work the American accounts following the same strategies service ace in the Soviet days once did\nOh to incite anger on hot button issues again race immigration gun rights trying to pay the groups against each other and various other ways\nAnd again I think at this point has become common knowledge and and don't want to go into it\nBut I think the interesting point is that we also now know from a department of justice indictments or this past summer in July which charged for Russian intelligence officers with these uh operations\nNow the Russian military intelligence services one school junior you but now renamed the main director of the same name they how during the Soviet years\nOrchestrated a hack and disinformation operation by stealing data and then we can use their policies that we can leagues and other entities like suffer to point no releasing was stolen data key moments of the presidential campaign\nSo the U.S is the latest experiment that's been a test of Russia's new digital information tool kit\nAnd that's a good this kind of disinformation as opposed to the Soviet Union used to do is very cost effective\nWith lots of room for error I've tried to calculate how much the U.S operation caused based on what we know who's just what we know an open source\nAnd if you include the twenty fourteen intelligence gathering trip or the department of justice has reported on the amount of money the Russian government spending the stroll factory um and the amount of attitude out on Facebook Twitter and Google\nThere's as far as we know it's not possible to costs more than a million dollars\nSo that's pretty great impacts and we are talking about is still two years later\nAnd it's very difficult and time consuming for the other side the attack site to shut down and attributes all of these thousands of sources and thousands of stories\nBut this information is just one part of a much broader influence toolkit [noise] so I became interested in this topic a Russian influence uh because of the years of research I hadn't done on the rise of far right political movements in Europe\nAnd so political influence in the development and cultivation of political networks is another such tool of the Russian disinformation of the Russian influence operations\nAnd the and the contract was\nNineteen nineties or terrifying for most Russians criminality was widespread there are multiple economic crashes many Russians say they listen to NPR remember as a great period of instability and they associate democratic reforms\nWhiz instability economic instability and food and it comes to power his message to the Russian people vote for me vote for stability\nSo you may give up some local rights but we still have economic prosperity an economic growth and that worked for a while as long as the price of oil was going up and yes many Russian people did experience an increase\nAn improvement in their standards of living through out food and it's for two terms so between two thousand two thousand eight\nBut as Russia's economy is still completely linked to hydrocarbon exports if not diversified its not capable of developing other sectors\nThat's because the other day ... and those will lead around him don't care about improving the lives of most Russians would they care about is improving their own lives and being able to skim or off the top\nAnd so the social contract once the price of oil started to go down how to be written and what we've seen emerge with a new way to shore up support for the regime what's their foreign policy adventures\nSo social conscience became not give up a little ... writes for economic stability became will give us some political rights and we can't promise you could nominate prosperity\nBut look Russia's great again and how is Russia great again we have Crimea which in fact get food and about thirty points boost things popularity ratings and this is a big topic of discussion you know eighties hottest food and enjoy eighty something for some popularity what did I should say things have been changing recently\nWell it wasn't like this before Crimea approval ratings were in the mid fifties or who is low sixties before Crimea and twenty Thirteen genetic station of Crimea was a big national is boon and suddenly prudent was riding high with eighty three percent eighty six percent approvals\nAnd they have the intervention in Syria which gave him a few more points for not too much 'cause he was already so high\nSo that's one reason and you know I think to some people may seem like a a conundrum are paradox\nWhy when the ... leader like fruit and care about approval ratings well associate regimes really care about this because they needed a source of legitimacy for food and especially one thing he has to constantly manage is the many\nCompeting interests around him and the many clans they're looking to in waiting until he dies or something else happens to him and\nThe support the cover of popular support allows them to maintain the loyalty among the elites because the messages you can't get rid of me you'll have a revolution in your hand\nOn the other hand I mentioned this earlier\nYou know Russia is constrained in many ways these of either West Indies it'd be China\nIt is a relatively poor country doesn't have a lot of resources rushing GDP for being the biggest country in the world is the size of Spain it's about two percent of the global GDP its economy is dependent on oil and gas\nAnd as a projection is that the economy will continue to send it in the foreseeable future [noise]\nRussia also cannot compete militarily with NATO or the United states and certainly not China\nSo it's out flanked in military economic and even in political terms Russia doesn't have the same kinds of allies of the United states has\nIt doesn't have the sort of real soft power doesn't have a shock to model the other countries want to talk to you know far right populist leaders may admire food and for being a strong man but you ask anybody they want to live in Russia who was in Germany and they probably don't\nSee the model is not appealing [noise]\nSo when you're faced with these kinds of constraints if a rational decision to invest where you have comparative advantage and that is in these tools of political influence and warfare\nAnd it's convenient because chaos is very cheap in Russia's very poor\nAnd chaos is cheaper and easier to engender than it is to respond to very expensive to respond to us we've learned\nBut at the end of the day these are tools of the week it's a ... it's their weapons of the week a week state that is concerned with its own legitimacy on the world stage what's concerning to me a force is how vulnerable we had been to it as a society [noise]\nSo before conclude I think there's a big question about what's coming next so we've seen some of the Russian influence operations in the United states and elsewhere we still don't know what to do about them for\nA and in many ways we're still fighting yesterday's game and if we look at the kinds of technologies are developing today\nThey're going to be calm and they will be co opted by hostile states like Russia or China or other non state actors who have an agenda have a desire to compete with the west to undermine us in Germany in the world um through various tools of gray gray zone operations\nSo if I don't know if all we know about this\nUm but I'm sure you've heard of artificial intelligence\nUm you know AI technologies are dual use and just like Twitter and Facebook we've learned our dual use\nArtificial advances artificial intelligence will become increasingly more dangerous and increasingly more useful to hostile actors so these\nBox the Twitter is now taking down all the time the automated accounts um I heard this thing this is in the open source yet but I heard from somebody at Twitter there right now taking down through algorithmic review about nine point four million automated accounts a week\nAnd this is all from all over three million a about a year ago\nOver time will become increasingly more difficult for the platforms themselves to know what is an automated accounts or what is a real human account\nDoes because through machine learning our machine learning it was a subsection official intelligence these tools are becoming much more sophisticated at manipulating our emotions predicting our responses and eventually affecting our behavior\nSo some interesting examples [noise]\nYams generator adversarial networks is the type of algorithms that could generate based on a large amount of data original new content so these two portraits\nAre not real people or these to photograph um these were rendered by a an algorithm that was fed millions and millions of photos of celebrities and that was\nGiven the command give me a woman in her thirties demand in her thirties with little to produce if you look at those who have real people to me I Will not look at that immediately and say these are fake right and this is just the beginning um\nYou probably have heard about the fake since all of you are young\nAnd I think what's really coming out us is today these are all developing different actress so when the deep fakes the gas and the effect of computing was very soon there will start to combine\nAnd when that happens I think is going to be akin to a Camry an explosion and test security ... and it was the evolutionary event about\nHundred million years ago a during which simple life forms combined and became more complex life forms\nToday in the tax base and what that means in terms of the kinds of tools and opportunities will provide for hostile actors is that this ... this information companies that I describe a going to become much more customized\nMuch more personalized and delivered by increasing the motive entities\nThey can manipulate our emotions predictable responses and then the other day effects are behavior so\nCameras in a little car which all of you have heard about I'm sure\nIs one data broker and they've only been in the news because they just some shady things but then one of dozens of companies that are part of a multibillion dollar industry was entire purpose as a profit driven industry is to manipulate us so every piece of content you see on line\nFacebook Twitter and Google searches\nIs just the tip of the iceberg\nThe reason why you see that piece of information because underneath that content is an online ad industry um an online research a industry that is driven by profit to try to maximize the contents are you seeing so that\nYou are buying a certain products or the sinking a certain thing\nSo\nTo my mind will just the very beginning of understanding all of these tools will be co-opted and will be used by other actors and to me it paints a world in which potentially we eventually interact on line with entities that we don't know if there is humid or not", "show_name": "World of Ideas", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "29"}
