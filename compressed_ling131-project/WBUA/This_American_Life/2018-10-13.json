B. U. R. dot org WVU are Boston's NPR News station\nAt the school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it students have said it by hand guns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training the running to first drill and the school building with a gun fresh out of the boxes\n[noise] all\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district of rural Ohio they let us record on the condition that we not see their name on the air the date people on this team and we to teachers volunteered for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians\nThe three administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman on the team vicious pollock watch them doing this\nWe used to so I'm explain how this works exactly okay so\nThe seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations all over the school I saw the ride a bunch of drugs\nAnd then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drill okay we're\nGoing to pay for this is one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks that fire during these drills [noise] so the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble\nGetting into the safe you had to put your finger on the sensor is like a fingerprint\nAnd it's tricky network\nMhm [noise]\nThere's a share of that meeting he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John he's a principal for grade six twelve and he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria he's got a gun he's rambling ... bass he's holding a walkie talkie very focused area where the clock is ticking you told me that every few seconds and one of these shootings and other to\nCal not enough of this way\nElementary awareness in the elementary when [noise]\n\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right so the principles running down the hallway\nAnd it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are that there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the focus into lockdown\nThe he and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right\nOne ... he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nHere we go by Oregon [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there so that's the goal the exercise they got there and they don't pretend to shoot him or anything they're just tightening their side\nWasn't great ... that was the target is the first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors\nSo controversial to put\nGuns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nBut I talked to John the principal about this yeah um for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even though he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he said he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force mhm so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own and and so\nI wanted to learn so I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you should be done that's pretty scary scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school and went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... goes to that you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target you've got to shoot that target\n[noise] I Can't miss [noise] because if I miss there's a possibility somebody else getting her [noise]\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise]\nI Can't let it be me who hurts a student at my school\nOf course he might have to shoot one of his students in a lot of these shootings that's who the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating we're we're thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't ... [noise] but [noise] knees\nThings don't stop happening [noise] they just continue to happen\nAnd\nThey shouldn't do just continue to happen [noise] do they end up as when we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting it looks a pass to dispute the future [noise] knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish the shooter gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything\nThat one of our show today we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put in measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help the b._b._c.\nChicago it's this American Life America last [noise]\n[noise] Mm\nMhm mhm mhm\nTook one ... will never be\nPretty school just trying to figure out the best ways to prepare for a gunman there's an example out there that might be really helpful\nAnd that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained her students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more prepared than workday I mean they knew what to do with me what to do\nEven still even with that we still had that and then the\nCasualties haven't been able to return to their families\nDid the training they received save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to ... to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warning a bank robber nearby an active shooter Douglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so\nUpgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments most of all ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up\nShe's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive once she and other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills no school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you're the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every ... every this is what occurred black and this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the ... you have to deal with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids knew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew they were asked to non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nReal colors silver burgundy their on an alternating federal law says her kids to the drill seriously on a scale of one to ten\nI Would say we were totally prepared like attacking the school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors the paper and leave the paper up all year just in case if there were on it would make it harder for an active\nShooter to see and that's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight before Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do\nActually Chris teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in the restaurant kitchens not living are cool but she did actually remembers being trained with the other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with them listening to nine one one audio from Sandy Hook\nFor like the next Ninety seconds if kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building Oh yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThere were following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center\nIt sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was and what happens\nThere were terrified people running and I just I could not you know a consciousness leave them leave and be like that\n[noise] actually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\n... ... ... ... ...\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder and you kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway ... the group is small enough to fitness applied closet someone told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and move there in the closet it was hot and dark\nSpaces left by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she tax to send a text to us that says there is a shooter\nThere was a shooter and my floor um and so my my friend Ferris says drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm viable it thank God and I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by\nWe heard noises in the hallway I'm without really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on\nAnd when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key um and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police\nAnd then the police officers that this is a police anyone in here and then there was I kind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police if anyone in here and I was like the eyes I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is the police's anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door they didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons\nDrawn she really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops and so I just\nVery slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it up and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] Mm\nMust have told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with ... you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands and pulls it closed\n'em to her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nThey seized the teacher who's our most grade is she survived [noise] not legal in the room next to this day seized at the same things they ceded waited\nA little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in his doorway go\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare\nBut now Melissa and actually have been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a play up for what to do helped\nNow I lock my door now I count the kids in my class and now I Move us all to a closet\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared and\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has said live and mass shootings and I really wanted to find some experts weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better\nCheryl Johnson researches what effective in these drills and savior university and it's a training instructor for Alice went up to big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international\nThere's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't on [noise]\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of those things I knew that done it Douglas like he'd bring over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also code ran all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said notice to\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes and all I I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go pay code red meat families active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there's a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that that data\nShows that people need many more options many more ways to respond to a shooting [noise] sometimes you standing room sometimes you evacuate like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open faced with more exits like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort you cite basically trust your ability to make a decision\nAnd told her to ask her how she eats dinner doorway grabbing of dozens of scared student [noise] whomever it was a break from her school's protocol\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in ...\nThe problem with that and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gun me being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of the training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lots of furniture out the answer classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did it was actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol locked him barricade at her door right away it would've been way harder to pull those kids in her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school\nMy daughter's nine fourth grade\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school button hide [laughter] but when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about that one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one classroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting behind because they practiced it\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me that Israel did not help them at all that have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills in school period to traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nOr write them down on them I don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nI wanted to know about Barack heating and I want her to know about running in fighting back I Want her to know about active shooters because the thing to recognize\nAll want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nOh one more thing I'd say to my daughter's school ... point about don't take codes\n... like it is\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red I Want someone to say listen I there's a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\n... ... ...\nThis year at ... there are new gate new fences new cameras Jim back searches key card entry for staff\nGodzilla trauma kits in every room Fifteen campus monitors compared to five last year three school resource officers\nYou know after a few minutes he's kind of broth enough to talk he tell Sandy he wants to shoot him to stop so you want to take action somehow and then Chad's suddenly switches gears and starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know these are the viruses going on in this world [noise] taking drugs is not ... because the strip or yours every drug or if you're still able to get a new\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year they develop those are actually gun owners to never twelve gauge shotgun people leaving the second amendment but they're also advocates\nFor universal background checks in tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks person can buy however Sandy says they don't push their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for\nGrieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there is a whole movement a conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government stages mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones\nOf course is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Philips has ran into him face to face and a gun control\nStory and then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and done it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of him it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy stopped dead broke it up I reached out to Jones through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNotice truth ... trolls families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after that Philips his son gave interviews and Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was writing him ended up in jail hoaxes or one of the\nThings the Philips is born parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nOh I'm a [noise]\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again cancer of\nCourse starts with their daughter shooting they got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home and tax us this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse friend called Sandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone\nThere was [noise] [noise] screening just [noise]\n... screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting and I was like what is he talking about just Jesse had been at a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left the food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire so my first thought\nWas this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went why isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I Try\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it will show horrific and children are never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse was one of twelve people killed that night and other Seventy people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the Philips says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents there\nSaid he said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown and he says they felt nervous\nUncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if the parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know and I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their faces and he said that's what we look like five months ago\nWould that look like [noise] um they're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there I realized that's when I look like just five months ago\nBut it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy said it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the filter side there was also a strong and instant sense of kinship\nCouldn't turn away from well they were there they ran into parents from other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech in Tucson these parents have lots of kids suddenly and violently in places where they thought that they were safe\nThe filters now had parents that they can lean on to this is the moment that launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no experts on what to do when your child dies and the mass shooting\nThe only experts are the people what's happened to help them find each other money in Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and cherry scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was\nAnd they want you to move on what you want you to get back to normal light ... rather should they should you know Seamus you were shouldn't you know let me explain something you're right I'm not to shrink person and there will be the shooters were obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Phillips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away we believe are closest to disappear which makes us informal support groups even more crucial\n[noise] what's that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who got it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting at Parkland Monica in that store at I met them at\nTheir house there is something was neck he was the captain of Parkland swim team who's about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors and Oreos and waited for Supreme drops Mitt said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting ... phone\nCalls in text all day from people who said they'd heard Nick was okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and others at a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital that she thought patient who mash next to this corruption [noise] by that evening the door at still hadn't are directly from neck they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in a ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang you jumped in thinking that calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was calling you do you have any comments can we help you find your son as just like [noise] yeah\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning is the this FBI car and then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the airstrikes claims from these rooms\nThan their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like the we couldn't even find yourself and you know and I hope off that he was arrested and taken keep I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long\nTo her house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot than he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare second nightmare\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a could want it to look at his injuries which did not\nHonest says this is just how her brain works she's an E R nurse she needs details the director at
