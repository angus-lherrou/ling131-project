Boston's NPR News station\nIt's school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building and a week and a half before school started\nAfter a bunch of training they're running their first drill in the school building with their guns French and the boxes\nOr [noise] all should be\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district ... hire the best record in the condition that we not see their name on the air the date people on this team and we to teachers all do you avoid the retro guidance counselor to custodians\nDo administrators who run the school one of them is the only woman at the team vicious pollock watch them doing this\nLisa so I'm explain how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns or lack in these small face that have been installed in locations out of the school [noise] I saw that ride a bunch of drugs\nAnd then all of them the goal as to render their safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter as as soon as possible and they time each drought okay we're going to pay for this one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks deadly fire during these drills [noise]\nSo the first little glitch they came to believe that some of the team members actually had trouble\nGetting into the ... you have to put your finger on the center is like a fingerprint\nAnd it gets tricky\n\n\nDidn't share if that means he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John principal for grade six six loud and he's running from his office he starts by the cafeteria [noise] he's got a gun ramp bullet proof that he's holding a walkie talkie very for the area where the clock is ticking just told me that every few seconds from one of these shootings and other kicking and cows\nNothing nothing this way\nElementary awareness in the elementary wing [noise]\n\n[noise] I'm actually waiting to building also has middle school and high school right\nSo the principles running down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are that there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically when the focus into lockdown\nThat he and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and he's trying to find the right one\n... he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nAll right here we go by Oregon [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school aside and they find the shooter right there so that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything they're just tightening their side and it wasn't great\nThat wasn't the attorney compared as a first yeah oh yeah it was it was the doors\nAll I\nSaid so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nI I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time she agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even though he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns had never used one\nThey came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even have its own police force ... so if a shooter gotten the building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you were you worried because you realize that you're on your own\nAnd and so I wanted to learn so I went out and started learning\nHow to shoot a gun and now the handle a gun\nAnd which is different you know first time you shoot a gun that's pretty scary it was scary to me\nAfter that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school and went exercise the instructors said\nYou need to walk up to the target ... close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision\nThis is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close do you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target you've got to shoot that target and you can't miss\n[noise] I Can't miss because they're finding is there's a possibility somebody else getting her\nAll right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it be me who hurts a student in my school\nOf course he might have to shoot one of his students in a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking\nI I wouldn't have believed\nBut these\nThings don't stop happening they just continue to happen\nAnd\nThey shouldn't do just continue to happen today and effort and we have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare for like the staff at the school\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting it looks a path to display the future [noise] knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our Saturday we have people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to we have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nThe b._b._c. Chicago this American Life America last\nSee what the\n\n\nHeck one ... never be finished with is trying to figure out the best way to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful and that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed\nTheir students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation just came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning and the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think we could have been more prepared than work day and I mean they knew what to do we knew what to do\nEven still even with that we still had\nSeventeen people that are going to return to their families\nDid the training they received to save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well it did or did not prepare them for they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane mornings a bank robber nearby an active shooter Douglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so\nUpgrading all their emergency procedures took months to\nPlan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments multiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up\nShe's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and the other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills the whole school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying we know the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every period forever and this is what occurred black is this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kid was you have to do it with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids\nKnew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so if they were apps and a silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nRule colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule religious as her kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a ten\nThe school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors the paper and leave the paper up all year just in case if there were one it would make it harder for an active shooter to see\nAnd that's a lesson from previous shootings get out of sight\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do actually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic\nLike a person who spent years working in busy restaurant kitchens not losing are cool but she did actually remembers being trained with the other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with them listening to nine one one audio from Sandy Hook\n\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the clawed\nIt sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe wasn't the drill to shut the door and not let people in\nYes it was [laughter] yes it was laughing there were terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem leave and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your ... for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\n... ... ... ... ...\nIn her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency folder and she kind of Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway [noise] the group is small enough to fit in in the black closet someone told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot\nAnd dark except didn't faces led by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and\nUm my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she tax she's on the tax cuts that says there's a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my my friend Sara says drill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm viable it thank God and I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by\nHeard noises in the hallway and we've got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we\nI heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key um and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police evidence that this is a police anyone in here and then there was like\nKind of like a pause and then they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on like afterward I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really so because even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops\nAnd so I just very slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started you know giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhat they're told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know Scott below to close the door and grabs the handle with two hands impose it closed\nUm [noise] for her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway\nThey see is the teacher who's our most grade is she survived [noise] got Beagle in the room next to this day seized at the same things stay seated waited\nA little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in a store way go\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting ... of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we think and talk about them are still statistically rare\nBut now Melissa and actually have vending that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a playbook for what to do helped\nAnd now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I'm of us all to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared\nMelissa for instance one of trauma kits with guys in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually have save lives and mass shootings I really wanted to find some experts weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what's effective in these drills and maybe or university and it's a training instructor for Alice went up to big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters\nAlice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfits safe havens international has its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnson didn't want to get into the specifics of what happened to Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation and it's on\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of those things I knew that done at Douglas like he'd bring over windows Cheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also code ran all the codes their colors and meanings consumes I talked to said notice to\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes and all I if I could read your takes a split second for your brain to go a code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I say there's a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet but the idea that this is all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk and all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more options many more ways responds was shooting [noise] sometimes you standing room sometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open space with more access like a cafeteria gym\nAs a last resort if I basically trust your ability to make a decision\nAnd told her about actually curse how she'd stood in our doorway grabbing of dozens of students from a rose up right from her school for the call\nCheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in kids the problem with\nThis and unless you're there you don't know you know what exactly happened now does she probably save lives probably in in that situation at at work with the gunman being in a different building yes\nThing that was part of the training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing locker furniture up against her classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it\nIt was actually had done it and she followed the protocol locked him barricaded her door right away it would've been way harder to tell the kids into her room from the hallway\nShutdown barricade herself first\nFewer kids would emitted in\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for\nSomething concrete to tell my daughter's school my daughter's nine for your\nLast year she did a traditional lock down at her school button hide [noise] but when I asked her what the journalists for she said I don't know exactly and say\nI keep thinking about this one shooting the red lake Indian reservation shooting and how that one classroom students did a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practiced and\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me that Israel did not help them at all that have been better off without it\nAnd the researcher who told me we should not do drills in period to traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just deal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instructions\nWhere I come down on and I don't agree with no drills at all\nI Want my daughter to know everything\nAllowed her to know about Barack heating and they want her to know about renting and fighting back I Want her to know that active\nShooters because the thing to recognize\nAll want her to know there's nothing that can keep her completely safe\nAbout one more thing I'd say to my daughter's school ... point about don't take codes\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red\nI Want someone who said listen I was a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\nOr\nIf you're at Douglas there are new gate new fences new cameras Jim back searches key card entry for staff Godzilla trauma kits in every room Fifteen campus monitors compared to five last year three school resource officers instead of one\nYou know\nAfter a few minutes he's got his breath enough to talk he tell Sandy he wants to students to stop so he wants to take action somehow and then had suddenly switches gears starts filling out his feelings about guns and gun control\nNoses forever says going on in this world if it doesn't it's not going to change because the strip or your drug stores are still able to get and\nHe plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year they develop those are actually gun owners to never twelve gauge shotgun they believe in the second amendment but they're also advocates\nFor universal background checks in tight regulations on the types of guns ammunition and accessories like bump stocks a person can buy however Sandy says they don't\nPush their political beliefs on survivors when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns\nThere's a whole movement a conspiracy theorists who believe that the U.S government staged mass shootings to make conflict bad\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed Alex Jones of\nCourse is famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant in several defamation lawsuit when the Phillip says ran into him face to face and a gun control about he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and done it and I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Jones stood right in front of him it looked like a shoving match was about to start until Sandy stepped in broke it up I reached out to jump through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNoticed truth ... trolls families of victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting this can get dangerous after that Philips his son gave\nInterviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved the man who was threatening him ended up in jail hoaxes or one of the things the Philips is foreign parents about they tell families to brace themselves\nOh uh-huh uh-huh [noise]\nAfter watching Lonnie and Danny in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing themselves back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home and tax us this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time\nShe got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse friend called Sandy from the theater the minute I picked up the phone\nThere was [noise] screening just [noise]\n... ... in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting like what is he talking about just Jesse had been [noise]\nTo almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left the food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but he's not a prankster and I said are you OK me so I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went\nWhy isn't Jesse ... and I knew something was really wrong he said I Try\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was show horrific and it's up to no never heard before\nLoni found Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their ...\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night and other Seventy people were injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nWere twenty first graders insects educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted that's up says\nThey're reaching out to families from other mass shootings and asked that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents there\nAnd he said they didn't even have to think about it they immediately said yes because they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after Jesse died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown\nThen he says they felt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if these parents would feel angry are grateful about their presence\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral of people that you don't know and I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and\nI saw their faces and he said that's what we looked like five months ago\nWith that look like 'em\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking almost robot like their bodies are moving that they're not really there I realized\nThat's when I look like just nine months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nShe wanted to help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back Sandy said it was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the Philips has said there was also a strong an instant sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from\nWell they were there they ran into parents and other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech\nIn Tucson your parents had lost kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe to Philips has now had parents that they can lean on to this is the moment\nThat launched the Phillip says into what's become their life work they could see the need there no expert than what to do when your child dies in the mass shooting the only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money and Sandy had set up an organization called survivors empowered to help families navigate their grief\nPlus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charity scams that use kids go to to raise money how to get your child's body home if you live out of state however this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what you want you to get back to normal light ... rather should they should not shame as you were should know ... you're right I'm not the same person and there will be they should as we're obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Phillips is in a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away we believe are closest to disappear which makes this informal support group even more crucial [noise]\n[noise] what's that support looks like over time what it means to the parents who get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida who lost their son in the shooting at Parkland Hanukkah in that store at and let them at their house\nThere's something with Nick he was the captain of Parkland swim team who's about to go to the University of Indianapolis honest when scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops Mitt said they'd just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play less and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting mentioned ... phone calls\nAnd tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nicolas okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting\nAnd others at a police officer with giving him a ride home and then a nurse at a local hospital that she thought patient who match next inscription [noise] by that evening the door at still hadn't are directly from neck they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated as a meeting area is that in a ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery time the phone rang he jumped in thinking that calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was calling you you have any comments can we have to find your son ... [noise] yeah\nAnd I'm at two o'clock in the morning\nAnd then they start pulling one family into rooms at a time and the airstrikes claims from nature and\nThen their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like\nWe couldn't even find your son you know and I thought that he was somewhere else and have to keep on thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house and then they told us the news that he was gone he was shot and he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare second nightmare\nNext body was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on a good wanted to look at his injuries Mitch did not\nOn August says this is just how her brain works she's an ER nurse she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answer the phone and said oh I'm let me let me take a look what's the name again this Nicholas ... is just from the farmers perfect\n[noise] I think it meant that there was nothing on his face or its head I like his he was perfect\nHe'd been shot three times a bullet in his chops destroyed his heart and lungs through to see him\nYes he left them because your picture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shocked with an era Fifteen just\nSo gross I'm so horrible horrible", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "14"}
