Mm\nThat's one benign mop head ... was a producer on our program for many years and back when he was working at today's show is a rerun you made a decision to return to his childhood you went searching for somebody named Susan Jordan who he and his sister Kate\nGrowing up in Cincinnati these are the things that I remember about Susan Jordan\nMe and her three in the background I'm telling you about the day camp I went to that summer I Can't get myself to shut up and they had alligators and snakes I can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the counselor had to catch it and on and on like that means Susan flipping through one of his time life\nBooks rock and roll through the decades the sixties she has long brown hair she's incredibly skinny Nineteen Seventy five she's wearing bell bottom leave us a faded Jean jacket she points to a picture of a bloated man in the powder blue runs them jumpsuit sitting cross legged on a stage before\nA crowd of crime women [noise] that's my favorite picture of Elvis she sent this information seems somehow personal an important [noise]\nI mean Susan riding in a car I'm going through this phase where I'm trying to notice things don't report to stop I start trying to notice the guy in the motorcycle next to us he apparently doesn't want to be another especially by the kill your nine year old daring it to the passenger window [noise] what are you looking at USC near\nA turnaround that\nFace the dashboard did he say something to you Susan ask what did he say idiot\nNothing or you didn't say anything it's fine look green like tell me what he said what did he say to you I stay silent I Know if I tell her what he said she'll get out of the car trying to kick his ass which scares me the comforts me to\nSusan Jordan was our babysitter [noise] she watch my sister and me every day after school for a couple of hours until our parents got home from work [noise] we didn't know any adults like we loved her summer before I started to grade after being with us for a year Susan got another job\n\nLast time I saw it was Christmas Eve Nineteen eighty two sixteen the cashier at\nThrift way foods supermarket in Cincinnati where I Lived the place is packed oh twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up and this is Jordan she smiles we talk\nShe doesn't have many items I checked them through as well as I possibly can I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has me some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of red wood ducks she seems happy\nMeanwhile there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her\nAnd tell her to hold on I'm trying to get my break we can catch up\nShe says great steps aside\nI keep signaling to my manager but there's no one to relieve me\nI keep Glenn thing behind Susan making apologized gestures\nI can still remember standing there holding on one bag of groceries smiling back at\nFinally test me on the shoulder\nBut I come in here all the time I'm sure I'll see around\nI worked at two or three for two more years I never saw Susan Jordan again\n\nThe drives me crazy that I never saw her again if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care but somehow having her play with Comey seemed like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it would be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten them\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I just had to find her\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know\nI'm I'm a do you want to know I'm calling I Do I Do\nYou remember she was in Jordan Wright\nIs George\nGeorge yes it's ringing up out but I Can't place a she was our babysitter\nOh OK chicken like my pet\nOne of the many ideas that Susan introduced to our household with the concept of the nickname I think that's all I wanted to say about chicken legs in my pet a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Susan but she didn't remember much more than I did\nA babysitter that really had more of a relationship\nWith you too and she did with I seem to have a very meaningful relationship with you on that kind of a relationship that you might have like another adult\nAnd I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember yourself on that that was because I think it works both ways I think that we felt that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded and\nI was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it it's only you knew you probably wouldn't hire me but I mean that people are\nDo we spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\nI mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy you know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure that we're [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo he sort of talk to us instead yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise]\nEvery time the subject of her hard times came up I hear a subtle hesitancy and Susan's with\nThe person I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't exactly it wasn't until\nWe've been talking for hours that I realized what it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me do it\nI don't think I was just kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people\nAnd and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me\nLove blah blah [laughter] that would be devastating if I heard anything different Mm\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to ...\nParts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nThe person who's in Jordan here for like that I remember\nIs he or she just as soon forgot\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like but you know\nI don't think of myself that's where it all but there's been Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nWhen I was nine and anxious and bookish it was kind of uptight\nNot to seem as an insult that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to your rooms I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of\nToys I Hope I've got this right but it just seems like there were mostly books and more educational things\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room and a chemistry set and I didn't remember that Kate had hardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite a playful as other kids that I had ... ... just been more serious in general no mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\nOr\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story and how little I remember as a deceived us about each other or even if they had deceived us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remember what we need to do about the other I needed to remember that part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her talk mess in the face of hardship\nShe said she must be remembered the side of my family but I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that keep people lived differently than the way I Lived in ... that's what I did I did I wanted for my no\nYou can try to return to childhood by looking at photos are visiting the old neighborhood or listening to recordings or you can find someone who knew you back then someone you haven't seen since they still carry with them themselves the picture of you to some clouded by the years in between\nThe remember you better than you remember yourself and you can do the same thing to them\n\nOuts limburg he did that story back when he was a producer here at our show no even pod casting company called gimme media and he's the host typecast without fail ...\nTo hunting a gray flannel suit [noise] wrong time David filled with the president of a mortgage brokerage firm in Beverly Hills\nYou might imagine in Beverly Hills they handle rather large mortgages he dresses beautiful clothes clean cut the back in the Nineteen seventies in England where he grew up using a punk band called the automatic you'll never really big commercial six\nIn the history of punk but people who care about that kind of thing a few years back there not series of connections he ended up revisiting his teenage years to the first time but going back on tour in a version of his band in Japan here is that something that happens I mentioned it to a client\nAnd and I said well you know I I played in in in ... when I when I was a kitten and or you're not really interested in and then the next day he sent me a copy of them\nAre even ... inside is this year and I said the ... so it was not watch the option I watched the sort of price shoot through the roof you know and then I began to realize\nWait a minute [laughter]\nI'm collectible [noise] get down to brass tacks or how much ... I think that one actually\nWent to forty eight dollars [noise] I I particularly like looking at you know all that sort of ah other groups that were going and twenty five cents I'm you know music business\nOr offerings along punk climbs or that you know I don't want to live obnoxious at the time and it was good\nTo see that uh [noise] you know that their their records when values years later I mean it was it was found that history came out on the right side and yes that ah there is a sort of Darwinism uh in in uh\nIn record collecting [noise]\nWhatever that I went to conceive Vicki the drama and Andy Ricky collected everything you know ... and he very consciously\nLent me uh these two scrapbooks I took pictures and and things out of that I just put it up on a ... out a friend put it up on a website and um\nThen I got an email from ... in um in Japan's saying you know tighten Japanese punk rock grant band and a ... a ... percent yes uh-huh and uh your record changed my life ... ... and he found out through the website that you know there was an unrelated album\nSomebody else you know if you could put me in touch with\nA ... of a base records\nWhich we struck up a deal and then they said well would you come over here and play some gigs to uh you know for my age\n[noise]\nSo you go to ... how old are you at that point on forty five forty five years old\nOr a little bit of gray hair coming\nInto the middle ground hack in and uh and and what really wasn't sure\nWhether I'm you know I'd still be able to do it because I haven't played those songs in twenty two years\nYou know in my shower no to any one uh I mean\nPrior to being married I mean I remember dating women for you know a year we never knew that I played as it has had ever played\n... no it wouldn't even come up\nWouldn't come out really I may not have a good time around but you know most of all the guys did to would you ever pick of the guitar for yourself yes original songs my dog during this\nPeriod [laughter] some of the titles would be we going to the park was a big favorites\n[laughter]\nTo be followed by that here too is a good boy [laughter] oh what a good boy is actually a it is [noise] what a lot of good boy [laughter] [noise]\n\nSo ah we went over they want the October ... I took my wife [noise] which\nPossibly with a ... was a miscalculation but [laughter] no he's a good thing to take my wife gets a are you you're approached by dozens of teenage girls I was getting stumped on the street\nSo what happened the first that you went on stage\nSomewhere else entirely\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary that it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel\nAnd [laughter] I mean [laughter] um\nThat that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know the deep thought of a young Zionists as he prepared as way to lead nation [noise]\nOr or regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this diary\nRemain another sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me\nOne thing is the lack of any strong Jewish identity among most Jews this attitude sickened me huge ... of the world stop worrying about money and well being I Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry\nWhat that will generate here comes out of them was on Capitol [laughter]\n[noise] wow [laughter] [noise]\n\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership [laughter] no that's a that's kind of thing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise]\nYeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knows this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the past just where you talked about Israel sure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] so many amazing that you're in the prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably try to fund recite that at some point or the ball game or something and the thing is he right exactly [laughter] [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blamed the Jews for everything in the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would predict would immediately become designer [noise]\nAt sixteen I had such an inflated sense of myself there was so much going\nOn in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and\nYou know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl with them and\nBeing scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean it was like maybe\nThe maybe keeping a diary where when tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\n... ... maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy ... yeah I think um I didn't have much angry about being the future prime\nMinister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ... um\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would\nFeel it knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people with with getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small that sixteen year old would feel so\nNothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nAnd I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect millions of people like how is that enough motivation\nYou know just have your petty little craft and your petty little family and your small little apartment like\nThen I mean they have the kind of life that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself\nWhen you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at\nSixteen yeah that's very true yeah he would be very very disgusted to be heard this this radio appease\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that way and\n... staff writer for the New York\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drying at the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get on to the program in which he had done is that she had Rick ...\nLittle micro cassette answering machine and then to edit the quotes that you've gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like stories ... American might\nNot for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on the radio to this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style which we added music do here at the radio station to make it bully sound like story on our show\nDid a story about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate\nUniversity is a pretty straight place entertainment for most people means fraternity tigers it's not the sort of place you'd expect\nPeople to watch it guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friend's got with the top half\nThere was the beginning of the school year and we were [noise]\nUm [noise]\nCut aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad and\nIt's basically got I'm On I'm On phones back and he started yelling and screaming about how giant he was a magnificent he was and I'm actually right after that I might have gotten to a point the back of that yeah you know I also dry up [laughter]\nAnd uh I guess that really struck a chord in me I thought that was a pretty amazing\nTo think\nOf I bought a lot about it um [noise] it actually good a Barbie thinking along [laughter] I'll pick your path\n\nScott talked about the idea one night in the dining hall\nThe next day on the weight of class he saw signs all over campus that enabled me I Am nine feet tall and see giant man eight pm on the quad that\nHad no idea who put them up he learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner got decided he would go to the plot to dispense aside time and undertake the challenge to pull this off\nHe would need to create a character in a costume for the giant\nGiant man a booming voice\nPaddling even though exactly it was something like you know from old I Am trying you know just the you know loud but just kinda weird [noise] you know sort of\nSuggesting enough [laughter] you know I don't know\nSon asked his college friend who has access giant man's leg\nThey grab some ... before heading up to the plot\nOf Lincoln wrap around the middle of the high ...\nAnd a black really ... like the guy thinking\nWe pick up a point in the bushes photo died at I um [noise]\nBecause I really couldn't see what was going on out on the quad and for the hot day but I got on the shoulders base with their bike around my waist we walked out that I remember just being maybe you know maybe ten people Fifteen people right [noise] I remember them being way on the other side and sort of running into what sort of about it was", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "27"}
