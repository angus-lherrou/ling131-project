somebody named Susan Jordan who he and his sister Kate new parents knew for about a year when I was growing up in Cincinnati\nThese are the things that I remember about Susan Jordan\nMe and her three in the back room telling her about the day camp I went to that summer I Can't get myself to shut up and they had alligators and snakes I can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the counselor had to catch it and on and on like that means Susan flipping through one of his time life\nBooks rock and roll through the decades the sixties and she has long brown hair she's incredibly skinny it's Nineteen Seventy five\nShe's wearing bell bottom leave us a faded Jean jacket Mm she points to a picture of a bloated man in the powder blue runs them jumpsuit

by peculiar nine year old during it to the passenger window [noise] what are you looking at is near\nA turnaround that face the dashboard did he say something to you Susan ask what did he say\nNothing or he didn't say anything it's fine but green like tell me what he said what did he stadium I stay silent enough I tell her what he said she'll get out of the car truck ... which scares me the comforts me to\nThis from Jordan was our babysitter [noise] she watch my sister and me every day after school for a couple of hours until her parents got home from work [noise] we didn't know any adults like we loved the summer before I started to grade after being with us for a year Susan got another job\n\nLast time I saw it was Christmas Eve Nineteen eighty two sixteen a cashier at thrift way foods supermarket in Cincinnati where I Lived the place is packed all twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up and there's Susan Jordan she smiles we talk\nShouldn't have many items so I check them through as well as I possibly can't I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married\nShe has been kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of red wood ducks she seems happy\nMeanwhile there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her\nI tell her to hold on I'll Try to get my break we can catch up\nShe says great steps aside\nI keep signaling to my manager but there's no one to relieve me\nI keep Clinton behind Tucson making apologized gestures\nI can still remember standing there holding on one bag of groceries smiling back at\nFinally stops me on the shoulder\nBut I come in here all the time I'm sure I'll see around\nI worked at thrift rape or two more years I never saw Susan Jordan again\n\nThat drives me crazy that I never saw her again if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care but somehow having her play what to me seems like a huge role in my life when I was a kid\nAnd then getting just a taste of what it would be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten that\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I just had to find her\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know\nI'm I'm\nA do you want to know I'm calling\nI Do I Do you remember she was in Jordan right\nIs that George said sure\nYes it's bringing about but I Can't place a she was our babysitter\nOh OK chicken like in my pet\nOne of the many ideas that Susan introduced our household was the concept of the nickname I think that's all I Want to say about chicken legs in my pet a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Susan but you didn't remember much more than I did\nA babysitter that really add more of a relationship\nWith you too and she did with ah she seemed to have a very meaningful relationship with you um are the kind of a relationship that you might have like another adult\nAnd my little sister and they were gone and I would I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember it used to find that that was because I think it works both ways I think that we felt if that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded and well\nI was desperately I guess I was looking for a family that I mean it [laughter] it's only you knew you probably wouldn't make that I mean they're people are complicated now what I really wanted to do with spend more time with your mom and dad\nBut I was terrified I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy you know a lot of times they it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure that we're [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo you sort of talk to us instead yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had the kids in my family and oh\nEvery time the subject for hard times came up I hear a subtle hesitancy and Susan's with\nThe person I thought it was embarrassment but that wasn't exactly it wasn't until we've been talking for hours that I realized what it was\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been knowing under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she'd damage me by exposing me to it\nI don't think I was kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people and and I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age\nBut you know you just want to remember yeah with the baby that are the kids love me\nBlah blah blah [laughter] that would be devastating if I heard anything different Mm\nThere are parts of your past you don't want to go back to ...\nParts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nThe person who's in Jordan Europe for life that I remember\nThe if she'd just as in for\nI'd also done my best to forget what I was like\nI didn't think of myself as where it all but Susan Jordan reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nWhen I was nine and anxious and bookish was kind of uptight\nNot just the missing and all that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play\nWhen I went to your room I didn't it didn't seem like you had a whole lot of toys I Hope I've got to strike but it just seems like they were mostly folks and more educational things\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room a chemistry set and I didn't remember that Kate had hardly any dolls\nYou didn't seem quite as playful as other kids that I had ... ... ... more serious in general no mainly I think that's what I did would try to play\nThat\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story and how little I remember as a deceived us about each other even if they had deceived us about ourselves\nAs Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we need to do about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face of hardship she said she must have remembered the side of my family that I just take for granted that it was common our house that there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that keep people lived differently than the way I Am ... and that's what I did I did I wanted for now\nYou can try to return to childhood by looking at ... or visiting the old neighborhood or listening to recording or you can find someone who knew you back then someone you haven't seen since [noise] they still carry within themselves the picture of you to send clouded by the years between the remember you better than you remember yourself\nAnd you can do the same thing for them [noise]\n\nOuts one bird he did that started back when he was a producer here at our show now even pod casting company called ... media and he's the host of pod cast without fail ...\nThat two hundred a gray flannel suit [noise] wrong time David filled with the president of a mortgage brokerage firm in Beverly Hills as you might imagine in Beverly Hills they handle rather large mortgages\nHe dresses beautiful clothes clean cut back in the Nineteen seventies in England where he grew up using a punk band called the automatic they'll never really big commercial success but they were respected known in the history of punk by people who care about that kind of thing\nA few years back there not series of connections he ended up revisiting his teenage years for the first time but going back on tour in a version of his band in Japan here is that something that happens I mentioned it to a client\nAnd and I said well you know I I played in um in the ... when I when I was a kitten and uh you know not really interested in and then the next day he sent me a copy of over ... and so does this year\nAnd I sort of ... so it was not watch the option I watched the sort of price shoot through the roof you know and then I began to realize wait a minute [laughter]\nI'm collectible [noise] get down to brass tacks or how much we got I think that one actually went to forty eight dollars I particularly like looking as you know all that sort\nOf a of the groups that were going and twenty five cents I'm you know music the business\nOr offerings along punk climbs or that you know I don't want to level known to set the time and it was good to see that uh [noise]\nYou know that their their records wouldn't values years later I mean it was it was wow that history came out on the rights of it [noise] yes that uh there is a sort of Darwinism uh in in uh in record collecting [noise]\nBut ... I went to against the ... the drama and I am Ricky collected everything and he very kindly\nLent me uh these two scrapbooks law took pictures and and things out of that I just put it up on a had a friend put it up on a website and um then I got an email from ...\nJapan's saying you know I play in Japanese punk rock ... band and a few feet are a number of a person yes uh-huh and uh your record changed my life\nWell ... and he found out through the website that you know there was an on released nominate somebody else you know if you could put me in touch with\nA ... of a base Michael Woods which we struck up a deal and then they said well would you come over here and play some gigs to uh you know for my age\n[noise]\nSo so do you go to ... how old are you at that point when I'm forty five forty five years old or a little bit of gray hair coming a little bit of ground hack in and uh\nAnd and what really wasn't sure whether I'm you know I'd still be able to do it because I haven't played the stones in twenty two years\nYou know in my shower no to any one uh I mean\nPrior to being married I mean I remember dating women for you know uh yeah you never knew that I played that has had ever played\n... ... it wouldn't even come up\nWouldn't come out really I mean not have a good time around but you know most of all the guys did to\nWould you ever pick up the guitar for yourself

what a good boy is actually a it is [noise] what a while to go boy [laughter] [noise]\n\n\nSo ah we whenever they want the October ... to ... which\nPossibly with a ... was a miscalculation but [laughter] no he's a good thing to take my wife gets a are you you're approached by dozens of\nTeenage girls I was getting stumped on the street so what happened the first that you went onstage well there was just you know the announcement\nSomewhere else entirely\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary [noise] that it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel\n[laughter] me [laughter] um\nThat that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know the the thought of a young Zionists as he prepared is way to lead his nation\nAnd that our our regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this diary\nRemain other sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me\nOne thing if the lack of any strong Jewish identity among those Jews this attitude ... me huge use of the world stop worrying about money and wellbeing\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and wash out little jittery here comes the Adam was on Capitol [laughter]\n[noise]\nWow [noise]\nIt's interesting that you actually are addressing a readership [laughter] no that's a\nThat's a kind of a thing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel sure let's see\nI mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] somebody some anything that you're in your prime minister of Israel in in what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably be dragged on for a site that at some point to be a ball game or something they let the thing that you're right exactly [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effects of Arab propaganda they blamed the Jews for everything in the world including Jews go along with it\nEntirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and anyone who would read it would immediately become is innocent [noise]\nSixteen I had such an inflation\nMuch going on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of you know I'm not just a sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and\nYou know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a kiss them and being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know I mean maybe\nThe maybe keeping a diary where when tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy ... yeah I think um I didn't have much anxious about being\nThe future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident uncomfortable with it and I had so much anxious about every other aspect of my life [laughter]\nI Know it's just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know there was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have this space where I could just be you know one of the great ... uh\nI Wonder what are the sixteen year old and I'm David center would feel\nGood knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people was was getting some of the reading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small that sixteen year old this would feel so nothing I mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and\nAnd I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect millions of people like how is that enough motivation you know just to have your petty little craft and your\nPetty little family and your small little apartment like\nYou know it just seemed pathetic\nI mean they have the kind of light that you know I mean basically I I Want my for myself\nWhat you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at\nSixteen yeah that's very true yeah he would be very very disgusted to be heard this this radio appease\nIt would seem like I had settled in the ... that are way Mm\nThese days staff writer for the new\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly studying drying at the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get him to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quotes that you had gotten which you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably like story from this American Life now for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on the radio but this week's show however we had her put together another story using that same style\nWhich we added music do here at the radio station to make it fully sound like story on our show\nIt destroyed that an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nThat's university is it pretty straight place entertainment for most people means fraternity tigers not the sort of place you'd expect people to watch it guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friends that with the top half\n[noise] there was the beginning of the school year and we were [noise]\nUm [noise] got aboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad and\n[noise] it's basically just got up on 'em [noise] on going back and he started yelling and screaming about how giant he was never any [noise] and I'm actually right after that I might have gotten out back and said yeah you know I also try it [laughter]\nAnd uh [noise] I guess that really struck a chord of thought that was pretty it is I\n\nGuess I bought a lot about it um [noise] it actually did a pardon me thinking along [laughter] [noise]\n\nThe next day on the way to class he saw signs all over campus that in will print I Am nine feet tall and see giant man eight pm on the quad Scott\nHad no idea who put them up he learned later that the science were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner got decided he would go to the plot to specify time and undertake the challenge to pull this off\nHe would need to create a character in costumes for the giant\nHe gave giant nana booming voice\nPart or even know exactly it was something like you know [noise] um but I'm curious you know just the you know loud but this kind of weird [laughter] you know sort of [noise]\nProtesting [laughter] you know I don't know and\nGot asked to college friend who does the actors giant men's legs\nThey grab some ... before heading up to the plot\nOf blanket wrapped around their middle and high Toto\nAnd a black really way like the guys in Kansas\nWe picked up a point in the bushes pulled out on that I um [noise]\nBecause I really couldn't see what was going on out on the crowd and for the hot pavement I got on the shoulders based way up to their bike around my waist and we walked out that I remember just being maybe you know maybe ten people Fifteen people try and I remember them being way on the other side and sort of running and it worked so ridiculous about it was", "show_name": "This American Life", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "28"}
