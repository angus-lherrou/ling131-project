Boston's NPR News station\nEverybody I'm speaking to today from the stage with opera house at the Brooklyn Academy of music in New York City [noise]\nOf here or not have saved for the story that is so small it almost feels\nWrong to tell it in a room this ground\nIt's actually about a real opera singer not a super famous upper sing or anything like that and go for eight minutes about half of our living singing the other half she makes recording audio books and about a year ago she was staying at a hotel\nAnd she had a deadline looms children's book that she was supposed to be recording and hotel room was kind of noise is using a lot of noise from the street and digital drop are quiet places you went into the closet put pillows all around to\nDead and the sound sound before with microphone and then the court and the microphone uh went under the door of the cause it out to her laptop because her laptop had a fair make noise but did you closes the door\nSo it's pitch dark except for the light from AIPAC which had the text of the book that you're supposed to read and she began\nThe exciting exploits an ... else written by Tricia sugar wreck and narrated by kind give free chapter one way or is Anna the enchanted\nForest was deep and green and splashed with President would it be incredible if I just ... the entire audio book\nHe paid like eighty five bucks for the future [noise]\nActually I can put you to hold their book good car and gets exactly like two and a half sentences into this book\nStart again at the start from the beginning so she gets up to go to the cause it and start the tape again started recording again and uh she tried to get out of cause it\n[noise]\nI just got researches lock them [noise]\n[laughter]\nOh my God [noise]\nThe guy told me at first she thought like this isn't going to be that hard right after all she has the pet\nIs why she called the front desk on Skype right and it was a problem\nThis wife I was like half of one bar and it kept just cutting out but I found the hotel number\nIs ... is on the recording into six six one nine six zero zero [noise] down there [noise]\n\nThank you for calling the road you know how we would have happily watching for this you know information about the hotel we get our website\nAnd then of course I like the longest hotel phone a menu\nEver for a while and hearing last night boycotting platforms\nWhen he came in\nAnd like trying to pressure zero to get to the operator\nAnd I'm thinking the wife I was going to cut out at any moment so I'm listening to like this giant long menu and finally I hear\nIt anytime you're listening to an operator from eight [noise]\nRead the ... the ...\nHi I'm actually in room a lemon certain effects can you hear me can you hear me [noise]\nAfter that the seven minutes of silence on the recording just like total silence nothing happens except every now and then turn just laughed to herself\n[laughter]\nOne minute and forty seconds after the phone call then it's quiet there's no other sounds from forty four seconds and then in the recording you're here [laughter] [noise]\nNow and then she tries to door handle again thinking she told me later you know this can really be true like this cat this got to be with us going to work\nOne wall because it has the hallway on the other side and Eighteen minutes after ... up in she hears people she hears some German tourists walking towards her down the hall and fortunately she actually has the skills\nFor this very situation\nGermans come to the door of the room they whisper to each other for a little bit\nAnd then they do nothing [noise]\n[laughter] [laughter]\nHer husband is I don't know dish and he's also a singer and his phone was turned off she takes her mom you're nothing back she found her mom and ready then somebody taps on the door the hotel room and close to ... are you okay\nCan you come to the door the person asks [noise]\n\nOh [laughter]\nThe later and I didn't [noise]\nMy current news is really weird thing to say that somebody as you're getting less clear is\nCouldn't help herself nobody wants to look like I'm not you know\nApparently the Germans when they found is\nVery sweet Jamaican housekeeper and twenty two minutes after term was locked in to housekeeper set her free\nOn I was so happy to see her and she was how nice oh my gosh she was so nice\nI Know this is a weird question but like is it appropriate to tip in a situation like that [laughter]\nI don't know I didn't think of it than\nCurrent remember is she's just an opera singer right an opera is all about the spectacle you know it's eighty people from the stage and horses and of vengeance and big grand feeling it was really it would really be hard to get further from that\nTo what happened to her in that closet right all the action takes place in a space not much bigger than your body it is the simplest pot imaginable there's literally no movement in the spot if someone what your stage this as an opera how would that\nUm it might be minimalist music actually a right like\nJust repeating theme over and over and over again with me yelling help [noise]\nI mean that people say those kinds of things in interviews and then I put the court at the end of the story and make sure that they put a little pinky music under it and maybe you've heard our show [noise]\nBut when we did this interview like three or four weeks ago I wrote a witness and every once in my life I don't have to let the story stop here I Am actually going to be an opera house very
