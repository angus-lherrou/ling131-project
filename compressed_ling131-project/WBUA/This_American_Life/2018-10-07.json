{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WBUA", "content": "Member in the news was boring politics is boring\nThat happened right makes ... that you were there I was there that happened in our lives I miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it\nI don't know about you but me it's been a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it\nAnd I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWere red America and blue America look at the exact same about income to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one feels the worst one and I think to the original hearing itself a duck deport injured Kevin all the money was just so I don't like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was emotional it was upsetting\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting\nFor the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state education and disbelief Republican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one\nThere are people who haven't picked aside and incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide\nTo have to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them today and I shall we have somebody in that situation and our\nJeff Flake or second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who's literally deciding on a man's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise]\nBoth those people having to make these huge decision they are not comfortable with all the w._b. the Chicago just American Life\nAmerica stay with us\n[noise]\nBut judge\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the drama on Capitol Hill this last week turned the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nTo drag his decisions down to the wire over and over he was undecided and she might could know when Kavanaugh was yes it was let's wait a week is if we can be the Senate wait for new FBI investigation than he was a guest again\nA British is do we change has been a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording him for months did you tried to pass some kind of DACA bill Jews were them in the days before and after the Kavanaugh hearing watching what is going through and talking to them about how he made his choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay the big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator near and sell you that's not a true story it's not what changed its mind [noise]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator he just took me up for an interview\nJust late fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune in this case though I think he was miserable\nHe just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh he dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters around the corner to get to the elevator to get to the boat and now he was\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country\nCan declare that he'll be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination that English confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake and crumbled Archie and I was one of the two women that confrontation has had her play good morning or good morning\nWhen the elevator dorm close to where Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n\nOr ... and Maria Gallagher and the other one that the elevator they always hedge how influential they were lots of others don't reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAnd on line said support the heroes who convinced Leighton reads over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people loved this version of events and I think it's because\nThey just want to believe protest works so much of these last week\nAnd then people watching the same stuff on TV and seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff weeks to mind is not true first of all I saw him she had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and this morning that they have a need for your mind\nAlso we talked about it was ... and there was a\nIt was the thing is not the thing that convinced him protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the health care bill the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nAnd it's a lot just a de before\nLincoln I gotten an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham Greene before\nWomen jumped on the elevator with that they were being a hero to shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand and calling out you believe women Senator Flake easily\nPortland we support for women we thank you what do you have to say please funding even say that went in right now in the survivors\nGlover having this er into\nDid it affect you and people yelling like that [noise]\nThe week making fun of himself was talked about before like lots of men his age doesn't connect to well to emotion\nAnd he walked into the hearing to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh not sure what you do [noise]\nBefore he explained might happen next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now I don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke in the hearing he sounded just as insurer as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that\nWe are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today\nAnd uh and just have a little humility on that front to think\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nTonight after the Ford Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night fleet stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talk to lawyers going over what was said he found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night\nHe found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be\nHis staff said they'd never seen him like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a boat\nAnd um it's been it's just really\nHadn't debates staff discussions\nLate last night too and\nThat was that I was already raw you know\nThe next morning of course we finally released a statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the head and you've got to come back to\nThat person up to the medicines and\nHe goes to the elevator get yelled at on TV and to the committee meeting you know that part meanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and and he gets the news that freaks yes he chokes up reportedly since ...\nAnd then we each make choices for our own reason I'm struggling sorry ...\nYears in the capital those two days the meeting begins\nThe two sides rail against each other fleet stressing gets up and makes that call he probably check Twitter because usually does but he says he did not see how viral the elevator video was going and the bad PR that says he wasn't thinking about that at all so he comes back and then Coons gives a speech at\nShould add opinion and say an unpopular case [noise] uh we draw down on that capital of trust and we make a withdrawal [noise] on the trust that the public has been our institution and it is our job always to replenish\nWhat rule like that when I write those breeze I said oh it's about one sixth ... sixth back [noise]\nI said I think I remember your last one it was a three six

program the unhappy to siders stories of people who are saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make\nDecisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decisions that way on them like what about program today was about a judge at two is about a jury and we'll just get right to it the\nStory comes to us from the pod cast heavyweight if you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan Gold steam and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with it wouldn't make right with another person usually it's something I've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan plays a kind of bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny or the one that we have today is a more serious one\nI mean here's Johnny book staying\nIn two thousand and eight men received a letter for jury duty you\nKnow lots of people would say oh this is such a boring thing on the way I Hope it don't give jury duty but I was more curious and interested in like the the process and you know I like to watch and stuff like law and order and other things like that\nI could have changed\nUm [noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something's fan never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness shared forgiven may have if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and [noise] knowing\nKnowing that there's that forgiveness itself so weird like it it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her Mrs ... how do you mean\nWell I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as that uh because it just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say the\nSand was never able to write Marilyn back\nI did begin reply but I didn't have the\nCourage to [noise] finishers under just you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] I feel like I really read things are [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was that the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen\nBut then something unexpected happened Glen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied to cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment\nStudents cherry presents a statement which reads in part we do not want to pile stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son\nThey are innocent of his deeds based on this testimony was only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed when news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening\nTo finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nThe [noise] I I Need to apologize for not [noise] not during one should have done to begin with for not following my good for not Brian [noise]\nShame leads to a nurse or even the most casual reader of the fundamentals of\nPhysics will tell you and an object will remain a nerd until it has acted upon by an external forces in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply\nA little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue it reads and I hope I'm not being too\nForward I ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward Mr burger they have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply\nJoseph forwards her original email to Sven\nOnce you send two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about\nBut I read it I'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son cartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark\nI understand that's been\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little but would I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place [noise]\n... job I mean I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get packages at all or some\n... some\nOf the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK Marilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us to meet in a hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering a food that she can't stop refusing you want to have a coffee or tea\nMaryland as a child and stately with smiling eyes she's in ... to the crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of what her life was like before the trial\nI was always life on the party I mean I was a jokester oh makes you you have melons or because she's going to keep the policy going [noise] I was always kind of the ones that everybody went to people who you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know ... should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person every day she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and wearing endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and unreliable and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member was our powders to cause the bottom of this and that was a very hard for me it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that's my chow and I love him and I'm not going to ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him meant working with her son's lawyers to changes sentenced to life in prison\nTowels appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality jobs she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became extremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it cost me my job\nAfter losing her job Marilyn then lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kinda like you know at my age where I thought that I mean getting ready to retire I'm starting over so that's a real ... I'm\nIn [noise] one\nTen years after the trial and everyone or friends or family have all moved on to win Maryland ... article and she signed him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial when\nActually gay the sentence the death penalty\nThought I had literally died this even register because I'm just like you know what just happened what have they done\nYou know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read okay what are they thinking what are they doing [noise] um I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he has and I want people to know you know everybody has their own that if you involved in a\nHeinous crime like that the true a monster but he wasn't a monster\n[noise]\nIf there is no okay so he's going to come up in Maryland and I had been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk\nFor us I think that probably is fen phen so then as the ... yeah yeah man [noise]\n[laughter] I Hope I get that before we get to [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice their fans span this at the door [noise]\nAnd I then I'm Jonathan it's very nice like a medium they Maryland is here\nNow how do you spend your ... how can we get a lot of trouble\nWhen lingers in the door the hotel room you sit\nDown a have a seat over there um\nHe's the spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears its throat um [noise] a little nervous and so there was the last time Maryland and spin and been in the same room was ten years ago if you have to trial\nMaryland was seated behind the bar spent that and the jury box but today he sits down to the empty armchair beside her to do in a while you can't quite bring himself to look at her as he tells Marilyn what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lap\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] a rather than I re read it and I even began\nTo her letters or remember when they weren't I don't know what to say where did you say about that I don't want to write a letter to try and make me feel better you know what I mean\nFrom the moment the vote was cast I regret I thought I'm doing wrong for [noise]\nAnd although it was great hearings or do you know forgive me they couldn't forgive ourselves exactly and I can't even imagine how the most real", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "07"}
