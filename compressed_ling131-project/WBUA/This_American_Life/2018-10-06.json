R. dot org WVU are Boston's NPR News station\nMember in the news was boring and politics was boring that happened right\nWing ... that you were there I was there that happened in our lives\nI miss it I didn't appreciate what a good thing it was when we had it\nI don't know about you but me it's been a full week obsessively reading about judge Kavanaugh and watching videos on line and calling people to discuss it\nAnd I know this is just daily life and are totally to buy the country these days but can I say for me again for me of all the moments we've had these last few years\nWere red America and blue America look at the exact same event and come to radically different conclusions\nAnd to me this one feels the worst thing because the original hearing itself abducted forward and judge Kavanaugh the testimony was just so wow like it was so many hours and then both witnesses were so emotionally wrong\nThat even watching it was emotional it was upsetting\nAnd then since that hearing we've had this week of waiting\nFor the FBI report which held us all for a week in that same state ... disbelief Republican disbelieve the Democrats Democrats just believe that the Republicans\nBut even in moments like this one there are people who haven't\nPicked aside an incredibly sometimes those people are the ones who have to decide to have to cast a vote in the United States Senate and it does not seem fun for them\nToday and I shall we have somebody in that situation and our first act [noise] Arizona Senator Jeff flake or second act we leave Washington behind we have somebody who's\nLiterally deciding on a man's life or death [noise] no real experience or understanding of how to do it [noise] both those people having to make these huge decision ... they're not comfortable with ... [noise] ... Chicago it's this American Life America stay with us [laughter]\n[noise] but [noise] judge\nTo Senator Jeff flake was one of the central players in the journal on Capitol Hill this last week turn on the TV and you'd see is tortured face\nTo drag his decisions down to the wire over and over used undecided didn't seem like a ... there was a yes it was let's wait a week is if we can made the Senate wait for new FBI investigation than he was a yes again\nA producers though he chases spend a lot of time with Jeff Flake over the last year you may remember the hour long episode she did recording it for months that he tried to pass some kind of DACA bill is with him in the days before and after the cabinet of hearing watching what was going through and talking to him about how we made a choices there's always\nThe first thing I Want to talk about the elevator okay it's a big story of Jeff Flake changed his mind because two women accosted him on an elevator here to tell you that's not a true story it's not what changed his mind [laughter]\nI was there right behind the women yelling [noise] that's why my recording isn't clear as what you heard on CNN [noise] just staring at flake peering out from the elevator he just took me up for an interview\nJust leaks fees can be a little deceiving he looks kinda miserable a lot of the time when inside he's just like humming a little tune in this case though I think he was miserable\nHe just released a statement saying he was going to vote for Kavanaugh he dashed right past a bunch of CNN reporters and around the corner to get the elevator to get to the vote and now he was\nAnd then he went to the meeting we asked for an FBI investigation for one week\nAnd what they said an elevator door appears to have led US Senator to change his mind their words have now reverberated around this country\nFlicking declared that he will be voting for Kavanaugh's nomination that English confronted by a mob of screening protesters the youth wing of the Democratic party Jeff Flake can crumble\nOur team was one of the two women and that confrontation has had her play than mourning mourning when that elevator dorm close to where Senator Flake did you think that history might change\n[laughter] [noise]\n... and Maria Gallagher and the other one that the elevator they always hedge how influential there were lots of others don't reading things like it was the elevator pitch that altered the trajectory of American history\nAn online site the poor the heroes who convinced flake raised over thirty thousand dollars in a couple of days lots of people love this version of events and I think it's because they just want to believe protest works so much of these last two weeks\nAnd seeing what they want to say here's how I Know that story about the elevator about how it changed Jeff leaks mind is not true first of all I saw him she gives had no when asked about it by other reporters\nInto the women and this morning that they have any mind\nAlso we talked about it wasn't they they it was a\nIt was the thing is not the thing that convince them protesters don't affect him like that I've seen him confronted by protesters over the healthcare belt the tax vote the dreamers in for days now the Capitol building has been choked with them\nThey're stopping senators as they move through the halls sometimes chanting sometimes telling horrific very personal stories sexual assault it's everywhere\nAnd it's a lot just a de before\nLincoln I'd gotten an elevator on the other side of the building he was in the middle of a story about Lindsey Graham\nWomen jumped on the elevator with that they were being heroes and shirts and I believe women T shirts they were filming hand calling out you believe women Senator Flake easily\nHeartland we support what do you live in one way and therefore we believe when we think what do you have to say something you can say the winning right now in the survivors\nGlad we're having this hearing today\nBecause it affects you and people like that [noise]\nBenefits of each of\nThe week making fun of himself was talked about this before I submitted his age doesn't connect to well to emotion [laughter]\nAnd he walked into the nine to listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh not sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I Want to just say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now I don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not the one time he spoke in the hearing you sounded just as I'm sure as he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nThis is not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that and then\nWe are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there is likely to be as much doubt a certainty going out of this room today\nAnd and just have the little humility on that front like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThe night after the for Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night\nSleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do some close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said he found Ford credible and convincing became back over and over to the fact that there was nothing corroborating her testimony no one else could put him in the room that night\nHe found Kavanaugh credible also in his anger wasn't is off putting to him as they thought it might be his staff said they'd never seen them like this\nWas agonizing to say it really was more so than anything or any decision on a boat and um\nIt's been just ...\nTo ... staff discussions late last night too and ...\nThere was that was pretty raw you know [noise]\nThe next morning of course like finally released a statement he's going to vote yes on the judge\nWhatever you do say in the end you've got to come back to\nPercent to the ...\nHe goes to the elevator get yelled at on TV than to the committee meeting you know that part [noise] meanwhile Chris Coons democratic senator from Delaware is on his way to the meeting with a bunch of reporters and and he gets the news that freaks yes he chokes up reportedly said over\nAnd then we each make choices for our own reason I'm struggling sorry\nYears in the capital those two days the meeting begins the two sides rail against each other fleet stressing gets up and makes a call he probably check Twitter because he usually does but he says he did not see how viral the elevator video was going and the bad PR but he says he wasn't thinking about that at all\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as flake voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am a presumption of innocence she told me over and over\n[noise] do you feel better now you're kind of back of your people you had kind of a week with the ... you know the Democrats celebrating you we're kind of back among among your people\n... people [laughter] that stuff I a template liberal party [laughter] [noise]\nThere is no bipartisan right now there is No Child just stand in the middle of the quote a film that Robert Deniro was not in the kind that you don't ever take sides with anyone against the family [noise] ever\n\nVery chase some of the students have a program that turned out of this a recording that we found a Justice Anthony Kennedy Kennedy of course as the retiring judge you see Brett Kavanaugh was nominated for the swing vote on the Supreme Court for years this him being questioned into cue in a back in twenty ten\nI stand here today just just a potential colleague starting the confirmation process how has that changed since you went through\nAll that well I like my own uh\nYou know remember the\nSenate is\nA political body and they have to act in the political away\nThe frame or just knew that and it's really\nNot for me to tell\nYou a Senate how to structure that process\nI Do think ah it has the obligation or to recognize the necessity of\nPreserving the neutrality and the independence and integrity of our court\n\nShould ask is whether the judge has the temperament commitment or the character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\n\nMy self was of fascinated with political theory you know if if you ask what makes a good judge of going to get an autobiography you know so you you have to be careful about the [noise]\nThe southern southern southern southern slanted a as a as a really very difficult position [noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience could in high school students people asking about his favorite cases you've always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a good talker and explain this job how it works we will meet\nUm just the nine of us and uh\nAnd discuss the case and we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the least senior and if the case is one in which there is a great issues of public policy involved um\nWe know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it and let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just reverse of our from it's a a question that the rationale\nThe principle of the reasons that you'll get in let's say five to four\nOr five in the majority don't have a lot of back slapping high fives in thumbs up there [noise] there there's there's a moment of off as we realized one of us will have to\nWrite an opinion that commands the allegiance of the American people\nAn opinion that explains\nTeaches the principles of law or the principles of the constitution ah that that control the result\nIn when we issue that opinion\nAnd say an unpopular case uh we draw down on that capital of\nTrust and we make a withdrawal and the trust that the public has it in our institution and it is our job always to replenish\nA bite hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality in independence\nAnd decency and courtesy [noise]\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\n... I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talks about this\nI was meeting one time with our judges and attorneys in Alabama\nMorning and for my schedule or there's are both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis and they were gracious enough to hear me for a few minutes until I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney raises ... now you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of those briefs ah how do you possibly do that I said well I'm I have four clerks and\nDivide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and or if they're very difficult cases I Will take them home and read the brief the second time over the weekend just before arguments and I like music I have opera playing in the background and\nI sometimes have cases that are one opera cases sometimes to opera case [noise]\nWell the minute I said that I I kinda knew I lost the ... they were too polite to roll their eyes but it sounded\nKind of what intellectually pretentious thirty out here from eastern guy talking about the opera and but uh so I thought I lost the audience but I Would say because the attorney in the room raised his hand\nIs all I have a rule like that when I write those breeze I said oh yeah that I Do one sixth ... sixth back [noise]\nI said I think I remember your last one was a three sick factory\nDone where like beer [noise]\nThey used to farm club of the Palm Beach is recording of Anthony Kennedy coming up the total and complete amateur has to decide a death sentence was only previous experience in these matters watching law and order that's an emitted in Chicago public radio when our program continues this is Ninety point\nNine W.

[noise]\nAfter the article was published something else happened something spend\nNever expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email\nFilled with sentiments of forgiveness shared forgiven me that um if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and [noise] knowing knowing that there's not forgiveness that felt so weird like it wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland and want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her Mrs ... how do you mean well I I wasn't sure how to reply with something else\nIt just floored me I'd I didn't know what to say the\nSand was never able to write Marilyn back\nDid begin to reply but I didn't\nHave the courage to [noise] finishers under\nJust there there's so much pain in there and\n[noise] feel like a really read things are [noise]\n\nA few months after spend receive Maryland's email an execution date was that the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen\nBut then something unexpected happened\nGlen and Judith cherry the parents of the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically due to the cherry presents a statement which reads in part\nWe do not want Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son\nThey are innocent of his deeds based on this testimony was only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed when news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening\nTo finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nThe [noise] I I Need to apologize for not [noise] not\nDoing what I should have done to begin with for not following my good for not drying [noise]\nShame leads to a nurse or how does even the most casual reader of the fundamentals of physics will tell you and an object will remain a nerd until it has acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge\nAnd who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter I Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue with reads and I hope I'm not being too\nForward ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spend burger about a week later I received a note back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes I have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply\nShe also forwards her original email to span the once you send two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about but\nI read it expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead\nIt's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks then for the article and says she shared it with her son cartoons breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that\nSpan consumed by guilt would read so much into so little but would I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place [noise]\n... joke I have\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get back to ... some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK Marilyn\nLives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meet in a hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering the food that she can see opera fusing\nYou want to have a coffee or tea Maryland as a child and stately with smiling eyes as she's in ... boots and a crop laser all the black she sits on the end of the couch next to it in the armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always life on the party I mean I was a jokester\nI'll make sure you have Maryland's there 'cause she's going to keep the policy going [noise] I was always kind of wanted everybody went to people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn she'd get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person everyday she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly about a safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though is that the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and under the mobile and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member what our policy is to cause some out of this and that was a very hard for me it's like they wanted everything to be okay but that's my chow and I love him and I'm not going to ever stop fighting for him\nFor men working with her son's lawyers\nOh appeals more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became extremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it cost me my job\nAfter losing her job Maryland that lost her house she was forced to move in with her younger son\nSo it's kinda like you know at my age where I thought that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over so that's a hard thing I'm\nBrian Mann in\nTen years after the trial and everyone your friends or family have all moved on to win Maryland reds fence article she signed him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay that sentence the death penalty I thought I had died I\nI I had literally died they didn't even register because I'm just like you\nKnow what just happened what happened died\nYou know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read okay what are they thinking what are they doing [noise] um I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he has and I want people to know you know everybody has their own that if you are involved in a\nHeinous crime like that the true a monster but he wasn't a monster\n[noise]\nI think there is no okay so he's going to come up in Maryland and I have been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk for\nUs I think that probably then\nIt's been since then as the ... and ... yeah yeah [noise]\n[laughter] I Hope I get that before we get to [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice their fans spanned is at the door [noise]\nThen I'm Jonathan it's very nice to meet him they were Arabs here now how do you\nWrite men there was no okay we'll get a lot of trouble\nWhen lingers in the door the hotel room\nAnd a half feet over there um\nHis spectacles neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears his throat um [noise] a little nervous and so there there were lifetime Maryland and fan and then in the same room was ten years ago if you have to trial\nMaryland was seated behind the bar spent sat in the jury box but today he sits down in the empty armchair beside her during the ... you can't quite bring himself to look at her as he tells Maryland what it was like to receive or email you gaze is down in his lap\n[noise] it was very surprising and um [noise] I read and re read it and I even began to her\nLetters or never went anywhere I Want to say what do you say about that\nI don't want to write a letter that's trying to make me feel better you know what I mean\nFrom the moment the vote was cast I have regrets I thought I'm doing wrong and although it was great during the general
