Russia your music than it was not just about dancing as we know\nOne of the thing basically said I thought there were people who are writing about love much better than I could I Do feel there is a need to write about what is happening around us\nBut I don't believe in political party that's like ... like propaganda exactly that's what it turns into I resent the fact that anybody would ever call me a political singer because I'm not that's ... I don't believe in that\nBut I Do believe that one can document of what's going on around us and that somehow that will make us all feel less alone less disconnected I think that it can create an end or foster Sony that already and also document the way things are I think it's very important\nI never did like the whole thing about protests singer because it immediately placed you on a political sphere and without even ate\nThe parts of the message that were simply humanistic so I'd rather talk about ... ... ... and you're talking about life in the city so that's where I went and it was not a wise career move\nAt all because I'm the radios wouldn't play my songs and because there were too long and and or considered too arcane\nSo like for example like here in New York like the radio station\nYou know they wouldn't blame I sounds I mean my son was five little boy was about six six and a half minutes\nOf the way of those big I've done one of those [noise] way valve every body the\nFormat of the radio the time was two and a half minutes maybe three so if you played a song that was six and a half minutes you are destroying the publicity a paradigm in terms of their present station you know you have three sons\nOf two minutes each have six minutes and then we're going to have three minutes of commercials and so on if you played a song six minutes long that meant that you were only playing once on instead of the\n\nSo you are rising New York city Seventy four in Seventy four first time was sixty nine to visit\nA well the dictatorship closing university and I was studying law school and my mother was very worried that I was going to probably joins us from our movement\nLike seriously yeah she was like me 'cause they get here he's\nGoing to be a really yellow paying so in a moment don't so how old were you then Twenty years on who's going to Twenty one and don't say my mother knew that I Love music but I had\nDecided I'm going to go into law school only because the dean of the law school also\nHe said you're going to be a lawyer or a musician and you can't be both here you know so you got to decide and I decided for law\nBut then the army closed the school my mother and proposed out of nowhere this woman who did not want me to be a musician because she had been won and she knew harder life was\nShe proposed for me to go to New York and visited New York that I always talked about the New York and you can't see musicians in New York and I'm looking at her like she's drunk [laughter] ... and it didn't dawn on me what she was doing I was so happy I said oh sure\nAnd we had no money and there's another ... percent urging me because I'm a lawyer and I ended up I graduated from Harvard graduates last night we were working class family\nYou know and I was the first one to graduate from anything and I graduated from a public university and there's the honesty and I live on my mind\nBut I had a brother who worked in Pan Am\n... I made the trip to New York for like twenty bucks I mean my mother gave me some money that she had and I had to promise done earlier sixty seven I think by ... who was a huge producer here in New York\nAnd he said oh I can do an album for you so when I found out that I can point to New York with a blessing that my mom I called them any I did my recording that was my first album that you're with a ... and and the ... and his orchestra the guy from I like it like that and on the\n... and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo you're starting meal ruin the memory my funny that's worse when I wasn't planning I my I rode two songs that were recorded right when you're a musician so I figured now I'm In the mail room in farm here in New York who doesn't want to write for more where people because I see them when they come to get their checks and whatnot\nSo am I get tired like right there you know in a corner and so I Would try to sneak in like I said would you like to hear a song or something yeah\nCan you tell me about one of those times where you had the guitar you son who walked by\nEverybody would you know first of all that I could actually approach without being you know school does that help doesn't going by the stars yeah and that's how I started I mean I'm going to allow recorded a song of mine who am I Am in\nAnd um what if I can which is a big kid you choose a more gate with mental than just a movie about me\nI'm In my meet on a few things I called the great stand lands right there in the\nSun now about\nHaiti is Daniel ... New York city\nThe seventies for a very important moment because of what was happening in the city as a whole it wasn't just to sell some movement it was like you had everything seemed to happen at the same thing you have a rock\nOf you had the beginnings of punk come\nThe jazz scene\nWhere John Lennon was living in the city\n[noise]\nBusiness and stuff that any time you know he was doing when he cologne\n[noise] Vietnam the protests\nAll around\nPerjury is so young Lawrence hair\nAnd everything seemed to converge at the time it you know there was a a thing credibly Raul energy a all over the place\nAnd and to have been at that time in that mix I mean that was um it was just as a very special moment\nWhat year it does seem to come out so many I think it was recording Seventy cents or is there any science and he ate around there he is the best selling album in history well I don't know I Do believe that there's a strong possibility it is because it's been sold still to this day\nBut at the time I Know that the reason why it might have been the biggest seller ever is that\nScene but I did something that nothing no record that done at that time and that extent which was to international lifestyle so in sales\nIn Venezuela sold\nOver a million to ... that it never happened before\nIf you saw sixty thousand records\nThat was one if you sold the hungry that was unheard of we sold\nMillions outside of the United states I mean there was no precedent for it\n\nI told your story I mean when she was done majority much sushi God Bless him all the time was the president and fine because when you go on and myself to the office and in the office where people connected to the radio business in New York and every single one of the times said\nThey didn't like direct one of them said that it would be the commercial death or what do you call them and this I Will never came out and actually suggested that the other one should be not released I wasn't at all faced by that and neither was really I mean we're just listen\nYou also have to understand that I had replaced in replaceable ... which is to allow ... you know some people saw actor and Willie as an ideal match when actor and will these players\nIn it to me then I come in more or less you know then the vehicle by the ...\nSo they want to exactly like waiting for my next production early\nAnd they live down\nBut it's one of them getting any better now than when it's such a classic now\nBy this I have to say it is and I know because they sing it back and what I've been doing it like for the last four or five years every place we go I the end I asked somebody from the ban is a tape we end when it says you're not the answer but it's now\nSo talking about thousands of people everywhere we go\nBack and you look at them and you know they weren't born when the sun was up right so they learn to something\n[noise]\nHey we're back and before the break we were talking to Seventeen time Grammy winner Ruben Blades about the impact his breakout hit record which brings us to the album he followed it up with mice not eat\nThat's another one that was like what the hell are you doing ... ... like the way he's going to make an open I don't know it was worse because after ... then they want you to write us on course they will find [laughter]\nYou know and after several fun and they are from a title from you know you stay there because that click you know better than our lives so now is one of my day and then it's like\nAn old and I wanted to you know just stay around there and instead of coming with something following up this monster hit I come up with my family that\n[noise] that game\nI've decided I'm going to write a story about a family from the moment they meet in a moment they die and then they were in this particular imagination place that I created by mia [noise]\nIt begins with a classical introduction oh\nOverture and then it goes into a\nSpoken word that goes into like I'm Out of racial and then there's theater\nBalls will say to him in a lot of negative stuff he looks like one of those I Love among the\nLength of a sudden the songs began and then there's more talk and then there's a diary there you go to the back and you have to read the album and then you\nFollowing up on the characters and it was\nIt made all these demands of an audience that allegedly was there just\nTo escape [noise] and I asked people to write me\nThat that was going to be the way for me to gauge whether people were supporting and I got thousands of letters and I hung on to like four hundred of those thousands of letters that I couldn't throw away for like years\nSince they were so touching bulky also but there were so touching premium\nDone really is about my because every single song since Nineteen sixty nine it's about\nIt's about this place\nI I'm just recognizing it\nAnd making the connection so\n\nSo what year is the song for those kind of a nude photo middle aged father\nHe was the archbishop of sometimes not do it and he was assassinated for speaking out against the government\nThat came out and that was ... that is Nineteen eighty three which was not only about Scott ...\nKnow [noise] and there was also about\nOlder people who simply pose a dictatorship that were murdered in what I did was because of what happened with all kinds of ... at the time\nAnd number ... main thing I felt the look on the on my\nLeft swagger blessed to have a ban on a number that if you [laughter]\nYou know he felt that was not the place of church get involved in political matter this is the archbishop of El Salvador right\nIn a time when the people were being targeted\nMassacred two thousand people were being killed every month for just raising their voices for basic kind of union I yeah but what they did was they said to the left they said okay but instead of revolution why don't you participate in the political process and they said okay so whenever they ... got to get to participate in the political process they will\nGo in and kill all of them now and thirty eight years later he's gonna be the Glenn Americans think he is going to be at the same time same enlightened about\nAgain which also ignored grow middle and the time when ... to the Vatican and spoke to the pope and said this is happening he was scolded and he was told to keep his position and do not get involved and when\nYou end up recording in English and you start recording with Lou Reed\n\nWhich being\nWith Elvis Costello\nDid an album English and a coal nothing but the truth and I said I Want to ride with five\nWith Bob Dylan with Lou Reed and would that was the snow and the guy from a an hour from electric just looked at me like I just ask him to drink poison ... and he said you know\n... or not it's not going to happen and I said why not you say well first of all the five guys you mentioned they'd never collaborated with anyone\nTo as they're not the easiest people in there it's due to reach and\nThe thing is I insisted and then he came back about a month later and I had forgotten about it and he said you know they all said yes but they they don't want to talk to us they want to talk to you so I actually met with Dylan and akin to the house and we spend like five hours writing supposed to be a song that which I still have an a tape recording [noise]\nYou do something again another Ruben Blades which is okay\nI'm actually going to translate Michael Jackson's I just can't stop I mean\nThis is the way it happened so Quincy Jones called me and he was very hip to Latin things and not music so he said you know Michael Jackson and wants to uh sing a song in Spanish and\nI think that you're the guy who um [noise] can write the lyrics for him and I and and I said a really [noise]\nYou you were actually like I wasn't sure\nI Want to work with Michael Jackson wasn't sure seemed\nOdd too eccentric I then sell Washington as a dear friend of mine I share his philosophy themselves says keep it simple and that's how I Want to keep my life and then I thought that might be too complicated [noise]\nLong\nAlso he was huge and he'll get Nicholas right after thrillers like my God you know so I said okay the other thing I said I was I don't I Can't right just a translation this has to make sense\nWhen I have the freedom to write a lyric that would also incorporate new elements to it but that can you're an or transmit when he did\nAnd he said yes so I wrote that lyric I made one for Michael that word by word explaining what each word meant explaining
