you sang in an interview a few years back you were talking about how you were getting fed up with talking to people actually [laughter] I I I guess you off but you you said in that interview that dumb\nYou you'd rather likes to be a non ... did make a very good non is that\nTrue I did I didn't actually remember saying that but I Do have like me\n... as I did want to spend a week and it for a

year old child and she's playing on the beach with her older sister Pamela\nI'm ... you know as as having a fairly ambiguous character and being a no vote because I don't think she wanted to be no and\nThen I think I had to leave her there sometimes you touch the characters and you want to bring them back or you know give them more but then you have to have to talk to them that because that was that role in her role is to be a kind of seen it at first blush except for women may cause she's of the time I think [noise]\nBut if I were to write another novel based around folks corner which is my recovering desire I'll have to say 'cause it is that many how rich you know the place I Want to live where everyone wants to live than it would be Mr Schorr closest store the next door neighbor

making ... because it's not necessarily something I've written and I never think you should talk about things you haven't written because they just don't exist but I think is he is he's war echoed as it was because she stepped in the in the ... and you know the messages and the first World War and I think\nSylvie can see in that that that's a woman who did something and that Sylvia has only been a life and a mother and I think also being a wife and mother in\nNineteen ten is a very different prospect from England now so I think it shows something that could have been an is annoying because she's not done the best with it so I think is probably so easily looking into that you know is he is and ever since everybody really\nWell to me I I don't know I loved it I mean she's she's this wild child up bumped always comes up to ... always helps us You're up through the various crises and fun life I think she's extremely attractive ... writer [laughter]\nTo a best selling author don't they draw the life of one of a Sheila's brothers up but I just it makes me wonder because you know how you fall in love with heart disease in books was definitely the old many attractive all interesting charges and book she was my face\nBut I just wanted to use and also other than a Sheila presumably the center of your country was that there was one you particularly enjoyed\nEnjoyed when I left Haiti

World Service uh swatch are bonding\nAnd this is taking up a bit on the earlier question about was a a Sheila remains consistent whether she ...\nShe says some just talking about all the characters in the book she says you know who takes us from Iraq to their uh from one story to another from one tragedy to another ... the main characters a she's a mother father brother teddy and so on remained constant why is that\nUm well I never thought to write to many different needs to be honest I was surprised how constant psychiatric I send my students seem to go to law school reunions [laughter]\n... and what you know and I went to school in Nineteen sixty three so I'm going to fifty year old sixty ... gosh I didn't even know how many decades\nWhat we surprises me is how do people change he says the same goes as they would then essentially and gets I always think of myself as someone who is changed\nI wouldn't be the only one who had done that said people do remain constant and it's just what happens to them and it's interesting\nBut also how we understand them because I Love about the ... one of many things I Love is the ... the characters you think all of sudden way actually you got to realize that much more than ... those are those oceans falls or you ... you brought you to realize is the tend to loving one of the ... parents but\nAlso her older sister ... who is kind of all the time I see it that way as you as you describe for not reading but I mean she used to go do ... do you think she's already stole ... boring actually she's far more acute suddenly about well politics for instance a sitter and she she\n... she's cautious smoke person she's not boring until\nNow no you've got to couches have to flower I mean sometimes they have to do the opposite and close up and sometimes they have to separate them killed [laughter] sad to me but I think you have to see\nSee the workings of the plug on them I mean that sounds clap mechanical because it felt life I mean you know it's not like these we are living life couches and plus two artificial so you have to\nWork with that and and make things happen and that's that's the fun of writing is being able to take charge and to move people around and make things happen to them and killed him off and [noise]\n[laughter] quite a character as I used to used to hold back but now I'm I'm not afraid of is this ... [laughter] the truth\n[laughter] well let's have another reading from life off their life now this is a simple as a character who is one of the most unpleasant and the entire book [noise] and where we\nAre is that this is a version of events uh she lives met 'em like the aunt is he in a tea room in London and\nThe one point she still be overcome by just terrible sense of Brett and it'll just wants to stumble out to bars I Need to explain that and another existence when we read about it before\nOh she was in London and tripped and smashed ahead had a terrible accident and she was helped her feet rescued by a man called Derek oldest son\nA name not typical she ... me off to get married and uh she'll be off does not in a jealous rage he kills so\nAnyway that was another life in this life us or is just called me sitting in a in the tea room waiting for is to come back because this is just pulled all of them knew\nShe was waiting patiently if I had to return when suddenly the terror descended switched to the ... century hawk\nAnd anticipate you dread if something unknown but enormously threatening it was coming for here among the plight ... teaspoons Sosa she stood up knocking as a child shouldn't dizzy and it was the fate of folk in front of her face\nLike thunder she torch yet you've never been bone\nShe pushed through the veil after the Russian TV to Harrington Road\nShe started to run and kept on running onto the Bronx and rather than blindly into education gardens she'd been here before she'd never been here before there was something just down to the site to just around the corner somebody she could never chased down something that was chasing had her\nShe was like the hunter and the hunters like the folks she carried on and then streets on something ... knows the pain was extraordinary blood everywhere\nShe sat on the pavement and cried with ... or\n... says anyone on the street but then from behind during man's voice said oh my how awful for you that may help here you have to not only are the nice to ... off it's not the kind of what was it ... my name's Derek Derek with us and\nShe knew them for his she didn't have that voice the past seemed to leak into the present as if it were full somewhere what was it the feet just spinning in the past either way it was nightmarish it's her in a dark landscape had become manifest the inside become the outside\nTime was active joint not refers and\nHe talked in since ... very much on did not function of events or reconnaissance ... quite pleasant\nHe's a car [laughter]\nFor me I think he just ...

those another question from is about a mile in El Salvador and Central America who wrote I was completely taken aback by the description of the blitz when a shooter is trying to survive this ordeal to the point I felt was that\nSo I was wondering about the research and the amount of time this must have taken to make the reading so visit\nI research is something you forget once you've done so that when people say how how long did you search for how much the search you and I'm like oh I don't know I Can't remember who said she said different these days when I wrote behind the scenes that museum it was amazing eat before the Internet and you would\nDo well either was done you'd go to the library of what you'd go to a reference library and you'd take notes and you would order books and it was very time consuming and then the Internet came an fence everyone was very dubious about the accuracy of information on the Internet and then I think we've got no confidence\nThat what you do now is you such as you go along as if you have a question you know if you up so it's much more seamless process whereas you know before you could say oh I spent three months and in the library was searching on the basis whereas now you don't know because it's happens while you're on she will do\nIs try to treat with life afterlife or recorded ruins is\nI did a ... year of trying to win most let's self so I wrote to read the last sort of biographies ... watched a little to film footage [noise]\nUh and it as much as I could because you don't want to become over the ... because then you become tedious basically I mean there were moments when I get carried away by\nSending a guardian ruins because I'm not a technical person I had to try and get to ... ... was a technical things to do with bombing and uh and it's something that you find that you stop talking about in your fiction you have to put yourself back and take no no no this is an awful decision to a handbook for them at an engine [laughter]\nAnd then you have to forget there was such that you did and you have to write the fiction nuts when you start going back can and and checking and putting things in and doing well so it's a it's not easily quantifiable for me these days research because sometimes it just in both sitting in your garden reading a book could\nSomehow I feel like such [noise]\nPick up some thank you very much\n... ... um caffeine O'Connor from Northern Ireland originally my favorite chapter in the book is one written from the German perspective and I would like to read more around this particular topic and my question is\nWhat was your favorite written source in your research from the German for say\nThis is this is at one point were one of our lives is a ... is in Germany is living in Germany she is she's still a British woman but she's she's a and reduce the absolute about the ... to ... some like from from\nThat side of the trauma yes I did become obsessed with David Brown or wrong I [laughter] I had to be held back from being excited whenever I can go Seventy back either as I started going\n[laughter] you know Mr there's very much too young to remember is that as a there's a lot of\nColor film footage for example and to film footage but no to color film pushes aside that um although that sounds slightly trivial way of getting into the gym expense the war in fact she does open up lots of things about\nClothes on past times and I know some high paid tribute to the end of the book to a book that neighbor my mother's had written it was a small out biography of her life which I've used again in a transcription\nAnd she went to Nazi Germany in ... nine\nBut I moved to back a bit in the book and she did go to Hitler Youth rallies and she did sing the ... when she didn't lots of handsome young flown voice and she did a whole ... like it was just sort of exchange it was like a girl scout exchange with the you know to\nThe gym and equivalent of the ... and that was a really good source for me because it was real I knew she was actually writing about something she'd done something she'd experiencing as opposed to you know reaching someone else's biography of something else so that was that was really helpful way into\nThe pre war that she'll ... experience a lot of that well I mean I did was such that and I did read quite a load of\nStuff about the Russian invasion of the island but really I had to re Detroit myself into that imagined it certainly I think when all of that is true but you know the animals at the zoo thing that's happened people eating them and all of these things and you have to come in through individuals individual accounts I think and there's always the ones where they'll tell you something\nColor of the cut and sang it the window as something as simple as that but you know oh well that's what the cousins would have been like hey the window I think he\nSays I'm doing with such so something that's going to be fixed you know I like

cheese so much debt by the end that she would have to find the right way of living her life I think she becomes fully herself and I think that's that's everyone's jumping life isn't it to become fully yourself before the end well before that and hopefully\nA and I think that's I like that way pushing it to you know I'm not quite stuff yeah I think so too\nDoes over what's I intended you know if that's what came across it [noise]\nWell the ... moves around a bit has talked consume moves through time back and forwards from Wall to wall\nIt'll somebody from place to place as we've said and uh there was one section if it's a very opening of the book which is not with us should was bus with another incident and this is that this is in Germany and it's in the Nineteen thirties fool will and I wonder if you would read something else\nStates\nMy publicist it asked me what I was writing about next I said well Cisco and she keeps dying and it comes to life she died she comes back to life she
