I came in thinking you know I'm a rational enough science ... grade I know that there are these ... is is a real bearing on the real physical world but I actually I don't know how to bring myself to do that either\nI learned you know what else to to send me to face has just today we did yeah so I think like me and the princes a couple of them out of\nYour mom and your brother is now\nYeah I think I'm\nA\n... yeah I just wonder you know just just to see\nHow comfortable which is like a lot on on us to come to it I think it's similar to wishing it'll somebody you don't you're not going to be able to actually change the lives of bring up something about just by thinking about that\nBut would you want to do it so easy for me to just not do that I'd rather just to just not do that you don't have to\nWhat I keep thinking\nAbout ... it's a very common to enrich hold my check yet again and this is a role in national thing today and when you do have to check on your wildly popular ...\nTo Sophie page on no thanks to my easily inclined to produce the most for that to mean trick no I'm going to go on a limb and say that most of you wouldn't be too keen on solving does or cutting pictures of your loved ones either\nBut it was a bit surprised by how strong ... version was even though I knew Russian either nothing would actually come of it I just couldn't bring myself to cut up the picture\nSo what's going on here how can something that we know isn't truth still have an impact on the way we behave\nAnd to Jane rises and professor of behavioral science at Chicago universities Booth School of business and an expert in magical thinking\nMy way of thinking about this is that a lot of these superstitious intuitions and beliefs are really just a product of how our minds work and so this is just how people think about the world and we're not perfect when we try to think about the world\nWho whether these superstitious or choose to kind of beliefs come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological process sees and those are functional and they exist for a reason\nI don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are here for a reason so for example we're always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen we are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not\nSo even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being ... related that ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control\nA scary environment right yeah that makes sense another example is the way that he respects or sort of the rules of thumb that our mind will rely on so it's a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program ... there was a bit of amusing about ... to um um but producing very cruelly brought along some pictures of my loved ones and I was asked if I Would like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it all just associating with a bad outcome of anything happening to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different era stick which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of The Likeness if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between two things that look so much alike and that is part of where the voodoo believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how a very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems\nAre in our mind one that operates very quickly and automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources\nOr sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition\nAnd the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air and what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case\nSometimes that slow system recognizes the Arab recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintains that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment I Want you to imagine this I have three of our lives on the table and one of them you know which has the money inside that you can win\nI Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three chosen okay good now you can keep your ... or you could\nWhat do you go for you should go for the two [laughter] there is no question here rationally what you should do\nBut a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they were to trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a okay this is where the magic comes and sell\nTheir torn between an intuition where they shouldn't try their ... and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them I said around like forty percent of them will stick with one ...\nWhile that's a really high number and so what you're saying there is that that kind of choice that between the intuition and and then the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems in our brain and I'm sometimes the rational system will win out but other times\nWe kind of I guess given to the first in Jewish and system just because\nJust because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that\nIntuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not a rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it and so another thing to consider is the cost of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the ... too so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi rational person on the radio\nBut the cost of ignoring the intuition I see this is going to be really bad if I ... through a picture of a loved one that's a big cost so I'd rather avoid that and not do it\nYeah I think that's a perfect illustration the only thing that I Would add to that description there is to just say that the reason you're having an emotional reaction in the first place is because there is some sort of superstitious intuition underlying it\nI mean not even just to the extent that you're entertaining at as a possibility Jane rise in that\nYou are listening to crowd signs on the BBC well service the program the odds of your questions about life on the universe we've heard from Jane about how our natural tendency human beings to seek causal connections can help us to understand the whole world but can sometimes lead to a rational belief\nIs that what's happening with list them also to help us all to that question is David Spiegel hope to an ex but to uncover incidents as [noise] do you believe that in good or bad luck [noise]\nExcept as a label witches are applied offer things have happened in order to destroy things
