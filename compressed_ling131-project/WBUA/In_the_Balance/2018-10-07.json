away in the Sahara Desert is tiny disturbances in the flow of hothead streams west from that\nYou may have come across the idea of the butterfly effect that the tiny motion of the butterfly flaps its wings in one part of the world creates massive consequences somewhere else it's he's in popular culture as a metaphor but from what the scientists it's more or less true\nMeteorologists always talk about power butterfly flaps its wings of Omar can make it ran in Beijing two weeks from now\nHurricanes in the U.S tend to start in a similar fashion with small disturbances in the ... coup waves\nAnd you get these waves that come across the car in front of garlic butter root for decades\nAnd every one of those could turn into something\nSo you get Seventy or eighty those during the course of the

recipe\nNotion surface where you have water that's twenty eight thirty Celsius going down fifty sixty meters huge amount of heat stored in that water and that's what the hurricane lives\nThese days the focus in the U.S at least is on monitoring hurricanes which help scientists predict what's going to happen when a storm like Florence hits the coastline surely ... is the deputy director of NOAA's hurricane research division and explains how the organization's mission has changed quite a bit\nStarted way back when with a project called projects dorm fury the purpose was that was to stop hurricanes we thought that we could use\nIf you will sprinkle it over the hurricane and maybe stop the convection from happening that didn't necessarily work for us and so we got more involved with trying to improve the forecast who back when that started when people said\nOh a hurricane's coming is it just they tell by looking out the window and seeing black cloud pretty much so I mean it only got better for us\nWhen we had a satellites and that was around the early Nineteen sixties and that gave us sort of a picture of what was to come to our coast\nAnd since then we've been improving the forecast what kinds of tools do you use to track how can we use as I mentioned satellites we use the aircraft to collect data overland we'd we launch radio sons bitter weather balloons we have buoys out in the ocean\nOr we also use coastal radars so we use all those those things to help us improve of how we can monitor the hurricane ... doing they're gathering wind speed wind direction pressure\nA relative humidity all of those things and with all of that data that we can collect even the radar gives a tour of the reflectivity which is a signal of how strong or how deep those us under storms and hurricanes are\nAnd you've got on the table in front of us well it looks like a sin into that you ... percent poster inside\nWhat is it it is a drop when San does a GPS drop when sound and we drop about twenty five from the belly of the aircraft into the storm and so we sort of pepper the storm with these instruments\nTo our morning chorus Hurricane Florence making landfall thousands and thousands would know\nSomebody might wonder how TV weather forecasting snow so much about how storm is behaving\nI just seemed it was all done remotely but no uh no civic comes down to

more than twenty six degrees Celsius it might sound implausible but what if you could cool the seat to stop a superstorm\nBefore we came out to Florida we paid a visit to Stevens sofa in America is professor at the University of Edinburgh he told us that is exactly what he plans to do and he began by working out how much colder he'd need to make the sea to have an effect\n... every engineering
