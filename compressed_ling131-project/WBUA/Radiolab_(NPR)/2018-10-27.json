Boston's NPR News station\nHey Jenny here before we start today Schwartzman what you know that this episode contains descriptions of violence and sexual violence and it is probably not suitable for young children so if you've got young children in the room or if you're not feeling up for it just\nBe warned\n[noise]\nListening to radio lab\nRadio prominently Wu and why he [noise]\nThree two one hey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today\nWe have a legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal case this case\nIt's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away it it gets under your skin this is Lisa learning I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbia school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenda pharaoh who brought us this story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten ...\nYeah it it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSure Jim Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist one newspaper guy for the post aren't glimpse Bob's he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the Adirondacks which is where they started again so Saturday Night July twenty eight Nineteen Seventy three for young people age of Eighteen to twenty three three men and a woman\nGo camping in the outer on ducks pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty they made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM\nCampers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they thought was his middle aged man peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen uh of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook them into the woods near brook\nIn pairs of two with him behind them and the kids of course we're scared out of their wits he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had each them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun Adam and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied he went back to the first boy\nEighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids were spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled voice\nGet really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing doubly ski with his back and I\nUsed to have been five times in a chair\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a\nDitch next to him to kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the dead chapter then our men come men that the other two camps are the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted then the killer and Freeman\nLaying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly Cooley walked into the forest and nuts began what\nWas it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road is you can see\nWhen the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by our there was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down on manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of\nThe woods they eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and that comes back with an ID A thirty seven year old Robert Guerra Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape served seven years\nNow armed with a thirty thirty rifle a knife\nThe story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday\nOh well one of the doors are large people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast that I'm aware that last night and the day before that they left their town saw last barbecue smoldering they left\nBehind coolers so as a man has dragged on what happened was Guerra was able to use those camps in that food and those drinks to survive day after day the man hawk it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follow her lead that he had stolen a car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named Hillary ... spotted\nDarrow these ... or drop your gun something of that fact and Guerra started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but that you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\n\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with him there and the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk\nAnd it's at this point that the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor at least ... is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording this other guy at the center of this conflict was a man named\nFrank our money frankly each arm\nBrenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or money that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use our money but it is or money\nA couple of months ago producer Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money's now in his eighties he's retired\n[noise] my name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well we're just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go fights like standing up for the little gun and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defendants you're fighting the state and ...\nAnd he was doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert Guerra\nNo life you're strong enough to take your mo you need to forty five and a or juice had that feeling this guy is dangers in love with things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the men and Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things one one\n[noise] schoolteacher heads of cells to his child he was sued the school and I took the mother but none of them will\nBe actually I wrote about that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then\n... ... from ... some younger kids\nTwo very young girls age ten eleven Darrow was released on bail he skipped this court date and just disappeared and then we pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ninth the night Guerra got captured Frank gets a call from Gary his wife\nThere about thirty minutes bells you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nThen we went up to the back door [noise]\nTook of driving the lady friends car to try to lose any ... tales\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here this\nMeasure as far as we walk up to this old abandoned mine\n[noise]\nI went out there last February with reporter Lauren that chemistry and the town of supervisors Mariah\nTom's 'cause the father says it's a ... a road that goes to the mine is or what is your after their minds [noise] it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road is is a\nTrail of her own or you're just very icy that day this hair is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly feet or know leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Serious skeletal walk\nAnd this is the only way they could've came in here soon so\nHere we are in our Sunday suits and every goes trudging to force looking for the case\n[noise]\nSpent hours looking around [noise]\nAnd then [noise]\nWe found this ... well\nYou see the air ... fair they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for that says get any such little yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight did he takes out\nAnd then those you held my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see her sneak the shoe simply sneaker [noise]\nAnd and a leg I said to myself this son of a bitch does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of here who my backup\nReally\nAnd truly algae down the other body at least ... body she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her put our money wasn't there went down the founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls ... yeah that's played that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just care we joke you know to keep the confidence is over ...\nUnder the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up and even if they have hired detectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there's no if the if if people are already dead than you do the lawyers ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs it to play this part of a system in which you're the one\nWho stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for the client\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client\nOnly only the agent a plant or also a citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a ... year building on on the side of hope just tell\nTell of course yes and I knew Mr hawk from bowling who's who's do other daughter my daughter were in the same class and I knew him from ... June\nOne used to be in them or not\nThe ANC was she was the parents of the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\nSo now this [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder\n[noise] we'll be right back\n[noise]\nThis is from the from Arlington, Texas radio a lot of support it in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology and the modern Ron Maher from ... uh WWW dot ... dot O.

I'm Robert Krulwich who's radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral and when we left it there were where they were stuck right they do they knew this thing and he was a client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of two girls and a no\nBrainer what is it what what's their next move well so they decided to put the burden plea bargain that take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange they want you to give me a better deal for my clients\nTo get Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison Oso right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give her Lulu and you're going to take a little\nWell that's kind of gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargains then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again they called a meeting with Henry McKay investigator from the state police\nDetective McCabe and the district attorney armies office and when they met arming rebel gee search the briefcase was up to be a an investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause they're paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some sort of bug and then a Dell gee presents the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies\nI Want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off the president and the prosecutor apparently very quickly put two and two together and immediately thought\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility and there were about four hundred people in the room most of them layers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that I don't\nGo with you here or just was a lawyer to do this job\n... ... I was a good lawyer\nCipher through art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money in Belgium did a good body is case taught in schools across the country everybody teaches the case it's like a touchstone what people think what if what if what if you will face\nSo I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham what just stand\nUp um I agree um his duty is to his client she represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen sitting in on these classes and and talking to law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely is because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this\nStory I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she initially didn't want to go\nOn the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record okay All right yeah\nSo I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and okay\nOkay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan ... mother\n... was a girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing washing camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulging found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it seems that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality\nAnd so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any dealings with also about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct uh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things\nIn an ethical class is totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they're trying to defend but what about the victim and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing\nWe flew immediately and and went to the police station and dog when we were there sitting with the police men\nThey received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's my daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nAnd in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact even went so far as to contact a psychic\nThat's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli\nA lawyer maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of horror\nAnd [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway just to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um\nWhen they approach this as it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is\nTo side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it and so I guess that's why I was hoping\nTo talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate some of that experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate in words I made forty years later and skills I I ... and it showed a struggle to discuss this because it'll never go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of um stuff I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know\nIf you don't have to but\nWell\nWhat can I say she was she did receive her degree past few months later we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University\nToo difficult for us and Danny what's your boyfriend had been just that summer and get a full scholarship Herbert any uh graduated just before and\nSo to and I'm sure the other two children get great future I hadn't been true and\nIt's just a horrible tragedy [laughter]\n[noise] oh\n[noise]\nIt's a horrible you know to be in a position\nTo live [laughter] I mean how do you really lose your your daughter you know what what excuses for protecting the person that killed her no justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it but that's the way it is [noise]\n\nI'm going to get just a minute of silence I tear if that's okay\nUm [noise]\n\n\n\nI can hear the echoes of dogs on the mountain things tend to travel up the [noise] the hill kind of bounce around um water I think it's deeper down in there dripping I Can't tell where it's drifting everything up here it's frozen solid so what that is\n[noise] um I think I'm going to turn background [laughter]",
