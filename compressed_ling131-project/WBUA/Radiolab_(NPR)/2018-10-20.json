[noise]\nAnd [noise]\nListening to radio lab\nRadio from the middle of you and why\nAm jet up I'm Ron I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can stay and\nAnd uh in the spirit of the bleep we should say this episode a contains some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have that concern because this is a story about censorship and about the pressures that lead you to say no don't say that we have to say that what don't we ask you and so that tension exists throughout this show so\nAnd here on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping so we must what we've done is is on the radio yeah so she's got kids with a you may want to mention went on it yeah anyway\nThe story comes to us from producers Simon ... so let's start can we start in two thousand eight ... how about what the song yes please check\n[laughter]\n\nSo ah December twenty seventh eighth sunny Saturday morning ah this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto and are singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nFacebook and [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is on a few dozen women and babies\nThat right there\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie Miller\nAnd what what are you calling me and I'm the same\nNursing has been like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would uploads those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up all of it is [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n[noise] now\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small peaceful\nProtest will turn out to be\nThis morning a face off on Facebook and one of\nThe opening shots Facebook triggered hordes knows even what would become a loud but Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEOs boxer day playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech\nViolence against roe kingdom muscle what we can say and what we can't say that again they bonded like on the subject of what we can\nSee and what we can see it led Mueller right kids around on the\nThe Internet\n\nAnd Mr\nSacrifice I got to give you some jackets laid prioritize or sensors beach\nRe congresswoman we don't ... the\nGlobal for doing of censoring speech but there are types\nOf what what what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion\nOf us can say on Facebook the digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAn diet in bullet points and it's been statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written in can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into the rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test ... so ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all\n[laughter] 'cause you know building right behind those protesting mothers there was the Google Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch you just\nSo I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employee ... [noise]\nSo at the time when I joined them there was a\nSmall group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind\nThis was in the early to thousands seismic changes this week and the Internet hierarchy and this was like the deep dark path my space\nDot com is now the most visited website in the U.S\nThey smoke had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each of them in front of their own computer\nAnd things would come up onto their screen flagged her to Facebook and\nI'm like meaning like Iowa user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly\nLike a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate chronic she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason why someone had reported\nBecause it was like a photo of a golden retriever and\nPeople are just annoying and Everytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it out and at the time if you didn't know what to do you turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who'd been around nine months longer than you and ask\nWhat do I do at this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you where are you both would know and you'd Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach was there any sort of written standard or any common standard or what kind of they had a set of community standards that they're at the end of the day they were just kind of that one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one page long\nAnd basically all of this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it out until\nRise up fight for the rights that breath\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically\nEnough through Facebook so to coincide with the live protest they just ... you know taped up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse and two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and it caught on social networking website is under fire for any pollinate on photos of women threatened leading their sheltering twelve thousand members participated and the media request started pouring in a\nBad thing is not I did hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine in New York Times Washington\nPost so the Internet is a trusting of Dr phil [noise] it was a media storm and eventually perhaps\nAs a result of our group in our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nFor example by then nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just said no nudity and so the site integrity team that does twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nI'm going\nOf it we found out pretty quickly none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting leaving me happening\nA lot about the good work advice [laughter] so now I Am I thirty somebody's you know I'm Sorry you're working with\nWe just came out of there [noise] I Know your life in fact\nMost people wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an NDA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to talk to me do you want to be named or do you now where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather that that is totally fine you know I just landed history I don't want to move up here\nTo explain that she and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they work for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nLike a ... about ... watch blind\nFacebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which if your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I signed up to monitor Jessica Lynch has just given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that that's going to have I I tell you after so\nThis guy I talked to she he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones [laughter]\nIgnored ... he\nJust I just like okay what do you live I Will just every day I was just ... and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case he\nSaid basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\nWell if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just like the ... ah it's too I ... I actually heard a\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things\nHas exploited shows you know get squashed by attack to kick okay just ... like\n[noise] they're heroes girl having sex with in a way it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up and not as you did this\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up at night uh he'd\nCatch himself thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat were there were specific like it is but I couldn't watch it was ... ... ... S C I F R I was like okay I had to wear exploding like I have to walk away\nAnd I just I have I I it's just it's too real [noise] I I saw that [noise] ah it's it's ...\nThe different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity\nYou see all of the stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they're going around plain cleanup yeah what a job well yeah and and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a Gore or terrorist propaganda\nOr they're getting better automate that they had the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of of the terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it for anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a\nMoving on to our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they're having an incredibly hard time or not just automating even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out of there will be laughter really there will be comedians there will be a joke to me is hey All right okay so we take a break and come right back and I think we should [noise]\nHi this is Jenny calling from ... radio lab is supported by transfer wise and online service that less people send and receive money internationally and therefore they listed countless customers hold and convert multiple currencies anytime more a transfer wise dot com and\nCame back from a Hindi now making lot interpreted by targeting presenting future at hot hot ... change makers and the project I kept getting in communities nationwide theater and high level on ... and found [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] this is W.

you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty Thirteen strike\nAin't gonna let Rhonda Marilyn nice but it's All right well if my aunt had him to get up thank you I mean how can break we have some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so

all the debris and one of his legs is completely blown off\nAnd the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then sort of skin and muscle and tendons it's it's ... ... meanwhile\nSays Feehery a studio on the other side of the country the next five me I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees are clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news ... and\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published online\nAnd it wasn't long after that\nSomeone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly\nSort of going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this images reading like wildfire across their platform is it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context so they got their team together sat down in the conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like\nShould we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down your however have to ... says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy\nEssentially just photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately receives push back\nWell I was saying that what we pride ourselves on was not making those calls in there are exceptions\nThere is either or their mistakes were improvement\nWe made the guidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots\nBack oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking a down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff that in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally clear they decide to take the photo down um before they can pull the lever\nWords start making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... sat down in order we were essentially told\nMake the exception ... why\nDon't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes so I mean yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher ... but they don't\nMaybe they have but there's major news judgments\nA news organization yeah and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrapbook\nFor us all or is it a public square where you should\nBe able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now and news organization transparency let\nMe let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get the one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook\nIs and this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this was a\nView us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you responsible for your conscience which makes them a publisher and\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products basically\nSoccer burg and others that the company are arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization that could change but setting that aside\nWhat what what really strikes me about all of this is if you're you have a company that really\nUh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective as possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than what people find interesting were important what what people find newsworthy he'll give and I'll give you an I'll give you a great example of this\nOr that happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera\nAnd then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head back and slices her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times like just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like\nOne person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young\nMy name is Shannon young I Am a freelance radio reporter I've been living here in Mexico for for many years now and", "show_name":
