Boston's NPR News station\nBefore we start today's episode will be much do you know this broadcast contains tape that describe violent events some there was some profane language that we'd be but uh there's descriptions that may not be suitable for young children or sensitive listeners so please be forewarned weight you can\n[noise]\nRadio from W. N. Y. [noise]\n\nHey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today\nWe're going to start this show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times\nWe've had on the show before than say something high [laughter] [laughter] okay I think it's good All right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning yeah start getting health what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson and\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed\nWhen that became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again and the press how many people do if they killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch fire some\nIrrigation Harris than Dumbo John become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trending one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nYeah the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself in the police department it does on the local level however it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know because most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports so the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right\nTo ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented Brazil burst study had Florida is a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country\nAnd Florida has wonderful public records laws and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... then sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida ...\nThree hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for this involves a year of work\nHow many police departments getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThing\nThen put together the most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of flu show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah\nHow many how many accidents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages I have a stack of\nPaper that's I'm about as tall as me six feet tall we've got an broken\nDown by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B county Booker aton going and beach uh all the way through\nThe alphabet and you basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers and by the costs and in ...\nAs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent a eight hundred and thirty one\nShootings I Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and and six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scraped each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team\nDidn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those poets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions lessens some solutions didn't\nAll went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from my website radio lab that Oregon highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line\nHe says if you look at the numbers what\nYou see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it\nSeem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category\nAnd he says you know what you see like on the most basic level are are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking aghast at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence of the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they hold suicide by cops would you were somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a\nWeapon so it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to incite the shooting sides right this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThe news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto frontline dealing with mental illness in this country [noise] but when it got to Ben central question what do the number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are\nBlack and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nYou what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nDoesn't tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for the same demographics and this was that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent\nYou know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixteen numbers themselves don't really get you very foreign percent six kind of person he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the proper yeah\nYou ... I mean [noise] I mean what's what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to where\nWe were in why we want to start this natural gas bill just moved by the single case a vigil cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nYou know I mean they're all written in this ah\nClaiming investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler receive a call and this is the Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife at apartment to fight it off every one of these every report says at least one human life someone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nSo we have on this table that the investigation the death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nPeople to [noise]\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nMatt guilty and then traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one of those stories and if you're interested after this episode you can head to our website radiolab dot org\nWe say in the ... the club that nobody really wants to be a part\nFamily more than just\nAnd go after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the mom built on their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this after every every event or a no no just wanted to know the ones that are on the air and has been telling everyone about them\nThis de ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nThough no we didn't know anything about this but big in this must be part of the different types of learning as part of just ... right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way is a personal\nGathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I Hope or here's how I deal with my grief\nYou can either get the um the largest age at their Lincoln was talking to two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a like a like\nStage comes around you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then uh they went from the gym shop over to Christel House\nJust [noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room were drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin where the kitchen cooking chicken\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories you stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\nThe night before they'd all gone out dancing together in\n\nThe summer when a fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel room again this is talk of Clinton's we start to stay over it and that's how\nWe sleep in each other head on the couch you know um air mattresses it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the corn asleep for up talking you know getting to know each other you know some are the children with like therapy for\nVicki is let me ask but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me\nI Believe we're at ... ... to\nMinutes when crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like about twelve people out in about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass\nSo we usually the video that is really\nMom's house probably over like right now and then the police caught attained behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in and\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we called excuse me in a vegetable garden has to the garden was here in\nAnd all that\nThat I Am then 'cause um when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and take the stuff we came back at all you can smell what's going on\nAnd so now like when you have any like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions and you get that smell like it just you get those flat ... times it just\nBrings you right back here mhm\nYep [noise] and the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute [noise]\n\nGoes I just tried to get ... some of the other one that started crying [noise]\n\nAnd then you don't want me to uh take some yeah my find to be a lot of what about the phone to me\nA couple of women enemy their phones man\n[noise]\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree do run\nThen we all started walking back to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing\nAnd you know [noise] they\nI mean we we haven't been I have\nIt was up to the very same we've run out last week\nAnd I threw a clock in the morning\nWhat I remember at the end I used to tell you how do you live so far away from him\nOh my gosh that was that was\n\nI visit home I have to go there all the time of horror game yeah no more it's how could you not\nThen I Know like you want to go take a chair and sit there yeah and it's crazy because like if a ... it's a cemetery like a little bit further out mhm and it's crazy you know about is like a certain time every day and it's just a little white man in his chair\nHe literally I think he does he liked to have lunch with every day\nI mean I Love the way I like going on in all of that in a little white guy that always did not know\nYou take a chance I get home\nSo that your Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nOr you can even be feel with the mother Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nChewed on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother\nWatched as my daughter was loaded into the\nInterns around this time of the few these women started call themselves the mothers movement [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in D. C. [noise]\n\n\nIt was weird because in this short amount of time [noise]\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really kind of felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and down the cop with a gun a man with a knife in them\nAnd to look at the razor thin life or death moment between them and\nThey're getting a game so stay with us [noise]\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation enhance the public understanding of science and technology in the modern world more information about Sloan at W.

drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming I mean you're\nLucky you didn't just shot I wanted to your best shot and I think I Want to die if you want to die you can die\nHe tells the officer was um Jesus Christ and they want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nA fan of our counseling on T.\nV. to pick him up walk them over to the squad car with a man\nIn the UN's ...\nSaid this is the thing that you guys will use this video for\nWhat it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used timing distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans in the current judge that when you have to resort to deadly force right away to use verbal commands first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important to their guys partner was holding a gun have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek isn't just a\nBlack man shirtless with a knife in his hand when\nThere is no connection there there's a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in the face listen I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of or a poor\nI always want to deal with this thing [noise]\nNext year after we finish watching a video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nOn biking through the neighborhood if you miss it on the front step waves of hatred what I meant that dared does stupid set up a bit you don't have close came to be in that wouldn't be backwards medication he wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now [noise]\nKnow again I almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the winners ... just leave his house militias will share like shit would was elected sheriff of Linn\nCounty [noise] I Am\nFriendly time which is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a ... organization called her which decrease executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition of police chiefs and it twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after ... put out those principles to the biggest pleasing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police\nAnd the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against these guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between you and your patients but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago huh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have I have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and that sort of stuff that same way too but\n[noise] there was this experience than I had read realized\nHow far [noise]\nHope has to go\n\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to\nThis is Ryan pursing calling from stover
