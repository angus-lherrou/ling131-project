study that face more than anyone\nUp at my work that was supposed to serve me we didn't really know how many expressions of face could make and there was nothing like a musical notation for the face\nOh about Thirty years ago he began by examining his own face very closely to see how many muscles are in there there are roughly fifty then he spent the next couple of decades trying to figure out how many ways those muscles can combine to form of ...\nHigh developed tropical official actually encouraging system\nBasically a muscular scoring system or you could apply to photograph film

reason that we're talking about him here in our on line\nBeing paid these days to finding lines by using fancy brain scanners ... minutes kind of on a crusade to remind us that you don't have to do that you don't have to look in the rain because the brain is actually directly connected to the face in ways that we can't control\nAll of these muscles are activated involuntarily when an emotion and

in your brain your brain knows it you say it\nNo problem but your brain has to work harder to generate the line there is an effort and with that there is always leakage even in an instantaneous moments sometimes\nYou even hear it were a person's breathing pattern will change or the size that people do and what particular time that they do a you're not trained to look at it most people ignore

[noise]\nCheapest traumatize\nThe whole experience he compared to an earthquake [noise] have you ever been an earthquake no never well one of the things that happens is that there's these aftershocks after the earthquake and there for a little while after the earthquake you're not sure\nThat when you put your foot down the ground is still going to be in the same place as it was a minute ago there were days\nI can tell you there were days when it was significant to hear anybody say anything of any consequences there was just\nYou know to say\nI have a carton of milk in my refrigerator that expires on September ... and that was true\nWas it didn't say the Denver nineteenth or September fifteenth potential temper Seventeen to other\nPeople crying on the phone talking to me about the situation and they were victims six seven years ago people are embarrassed they're embarrassed and then they become mad\nYou know that's when they become detective [laughter]\nMake lousy practice\nWhere are you know front of her mother's house in a bad neighborhood in New Orleans sort of around midnight what's your name and her mom Marcia Valentine and why are you there exactly I kind of gotten a little obsessed with how he got upset\nNo idea I just having taken a semi\nImagining how she was doing all this so\nWas like really fun to imagine but maybe also happens Leslie too but like once I started looking I was able to find a lot of victims a lot of information and I wanted to meet her [noise]\nMarcia Valentine [noise]\nTheir number on here ... we're going to the library of what you read every but we're\nHoping back there okay next right with ... what did you know about hope at this point well I knew that she had had a daughter\nReally know anybody who\nYou know not choose\nThe timing was all wrong and I had located the father well I'm standing outside of hooks mothers how shares through clockwork ...\nUp against ...\nNext morning I went out to find a woman named\nRuby ruby moon I live in New Orleans Louisiana Rubio's a coffee shop I live down the street from hopes mother the one who came to New Orleans um her mother you know introduced a ruby has a kid who's about to pay me it just hopes daughter and they go to Montessori together\nAnd when Rudy opened her shop a year ago hope to car pool today she would\nPick them up and when we got home about five thirty six o'clock we'd all eat dinner together and she would spend the night sometimes and quite\nFrankly I enjoyed having help around the weeks later the cop show up to a raft hope she printed a check on her home computer with a made up account number divide twelve thousand dollar used her\nHere you are you really like this woman your kids love her and you can't believe it you don't believe it and I wanted to stand by her I wanted to help her you know and she hadn't screwed me over she hadn't done anything to me so\nMaybe she's\nTurning around that well then ...\nMy husband find that she's taken a credit card off the show that he put away because the credit card with max 'bout and she'd been buying gasoline and paying her phone bill one of the much it was like two hundred and fifty dollars it really wasn't much and my husband was like\nYou know inconsistencies big ones and then the hundred and eight books that she ... she found a pathological liar twelve actually twelve twelve out of a hundred and they'd say of where are they pathological ours and then it depends on how you defined I Would hope that she found twelve people that you want to look at further she said to them\nWould you be willing to come on a purely voluntary basis into the lab\nAnd ah let me scan your brain [laughter]\nJust another day or two ...\nBasically put people in the scanner and then we scan their brain\nDidn't everyone's ... all one hundred and eight of participants the liar than the non liars no one knew which group there and ... and she was looking at a particular part of their brains just behind therefore it called\nThe ... corps tax and this is the part of the brain that part of the nation is where the real thinking at making decisions and Lawrence judgment for example\nIf you knew him into that place just behind your forehead [noise]\nYou'll see to kind of brain tissue you've got\nGray matter and then you've got white matter I've heard him gray matter yes well we think of the brands being gray but actually to to think that is great white the great stuff and kind of think of it was like the computer processor part yeah these little clumps of neurons to process information\n[noise] computer [noise]\nThat's the great where's the white a white matter it's like the the connections between all these cars on the computer and the way matter in other words is what moves the thoughts around gray is where the\nThinking happens and then why is when you move the thought from here\nTo there exactly yes they transfer in the nation from one end to the ... because\nThey've got your grave that you're white what y'all lean thought she would see when she looked into the brains of people who ... I found\nOut we would see a reduction\nSome piece of it not they're missing something physically she thought she would find less gray stuff most of the thinking why would why would\nWhy 'cause that's what you've seen in other mental disorders that are kind of like this and if you think about it in a really simplistic level the graves where do you think your thoughts and it's also among other things where you crunch your moral calculations and liars she's going to have trouble in this department some maybe they have less great\nThat was okay but when she got the pictures that what you saw was such a great increase in\nMore not that great more white matter\nWhite stuff a lot more twenty five cents a quarter\nTo twenty five twenty five percent more connections in their head the non liars yes before we get to what that means what were you thinking when you saw this\nI was really bubbling I thought this was this was something something something\nSomething shoe here's your idea so far ready if she thinks that these extra connections play a crucial role in a kind of in the ...\nYeah it's coming up with a story on the fly let me give you an example you're leaving work you're\n... you're young and annoying but nice co worker corners you oh hey Sallie cornered you in the elevator hey asks you out you know I've been meaning to ask you you may want to go out with me on friday\nSo there you are questions dangling in the air tomorrow\nSo for most of us right at that moment inside her head and our brains were thinking\nThat he's saying is if you have any idea why why why it was all the\nThings I think he has just been reaching out into the void trying to form a connection with some ideas that can help you come up with some excuse I can say I'm you know I can say well don't show [noise]\nAnd really what you need to do at this moment is you take a bunch of disparate thoughts on different sides of your brain like um need night cheese dentist and connecting altogether\nFrom the central reflect that book okay we can all do it given enough time but for the pathological liar she thinks that because they have so many more of these connections to begin with [noise] they get their faster\nAt night and ... ... I have to pass a young guy ... he make them more connection very beekeeping and then the ... during the speed of the hottest thing you can jump from one idea do not there and you can come up with more on random stories\nShe thinks the brains of most of us we have trouble making those connections we have would you have trouble as I said you like do you want to come out you know friday night would you not be able to come up with a ... I Would say um yeah I Am\nI have to drive to count straws to assert searching struck county we always we have about three hundred and sixteenth stress so far and ah I'm only I'm only doing ones with with um with the little red circles on them so that's there's you know sorry\n[laughter] I don't know I just happened there you go see you've got you've got extra white men or perhaps\nSo she's saying this is a cause of lying or ineffective lie like\nWell she's not sure and this is a big debate in which he can say is that children as they grow from eight to eight ten here is a big jump in the white\nMatter oh and that's it and see the same age that they give up the skill to lie or\nAmong the\nClub for me to have you given everything we've just talked about how do you square this\nInformation with being a new mom I mean is this your first get yes it's my first one a boy or girl again oh what's her name as Sally doesn't it make you wonder a little bit about Zoe and what's what's going on inside her\nHead Oh yes I Wonder about that all the times it's still too early to scan her brain but eventually I Will do and are you serious yeah\nThis is a moral to this never if you're a little baby have a social psychiatrist as a mother who to the very very dangerous thing anyway if she does is maybe one a little bit more about the nature nurture of liars but until then\nThis is radio lab will be back in a moment in your brain\nFrom Boston University this Ninety nine W.
