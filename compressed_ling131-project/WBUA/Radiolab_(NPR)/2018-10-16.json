Boston's NPR News station where you're\n[noise]\nListening to radio lab\nRadio from W and why he [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] it's\nTime now to practice some very useful phrase I don't see them first you repeat I remembered together let's forget\nThis is radio lab today translation it's time to begin we'll have five experiments in translation trance creation\nLesson number one ... oh we're by my mother got cut off the people you know you try [noise]\nHi there Hi Doug yes ooh boy so uh this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug\nDoug Hoffman a professor of cognitive science Indiana University Bloomington\nUh you may know him as the guy who wrote ... Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen eighty nine we actually got interested in and uh things are pretty startling levy\nBecause of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking a French literature class one day I came across this poem\nA tiny little bump it kind of sat right in the middle of the page\nLike a long stint sausage is there to fall off you know three\nPer line it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute\nLeon memorize that are still not by heart\nDiplomas basically a get well card written by this guy Clement LRO who was opposed nearly Fifteen hundred at the court of queen\nAnd he wrote the palm for uh just queens daughter she was seven or eight and he'd gotten sick the flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and I thought it was very sweet could you said in France let's just here at first\nYeah okay it's called a union done was that in my lab to a sick demos ... so to speak ... of the young lady money none\nOf us who doesn't look born through new ... ... ... ...\n... feet onto the top ... to ... to ... to ... a pill to hog on boom for ... to ... I mean\nLike I didn't have gotten so many checks and you were I was really ...\nThe opposite I was I was a widow [noise]\nOkay so you read suppose files it away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years he publishes his first [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decides to have it translates into the number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home popped into his mind and I said there's a challenge what is it what is the challenge ... what I meant was to say well\nHere's the thing he says you've got this phone mommy none of them doesn't loom from if you just focus on the words that basically just this guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you said being sick like president ... I went on to wish you to open your doors get out into the world ... get out of bed\nEat some jam coffee too so you don't look so pale out and you lose your plump shaped ... or ... like get better here's your good health ... to ... million\nBut just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the ...\nThe tone the light hearted nuts and and this is key for Doug ... also known as the bones form it's wonderfully catchy little suffered shape when the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know a BBC CD\nAnd uh the first line mom union is identical to the last line I mean you know to sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems in order to Vermont oh and I did I say three syllables per allow you to know how yeah or it's three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work in a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this um you know along the way even began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem\nFor example vast sea onto the top ... like this land that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here\nInstead of hurting blood in bed instead\nOf burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of looking in your instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their instead of squirming in your head of slurping sloppy and instead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue and bad on and on\nAnd I came up with you want me to read my ... my sweet dear I sent cheer all the best\nYou're forced rest is like jail so don't ale very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban you were a for my sake\nButtered bread while embed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise health be near my sweet dear\nSo claim on now Douglas yeah Clinton all became Douglas and I I like the ones on jam became read the hotter the bread and butter butter ... yeah well I just figure jam and jelly\nThey are words but the words represent concept and the concept to have a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly\nTalking about bread and things that you spread it on oh her just some people like just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it ducked sent them home to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named\nFrench [laughter] and I said hey Bob and you do it and uh\nFirst friend let me and my embrace quit this place\nIt's dark halls and bank\nIn soft they'll regain health dress and fleet off with me Clement who calls for very different in tone and really quite marvelous you\nGot the uh he'll face in there you got the gym Clements name in the middle\nBut at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient\nWhich you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but Doug says you know there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and when he ate was eight\nSacrosanct number so that's just two lines though no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a than a message that is the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was the form that's what made the things funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nail the form he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet treat one regard motives hard your colleagues friends\nChicken D. I. decree of find day even got his wife to do one or two away from\nYour cage and engage in brave flight so you might flee the group that was all burnt themed hope you scoop into ham apple jam and French brings you go running around from town to town saying hey I got a bone everybody want either related and\nI Am a person of binges this began a been she might say\nAnd that they ended up becoming a seven hundred page book filled with translations of this pump\nGo ahead and read out of the best one now this has been that right right no that's not the best one of this or that one on the opposite okay here we are OK okay this is also went to his but like the twentieth when he did ...\n... feet gal so sweet hug from some dumb bug drag you down the fact that friends feel the urge bugs

government and this was serious policy thank you all very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seems to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I don't like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me if not being serious\nWe put it in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding to carry on this uh this film oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards [noise]\nCan you pronounce your name for me [noise]\nMy name is ... he's a young guy in his twenties he's an independent journalist yeah I used to work in different newspapers and um [noise]\nI was like you know when you when you listen what happened there and I felt like a kind of cultural a guide me\nIs that Americans think serious

I just got the shooter which will know you try\nThis one a Robert Krulwich and our producer and we'll talk to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin and why is George Carlin mentioned\nOaks because Carlin is wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language is not about the comedians of\nMeeting yeah [noise] and the next thing is about the English language it's about little expressions we use we we all saying the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time I was just one of his great subject really seemed to examine these expressions and all the more interesting\nTo see was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he thought from schooling and one of GOP next\nFavorite curling or some I really like just went to his about how Carlin hated euphemism\nI don't like worse than hide the truth I don't like where's the conceal reality I don't like euphemisms\nMuslims because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality it carling was wonderful about things like that was about both the call him you know\nPeople in this country norm are all people we shift them all away and we brought in these\nSenior citizen [noise]\nIs heading subsidize\nThe reason we use you as I've just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through the same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nWe just what your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely ill means he's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs to the hill\nPass out before he died and so and so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is full what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise\nBut Karlan is real point was that it it might Dole's our\nReactions to it that actually have like I have a negative fat and it gets worse with every generation and he has his whole bet is about um shell shock becoming PATS too you\nKnow he goes so goes it's been four different things in the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... language to settle those shell shocked and then it became battles for the battle for the fourth of those now takes a little longer to say doesn't seem to hurt as much and then after it became battle fatigue then it became operational exhaust [noise]\nHey we're up to age syllables now then it became post traumatic stress disorder [noise] still a syllabus but we've added a hyphen and then it became peachy as the post traumatic stress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon\nThis was the Orwell notion that you could erase sensitivities if you bland it out the words so if you stop saying oh yeah we just tortured the guy if you say\nSome for some interrogation or enhanced interrogation that makes a big difference in part of a curling saying it's just like now that is PTO Steve we're not having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its\nWalking down the street it's told me that usually\nYou know now that she's blind when she's walking down the streets of New York city especially at a town\nTo get people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nI yeah I hardly ever
