[noise]\nViolence against roe single muscle what we can say in what we can't say\nThat again by this on the subject about what we can see and what we can see it led Mueller right kids in front of me\nThe air\n\nMr\nSack of arc I got to ask you do you subjectively prioritize or sensors beach\nResort and we don't really think about what we're doing of censoring speech but there are types of ... what what really grabbed me was\nWas discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all\nTo point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and diet in bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like what are these rules\nHow were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly\nAnd so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really put it to the test ... so ah let's start back a on that morning two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all [laughter]\n'cause you know building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room\nTrying to figure out what to do I'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just\nRead so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nIn now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought into read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so\nAt the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind\nThis is nearly two thousands seismic changes this week in the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path my space dot com is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of\nTen million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each\nOf them in front of their own computer and things would come up onto their screen flagged at Facebook and I'm like meaning like Iowa user saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate clinic she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then [noise] that content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying was either naked people\n[noise] things that there was no clear reason why someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and\nEverytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it out and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and ask what do I do at this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you where are you both wouldn't know and you'd Google some things\nThat really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any Senate written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that was one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one ... and basically all this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breastfeeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it out until [laughter]\nRise up fight for the rights that Brett\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized ironically enough through Facebook\nSo to coincide with alive protest they just you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nTo the title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and it caught on the social\nNetworking website is under fire for any pollinate on photos of women right leading their children down in twelve thousand members participated and the media requests started pouring in a bad thing is not the guy did\nHundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine New York times Washington\nPost so the Internet is an interesting Dr phil [noise]\nIt was a media storm and eventually perhaps as a result of our group in our efforts Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules\nSo for example by then nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just said no nudity and so the site integrity team that those twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nI'm kind of\nA general we\nFound out pretty quickly like none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting femi happening\nA lot about the good work if I may put many so now I I started you know sorry you're working with\nI mean like we just came out of there [noise] I Know you're lying in fact\nMost people wouldn't even admit they work for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in like an NBA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to do you want to be named or do you now where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather live\nThat's totally fine you know I was ... a year\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators like him were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements dating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAct are headed for about ...\nWind several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be damned or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers\nAnd the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I signed up to monitor traffic has\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact at ... and a half hour yeah I tell you got your so\nThis guy I talked to she he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year he jumped to his desk every morning put on his headphones [laughter]\nIgnored ... sorry\nCan I just I just I I Will test every day just ... ... which\nFight five thousand a day you just said\nYeah I was like it was a lot of case\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds [noise] wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\nWell if if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThe last ... ... ... that's true at age ...\nCame across unspeakable things\nHad to explain to you know get squashed by attack to you know people will cages ... like\n[noise] Thirteen year old girl having sex with an eight year old boy and it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you did this\nAbsolutely absolutely um it can be up at night uh he'd\nCatch him self thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat they were there were specific like movies and I couldn't watch it was while I was thinking ... ... S C I was like okay I ... I have to walk away\nAnd I just I have I I it's just it's too real [noise] I I saw that ah it's it's a classic case yes to\nA different moderator I spoke to described it as being the worst side of humanity you see all of\nThis stuff that you and I\nDon't have to see because they are going around playing cleanup yeah what a job well yeah and and it's worth noting that are more and more this work is being done in an automated fashion particularly with content like a door or terrorist propaganda\nA ... they're getting better automate that they ... the uh through computer vision they're able to detect hallmarks of of other terrorists video or of a gory image and uh with terrorist propaganda they now take down Ninety nine percent of it before anyone flags it on Facebook\nBut a\nMoving on to our second story here that there is a type of content that they are that they are having an incredibly hard time or not just automating but even getting their rules straight on and that surrounding hate speech\nOh good more or less that's coming out of there will be laughter really there will be comedians there will be jokes are readers hey All right okay so we take a break and come right back

kind of thing to do with their kids in the room might want to put it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once\nThey're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands of people spread across the globe in ways that are fair and consistent and I would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty thirty strike\nAin't gonna run to Maryland but sorry myself my aunt had him up thank you only have some break we have some breaking

skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific ... meanwhile\nSimilar CBS studio on the other side of the country the next five new I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees are clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news ... and\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo\nPublished on line and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly ... going viral\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is reading like wildfire across their platform and it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context so they got their team together and sat down in the conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like\nShould we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone and so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yup however half the rooms says\nNo the other people are saying this is newsworthy book\nIs actually this photo is being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received pushback\nWhile I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and\nThere are no exceptions there is either or their mistakes were improvements\nWe made the guidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots back\nOh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe is publishing this all over the place and we're taking it down like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of the right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest\nOf the stuff that in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWord starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n... well\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason as the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes so I mean yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher ... but they don't think maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrapbook\nFor us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want\nOr yeah it is it now in news organization transparency\nLet me let me get an I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question that kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when Dr bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a\nView us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and well that's an idea responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and bill ... basically soccer brick and others that the ...\nWas actually why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what what what really strikes me about all of this is if you're you have a company that really\nUh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible and can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting were important what what people find newsworthy he'll give and I'll give you know give you a great example of this or\nThat happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera\nAnd then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head back and slices her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times like just reading my Twitter feed I've been like you know like\nOne person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young\nMy name is Shannon young I Am a freelance radio reporter I've been living here in
