S. than Boston home of Boston's largest radio news route Ninety two point seven W. B. weight his very eighty nine point one WB wage Brewster and streaming W. B. U. R. dot org\nW. B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station\nAnd [noise]\nListening to radio lab\nRadio from nobody you and why [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nVery useful phrase is I don't see them first you repeat I remember in together let's forget\nThis is radio lab today translation\nIt's time to begin\nWe'll have five experiments in translation transportation\nReference number one the best was by my mother who got cut off the people you know you try [noise]\nHi there Hi that Doug yes oh boy so uh this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug\nDoug Hoffman a professor of cognitive science Indiana University Bloomington\nUh you may know him as the guy who wrote ... Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen Seventy nine we actually got interested in and uh things are pretty startling levy because of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking French literature class one day I came across this poem\nA tiny little it kind of sat right in the middle of the page\nLike a long stint sausage vertical off it you know three syllables per line it was super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized that I still not by heart diplomas\nBasically a get well card written by this guy ... who was opposed nearly Fifteen hundred at\nThe court of queen\nAnd he wrote the palm for this queens daughter she was seven or eight and he'd gotten sick the flu or something and this problem we supposed to cheer her up and I thought it was very sweet could you said in ... let's just here at first yeah okay\nIt's called a union done was that in my lab to a sick demos ... so to speak ... of the young lady mommy none of us who\nDoesn't look ... through ... ... ... ... to beat them all ... to\n... to ... to ... to ... ... ... on them for ... to ... I mean you and\nLike I didn't have gotten so many checks and you know I was really ...\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so he reads a poem files it away deep in the corner of his mind fast what about Twenty years he publishes his first book [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decided to have it translates into the number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me under the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and\nAll of a sudden one day that home popped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is that what is the challenge okay what I meant was to\nSet we here's the thing he says he got this power money and you're on a group of done the bulls and if you just focus on the words is basically the just the guy talking to a younger girls saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like president ... piece of I ... wish you to open your doors get out into the world ... get out of bed\nEat some jam goofy too so you don't look so pale about and you lose your plump shaped ... or or you know it's sort of like get better here's to your good health\n... to ... I mean young\nBut just saying those words in English misses the whole\nSpirit of the ... the tone the light hearted mass end and this is key for Doug ... also known as the bones form it's wonderfully catchy little sausage shape when the page the fact that the lines rhyme you know a BBC CD and\nUh the first line mom union is identical to the last line I mean you just sort of has the feel of a ... it has the poets name in the middle of the poems they've known to Vermont oh and I forgot that I say three syllables per lawyer you didn't ... yeah or it's three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work in a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this um you know along the way even began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem\nFor example vast sea onto the tub boost used to like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here instead of\nHurting blood in bed instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in instead of lurking in your instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their instead of squirming in your own vendetta slurping slop in that are burning up in bed instead of turning blue in bed\nYou want me to read my fruits translation please my sweet dear I sent cheer all the best\nYou're forced to rest is like jail so don't ale very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban you are a for my sake\nButtered bread wall embed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best sooner rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas praise help being near my sweet dear\nNo so Clay Moltz now Douglas yeah Clinton all became Douglas and I I like the ones on jam became bread though I ordered the\nBread and butter butter bread yeah well I just figure jam and jelly they are words but the words represent concept and the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread it on her just\nSome people like just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it ducked sent the ... to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named oddly enough\nBob French [laughter] and I said hey Bob and you do it and a Bob Said well give it a try\nFerris friend let me send my embrace quit this place\nIt's dark halls and bank\nIn soft still regain health dress and fleet off with me Clement who calls from very different in tone and really quite marvelous\nYou got the uh he'll face in there you got to Jan Clements name in the middle\nBut at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient\nWhich you could argue well it's an ancient pounds but Doug says you know there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and when he ate was eight sacrosanct number for this just two lines though no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a\nA than a message that is the message was get well which is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was a form that's what made the things funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nail the form he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral students who my sweet I and treat\nOne regard motives hard your colleagues friends chicken D. I. decree a fine day even got his wife to do one daughter away from your cage and engage in brave flight so you might flee\nThe group that was all bird themed hope you scoop into ham apple jam and French bread you go running around from town to town saying hey I got a ... a buddy when either related and if I Am a person of vengeance this began a been she might say\nAnd then ended up becoming a seven hundred page book filled with translations of this pump\nGo ahead and read the best one now this is that right right no that's not the best one it is that one adopted okay can we say OK okay\nThis is also when is but like the twenties when he did\n... ... ... from some dumb bug drag you down that friends feel the urge bugs for from the scourge you'll emerging attract sound advice from the slash clown so smashed who's\nCome you come you who lived to sheets eschew sweet let's choose heart make your heart competing claims mandate sure hope God cures your body had defeat of God [laughter]\nIt's humor yeah\nAlthough not the best he says I I I Do want to get to my mother's translate ads here whereas my mother's was\nSomehow I'm going to have to look it up here where we're from oneself is because of all complicated than [noise] the flu this one\nHere he is the word serious in East Africa and can be translated very much in are you doing something preferably a Lincoln financial transaction right and so what this journalist is saying is you are you just talking\nAbout this or are you doing something maybe threatening Ethiopia who is withdrawing eight are withdrawn just pouring in Kerry says I Am very seriously talking on the\nWay of previously calls for the release of these individuals and that is the policy of our government and it's a serious policy thank you all very very much appreciate it\nAnd it seems to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like look I'm like the most serious politician that's out there I mean I lost the presidential race in two thousand four in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public you know like what are you kidding me not being serious\nWe put it in a number of request to speak to John Kerry or someone in the state department but there was no response\nDo you think he was aware of the misunderstanding who carry the uh the uh the sun and oh yeah no I followed him out afterwards [noise]\nCan you pronounce your name for me [noise]\nName is ... he's a young guy in his twenties\nIn different newspapers and um\nI was like you know when you when you\nListen what happened there and stuff like that some kind of cultural a guide me\nIs that Americans think serious means\nI'm standing here I'm not joking I'm Serious when African space serious and I'm using a generally they say no or you could and not just speak are you\nGoing to do yeah this is as us exactly my point is going to take some actions maybe when you see the youngest son's yeah do you feel that that question put you at risk maybe who knows is that the job description doing good journalism in Egypt at\n[laughter] [noise] make so much think I Would give you any from my numbers on the [noise]\nFor that conversation was about five months ago did you do know what his fate it at all I mean we found out whether did he suffered for this question in any way nobody had his phone number so I can give them a call in and find out\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] and I and many of its Gregory Gregory Warner oh legal the audience I enjoyed\nI and I reached him by Skype you told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people who didn't know telling him that he'd better rethink what he said\nYeah I got to lighten up a gun on together with them and started shooting and that\nThey said you shouldn't line up with the government's priority\nYeah these messages from the government ... it's hard to tell it has been reported that this Ethiopian anti terrorism taskforce will wage social media taxed by getting people to send messages on his behalf ...\n... ... out of the ones that are in these kinds of music\nAnd were they threatening yeah some\nOf them were you know some skiing in the documents the bunch Dakota being the one good thing comes and be like wanting\nA newspaper he founded get shut down after publishing one issue and he was planning for a while to fleet in Nairobi\nMy safety\nLeave his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grab them apply for asylum in the United states\nYou know my mother and my older brother and I ... in your your it's Washington\nOkay Washington like a lot of Ethiopians he's actually got some relatives in in the states did they hear that you asked a question to John Kerry\nYeah yeah yeah yeah ... ... what does your mom say\nShe said please don't do that smoked gouda it might be you know got to get you in like that you know I'm not like they're yeah they're like that yeah\nMm\nSo on\nMy ass on\nOr off to\nPony Mm\nA ...\nEasy\nOn\nRadiolab will continue minimum and I think one of the other phone hey this is Gregory Warner to read the

George Carlin twice George Carlin mentioned\n... biggest Carlin is a wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language\nIs not about the comedian for the comedian yeah [noise]\nThing is about the English language it's about little expressions we use we we all saying the little sayings and expressions that we use all the time is one of his great subject really seemed to examine these expressions\nAnd all the more interesting because he was he didn't even have a high school education you know so he was not something that he thought from schooling and one of\nGOP next favorite curling nurse and I really like just went to his about how Carlin hated euphemism\nI don't like words and hide the truth I don't like words to conceal reality I don't like euphemisms and American English is loaded with euphemisms because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality as Carlin was wonderful about things like that was about both as she calls and we I've known\nPeople in this country no more old people we ship them all away and we brought in these senior citizen [noise]\nHad he was\nThe reason we use the if it's just been through my father in law died four months ago and we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in intensive care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they've been taught\nWe just what your father to be comfortable he's gravely ill is gravely I mean she's dying right and we want him to be comfortable means can we give them enough drugs so that hill\nPass out before he dies and so on\nAnd so it's certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing but no one is fool what we're mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise but\nKarlan Israel point was that it is like Dole's our reactions\nTo it that actually have like I have a negative effect and it gets worse with every generation has a whole bet it's about um shell shock me pie TST no he goes so goes it's in four different things in the first World War that condition was called shell shocked\nThey used to call it shell shocked simple ... direct language two syllables shell shocked and then it became battles for the\nBattle for the for some of those now takes a little longer to say cousin seems to hurt as much and then after became battle fatigue then it became operational exhausted [noise]\nHey we're up to age syllables now then it became post traumatic stress disorder still a syllabus but we added a hyphen and then it became peachy as the post traumatic stress disorder that pain is completely buried under jargon\nThis was the Orwell notion that you could erase sensitivities if you landed out the words so if you stop saying no yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some\nFor some interrogation or enhanced interrogation that makes a big difference in part of a curling saying is that like now that his PATS Steve we are not having the appropriate reaction to it I mean its\nWalking down the street she told me that usually you know now that she's blind when she was walking down the streets of New York city especially uptown\nShe says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her\nI uh [noise] yeah I hardly ever notice other people walking around me I feel\nI can always hear the topic and the sounds of traffic ...\nBut she says when she put the device on and put a sensor undertone [noise] the sidewalk one\nCame alive I thought it was amazing like I didn't know this many people around the street at the same time as they can now they're um they're all there again which you describe them in a way that sounded\nAlmost like a painting like\nReally soft launches everything that sounds nice soft rock is as he\nCan move

[noise] this is a code problem\n... thought okay I Know the DNA is contains four bases ATC and GE and ... days somehow create hundreds of thousands of protein\nSo I just need to think of a of a clever way of [noise] you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA\nThe ACC Gigi ...\n[noise] and then out comes the ... what\nWhat simple toad could I Do to do that and just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy came out to side\nI think that ourselves read our genes three bases at a time\n[noise] like instead of eighty CGI ac ... thought maybe it's a TA season G. P. C. A. A. C. A. G. in\nOther words whatever it was it was reading the DNA and sell maybe it was reading it in triple not care because if you have a sense of three or rather than to game I figured well that give mathematically would give you more possibilities and that might put you on a path making all those hundreds of thousands of proteins yup\nNow this is just a guess but shortly after the double helix duo Watson and Crick\nAnd a group of other scientists worked it all out they they figured out how you get from physically get from DNA into\nProteins yourself works sort of inside the cell the DNA is sitting\nThere more ... more set of molecules come along attached to it and zip it and make a copy of", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "13"}
