Boston's NPR News station it's nine o'clock\nHey Jetta here before we start today shows on what you know that this episode contains descriptions of violence and sexual violence and it is probably not suitable for young children so if you've got young children in the room\nOr if you're not feeling it for it just be warned you [laughter]\n[noise] [noise]\nListening to radio lab\nRadio from there'll be you and why [noise]\nThree two one hey I'm ... I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today\nWe have a legal case well it's actually it's ... it's really more than just a legal case\nThis case it's it's um what my husband and I refer to as a mental magnet once you start thinking about it it won't go away that it gets under your skin this is Lisa learning I'm a law professor at Catholic university\nAt the Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she said I'm not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna pharaoh who brought us this story and under whose skin it also seems to have gotten\nYeah it it just made me\nNot know whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started\nSure Jim Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post ...\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on\nFor him um I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eight Nineteen Seventy three for young people did Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up too tense and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM\nCampers hurts somebody walking outside their their time\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they thought was his middle aged man peering into the tent\nLooked like a conservation officer he had a door with a feather on it sunglasses a rifle yet a butter knife binoculars around his neck\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get\nThe other campers you got all four of them rounded up together and they were kind of standing a semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen ah of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook him into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them with the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some real basically he had he had each of them\nTie themselves you know as he pointed the gun at him and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds [noise] and then they heard filled with voice\nGet really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing ... with his back and I\nHad been five times in a cast\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running neck Fiorello ran to his car Carol\nAnn ... ran through the woods [noise]\nBut the man caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had um lay down in the ditch next to him\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter then our men come men that the other campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted than the killer and treatment\nLaying down in the kitchen when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the manner the gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly Cooley walked into the forest and nuts began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by there was a scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down our manpower into a roving patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifles shotguns bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nThey eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and it comes back with an ID\nA thirty seven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape here seven years\nNow armed with a thirty thirty rifle and nice and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday night when the people got panic when you're all are well one of the doors are large people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't hear that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers says a man has done what happened was Garrett was able to use those camps and that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follow her lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted\nGal said freeze or got big on something of that fact and scare started running\nLow black fired four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm in the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead\nBecause he was just laying there but they you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with them they're really in the whole time because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and\nFor a girl who's gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk and it's at this point that the story that I'm\nInterested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case doesn't law professor Lisa ... is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording the guy at the center of this conflict was a man named Frank Armani\nRank age army\nAnd Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it our money our money [laughter] that's Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use that urban but it is or money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money's now in his eighties he's retired [noise]\nMy name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like what how did this whole story start for you well we'll just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go fight like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for defended you're fighting the state and tear it\nAnd he was doing really well he has well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert De Niro\nYeah life you're strong to take him out you need a forty five and a or juice had that feeling this guy is dangers in love with things are going to happen\nThis is the year before the man Hans Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty small things one one\n[noise] schoolteacher headed self does this child he was sued the school and I talk to murder but none had an automobile accident I represent them on that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got dismissed but then\nBecome ... for ... some younger kids\nTwo very young girls age ten eleven Darrell was released on bail he skipped this court date and just disappeared and then we pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ninth the night Guerra got captured Frank gets a call from girls wife\nThere about thirty minutes bells you talked to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went up to the back door [noise]\nTook of driving the lady friends car to try to lose the tails\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here which may be as far as\nWe walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren McCain street and the town supervisor of Mariah\nTom's 'cause if Ava system a road that goes to the mine is or what does he have to them on it was this sort of hilly area off the side of the road to visit\nTrailed her own or you're just a very icy that day this here is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're walking up a very wooded hills is fairly feet or know leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in your same area that are many and this is the only way they could've came in\nHere soon so here we are in our Sunday suits Ruggles trudging to force looking for the\n[noise]\nYes but of course we're [noise]\nWe're looking for [noise]\nPhones with her friend well\nYou see the airship after they find this air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for this has given me such yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the whole So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft he's got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you hope my feet and left be donors in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nRecruits see or sneak the shoe of blue sneaker\n[noise]\nTo myself this some of which does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of your boom ... backup read\n\nIt in Chile ... found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery where Guerra had said he'd left her but our money wasn't there when the algae founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's let's play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right\nNo you can't you just can't we\nTook you know to keep the confidence was over ...\nUnder the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality ... so you're not supposed to tell anybody except to prevent reasonably certain death or a substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that that is yeah it can be or we'll be right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question or frightened and waking up when even if they have hired detectives and even if a local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there's no if if if people are already dead than you do the lawyers ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role\nIn that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to play the part of a system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates ... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person that fights as hard as they can for their clients\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client\nOnly only the agent of or also a citizen and a member of the ... part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a week you're building on on the side of tell just tell tell\nOf course yes and I knew Mr hawk from ... to ... his ... daughter were in the same class and I knew him from church June\nOne to be in them or not the visual\nBank where she was the parents of the family and yet you have your duty as a lawyer [noise]\nYou're caught between the two more morality [noise]\nSo now does she [noise] coming up that hard spot gets even harder

I was a good lawyer\nResearch sauce art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a\nGood body is case taught in schools across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone what if people think what if what if what if that was so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just stand\nUp [noise] um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen sitting in on these classes and in talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n... you know\nThe from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go\nOn the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and actually\nOkay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan mother\nSusan was the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she was camping with her boyfriend and she's who our money and algae found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really in this story um has to do with the fact that it's that that it's because\nLegal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality and so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask you something to that you knew a lot of schools are teaching and and if you had any dealings with off about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct uh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things\nIn an ethical classes totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes and it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you that I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal thought in their mind is not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes only oh my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and dog when we were there sitting with the police men\nThey received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call it the unease my daughter's boyfriend what his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later\nAnd in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact\nEven went so far as to contact a psychic that's how how important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a total Eli the lawyer\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway [laughter]\nTo try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professors law students there um when they approached this is it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are\nThey're struggling with the pain that I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um let you have a chance to communicate some of that experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate in words I made forty years later and still I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of um south I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of this that you would want people to know you want to share I don't know you don't have to but\nWell what can I say she was she did receive her degree posthumously ah we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University where it was\nToo difficult for us and um and Danny what's her boyfriend had been just that summer and he had a full scholarship Herbert any uh graduated just the year before and\nSo to live and I'm sure the other two children had great future's ahead of them too and it's just a horrible tragedy [laughter]\n[noise]\n[laughter] so horrible ... to be in the ... [laughter]\nHoney relieved [laughter] order you know we're we're ... for protesting the person was killed\nCouldn't justify my mind I don't expect them to accept it but that's the way it is [noise]\n\nI'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's okay [noise]\nUm [noise]\n\n\n\n\nI can hear the echoes of dogs on the mountain things tend to travel up the hill kind of bounce around um water I think it's some deeper down in there dripping I Can't tell whereas stripping everything appears frozen solid so what that is [noise]\nUm but I think I'm going to turn background [laughter]\nI Wish I'd prefer flowers or something", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "30"}
