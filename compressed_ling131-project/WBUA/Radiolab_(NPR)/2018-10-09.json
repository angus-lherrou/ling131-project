Robert Krulwich radiolab and today\nWe're going to start\nThis show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times\nWe've had on the show before and say something high [laughter] [laughter] okay I think it's good All right where we just want to know from you or like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started getting what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson\nIs growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed when I became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again and press how many people do is we killed in the United states about why the police each year how knowing chiefs accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings\nAnd it struck me at the time that like what would we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire\nMe arrive Jason Harris than Dumbo jarring or become sort of a national story\nLike processing now like the number one is there\nA is a trend in one way or the other or police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nYou know the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere within the police department itself in the police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency it and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right\nTo ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented birth birth study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has\nWonderful public records last and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... men sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five years worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting not for this involves a year of work\nHow many police departments getting lawyers involved is is a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThing than\nMen put together the most comprehensive police shooting database that we know for sure that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just them right there to check it out yeah\nHow many how many accidents you think you have sitting on the stuff probably five thousand pages so I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me six feet tall\nWe've got um broken down by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B county book or a Tom boy and beach uh all the way through the alphabet\n... basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across an entire desk\nIs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represents a eight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting in the state of Florida in in in six years time two thousand nine to two thousand fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team [noise]\nDidn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase [noise] all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those ... than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions didn't\nAll went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency to keep track of this stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest sort of counterintuitive a line in this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it\nSeem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like\nOn the most basic level a are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking aghast at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence and the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases the whole suicide by cops would you were somebody who is usually a mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch any behind a screen door and raised as a weapon toward a the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide\nAnd it's like the shooting or is that is right this is something that people will cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThe news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line and dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the number say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a data out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nYou what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nDoesn't tell us much right now but the breakdown between the talent these for their same demographics industries that they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixteen numbers themselves don't really get you very\nForeign percent six kind of ... he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were in why we want to start this man and you ask they'll just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nYou know they're all written in this ah\nDeployment investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call ... ... to Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approached department to fifty five it's confronted by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife a department to five five but every one of these every report is at least one human life someone was either you know [noise] more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nSo we have on this table that the investigation of the death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one\nPeople too\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off been Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might lead\nMatt guilty and then traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one of those stories and if you're interested after this episode you can head to our website radiolab dot org\nSay there's one called that nobody really wants to be a part\nFamily more than just\nRight\nAnd so after the event ended up community center crystal took a bunch of the mom they all got in their cars and drove over to this little gem shop\nJust like you guys do this every every event or you know for no just wanted to know the ones\nHas been telling everyone about them\nThis de ... says her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nSo no we didn't know anything about this but as big as this must be part of the different types of learning as part of just hoping dream right you're right we all just simply trying to find our way is the first of all\nGathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief\nYou can either get the um the largest age as they are going because it was talking to two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a\nLike a like you're saying the\nThen I open my windows and I just knew really goes on in my house she says page comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken now the guy\nWant to get\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories you stories creeks of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\nThe night before they'd all gone out dancing together\n\nThere was some earth wind and fire [noise]\n\n\nAnd now we're redoing instead of getting motel rooms again this is talk of Clinton's we start to stay over eight inches of how we see each other head on the couch you know a metric\nAnd the rest of the secret of talking you know getting to know each other you know some are the children with like therapy for\n... let me ask but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women just really stuck with me\nI Believe we're at ... to\nWhen crystal let some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people out and about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy brash so\nWe usually in a video message we can we just hang\nMy house probably over like right now and then the police caught attained behind them was probably right here and then the officer they they hid 'em came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we call the execution of vegetables are close to the garden was the investigators\nAnd all that but I I Am then 'cause ah when they when they you know when they took him away in released and sit down and take the stuff we came back at all you can smell what's going on\nAnd so now like when you got any like it's it's not it's not as bad now but just the associates Michael went up quite onions and you get that smell like it just you get those flat\n... any brings you right back here mhm yep [noise] and the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute [noise]\n\n'cause I ... some of the other one that started to cry [noise]\n\nThen you don't want me to uh take some yeah my find to be a lot of what about on them in\nA couple of women had to be their phone my ... like this don't do it\n[noise] and and it's\nProbably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face\nThree to one\nAnd then let me\nThree to one\nWe all started walking back to the cars\nCrystal I just want to thank you for just sharing with us for and you know [noise]\nI mean we we haven't been I have\nIt was also in a very famous we saw that last week\nAnd I walk in the morning [noise]\nWhat I remember the end I used to tell you all the time how do you live so far away from him\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nI visit home I have to go there all the time of horror yeah no more it's how could you not\nYou know like you want to go take a chair and sit there yeah and it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out mhm and it's crazy you know about yeah like a certain time every day and it's a little white man in his chair\nAnd everything like that on like he literally I think he does he like go have lunch every day\nDan I'm going to be I don't know if you're in the way I like going on and all of that is a little white guy that always did not do\nYou take his chair I get home\nTrip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nOr you can even read deal with the mother Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nJews on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother I watched as my daughter\nWas loaded into the ...\nIn his around this time of the few these women started\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\n\nIt was weird because in this short amount of time [noise]\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really kind of felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing out but again the cop with a gun a man with a knife down and look at the razor thin life or death moment between them and they're getting a game [noise] so stay with us [noise]\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and hence the public

com\nAnd then she changed central four cups and then\nThey may not if it's not a smart idea to have a knife coming out of the probably\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming I mean you're\nLucky you didn't just shot I wanted to try your best shot and I say if you want to die I Want you want to die you can die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and then when everybody know the police boats can't kill\nA fan of our parents want\nMe to pick them up walk them over to the squad car with a man\nAnd the un huh\nSo this is the thing that you guys were you use this video for what excites warn of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans into court judge that woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nHey hey hey this is important as the guy's partner was holding a gun have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest the communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior\nContact read them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek Derek Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there's no connection there\nIs a lot easier to see somebody as nameless faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to do with this thing ...\n\nActually after we finished watching the video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nUnlike us through the neighborhood that I miss it on the front step waves and ... what are you doing man ... dared doesn't stupid son of a bitch you don't have\nClose to being that wouldn't be backwards medication ... wasn't doing drugs and he was as Whitley as normal as me and you are right now [noise]\nNow again uh almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this this at the moment\nBecause it was just a few months after I left\nWill last say primary election among the winners they told him he just ...\nHis militia valuable Sarah she would was elected sheriff of Linn\nCounty I Am\nIs the county that Daytona Beach belongs to them and the other thing to mention is that a Jupiter belongs his organization called her which decreased executive research forum it's a big coalition of police chief twenty six team\nFor these forests and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after ... put out those principles two of the biggest reason organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police\nAnd the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against these guiding principles basically saying that being the top is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make just feel like reason for hope right and I sort of felt the same way too but\n[noise] there was this experience than I had read realized how far [noise]\nHope has to go\n\nThat's coming up right after this break so stay to\nThis is Ryan ... calling from ... radio lab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation

I'm rubber grow which this is radio ... we had been discussing police violence and raise mostly in Florida we met the mothers who gather from all over the country and we met the police chief in Daytona who who's trying out some different things so I was thinking maybe\nMaybe yeah maybe there's a little bit hopeful yeah it's the feeling we had a but then you realize hoping funny difficult thing um because well we'll let ...\nReporters taken from here we are here to see\n... Tosh Clemens touch among some other Rodney Mitchell okay [noise]\nSo it's actually the woman who you heard earlier I'm back at the community center I've met four hundred other mothers with lots of their children are that's actually when I first met her bed and have been reporting on Natasha for like a couple of years by this point and we were there because Ben was going to hand a ton of documents over ... on her son Romney's case she didn't have any\nAnd I was there because we'd set up a short interview Natasha but when we got your doors [noise]\n\nShe just started sobbing [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter]\n\n[noise]\nThen I just had no idea\n\nBut then she had just turned the tape recorder off what was what was happening in that moment well okay so\nShip would you know I'm like there is a sort of hoping that I I Believe but\nThe thing about a chip ... I'm a share of the police chief is that the only have the power to fire a police officer and that's really about it after that\nIt goes into the court system and so for Natasha I'm her son Ronnie twenty three years old unarmed was shot and killed by two police officers during a traffic stop\nAfter the shooting a judge ruled that the two officers had done nothing wrong they acted in accordance with the law and it just so happened that forty five minutes before\nThen and I showed up at her door she just got an email from her lawyers saying that the appeal that she'd filed against that decision I had just been rejected and so we sat there in the ... department for a while we actually\nEven left for like an hour eventually came\nBack [noise] kinda just hit reset on the whole thing [noise]\nMuch of the ... long dreads he's got a big smile\nBig smile right white smiling and we sat down at her kitchen table um\nOkay so uh if you can walk me back to the night that kind of everything everything happened [noise]\nShown eleventh two thousand twelve Natasha was at home nine thirty at night Rodney who is twenty three years old was a back from college you know driving a car and that's when all the phone call started happening people calling saying something going on with your car I knew something was wrong\nSo I immediately started screaming outside to see if I could get somebody to you know response that helped me so I can get a ride nobody came came out I started running down the interstate barefoot which is less I don't even recall walk in the door or anything like that", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radiolab (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "09"}
