right now there are a lot of jobs\nThis week the Labor Department reported more than seven million openings nationwide with just over six million people unemployed the rate of job openings is pretty high right now it's the fifth month in a row that there have been more available jobs than jobless people now high unemployment is obviously bad\nBut super low unemployment presents its own problem\nHow to recruit people into jobs that need filling\nWhat's it like being an employer right now are you able to hire the help you need maybe you're looking for work do you feel like you have a lot of choices if the job market is so competitive\nWhy aren't we seeing wages grow faster\nLet's begin with a view from here in New Hampshire joining us in Studio at New Hampshire public radio is Dan ... a welder who's been living and working here in the Granite State for more than Twenty years he's the owner of ... construction services Dan welcome to want to\nSay also with us is ... the

welder you run your own business give us a sense of what you deal with on a regular basis just trying to find enough people to get your workload done\nBut it's hard I'm One of the biggest reasons there's just no qualified welders out there any more um a lot of aged out in the education system really hasn't put enough a time into its a vacation trades anymore\nGive me a sense of what you got to do so you've got a job and you don't have quite enough people what kind of hoops you have to jump through to try to find people are you like making phone calls all day or knocking on doors like what's your day look like\nUsually the first thing that I Do is I go to my existing employees and say do you have anybody that you know of that may be looking for work and and sometimes that works out and sometimes it doesn't so then you know you have to\nYou know put the word out there that you're hiring and you're hiring basically in practice and you're going to be teaching on the job [noise] really slows down the progress that that you can make\nAnd uh you know it's it's it's a challenge for for any employer no matter what trade there in to um you know be starting ground up every time I\nWas

donate to this NPR station\n\nIs one a I'm Joshua Johnson we're discussing the job market and the difficulties in getting America's job openings filled with regional economist Russ T. Bo of applied economic research here in New Hampshire before we keep going and introduce our next guests I just want to kind of add a yes and he meant to what then you'll you just said\nThere is no shame and getting a career that doesn't require a college degree not and we did a show last year\nA four year degree about how to get into some of these skilled trades\nThat requires some training or an apprenticeship but that don't require a four year bachelor's degree one of our guests are Nicholas when Louis Wyman who was the c._e._o. of the Institute for workplace skills and innovation wrote a book called the job you\nAnd he put a question to answer on our website about what an apprenticeship is how does an apprenticeship work once you do you consider taking one where do you go to find one you'll find all this information on our site a program called how to earn six figures without a four year degree\nOn line at the one at a dot for that's the word ... the number one the letter a dot org\nBefore we bring in our next two guests Russ one more thing about the job market here and you mentioned\nThat New Hampshire has an aging population affordable housing is a challenge New Hampshire is one of many states has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic how does all of this show up in in the job market is it just an aging job market or or does it manifest in other ways and that well I think the main\nThing that is that what she right now is sort of the lagging wage growth in the state than it is kind of a deterrent to bringing more people into the labor force attracting more people to the state our wage growth has been around two two and a half percent a year for sort of lagging there's prosperous economy that we hear so much about\nI think one of the quips that I recall a woman said yeah we have a great job market in New Hampshire I should know I have three jobs and I need three jobs do you get by\nSo I think that that's a that's sort of the main stumbling block right now we're beginning to see a little bit of labor force growth as I said we've added sixty five thousand jobs in this state since the down turn kind of reversed course and started becoming an improvement but we've only added Seventeen thousand workers so that they're in lies to crunch\nLet it get to some more of your comments about what you're experiencing where you live with work especially in skilled trades\nSean emailed I work in the steel mill and union and management have been complaining about the lack of quality candidates were even taking mc Donald's employees if they will come in a big issue is drug testing half our potential potential candidates don't come in for an interview after hearing that we randomly drug test\nJulian tweeted ... jobs are no consequences if they don't pay a living wage all the jobs I see what ... my education and pay a third of what his manageable\nLet's try to zoom out a little bit more and talk about what's happening not only here in New Hampshire but also nationwide joining us from our home base in Washington is Ryan none policy director of the Hamilton Project and the fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution Ryan welcome to want to thank you for having me on\nAlso here with this is Christine car the executive director for the New Hampshire career and technical educators association Christine welcome\nThank you Ryan can you give us the big national snapshot of what's happening across the country right now in terms of the labor market we know what the national picture is we've talked about New Hampshire are most states doing OK really struggling what does it look like on a more granular level\nSure what I think that it's important to start from a long term perspective to understand where we are now ah and I think it can be summarized with the idea that the labor market is not always linking workers with economic opportunity I start by saying that productivity growth overall has been unusually low since the mid to thousands wage growth has also been quite weak\nOr and then there's also tremendous variation in wage levels across the country it's not always easy for workers to access jobs in those high wage places are at the health project we've released a paper recently that describes\nHow over the last forty years geographic mobility has plummeted in those geographic imbalances who's wage differences I just mentioned have tended to persist over time and the struggling areas in this country are not generally catching up with the prosperous places\nWe asked members of our one a tax club for their input one person wrote it wrote us at aged Seventy one I was shocked to be hired I Am a retired attorney working as a state employee Ryan do we officially qualify now as being in a a labor shortage capital L capital as labor shortage\nI actually have a different perspective on this or that and there's an example I like the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage\nAnd I think the same logic applies to the labor market fit in recent years we just aren't seeing broad signs of extreme labor scarcity in the national data or that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers\nAnd we just haven't observe that overall real wage growth after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins I for example a wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy and I'd also say that wages are growing at roughly similar rates\nIn the Pacific states but ah but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all say that that we're not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth\nI just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page and someone who worked for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can say wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nMichelle emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car I Wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised there's we're at the national minimum wage thousands travel to Massachusetts daily were the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you're dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor into structurally\n[noise] well I don't have any empirical data why so many uh employees are working in national traveling there that I Know when I Lived there that they played over half a million or caters everyday into the city and out and many of those they coming from New Hampshire so you know\nWages is one aspect of it but they're Fisher is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focus on how they can get the people that we as into the jobs that are out there\nWhen he sees the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nThat you know I I feel like you know my point of view is\nSort of a wider industry perspective and the sense that at work in technology for the last ten years and coming to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high end um occupation such as automotive construction manufacturing\nThere just seems to be shortages across every single sector whether it's factoring or in high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about\nThe nature of what we've described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed\nTo all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge salary\nJan in Manchester New Hampshire emailed I Know several educated and qualified older women who lost their jobs here in Manchester they've been out of work for at least six months I've overheard conversations at my local local supermarket from older employees losing hours to sixteen year olds\nAges them is a big problem ... how do you see this that the impact of of older workers especially in in high tech careers especially in like Silicon Valley it's becoming worrisome at this point where if you're old we just decided we don't want you yeah\nI think that's that here in New Hampshire it's kind of like a to a degree that's less of a problem than it may be in Silicon valley for example because if you don't\nHire and retain older workers of chances are you're not going to get any workers because our our states as I said our median age is the second highest in the country so\nIf you donate your old car to WVU are it'll have a

... and Ryan ... let me get to a few more of your comments before we\nBring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled workers Chris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility in for manufacturing HR director slashed production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics\nI Am calling BS manufacturing in the U.S has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties\nThey want to experience people at relatively low wages right off the street if you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and we're out in supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months and we're really\nTurn over where there are chasing higher wages and and new facilities that new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nFrom what we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent has definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nSo easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with is\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade job shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your ... your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to them their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there\nThere's a city in Nebraska that'll max signing bonuses for newcomers to the tune of five thousand dollars Vermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAnd accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt that plan was the idea of Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to what I\nThink's Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nYeah the ... award program that we lost and then ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship business models on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarship to talk about and doing that but at its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model\nAnd instead of investing heavily in a Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we flip it around and we said we will pay you significantly upon completion of some kind of degree but only if you return to our region to live and work and it's really our home home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair county to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county pay me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America a lot of friends community along the shores of Lake Huron in St Clair river um our largest town of course here on as a population of about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region\nA thirty percent of our workforce leaves are counting heads down in metro Detroit to to be employed but they love the small town life or the family friendly environment amenities our small town America Josh\nI was just gonna ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside of Detroit is that right\n[noise] yeah and you were talking about something earlier jobs I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged\nOn the economic held the regents park here on er Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true health\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people get their pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it here earlier than than hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come on program\nWas once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was ... the government business any other sector\nWe realized that we all had to get together play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan it had to be an organic planned that drove our prosperity\nSo Randy told me how to come home award words suppose I'm from saint Clair county and I moved to Chicago for work and now I'm considering coming back and how does that work\nChicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live in this region maybe completed college six years ago\nAnd you're still living in Chicago but you met someone you met a party the medicine if other you're you're weighing the option of staying in Chicago which is a great place to live or you want to come back home settled down started family spend more time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region\nOr you're eligible for Fifteen thousand dollar award if you're selected we give\nTo establish a permanent residency or they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up\nAnd then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as a carrot to keep you here and it's really simple back in scholarship ... pay the loan older directly which in every case for us it than the federal government\nSo I Do so you you pay it out a little bit overtime so by over time by the time the two years or up\nSinclair county voted this program to come home award will have put in Fifteen thousand dollars towards one's dead I'm guessing it's like where there'd be three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars like every six months or so and it adds up to Fifteen thousand overtime\nThat's exactly Joshua and the goal you know I'm is to really give young people actually young they could be in their twenties or thirties or forties\nI'm the chance to go two or three years without making that nationally I Know you see data says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt I don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we've received our average editor eighty thousand dollars\n... that's that's a crippling amount of debt that's preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was\nCaught it was it was the most awful form of financial slavery I can possibly imagine and yeah definitely like that's a whole other our where I Will I Will rebel you with my tearful story of dealing with Sally Mae before I I Know rusty but wants to jump in but before he does Randy I just want to\nAsk you about some of the perception issues that we discussed with regards to New Hampshire there's this ... there is evidence that young people are moving to a bigger cities in in large numbers\nYou've talked a lot about this feels kind of small town America New Hampshire specifically conquered for sure definitely feels like small town America do you think there's this misperception about smaller communities that young people are getting I haven't seen the TV show\nThat kind of glorified young people in a small town since dawson's creek I mean you don't see it much anymore do do you think you know people are just getting the wrong idea about living and working in smaller parts of the country that we're all just kind of dazzled by the big city\nYou know that's that's a great point I was when I speak around the country about this program in this effort uptown attraction there is a complete misperception that young people don't want to move to a small town America I'm One of the biggest impacts of this program in dispelling that met\nNo I'm not saying ten thousand young people a year one of the small town America New Hampshire or this\nPart of Michigan but we've already had far more applications where this program that we can possibly find\nOur region needs to realize there is a is a growing interest in coming to a small town America they just happened to be out of our line of sight right for people in my age so it's really just telling them in New Hampshire has a lot to offer and there are young people that will will back home we have to be open the how do we make that
