I I Do a lot of interviews and nobody ever asked me that type appreciate that [laughter] I'm good I think that like I'm a I'm a happy about being around the people I knew before the protests and people that I Know really well I got to see my sister the other day in in ... grade and her two kids so\nCalled the new favorite book of W the orange proud does any part of your other festivals\nNeed to get me the lie down or slapped them\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Americans for the arts committed to transforming America's communities through the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts industry which employs four point six million people nationwide learn more at Americans for the arts dot org\nAnd from the Alfred P Sloan Foundation bridging science and the arts by supporting the history of scientific theory misused in the eugenics crusade premiering October sixteenth on PBS more at Sloan dot org\nFishes won a I'm Joshua Johnson we are speaking to dream of catching the host of the podcast pod saved the people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope\nOne by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching was the most important thing you ever did how did teaching helped lay the groundwork for activism\nHuh you know it's funny I don't think of myself as very old but I taught a decade\nUh like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild [noise] ah\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because it was urgent everyday like every single day I had to show up as I taught sixth grade math every single day to show up and I was math to my students I had to be as prepared and I taught sixteen Ninety a hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lotta math for anybody who's ever been around eleven year old\nI what I learned there are a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that are can be consumed and could be repeated back so much skill was like what I learned was not only how to like get kids to understand like with an equation one but like I did teach discreet skill like you know what you think touch it sometimes means multiplication right that like\nTo how to take apart these big things to make them bite size and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they could put them back and rearrange on their on their own\nOr the second was like really understanding what it means to like do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impacts so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative numbers they struggle they like they can get it like anything lower than zero that like I don't get it\nBy the end they can fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it and that was like understanding like the arc of how to build capacity and like I learned that the third thing is that we think about the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got there\nAnd that like I work is to help students understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone with the worse teachers do is walk in the classrooms and\nMake people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that is I think in such a corollary to organizing that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community that like what I'm trying to do is help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know they might not believe they might not know how to use them\nAnd what I can do is help them find them and they use them long after we're gone\nLet's let's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct\nTV with his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people know the names of the three black women who actually started ... I think Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nYeah certainly they got the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book that\nI you know for those of us who are industry in Ferguson we're mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protest there was no one to three people who caught us all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nUh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we were the she for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which is unfortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that as a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized every body the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true so when I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nThat I'm awful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom with out you wouldn't there would be no protests are so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exists for me that\nUh one of the important things about having a platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president in every room but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people how to spread across the country like you've never heard those names are in in the book I Try and write about those people to you that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small for the people who like started every thing and the movement or that there's a small set of organization\nTo like what a catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders have become more prominent\nWith the concern about but who profits off to cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast is a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nYes it's interesting I think I'm always shut you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the the way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end emily's seep in a portion of all the pre order sales went to the end up ... cp legal defense and that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book right so like that's I think about the books\nI'm full of ... when we started campaign zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Thirteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of research for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is\nNot a lot of money and the grand scheme of nonprofits and we did it so that we could just raise enough money to do the work that we that was important right so we created the first I was a database of police union contracts at first it public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really disagree projects [noise]\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not pay salary from the stuff so\nWe try to do it as like with just the bare necessities so that it's not just a question of like profit\nUh in with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton to be a part of it they get paid as a part of the ... I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some you know huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to\nRely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well\nAnd you know it's like I ... at the way that I could just in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not my state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I Do have you know it's like a ... that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like it was a really rough um it was rough\nAnd only it's only a couple of months ago was the first time I've actually lived alone since the protests I've ever since you've been staying in the basement of a like my second parents up in the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not a ... you know wants to get married in the in the basement up there right second parents that's not that's a famous I\nSay it but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like there are these narratives of like oh I made it gets ill in dollars and it's like well now you see me on the news you came in a pod cast you like see me out of an event that that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case that I've had high incomes and before you know that they their income and wealth it's pretty significant right oh\nI'm so people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one eight text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and the free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another text club or who wrote\nAs time goes on society will bring about necessary reform but to denigrate and disregard the entire police force as an institution is ludicrous what do you think\nHe I think you know I think for for\n... years we slit people's resting call their health care we literally drained people's blind down and we were like where it's going to drain out all the impurities and people were like oh they their blood pressure they change it's like no they didn't have any blood right that that actually isn't a solution but we did it for two thousand years it was one of the most popular medical procedures\nBut it didn't work so if the goal was if the people who live and it's like actually wasn't a good thing or if the goal was to like pretend that you were doing good doing like this is an excellent and I think about policing it's like if the goal is to stop crime or like to do any of that work like it just isn't whether how no matter how you feel about the police that just isn't happening so\nThose efforts don't show up in pools but could affect the results\nThat Don point tomorrow from tend to noon and again it's seven and nine\nPoint nine to ... you are Austin's NPR News ...\nSupport for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from the Charles Stuart ... foundation supporting efforts to promote adjusts equitable and sustainable society and it's home town of Flint, Michigan and communities around the world more at Mount dot org\nFrom the Epstein Family Foundation in support of the David Gilkey ... amount of memorial fund established to support NPR's international journalists their coverage and their commitment to providing the news of the world to audiences back home\nAnd from Americans for the arts\nBack now to our conversation was during the catch in his new memoir is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope let's talk about some of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short section in the book it's like a page and a half\nWere you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write quote I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remembered joy and triumphs\nWhen we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves and cope with trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote talk about how those kinds of\nTraumatic or difficult experiences as a kid kind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward activity\nYou know it's interesting the first time saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she tests\nWas I hate to re read the book we should talk [noise]\nAnd I just haven't had been done with the right back at so hopefully I write back soon\nIs one of the reasons why I wrote this happened in the ... I can remember and now with that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we named him one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she can leave and it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had that sort of work within an grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and that's important as we think about what it means to organize has had like we're all walking into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are as we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nCore part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember a joy\nIs that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race or or any other aspect of their identity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we added a family and I knew would pass woman not to ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know a lot of people talk about growing up poor but not said one of the hard part is like when we grow up\nAnd sometimes we still only see a world of can strengthen the constraints becomes so great and the way that we learn how to survive that we can start to imagine things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like you didn't know that they're seeing the right and the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe that you've never seen a world where every woman has the right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories that actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good story to tell her about a future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you enter the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times that are rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you call the client quiet about the sole but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never seen any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons are important for me to be out and very very um [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very sort of overt way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gave to think that the only way to do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and\nAh you know that chapter started from the street that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it was a real like I was in the quiet and not the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room and the gay black man and like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collective with social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about a mile an identity\nNow I wrote about the uh the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just they and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed to say that this happened and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally told a couple of years later they realized that he had actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me\nI'm so like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is I like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that I had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we're up here and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right [laughter] so I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlets actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my own air career if not all of my career but I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute\nWhere it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian or gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does gay things\nAnd that changes the conception do you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my identity\nLike I think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that they're not two ways to be gate and like\nThere's a lot of pride parade is really really low grade they're like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nThat I don't talk about the issues is publicly as possible and like you know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life dry leaves that unlike other people can feel like it's real re so like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now they're trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people when people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of the results but that\nAh that they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns in a nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cause and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like what privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I've I don't feel like I Need to talk about the every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right so the other thing I'll say that there's some people who I can really homophobic but like me and that's how for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your ...\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quotes\nThere were calls from within the protests community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling the a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding your way forward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so any way you are part of a media so to speak\nAnd reconciling with tons of the social justice activism word that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were you\nKnow it's like a both and the rate that like you know it's interesting is that all those people who who companies to offer for quote participating in the system those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell everybody to vote who tell people not to vote in twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who said that politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in the Washington Post and people literally there were like you're wasting your employees I Can't believe you did that like president doesn't have any bearing this is just for show and it's like\nNobody is saying that now that is a ... that was a while the ... the then it's while Disney today so I think that people got a I it's unfortunate that like people getting it took all of the chaos that this the president continues to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "12"}
