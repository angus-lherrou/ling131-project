where in about legislative trends at the state level\nNext month in the midterms four states have ballot initiatives that would change how they draw voting districts instead of lawmakers drawing their own lines independent redistricting commissions would take over Twenty one states already have these commissions\nDistrict's more competitive critics say it's too much power to give an elected officials\nJoining us to discuss it is read Wilson national correspondent for the hill read welcome back to want to say hey Joshua also with us is David daily a senior fellow at a fair vote a nonprofit focused on electoral reform\nDavid is also the author of an upcoming book about redistricting called the rising David welcome thanks from event and joining us from WBUR GV you public radio in Grand Rapids Michigan is Katie face the\nShe's the founder and executive director of voters not politicians which is based in Grand Rapids Haiti thanks for joining us glad to be a Katie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform\nI Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you\nIf you just explain what we mean when we talk about redistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the descending all senses\nAre the census really starts the whole process of the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives\nThe states the official number of\nUh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get\nIs a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state's all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know there are four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington he'll method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well uh but then that those the the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAnd that's how we figure out that ah say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state\nSo this happens every ten years and then every ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways or some legislatures have challenged\nAh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power from other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various quirks here and there\nAre and the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows\nPretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate a in a crazy ways in ways that where the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power\nUm and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we're going to see thrown around a lot of in this next redistricting\nYeah North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five\nCompetitive swing states of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress of both parties to Washington\nExcept the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington\nThe Democrats have only been successful in flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb state and the special election in two thousand Seventeen\nSo when the two thousand twelve to fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states you also see this as well as the state legislative level so you have all of these states\nThat are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that Democrats may often when\nA chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority in in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override\nThe actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme ... insulate members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom bill that you know wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation um and it also discourages competition in a lot of the states and North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went\nWithout a major party competitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their districts here because folks\nTook a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments was well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of you are fans of the show no one of our audience as hot as hot as topics including with Michael wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an actor for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap\nThat's all the same in North Carolina Laura by the way we did a program a while back in February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we wanted to see if you could tell the difference between the map of gerrymandered district\nAnd the ink blot on a Rorschach test you can find that quiz if you search the words gerrymandering G. E. R. R. Y. M. A. N. D. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find that on our website the one a dot org\nKatie let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative that got started after you were trying to find some way to be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\nYeah um I accidentally started a political move met with a Facebook post um it was after that when he's sixteen election uh before\nI'm headed to a Thanksgiving dinner and I had heard my friends and family really are being drawn to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders on what these messages about draining the swamp and the political revolution and\nI realized that you know there's a lot of frustration against the current system in place which makes a lot of sense I remember learning about\nGerrymandering and it does make it so that our voices aren't heard or that popular a proposals aren't being passed at the local level and we're lucky in Michigan where we have the citizen lead ballot initiative process which means if we can write constitutional language\nAs the people of Michigan and then gather a this last down three hundred and Fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty four registered Michigan voters signatures\nThen we can have the people and the general election vote 'em ... directly on a constitutional amendment and\nIf you donate your old car to WVU are it'll have a new life supporting the news and you could get a tax deduction so when it's time to go to W.

rising and read Wilson national correspondent\nFor the hill a couple of you wrote us to respond to lower his message about Pennsylvania's redrawn maps not being in place for this year's election mark writes that the new Pennsylvania congressional maps are effective this election cycle Steve writes the state Supreme Court had to intervene to get us fair districts\nSomewhere so badly gerrymandered districts formed pictures\nLook at the old seventh congressional district\nThankfully the new districts are enforced for twenty eight team\nIn some of them say that the seventh congressional district in Pennsylvania looks like goofy and Donald Duck facing one another seriously if Google it\nSpeaking of which Maurice tweeted gerrymandering has transcended the political realm and infiltrated the fashion world he sent us a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com\nThis is they say gerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of\nVoting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana six Florida force Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each put the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states we got a lot of comments read about\nThe role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current maps it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIs that fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know well the Virginia example\nHe's talking about the house of delegates and how the Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen\nThe waiver Janine elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but then there's a difference between the state legislative districts which is sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the ... no party is blameless in this\nUh gerrymandering started we get the word\nFrom a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts uh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal at members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those still existed today\nA is to win all the districts around it\nUh the a newspaper down in in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic\nHum you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know five hundred BC\nUh but when we talked about today yeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south that were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland uh there's one district or out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes both parties do this Republicans have done it\nA more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about\nA fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that these lines may not be fair right but the people who who cry fairness tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils\nIf you will we do get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the G O P is going nuts in Colorado over ballot
