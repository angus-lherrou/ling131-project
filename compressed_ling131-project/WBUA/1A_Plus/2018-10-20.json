New Hampshire public radio in Concord we often have to change the friday news roundup hours before the program heirs to account for breaking news today was no difference with a story we figured we'd better include especially considering where we are\nSporting goods store started selling Red Sox commemorative shirts almost as soon as Boston beat the defending champion Astros Houston lost its bid to return to the world series after the red Sox won last night four to one\nNow maybe you were a fan of none of these teams\nBut considering how serious the midterms are you can't that grudge folks for wanting a bit of a break from the news we will get to this week's big stories though including the elections in New Hampshire and nationwide the continuing recovery effort after hurricane Michael an alarming new projections for the U.S deficit\nConsidering how big all those stories are is it any wonder we started with the run for the pennant\nJoining us here in New Hampshire Public radio is a senior political correspondent Josh Rogers Josh welcome to win a good to be her back in our Washington studios Alexander Jaffe a correspondent for vice news tonight on HBO Alexandra welcome back things adding and Franco or don't yes as a White House correspondent for McClatchy Franco good to have you with us great to be here\nLet's begin with politics in the run up to the midterms starting in Montana where President Trump campaigned last night and she made some comments that seem to praise violence against journalists he was speaking to a crowd of supporters when the president cheered Montana representative Gregg\nGM's forte for assaulting a reporter back in may here's what the president said\nThat your body slammed my [noise]\nLike\nThe president went on to say that he had initially worried that the assault would tank G and forties campaign but said he remembered quote vicious Montana it might help him and it did unquote\nRepresentative GM's Ford's he pled guilty to a misdemeanor assault last year after body slamming Ben Jacobs a reporter for the guardian a judge sentenced him to a hundred and eighty days deferred sentence forty hours of community service twenty hours of anger management and to find a three hundred dollars\nNow Frank or don't is I Wonder if I could start with you the president's comments come as his administration deals with what is increasingly looking like the murder the gruesome murder of ... the columnist from the Washington Post\nThe president has a history of trash talking depressed to put it mildly\nCheering on somebody body slamming a reporter typically would say that's over the line but it's not really out of character for this president is\nNow it's not at all and and and it is putting it mildly mildly um you know this is this is unfortunately a strategy a political strategy of the president I mean we spoke to Corey Lewandowski I'm One of his lead campaign guys during the campaign who told us that look\nWill

friday news round up with New Hampshire public radio senior political correspondent Josh Rogers\nFranco or don't yes White House correspondent for McClatchy and Alexandra Jaffe a correspondent for vice news tonight on HBO Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him\nThis DNA results you showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comments this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in some of these arguments that's what fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could help Republicans on sort of succeed in the midterms\nAnd it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be the best tactic but we'll see how things play out\nIt's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandra saying look this is what happened to two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio J uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook him out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and that's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff\nJosh we'll do it the way in which um you know the parochial entity like in your head for Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections are founded telling the gifts that they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know our presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been you know stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael ... an Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen him and typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've ... the people who've drawn the most attention of and the people who've cast themselves as Trump antagonist and\nUh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you the that's been good for them so you know the the midterms of up here lose their favorite both sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was in antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again this week he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight and ... came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at one point Franco or ... ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\nUm you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been the most fascinating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know try not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lions had um attacking them about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for work\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you\nKnow there's a lot of hope for better or some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexander I was going to ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nIran as a progressive Democrat like a war has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle it'll\nMean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the mid term typically you\nKnow not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which on election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think an undercover aspect of this race is the fact that Texas does traits\nRepublican Party over all the strength as Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running you know against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties and seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if that are over ark has been able to keep them to single digits\nI just wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... and says Republican and it automatically counts that vote dressed county for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically don't for every Republican all at once and this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that uh it won't be as easy\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they were on Monday and the results\nLooked pretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of ... Democrats or dominating fundraising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers outraged Ninety two Republican incumbents more than six the Democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars that corner\nIn the Senate Democrats are also outrage and Republicans bits of Iraq raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in\nHouse races also glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas Karen tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday night's rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatality spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nYeah there are still people missing there's still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think\nThe town and Mexico beach is not reported given any numbers um of how many people are are missing a but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this\nWas a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms out of the top three or perhaps by some accounts that you know had made landfall that would make it bigger than Katrina\nThis has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still don't have a phone service um and people are expecting asked film is sewn services restored and more roads are clear it and you're able to get more to people that they're expecting the death toll to continue to rise\nWhen Alexander the other big issues when people can actually start\nTo rebuild I mean it's it's fascinating and terrifying horrifying at the same time to look at some of the early drained camera pictures from where hurricane Michael came ashore from where it made landfall\nYou can almost tell which homes were built up to the latest building codes and which ones were not because of homes that were up to codes were there\nIn the homes that weren't were gone and I wonder what points the the ... the rebuilding effort is right now is there any effort is there any expectation on when people could start to rebuild\nAnd I was actually in North Carolina for the previous hurricane there and they were saying you know anywhere from six to twelve to twenty four months people would still be in shelters waiting to rebuild and that was just flooding\nAnd I'm president of the United states and I'm not going to eat anymore\nBroccoli met this week on hidden brain from NPR tomorrow night at nine

news roundup with Josh Rogers Alexandra Jaffe and frankly or don't is Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire the race in district one\nWill be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress\nHis Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen right\nTrading him of party departed from two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's retiring I'm In ... ad where did you have people who are\nRunning really within the mainstream of their parties are pappas has been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he says family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester often a stop for presidential candidate\nHer which is a town the where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters\nUm Eddie Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time led the states are enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh I was a fairly big job he a random enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they were pretty much keeping to well within the norms of their party Eddie Edwards is you know embrace Donald Trump the every Giuliani up here campaigning with them [noise]\nUm and he's in some ways tried to cash Chris Pappas as you know part of some sort of resistance movement does this thing we've obviously she nationally or you know Chris Pappas is hardly a radical guy or you know family I'm Ron restaurant ah worked I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um\nAnd uh this race though is one where the seat can go either way and ah both parties believe they have a shock\nWas also a gubernatorial race underway feared the Republican governor governor Christian new new\nFaces Democrat Molly Kelly she is one of the Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number the latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that tallied the Democrat has outraged Sununu the incumbent Republican\nThree to one uh ... brand of New York seem to conquered on yesterday's it helped campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave if I'm interested in aware of this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened with your ... listen\nIt's going to help families happier and healthier it's going to help people will be more productive at work\nAnd so it's a win win\nGet everywhere I go in that state I hear about the need for a family medical leave and how important it is to be able to have the ...\nIn their life to be able to work hard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they love the most when they're needed to know\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator Gillibrand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave the issue of big one for her based on her political background her personal background will\nIt's been a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test me she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue\nUm it's a challenge to somebody covering their first how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling that suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue he was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it\nAt the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction imagine to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\nUm the Democrats believe this is an issue that works for Mali Kelly by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who worked her way through college and that you know ... new new sort of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get at New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy uh\nUh you know boom times for people to the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections\nAre up but you know the wage growth for people to lower end of the scale\nIs not in great and this is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race well\nI'm ... you know Sunni should win or we have to your terms here no governor's been tossed after one term\nUh since two thousand four and prior to that it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those\nEr here polling indicates it's a new news about by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers and Molly has outrageous person in his three to one and the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch of this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he will freely admit he doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only got he's got four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand no interest groups will will add to that are in terms of advertising but\nThis is a race that Democrats feel they have a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture weights and they think that Molly Kelly a buy dinner background but it'd be a woman is somebody who president that's engineered to kind of ride away\nOf nationally known names Frank or don't yes I Wonder what your senses of senator Gillibrand making the trip to help Mali Kelly is their speculation about her\nSpeculation about her future and twenty twenty um I think how much is a kind of resonate is is the big question I mean obviously a there's so many names being kicked around uh right now or that you know if I think time will tell but there there's no question that killed rented one of the people that\nThat people are talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move\nOr that she makes on is being picked apart um you know analyze a and looking for it how it could mean and how it could uh what impact that could have on twenty twenty\nLesser discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because of the Treasury Department revealed this week but the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred and sixty six billion\nThis week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars it's a six year high end projection say it is on track by the end of this decade to hit a trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars\nNow Alexander some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly the tax bill part of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts\nIs it by cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest with more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out\nSo far ... well we haven't seen that yet certainly an advantage Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out though\nAt this rate although the economy is booming there's ... there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point on it was sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around was welfare reform\nUm to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill\nI'm that obviously won't move forward until after the midterms but there is conversation about to get you know starting to work on\nA welfare reform bill that would cut some public benefits um like Medicare that kind of thing and and so going forward you know it's interesting they care to see Republicans silence on this issue when they were previously the party of deficits\nBut it's also an opportunity for them politically to push another priority of the Republican Party which again is welfare reform\nYeah I'm Glad you mentioned that because Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blamed the rising deficit on public assistance programs in an interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday what's going on with\nThat it's very disturbing and it's it's driven by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid\nThat Seventy percent of what we spend every year the subject we were just discussing the funding other
