covers intelligence and national security for the Washington Post good to have you back saying Hi from afar Joshua\nLet's begin with the weather which made big news this week you know it's been more than fifty years since the United states had a storm like hurricane Michael\nFlorida's panhandle bore the brunt of the damage that's where it made landfall many beachfront homes are in pieces some of them in splinters at best\nAnd the number of water rescues are under way more than a million power customers in Florida Georgia the Carolinas and Virginia are disconnected and the death toll has risen to at least Thirteen people\nThe administrator of FEMA Brock Long spoke to CNN's John Berman on new day what's the biggest challenge you and your teams are facing this morning\nWhile access you know access to all the area that is one thing a search and rescue is where we are hyper focus this morning [noise] ah but as that uh you know simultaneously what we're trying to do is assessed roadways and bridges to make sure that we can get his hands commodities and equipment and so the areas that were hardest hit\nA hospital system not near Panama City in and around Panama City took a hit too so we we have to stabilize or the Cape and health and medical capability that are there\nAre over thirty thousand workers from around the United states that have been pre stage to try to work as quickly as possible to get the power back on but here again it's all about access we got to get make sure that it's safe to travel down roadway quarters and get in there to uh start rebuilding the power grid which could take a a very long time at this point\nIt's FEMA administrator Brock Long speaking on CNN he also expressed some frustration with Floridians who did not mind the updates to the building codes which updated in two thousand one pretty clear to see which homes were up to code and which were not you can tell which homes were up to code because they were still standing when Michael is gone\nTodd's we'll talk about the kind of pressure that FEMA is under with this recovery effort especially considering that these kinds of strong storms may well become more frequent in the near\nFuture a devastating storm huge sections you saw some of the drone\nCoverage or an aerial photos entire sections of Mexico beach in Florida\nEssentially a raced I'm a devastating storm even if the death toll is not the horrible numbers that we heard from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico belated numbers by the way so you asked about the government in their response of FEMA has of course fallen

political journalist Todd's will lick reporter Shane Harris of Washington Post and ... California report before we move on from the weather and climate Louis there was one more thing you want to see to ...\nYeah I just wanted to lead to mention you know poll Rome or the other guy who won the Nobel Prize in economics this week talking about\nTo this crisis at least in part and and you know I think it's important to just recognize that sounds punitive but I think there is a positive message that he's trying to put out there and that is if you commit to tax uh on carbon not only are you dealing with this issue had on but you're also in his view\nI'm opening up the opportunity for people to make money investors to to make money off it there because when money at stake you're always going to find alternative people will naturally gravitate and an economic argument is often on carbon tax or that it's bad for business\nCalifornia's the fifth largest economy in the world and Jerry Brown just signed an executive order committing the state to carbon neutrality by twenty forty five which I'm sure it sounds crazy to people outside of the state like that's actually very close to one of the policy prescriptions the I. T. I. P. C. C. set forth\nIt's kind of crazy until you do it really in California is very serious about doing it\nIt's very serious about doing it you know Paul Romer talks about\nThe problem isn't going to be solved until you build consensus on and political will is really at the heart of that there's there's really a huge divide in terms of political well not just here but also you know I just moved here from Canada at the same thing there yeah prime minister Justin Trudeau China and uh\nAnd pose a a carbon tax across the country and he's running into real opposition at the provincial level there\nBefore we move on let me get one more comment a few more comments on this not my autonomy tweeted why are we still talking about the credibility of science when it comes to climate change\nA good point not my economy I don't know if you listen to this program but we are not question the credibility that's kind of a done deal on this program but I hear what you're saying\nLarry tweeted it's frustrating to hear criticism of citizens in some of the poorest parts of Florida for not upgrading their homes ability to withstand hurricanes they may live where other people vacation but they're mostly stuck this storm will expose that contrast\nShane Harris I Wonder if you could respond to Larry on one hand\nI disagree with him as a Floridian like the state of Florida has programs to help you heart in your home and if you want to live in Florida\nThat as a base will risk of living within ... yards of a rising coastline if you want to live there you just have to absorb that on the other hand I totally hear what he's coming from like Mexico beach where the hurricane Michael made landfall\nHad to be moved back from the coastline for safety sake the talented and incorporate it it's it's a tough one\nNobody's really talking when we're we're when we're thinking about climate change in the sort of thirty to forty year our Todd and I were just talking about the strength to break\n'em there are existential risks that are opposed not just to\nA community is close to the coastline to where we are talking about today but large cities like Miami in Florida in other places that really in the long term are going to have to make serious profound choices about\nSurvive ability about resilience or whether people want to continue living there and there is an element of risk that you take her that also has to give people some agency and what I think is missing from the conversation about climate change\nIs a real honest discussion about long term risk and what the responsibility is for people living in these places and they're elected leaders both at the local and the national level we're not having that conversation\nAnd Joshua ... one small point just the end if you think that risking getting your heads around the risk for lower income or poor people here in America is something we need to think about\nUh Americans also need to think about what some of our international leaders leaders generals like Colin Powell advisors had been saying for years if you think it's a risk in this country imagine what storms increased drought\nAnd conflict it means for millions and millions of poor people around the world when they started to migrate when they upset the relationships between countries and that becomes not just their problem in terms of life and death but America's problem in terms of of keeping the world in order\nTo listen for those of you who work in an had been in the path of hurricane Michael we wish your core speedy recovery and we'd love to hear from you\nAs you continue to deal with the recovery give us a sense of how you're doing how the recovery is going\nWhat your thoughts are on how things are going how well FEMA is meeting your needs state officials how well that's going we always love to hear from you feel free to email us\nOne a at W.

I'll answer this you know senator calmly Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary committee where she's also in the homeland security and government Affairs Committee and in that capacity she had the chance to grill\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on that face to face on how much intervention did the White House do and that's sad supplemental background check\nWill also on ranking member of the Senate Judiciary committee Dianne Feinstein her six year term in the Senate is up there she's up for reelection\nYou think that that this is going to come up in the debate between her and state senator Kevin daily young who wants to know why she sat on that letter from Dr Christine Blasey Ford for two months\nAnd laughing I say it she just last night I'm trying to take the fight from you know on this ... thing too\nThat the way that Trump is trying to remake the courts rent large talking about the Ninth Circuit court hearing California Trump's nomination this is a court that's been a real ... side the White House just put forces three nominees there and she didn't get to sign off on that she's very upset about that and Trump\nAt ... really breaking French tradition by not giving the home state senators any say in these ...\nI Do want to see if we can leave time to talk California politics before the roundup is up but a few more things that are DC we wanted to discuss including the president stepping into the middle of the feud between Taylor Swift and Kanye West he publicly just missed swift\nFor indoor sing to Democrats in Tennessee and he woke him Tania west of the White House yesterday ... wore red make America great again hats for the visit\nAnd we're gonna have less we're going to do is I don't want to say I don't want to put you in this by love this guy here let me give this guy\nI Love this guy right\nNow kind of us was reportedly at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform he also said yesterday that he doesn't like the liberals and shows like Saturday Night live make the president look bad he said the president needs to be in his words precious to us as Americans\nWe should also be clear those Shane Harris Kanye seemed rather rambling during the good bit of his visit maybe a little unhinged he admitted\nThat he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder I I'm I'm I'm hesitant to dig deep in on this story I think Tanya is easy to mock easy to make fun of\nEasy to criticize but the fact that he said that he is bipolar while he's meeting with the president and dropping some obscenity at the other side of the regular desk I I'm not sure what to do with it\nI I'm not either I mean I think it was quite surreal we were actually in the newsroom working on other ... arguably more important stories I hesitate to to be so deep and it's like you\nAnd looked up at the TV and we all sort of said is this is this really happening it was just so strange it's hard to know what to make of it but it is part of a litany of these kind of bizarre carnival esque spectacles that we\nAll office and then from the president that have the flavor more of a reality show I mean that that seemed to remind us of the mill you that Donald Trump came out of\nA when he ran for president and so in that sense I suppose it's not that surprising but I think for a lot of people there is a sense that it almost diminishes the office of the president to see this sort of rambling bizarre what do we make it a behavior\nFrom a celebrity that has been outspoken about his politics and that's his right but there's also left many people scratching has had about what does he actually doing and is is there something wrong with him or he was just a very strange moment and I know for for for for me and my heart just tried to move past it as quickly as we could\nAnd the interest in moving past as quickly as we could do that too but I should note the county's old nemesis Taylor Swift and sort of herself into politics this week\nShe endorsed Democrats Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house in her home state of Tennessee on social media\nThe Senate race in Tennessee is tight and Britain has strong support Taylor Swift has one hundred twelve million followers on Instagram and voter registrations among young people rose by more than sixty thousand after for post\nShane Harris let me stick with you for a moment because President Trump is facing another difficult situation regarding the disappearance of a journalist named ... he's Saudi dissident and a resident of the U.S he disappeared inside the Saudi consulate\nIn Turkey you've been doing a fair bit of reporting on this particularly the concern that the Turks have raised that the Saudis basically sent hit men to kill them all to show you because of his reporting\nThe Turkish government hasn't really provided any independent evidence for this they say they have security video and and and logs of people who signed in and so forth\nWhat do we actually know right now if anything about what really happens right well we know right now is\nLargely coming from the Turks and Turkish security agencies\nAre what we reported last night my colleagues and I and the Post's late last night was at the Turks have told the Americans that they actually have audio recordings and video from inside the consulate\nThat they say definitively prove Fletcher mark a show the who was an opinion writer for the post Washington Post a was a beaten tortured and killed and ultimately dismembered inside\nThat facility um the Americans have we understand have not seen the footage or heard it themselves but there's a growing believe within the U.S intelligence community and I think was in Congress and the White House ah that the Saudis probably did kill Jamal ... and are not\nAt all being forthcoming about that this is a politically difficult situation for this president in particular because the White House is so close to uh the the regime in Saudi Arabia I'm Jared Kushner the president's son in law and senior advisors actually very personally close to a man named Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day":
