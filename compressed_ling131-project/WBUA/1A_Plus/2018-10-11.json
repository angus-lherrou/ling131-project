your calls Heather in Indianapolis is on the line hey Heather what's on your mind what'd you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for the entertainment value but my big piece was that moment when he brought her onstage knowing that was not her comfort zone knowing what she can hold that she wasn't going to be good enough\nThat no one would care that no one would find her interesting or attractive\nAnd she just went out and she killed it and they loved it and for that house second ISI that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her that was a pretty important if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reasons is kind of a big moment\nYeah I I I hear you on that just does that resonate for you in a way like was there something personal that that made you flash back to er sad about for LA\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know I Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowd or for people and you often hear you know you need to be dinner or project lower or beat this or that are younger and at that moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment\nIt we can personalize it whether it's your interview or what have you and I think that was an important\nOr with Heather what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her no\nYes yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and uh for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my name's needs to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got them to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and I thought it it kind of the ill\nYeah you do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that Ali billboard and he says we should have just made the old billboard you're knows\nA thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys honoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] what are the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a\nExist in and thrive in Hollywood as far as coming up the music industry it absolutely is of a powerful comment on the music industry as\nThe music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think the weirdest thing is placed in time where this movie is place in time it's interesting to think about that because almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's\nReally no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming playlists and um the major record labels having less power than they used to so\nIt's almost like the\nOld fashion and its view of the music industry but only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also trying to end but by the way for those who have not seen star is born will not be seeing stars more just kind of want to be in on the conversation she\nTells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose you know just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view the commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie\nI felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink\nWho is very much an invention of pop music but you also have this kind of rye cynical style style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways is very linear it's a very linear idea of there is one\nUm road to fame there is one path you just simply offend or D than as opposed to there's no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in at a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWithout kind of going through that traditional path so agree with Anna about that but I think that um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them pass each other on this fame ladder and I\nAnd what you're saying about lady guy you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist like Lady Gaga who has been so able\nTo make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about this movie is she is way more important to your than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from Bradley Cooper we've had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd in that way\nYeah except for the voice in rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean he is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley send a lot of time sitting up\nThat first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga character alley is just improvising love saw him they can pull\nTag can\n[noise]\nBradley Cooper and Lady Gaga in a store is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and sang and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's ... we say we sing everything live in the movie wow yeah there's nothing that's lips thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's seen next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene in the actors fully believing that you're the character you can't not believe it yourself so she really gave me that confidence\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played out\nThis is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meets jak he is a stumbling blackout drunk\nAnd I think it looks as if he's just been a weekend at a bar to Kevin Kevin ... and I don't find that interesting or attractive if she had met him sober and he fell into alcoholism\nAnd stayed with him it'd be more interesting he's he's increasingly mean he has petty and I think as his alcoholism ... becomes words he continues to treat her worst and yes he's Bradley Cooper\nAnd yet he's is incredibly talented musician but I never really bought fully what alley saw in him\nAbolishing audience they're going to extract a Democratic

Holmes and John horn let's get to a few more of your calls now gene is listening in Indianapolis he Jean what did you think of a star is born can you hear me\nYes I gave that five stars which why five stars\n[noise] um actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seems particularly well updated to today um I thought it was the irony of being discovered\nBecause she was a drunk and looking for a drink and a dear life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was that continually say and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent\nI guess he was her age at the guy who made her over the manager Dan agent played yeah what what did you make of that character\nBut ah the minute he had that conversation with jacks and um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him of being a problem in that whole relationship\nI just I just knew that that was going to be the start as of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear Eugene a hundred percent of ... and I I think I heard you chime in as well\nNo that was a male nominee to go ahead yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of the story one of the tricks with the manager is I think they do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is\nI'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them\nFrom the beginning um but then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forced elements\nThat it doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed debt because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways richer but\nYou know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough to drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was\nBy agree with you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or are we are done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on states to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened as someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right now that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way for me\nIt exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of that the narrative issue with the ending\nBut I'll go ahead and go ahead\nWell of course of course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the fame monster as Lady Gaga once called it and one of her album ah destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of stars born in there and in fact all the bridges of the SARS ... have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I absolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost was a sympathetic enabler\nUm of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know we're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name of alley or in the star is born versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people\nUm requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of the part of the cast you know has to be there um I also just want to say before we end got to get this out there\nThat um this is also the story of how a woman's rise leads to a man's fall [laughter] and that's an internal problem with the SARS bar and you know um it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama is traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA toward the lead female character but\nThere is this underlying sense have to say it that even as Jackson, Maine is saves temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from\nHis young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery\nFeminist reading problematic from well\nBut you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a feeling male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nWe get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars I deeply appreciative Dugas nuanced shyness in her early portrayal which made main characters\nHave the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance his scenes seemed a little too detached from Maine overall I loved the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Argo in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story the performance is especially the musical ones were fantastic\nAnd the cinematography was incredible\nI expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography cinematographer Matthew ...\nProduction designer Karen Murphy costumer Aaron been hacked score original song and editing John horns spoke with the cinematographer Matthew Lee ... about shooting live performances which are not really straightforward spaces to navigate here is a part of that conversation from K. P. C. sees the frame\nIn this film was very difficult to sort of um navigate the stage performances because we had three different modes basically we had the Coachella mode which is I'm borrowing stages or that were already set up with the lady that was already existing\nAnd putting in our own crowds and then there was the I'm running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot him between two sets with a real audience\nApologizing in thanking the audience for I'm sort of I'm shooting a movie in between\nTwo bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater which in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie fashion was able to create the Greek theater as a set\nAnd put a certain amount of crowd and so that was my most controlled scenario but the lighting of it had to have a consistency my my goal was that um\nYou know in creating a character from sort of cinematography standpoint\nJackson, Maine might as well be um [noise] oh I don't know Jack White and I had to make sure that the\nThe audience maybe subconsciously feel that this is his lady [noise] this is his road show and it's also in the film in the sort of visual movement of it or representation of rock and roll\nThat was Mathew live at seek the cinematographer on a star is born speaking to John horn on Cape he sees the frame\nJohn can you talk a little bit more about the making of this film particularly back to Kathleen question who wrote on Facebook how you can tell if a film is well directed this kind of a film the way that Matthew described it presents all kinds of additional challenges to make it a well directed film shooting in so many different kinds of locations\nYeah I think the ultimate question about what is it is not a well directed film is do you believe it do you believe you're watching Bradley Cooper or do you believe you're watching Jackson, Maine if you think you're watching the actor you're not in a well directed movie if you are with the character", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "11"}
