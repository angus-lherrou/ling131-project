St Louis\n... and I didn't like it and didn't inhale and they're trying to do\n[laughter] Bill Clinton in the run up to the presidential elections in Nineteen Ninety two or the deceased lake Christopher Hitchens went to Oxford with Bill Clinton said the idea that Bill Clinton didn't inhale it Oxford was probably true because he knew firsthand their Bill Clinton chose to take his marijuana in edible foreign\nThat's what Hitchens used to say he was no friend of Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that\nWe heard from Susan who sent us an email I Believe that our political risk started well before the Nineteen nineties the Vietnam Conflict was one of the most visited issues since the civil war and we still had never recovered\nAnd not witty tweets us on Twitter I was in high school when Gingrich and company produced their contract with America I remember peers who had been pleasant with each other suddenly became antagonistic suddenly politics became a team sport\nThat experience is one of the reasons why I today and nonpartisan\nSteve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting\nMight sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment in tribalism in politics where we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back during impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager\nHe helped impeach Bill Clinton and then what before the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor\nThat Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the rat Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended cabin on he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody thought I'm a single white male people want me to shut up\nAnd I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of Brett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve\nHears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner and twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years you've been the vice presidential nominee of the revolting for your the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are\nDead men walking as far as [noise] back in twenty\nTwelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quipped to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as a Republican Party of the future meeting Republicans had your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics\nFlash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it any more\nStunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hocus vacation in the Trump beer it said to you about where we were in in in where we are\nYeah I mean I think it tells me that the divide is deepening and you know did tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there in twenty twelve after twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of establishment nationally look to the Mitt Romney's last a brac Obama included what you know what Lindsey Graham demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election and that's a huge part of it but the fact that he was able to sweep through the Republican Party is like the primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen\nTold Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixty one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing and completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe that we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ...\nGranted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or she is he converted what's he think he I mean\nLook there's there there's all sorts of theories about this I don't know but I'll give you a couple of them that that that that jump out at me what is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons of Donald Trump's rise in his in during popularity with Republican votes\nThere is as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your next primary especially if you're Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being a being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there is also the theory that hey part of this is Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you're if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises\nOr if you change your tone on Trump's the way he as if you go off with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons is to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing Donald Trump win the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just ... more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time set himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacture them fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's\nChanged his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised at how often several of my neighbors express their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties\nVery tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and Steve you're nodding because that does not sound surprising\nTo you yeah ... what he's what he's describing his ticket splitting yet to be and political science they the voters who go and they\nWere Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot just election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and in that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal was All right let's get\nBack in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve ... so much of what your book is about uh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although he certainly could have a when he was a young rabble rousing congressman\nWho was willing to defy the normal rules of congressional decorum in May of Nineteen eighty four he delivered an insult on the floor of the house to then times speaker from Massachusetts the legendary Tip O'Neill\nMy partner speaker as you pointed out to us again yesterday are in charge of the house if you are saying to me the urine postmaster isn't capable of delivering from one member to another the male and the system you run then I think you may want to appoint a commission to look into the post office\nNow maybe a veiled insult there that might take a little bit of parsing but give it a back story and why Newt Gingrich was slinging an insult at uh the well respected and legendary Tip O'Neill\nYeah that that in in hindsight now you look back Thirty years and you play you may say well what was the big deal the idea was Democrats had run the Congress at that point for Thirty years\nThey were seen as the permanent majority I mean Republicans weren't just the minority party they were buried deep they weren't even close you didn't go into an election saying maybe the Republicans will get it maybe they won't it was like maybe they'll get to a hundred Seventy feet you know that that was how deep in the minority they were in here was Gingrich um who was in his third term from Georgia\nBeating the speaker of the house she was at that point a Seventy two year old\nOld school Boston politician Tip O'Neill man of the house beating him into a fight on the floor of the house of Neal actually left the speakers rose from came down to the floor that have stood to debate Gingrich and and we have that very sound here's Tip O'Neill and his response\n\n\n\nSupport\nFor NPR I'm is from this session and from the Ford Foundation\nWorking with visionaries on the front lines of social change worldwide to

org\nI Want to turn back to the corner ... in just a moment but before we do a quick appeal for some help with a program in the works for next week here on one day we spend a lot of time yesterday talking with women about how society views angry women and there's a broad range of opinion but most of the women were hearing from our progressive and liberals\nIf you're a conservative woman tell us how you are seeing this moment what have you got to say how do you want to be heard in the fight over Brett Kavanaugh and in the fight over me to the discussions over me to in this country do you think your views are being represented\nOr respected leaves the voicemail eight five five to three six one day one a if your female Republican or at least someone who would describe themselves as\nBroadly conservative what do you want the country to hear about you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a that's eight five five to three six one two one two will make sure to get your stories on the air part of the national conversation in the days ahead here on one a\nWhile we're talking for the most part about what politician said and did in the Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right in many ways we are a shining city on it but the hard truth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and glory there is this fair Mr President\nIn the faces that you don't see the places that you don't visit and you're a shining city\nAnd believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well\nHere's what I was going for another\nMoment or the moment that listeners sent us from ... the early nineties I take you back towards any [noise]\nTo be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the Arsenio Hall show remember him will will with are Sunni off before that year presidential candidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows adults so that was something new talked about how politicians grappled\nWith media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because the president appeared on our city hall but he seemed to offer an alternative to gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark\nVery serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nWas also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second in third place in the presidential race at that point versus Ross Perot [laughter] begging place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two\nHad was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Gennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of slick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer early tried scheme is way out of\nOut of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall\nWhich was very hot at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd and it was Ninety two it wasn't just starts anew Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot\nWho was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began in February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King large came in and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on in February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteer submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nBrown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show 'em in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the arson you also that night well we won't be doing anything like that\nIn our city hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the president's yeah it was beneath the presidency to\nGo on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not that's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't doing our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message um\nPoliticians now managed media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama\nHad a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon just even cold there there isn't a show that Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than than maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public has\nChanged just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or send your home\nAnd I think too that you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier in the rise of Gingrich net moment with a Neal what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around what at the time were the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me you CSPAN give CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience\nDraw a line from that and how Gingrich was able to build his career his rise in the house around that\nFast forward to Donald Trump or did Donald Trump to\nTelevision obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter\nDonald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media is well that's that's so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties with C SPAN in Trump was doing with Twitter and and I think there's a real common thread there\nWell let's go back then in the way way back machine one more time to Nineteen Ninety nine Donald Trump was people forget was involved with politics even at the time he flirted mentally and even in reality with presidential runs long before he was ever successful he went on meet the press\nBack in Nineteen Ninety nine and had some thoughts about somebody that we've already talked about Pat Buchanan the insurgent right wing politician in the Republican Party", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "05"}
