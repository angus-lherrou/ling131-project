welcome thank you so much Julie let me start with you and we'll start with Medicaid expansion we want to go through a bunch of different kinds of legislation over the course of this conversation\nBut we'll start with Medicaid first of all just give us the basic remind us what Medicaid expansion me\nWhen the Affordable CARE Act was passed in twenty ten every state was supposed to expand Medicaid the idea was that for um middle income people there would be subsidies to help them buy private insurance\nAnd for lower income people and they extended that all the way up to a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty I'm about sixteen thousand dollars a year those people were supposed to get Medicaid for the first time you could get Medicaid if you just had a low income you didn't have to be\nI'm pregnant or child or a senior citizen or someone with a disability a\nAnd it went to the Supreme Court in the Supreme Court to everybody's surprise said um this is going to be voluntary for the states states don't have to expand Medicaid will Congress had said that they were going to pay a hundred percent of the cost for the first three years and then going down only ... Ninety percent for going forward\nFor this um population so for most states it was a no brainer you're basically getting free federal money to help people get health insurance and the blue states all jumped to expand and eventually some of the red states jumped to expand but we're now down to roughly a dozen and a half states that have not expand it\nI correct myself when I when I come up with just the right picture I comment\nPete Souza on his new book shade a tale of two presidents that's next time I hear now\nFrom our new nine Ninety nine to leave Iraq on NPR needs to [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from the doors do charitable foundation whos clinical scientists development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health\nFrom the George ... foundation working to make Cleveland and northeast Ohio more globally competitive livable sustainable and just more information available at gun foundation dot org and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nThis is one a I'm Joshua Johnson before we get back to our conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program on climate change today President Trump is surveying the destruction from hurricane Michael says he still skeptical on whether climate change is\nAnd he's not alone maybe you agree with him at least in part if you are not one hundred percent convinced that human activity is changing the climate in dangerous weighs a hundred percent\nAnd how did you reach that conclusion leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a now on the other hand\nMaybe you are part of the vast majority of people who are one hundred percent convinced how have you won skeptics over or if you don't bother to argue climate change anymore\nWhy not tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our series this state we're in today we're looking at state trends in health care law's with Julie Rovner chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news Scott Greenberger executive editor of state line and read Wilson national correspondent for the hill before we move on from Medicaid read\nI I Do want to get your sense of kind of where this is going only one state Maine\nHas approved Medicaid expansion through the ballot box so voters in Maine voted for expanding Medicaid but the governor of Maine Paul the page still refuses to do so\nHe talked about his opposition to expanding Medicaid during the morning talk show on W. V. O. M. radio back in July here's part of what means governors said\nOr one thing I Know there's no way they can force me to put state in reading and I will not do that so I can tell I mean I go to jail before I put the ... the state and read it and if that the court tells me I have to do it then we're going to be going to jail\nAs part of Maine Governor Paula page speaking back in July and I read ... telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political feed her I mean how's this going to ask\nWell a ... page is he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh he was the loud and and bombastic candidates in a one two races that uh\nUh he probably shouldn't have one in the political side and that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came into shake up the old order and that's what voters elected in foreign uh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters um the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point Paula pages turned out this year or the Democratic candidate is leading and in most of the surveys that are that they're up there\nUm but it it has not happened yet and as a consequence of all the pages actions there are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have the health care that they that they need and and this is a\n... it's a problem in Maine especially in a communities that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the state along the northern coast or is it has been pretty devastated and they work for a very low wages in pretty dangerous jobs in a\n... you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs an issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with now dozens of states pass laws this year\nThe aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you we spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about this and about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the BP paid the retail price of the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that there might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would have been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned that the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that the ... the pharmacist from discussing this with customers\nKennedy and for their democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses and bill had not passed\nWe want it to make sure that\nRhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with their with their pharmacist in and learn what their their pricing options are because that is consistently one of the big complaints we hear from our constituents on a on a regular basis is how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like this will\nBe these gag or clauses are are pretty common and uh last year there were a over a dozen states that\nHaving to do with these gag clauses um and actually just recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these um gang clauses this was kind of the low hanging fruit though of a\nOf a drug the drug prices issue a I don't think anyone like these gag clauses but uh\nUh that that will the federal legislation in the state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggled to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince you mentioned the president's he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these gang clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nIt's the no the lowest price active two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices that\nAnd obviously based on the name you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices have different locations\nWhere to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to school the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have that other people didn't want to have that\nBut now we have it and it's going to really drive prices\nScott back up to the the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law on this a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws in the country what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is in is in the lead on this on California is trying to reduce drug prices for transparency in other words they are are requiring um uh the drug companies to be public about a\nPrice increases increases beyond a certain point and the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll sort of be shamed into into reverse in some of these increases it's still too early to say though whether this is going to have the desired effect um nevertheless other states this year California passed its bill or in two thousand Seventeen and last year you had five\nMore states um Connecticut Maine New Hampshire Oregon and Vermont all passed a drug pricing laws that are similar\nTo California so we'll see whether transparency is enough to reduce prices and then in addition to that\nUm some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a\nIts Medicaid program to exclude some drugs from the a formula or the the um [noise] uh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when negotiating with a drug companies over prices\nIf they were able to exclude some FDA approved drugs and and as of right now Medicaid state Medicaid programs have to include all FDA approved drugs and their formula Larry\nThe idea was that if they were able to exclude drugs that would give them leverage in negotiating on prices but uh the federal government shutdown that that effort by Massachusetts\nI Want to understand the argument from Massachusetts where they were trying to do and again you see the federal government shut that down so Massachusetts does not do this now run out for an hour an hour now but the ... it sounds like you're saying the argument is you know find Massachusetts\nAnd you know Julius the drug company I could say hey Julie this medication that we know is FDA approved is still too expensive and we're not going to just pay blanket leave for a medication we think it's too expensive so you have to keep negotiating or we're not going to we're not going to honor that\nIf you donate your old car to WVU are it'll have a new

M. U. dot org Julie let's get to that question from months in law who tweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support is that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan has a high deductible well of course the people who have an\nEmployer plans with hijacked our our our big problem and the lower income people of those have a particular\nLarge problem if you have many thousands of dollars in deductibles have to pay before your insurance kicks and there are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to ah basically filling with employer insurance but generally Medicaid as sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off\nThe way the ... was created with those people up to a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get 'em medicate people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts they don't have those big to Dr balls so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin we're constantly shifting back and forth between Medicaid and private plant and basically what they would do is the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plans that they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere two weeks sidebar for just a second let me to the point of the series is to talk about what states are doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter every human being in the United states of America should have equally good planned ... was simple set of health care costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and there needs to be versatility\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going\nJulie actually it's where it's going is back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes\nThat the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended\nTo create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states still do an enormous amount of regulation of how can they always have the federal government has always been sort of the\nThe junior partner to the state um but it had gotten so such a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you lived in what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act was trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being chipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act passed\nScott do you get the sense that this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding that it is taking us back to where we were beforehand\nWell as Julie said it is in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again California Massachusetts states like that\nThey are re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example or on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... that offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they're joined the federal level um insurance is regulated or at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance and our state you are going to abide by these rules\nI'll tell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on image they've kind of moved on anyway and that's dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalize the recreational use\nVoters in Utah will choose whether to join the states or not and the political battlegrounds seems to have shifted and I want to read if you see it this way for more traditionally liberal states into more conservative areas overtime\nOr yeah and it's not just the medical or that has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where a legalization is going to be on the ballot this year is in Michigan in North Dakota I met\n... know for ... racial noted for in in on the medical side there are three different amendments in Missouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then the Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved it this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate or it came up and you know in Florida last year and\nLast year two years ago um but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana those sorts of people who approve of a marijuana legalization tend to be\nA older white males funny enough\nAnd then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you\nYou happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of libertarian streak or they don't want the government regulating something that\nThey don't think the government has a hand in regulating and the real swing voters or perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women are in talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization or basically the battleground is mothers who are worried that their kids are going to be exposed to marijuana\nSo you get the proponents are talking about the law enforcement to ability and and the the fact that not that this will not expand the market into younger people who will then have access to recreational marijuana and then you've got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to rope and a bunch of kids why are there are three items in Missouri so they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual citizen groups that that puts them on about those are amendment to an amendment three\nAnd then there's a proposition which is currently from around the proposition goes on about it from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of\nCompromise or a piece that's proposition see 'em and they are all sort of competing with each other and this underscores another piece of\nThe evolution of of marijuana politics pots big business a lot of these states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California Nevada Alaska or Massachusetts and Maine are the people who are setting up\nA ... who get to write these laws also essentially get to determine who's in the market um and who owns a very lucrative space one of the biggest opponents of recreational legalization in a bunch of early states\nWhere the people who ran medical marijuana shops because they already have the monopoly right why dilute the monopoly with other people\nI should know by the way we did a program this year about state laws on marijuana and the business of pie you can find that on line at the one a dot org\nScott a couple of things to add to what to read said on this very interesting issue um at one is that it's sort of intersects with what we talked about earlier the opioid crisis because there are many people\nAre supporters of medical marijuana who argue that this is a viable alternative to uh to opioids for people who have chronic pain\nAnd then also I think we've written about this um it's interesting that social justice provisions are finding their way into marijuana bills or this idea that a\nA minority communities have been the most impacted by the war on drugs and therefore uh as we move towards legalization that makes sense to include in these bills provisions that a\n... on the one hand would allow people to uh to expunged they're a criminal records for small amounts of marijuana but also some of these bills are calling for investment in these communities that we're most impacted and and also as a Reid said it's big business", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "16"}
