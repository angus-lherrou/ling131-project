U. dot org\nToday we're looking at a surge in early voting across America with the help of three stations we're partnering with\nZoe Clark is the program director at Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Michigan she's also the co host of its program it's just politics so we welcome Joshua joining us from K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is reporter Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happen to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas\nWith regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth Zoe Clark in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting looked like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase over the last midterm elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges has eventually ... turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during the presidential election so we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTony fourteen we had six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in the state\nMichael do you want what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day and on election day and um it's a it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the\nI'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots and\nAnd Brian agreement what's Kansas look like with early voting is falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's many of the counties across the state of reporting a\nRecord or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they are Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting in them or they're saying requests in in one of the most populated counties Johnson county by near Kansas City uh they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nLet me speak with you how does early voting work in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through how to Kansas handle voting early well it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um\nObviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the ... vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request that you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like to early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas or we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters who like to take that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research a candidate amendment or proposition at leisure welcome pleading the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado how's how's early voting work\nWill ah basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you\nGot to do a lot of research in Colorado this year it is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because uh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and fill\nOut that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or worse\nWe're talking with a cup of tea much whatever you want a bird with\nReject when I'm you know and so uh you know a lot of people um like the system in Colorado but not everyone um you know that ... ... ... the world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um now you got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day and voted\nI'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting early voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November six times and I I don't know how it is for your three states\nBut in every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day but your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is an object of airing mind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day not a postal carriers hands on election day ...\nTweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to lie to vote early and Michigan for\nAll practical matters yeah so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to ah basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say I'm going to be out of town\nAnd and lie there are also some other ways that you can get absentee ballots here in Michigan one is to be a over sixty years old or another is maybe due to religious reasons or if you were in jail awaiting arraignment or trial but no it is\nWell known around the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot\n... what is being over sixty has to do with voting early\nAh possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's gonna be cold and maybe the idea is that if you don't you don't want to Seventy eight year old having to sit outside let's say in a wheelchair for three\nFour hours and wait to vote so that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nWe're speaking to silly Clark program director at Michigan Radio based in Ann Arbor Michael ... an investigative reporter was K. U. N. C. public radio in Greeley, Colorado and Brian ... who covers energy in the environment for Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas\nRicky tweeted I early voted because I have an hour commute and a twelve hour a day on Tuesdays\nI liked being able to look up all of the issues and candidates I was more informed and took more time with my ballot voting from home amen to that ... I have done the exact same thing especially living in California where our voter guide was about as big\nAs I think one if not two of the hobbit novels like stacked on top of one of the it was a ridiculously fit guide and it just took a little time to go through so I hear you on that\nTracey is listening from Texas and Tracy emailed\nI cast my ballot first thing on the first day of early voting because no one ever knows what may blow up and getting your way hello Harvey referring to that hurricane that hit the Gulf Coast last year\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from

last weekend's mass shooting in Pittsburgh and it's a question on the mind of the Reverend Adam Hamilton he's founding pastor of the nation's largest Methodist Church\nBack in Nineteen Ninety he founded the church of the resurrection in Lee would Kansas that suburb of Kansas City the goal was to attract what he calls thinking Christians with little or no engagement in their faith\nToday it has more than twenty thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential mega churches in the nation\nPastor Hamilton says that he has observed deep divisions within his congregation that reflect the nation's divides what's his plan to get people of faith thinking differently\nWe discussed it this summer when we were both in Aspen, Colorado for this year's Aspen Ideas festival here's the first part of our conversation Josh what's great to be with you today thank you describe your congregation United Methodist church of the resurrection\nYou're bullied as a suburb of Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas city's downtown Kansas City Missouri blue springs Missouri in a couple in the Kansas on\nAnd it's a very diverse congregation it's a highly educated the largely a highly educated we have um we did a poll not long ago we found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans are divided between conservatives and for you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nThe Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independents are divided between Republican leaning independents and democratic leaning independent so we're we're pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country you know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions ... exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader\nSpeak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I'd I constantly have not constantly but I regularly get emails from folks saying well you know you're being too political I Wish she wouldn't talk about politics and\nAnd I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates\nBut what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values when we're talking about\nJustice issues we're talking about people who are being hurt\nWe're talking about moral issues are talking about ... and so if you think about what forms or politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know in radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper\nSense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely and I pray that when you're doing your politics\nYou're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system in the value system\nHow much do you as a as a pastor is administered lean into the political debates\nAnd a religious lens on them as opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine there are some weeks where you think let's just do a sermon on you know tightening or just do a sermon on this story of the garden of eat anything but pilots yeah so\nHere's a so for the folks who are upset by it they feel like I'm doing all the time\nBut here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in the ... and the Trump era\nThere's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday based on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday mornings and and again probably something morning and so what I've set is and that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance\nAnd yet somewhere in the midst of those is preaching on these themes the things that are happening in the news are going to come into play\nBut my aim isn't that a I mean I I think\nPeople are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to a church I'm not sure they always need one more year round of what they're already getting every day\nSo what I'm trying to do is this carefully choosing where one of the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting\nAnd even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so like I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the ... into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or one of the issues we're facing in our society and then we're going to take a look and see how\nYou know for it to be a sermon and not just a an ethical lucky electron ethics we're gonna look to see how the scripture speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and what I Try to do the approach I tried to take us to say okay\nI Know we are divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we are going to try to understand what might be the truth in this complex moral issue that this one site has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation and I'm going to say now you know with all the humility I can muster\nYou can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but this is obviously this issue right now [noise] gun guns is a is a great example of this and uh recently I preach the sermon on gun violence in schools I did a sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation to a year ago [noise]\nAnd as I did that you know I've surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that one can take to um to address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and and it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left in the right on some of these basic things\nNow that sounds like potentially risky ground because it begins to get out of spirituality is actual policy yeah uh\nDoes actually so so here we're talking about what would what would we as people of faith how how might we respond\nTo you know the issues of shootings in the school so the shootings in schools is the presenting or just violence in our communities and the presenting issue and so and obviously there's no guns in the Bible but there are swords and spears so he got plenty of plenty of places where we talk about how do we respond to people who are in it\nGot Paul talking about you know doing good to those that would harm you you know you've got a lot of things you could [noise] so so there's a part of that that is going to be about those basic biblical principles but then there's going to be another part that's going to say so are there any solutions and is there any way that we as people of faith\nOn the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people\nWho were gun owners agreed with us or you know we lift it up for five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense\nAnd in the end you know part of what we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting nuts\nBut I I have friends and people who I Love dearly who are in the in our and they love to hunt and they're not gun toting nuts and they grieve every time there's a shooting the school on the other side you know you've got these aren't people who want to take all your guns away\nThese are people who want to figure out we've got we've got to do something we got to come together so when you can when you can treat both sides as human beings and you can help them hear each other it opens the door to finding answers\nWhat does your congregation want from its religious experience at our church do they want a place to deal with these social issues\nThat they want to refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture or did he want you to be more prophetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you know the answer is yes all of a lot\nOf it if I get emails across the spectrum I have people who are like you know I it just it makes me so mad when you talked about what's you know what's going on the news I don't want to hear about politics when it comes to church and again politics becomes the catch all phrase for something you said that I don't agree with\nAnd uh but I've got other folks are like so immigration on the border when when the children are being separated or the news broke about that\nYou know I'm hearing this News I'm out of town I'm hearing this news throughout the week I'm studying it and I'm like do I talk about that this Sunday or do I spend another week really trying to see how it's going to resolve because I have a feeling within a week it's going to be it will start to be resolved and sure enough within a week there was an executive order and it's not all resolved but\nAnd I had people who are really mad like why didn't you you should have preached on this this weekend and I had other people were like thank you for not preaching on a switch and and the next week and I did I did that it was Father's Day we can talk about it but um\nSo I it's all over the map on that are there but here we we also served the congregation we find out\nWe were doing and worship survey to find out about music and different things what they what they wanted to ask about the sermons which the sermons or do you find most compelling and then I'm On a response was when Adam deals with current issues where he's dealing with what's going on in the world but for every person says that there's somebody else who's saying I Wish you wouldn't do that and you just stick to talking about love\nWe're speaking to Adam handles into founding pastor of the United Methodist Church or the resurrection in leave with Kansas
