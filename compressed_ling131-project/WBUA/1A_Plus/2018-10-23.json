in\nThis week we're looking at state trends inlaws on unions involving the public sector workforce like teachers firefighters and government employees they make up one of the most heavily unionized sectors of America's workforce\nBack in June the Supreme Court passed a ruling that could make it harder for unions to secure a labor contracts through a process known as a collective bargaining the ruling affects more than twenty states and the consensus is it the decision will hurt unions financially and could lead to a further decline in membership\nAhead of that ruling some blue states took steps to protect organized labor what impact will all of this have on the labor movement and what impact does it having on election season\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Scott Greenberger executive editor of state lie a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome back to what I thanks very much for having me let's get some definitions out of the way first of all when we say collective bargaining what are we referring\nTo uh when we say collective bargaining or what we're talking about are negotiations between uh employers and a group of employees are on salaries benefits working conditions and the like and typically employees are represented by unions\nKind of basic wages and working conditions exactly now a number of states have right to work laws on the books that are called right to work states what exactly do we mean by right to work\nSo a right to work a states and there are about I think twenty seven twenty eight of them now a date prohibit labor unions and employers from requiring workers to pay union dues as a condition of employment\nUh and of course a union dues are extremely important because that enables the unions to not only um conduct the negotiations during collective bargaining but also a to engage and other activities um including a political activities\nSo if you are at a job\nAt a a union covered workplace typically you know what I mean in a non right to work state\nYou get the job and you join the company and they say hey will come to this job recovered by union here's your initiation fee you need to pay in a right to work state you can get the job and say no thanks I'm not eager to pay for this but I look forward to starting work that's right\nHow does union membership look in the U.S right now are we talking mostly about public sector workers like teachers more private sector workers like hotel workers some of whom are on strike right now what's the overall picture\nSo uh this picture has changed dramatically in the last several decades it used to be in this country that most ah when we talked about unions we're talking about private sector unions\nBut a union membership overall has declined significantly over the last several decades and now public sector employees make up a larger share of ah unionized workers in the United states so right now about a third\nOf public sector workers and we mean we say public sector sector workers we're talking about teachers police officers firefighters a government employs and state agencies about a third of them are unionized and only about a six point five percent less than seven percent of workers and the private sector\nNoon and again it's having a nine point nine WB ...

summer the Supreme Court ruled that public sector employees have a First Amendment right not to pay union for collective bargaining unions called it's unfair because non union workers benefit from the contracts that can be reached to collective bargaining but now won't have to pay for that\nSome blue state solve this decision coming in preemptively pass legislation to protect unions from high court's ruling were discussing that\nWith Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line Sarah Duncan is still with us on the line she's a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates and she's a ... a visual arts teacher Syrian there was one more thing I did want to ask you before we had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners\nAbout their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in grants and I can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we did hear from John in San Diego who left this voice mail in our inbox\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things of union negotiations or us on her behalf one salary health insurance\nAll that kind of stuff um I Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent it higher level Caesar accountability that will ultimately lead to higher salaries more competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers would you\nSend your that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition and the teaching marketer and ultimately compare ourselves through other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with Sarah I'm Wondering what you think of John's commented does he have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'd like to make a couple of comments about that first off I've not always been happy with everything that mining and has done but one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers\nThe union is not just your union leaders in the ... are driven by numbers and lenders need to demand\nAnd you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices and it's actually not that difficult to fire a teacher but what Indians has done is made it clear that\nYou can just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than you have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or you know and\nPart of the reason that's so important is because teachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay and if we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they make higher salaries and you you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go see her I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates in and try to work with the other delegates about improving\nPolicies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think that residents of your state or really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike to make things happen in West Virginia\nI think that they are motivated and I do believe that that is why the strike was so successful we could not have done what we did without the support of our communities and I think that our communities realize\nYou know it was portrayed in the media is that the strike was just it up pay or just about health care it's not about that not just about that it's about improving conditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general and\nI have seen with my own eyes legislators repeatedly putting interests\nThat outside corporate interests over their own people in this state and that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate your making time for us thanks very much thank you without a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union's efforts non union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and benefits with their employer you can't have it both ways\nLuke tweeted how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fear or equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers Scott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland ... comment about non union members\nGoing it alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers tend to go shoot for more if they want but a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions right\nI Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um [noise] uh uh differences that you were talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question to boys think is an ex\nAnd when I see in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U.S Randy welcome to one day\nHey Joshua and that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running in and Barry ... district and I hope she makes that one of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to you a little bit more about that in a moment I should also a union contract I actually I don't usually contracts I said also introduced Vincent ... he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\nHey thank you for having me on Vincent ... she's me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA is to save these or at least the minimum working conditions and wages right\nWell um it's in in some in some industries it's a floor now the ceiling\nIt depends on what the clause is about ... city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes it's for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay that's that's that's a good con a context is for folks maybe who never been in a union to know that it can be that they're they're mileage me very Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the gym is case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house oh\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back and to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country\nAll right to work all Janice means is that a union can't get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect a collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions\nAnything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it except for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired\nAnd going back to that contract is a a floor and not a seal up the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements especially those in the public sector\nHave seniority built in are the only way to get a raise is by logging another of your other job can I I'm ... and all the way to go ahead and finish off um so I I I actually agree with Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate individually if they want to the Mackinac center has model legislation it's called the workers choice\nThat allows public employees to fully opt out of union representation represent themselves and negotiate a better contract if they can\nIf union worker if unionized workers don't pay unions to negotiate for them how can that not have an impact I mean you have to pay the staff to negotiate for your right\nOr the problem is that they are forced to accept that representation whether they want it or not\nOh no no I don't know I I I hear you on that piece I just want to make sure we're clear on the argument you're making if the staff to to go shoot your contract he's paid and there are workers who choose not to pay into that staff how could that not have an impact I mean you got to pay these people right\nAt the staff is doing good job I mean I work for a contract for nonprofits and they raised there and they raise the revenue by doing good job and having um their supporters realize they're doing good job proving that are worth to deter supporters\nTomorrow at noon on Ninety point nine W.

A. M. user station they care about and so they choose to give and so the barometer we have\nOf whether we're doing what people want is their willingness to become members to become sustaining members to give to write a similar wills to donate their cars to be you know cash now to to support the station\nIt feels like a similar argument with folks in right to work states where they say if unions are doing what they are members want them to do you have to compel them to pay their dues they will pay gladly because they'll know what they're getting from the union they can't get on their own it's absolutely essential what's wrong with that argument\nSo Joshua it's frankly the arguments and the point that Janice case has ... has decided\nThat you know everything is completely voluntary the argument used to be this that if you are creating a staff and I'm an entity that is a bargaining contracts and representing all of everyone\nThen it shouldn't just be the people with the loudest voices\nThat get the attention it should be everyone who gets the attention and that just like in terms of taxes to the United states of America or to\n'em or or bar association fees or student loan see or student organization fees that when you have an obligation to serve all that all pay a fair share\nAnd that was the argument that actually had a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in the booth case\nAbout forty five years ago and six successive Supreme Court rulings that affirmed it\nWill be the case the Janice overturned\nExactly so but look Janice that Alito Sam Alito judge of the Supreme Court\nHas wanted this case has asked for this case for years most people thought it was it a a logically base because the issue was really on the outside that that the the case that the Mackinac center I Wish they were being more honest about it that the Mackinac center that Donald Trump that others made was that you know the Democratic party\n... it had really nothing to do with other kinds of things and therefore they want us to a defined as however the cases done\nAnd what has happened since is that members have stuck with unions and and and and and Vincent said something else which I think was or Scott there which I think I just wanted to raise which is that the Mackinac center actually violated all sorts of school board policy and all sorts of norms that was\nBy the day after the Janis ... sending an email on school email to ... to virtually every single teacher in ten states if we had done that\nPeople would be slapping us around rightfully what we do is we actually organize I'm outside at school and what we've tried to do is basically say to to the states just give us some time so we can introduce people to the union\nOkay let me give a ... a chance to respond to them then we'll keep moving by the way it is worth noting that the Mackinac center did file a friend of the court brief in the uh Janice versus ... case but go ahead Vin let me give you a chance to respond well\nHey thank you and you know there's groups across the country that are communicating with public employees to tell them about their rights mackinaw has their my pay my said dot com website I'm In Ohio to go back to your previous caller there's the workers choose dot org website\nAnd these efforts are needed because unions like Randy's are trying to trap public employees into paying them or trying to limit the time that they can exercise their rights under jazz\nUm in some cases in credibly confusing time periods\nOn some cases only about a week also that um states like New York New Jersey California give unions the ability to essentially have captive audience meetings or make their sales pitch to a public employees while at the same time\nForbidding anybody else from talking to that our employees and this is during the work\nDay we ... what you mean by a captive audience meetings what what exactly are you referring to [noise] um well recent\nLegislation passed in several states gives unions the ability to do what they call a orientation sessions with a with new employees so basically think it's time share presentation on steroids were the union can come and\nSay this is why you have to join put a dues check off for them or a membership form in front of them say you have to you know ... years while you really should sign up\nAnd there was no one else saying well wait a minute you know you actually have the right not to so that's why you're seeing all these efforts these educational efforts around the country saying no to know your rights\nAnd by the way if there is a artificial time period to limit when you can exercise your rights I'm this is what it is and shares help navigating that often confusing process and that process that may confusing on purpose to keep public employees trapped", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "23"}
