W. public radio in Seattle is Sarah ... a research associate at the University of Washington she holds a PHD in ecology from UC Davis\nShe also founded the row in Institute a group that empowers leaders to tackle climate change Sarah welcome to want to say thanks for having me joining us from NPR in New York is poll blood so a lecturer at American University's Center for environmental policy American owns W. A. M. U. the station that produces one day\nHe's also a former climate advisor to the Clinton White house and a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute poll welcome thanks structural Sarah I Wonder if we should just framed a discussion very clearly first of all this is a conversation that's for skeptics and believers alike right this is\nBigger than just is climate change real ... this kind of feels to me like the human aspect of working our way through this issue right\nYeah I definitely this is something that impacts all of the political decision making aspects of our public life right now how we're integrating science and how were you how we're essentially distorting science across this partisan divide that Israeli characterizing this political moment in our nation right now\nNow we heard from President Trump and that sixty minutes interview just a few minutes ago on that note John left us this note in our inbox my question really is why does the president insist on denying\nBy downtown uh W.

A. M. U. dot org we know that for quite a few if you're discussing climate change can be difficult so have you been giving us your suggestions for what has worked for you or what might work\nMelissa writes for my Bible friends I remind them that we are called to be good stewards of the earth\nNothing the environmentalists are suggesting would cause harm for my fiscally conservative friends I talk about the economics green power is more profitable and this is the future autonomy more jobs better jobs saving the earth for their grandchildren is way down on the list\nWe also heard from some of you who are dealing with the difficulties of discussing climate change Caitlin left this note in our inbox\nGround zero go that route that stays in Ireland and I'm very interested in protecting the environment\nTeaching others about climate change\nI Want to know ways in which I can better explain myself to\nOthers are just regular people who might not have the education that I have about climate change because from where I'm standing it plainly ... what's going on and it just seems like we really need to come together and actually make a change or there's going to be a really bad and\nCaitlin thanks very much for sharing your thoughts with us Paul I wonder how you would respond to Caitlyn particularly because I think sometimes if I may just add to your comment the terminology often gets us in trouble I mean some people use the phrase climate change some people say extreme weather as some people say global warming and\nJust beginning to get on the same page can be one of the core problems of talking about all this\nIt's a great point we need to recognize that the good news is we have the solutions to address this problem the technical solutions the energy\nSolutions the policy solutions what we lack our political will and consensus around action we know that we have to pee global emissions by twenty twenty and go to zero net carbon by twenty fifty turns out we have the technologies renewable carbon capture\nA electric vehicles and many others to make that happen if we make a real push but it is going to take a huge push likely made during the Cold War I Wish the country would come together over this expression of American leadership\nLeading the world again to safety I think that's possible but when one party in the United states the nice factual information over twenty year period then elected president who almost campaigned on it it becomes very difficult to engage with that and I think voters\nMay reflect that in this midterm election\nGeorge tweeted as an environmental health scientist I focus on telling people about the immediate and local clean air health benefits that will go to people in locations taking action to address climate change pollution and reducing fossil fuel burning irrespective of opinions on climate Katie emailed\nMy family has vacation to Mexico beach in Florida for twenty plus years and we have many friends and loved ones from Panama City who have lost everything meaning in hurricane Michael\nMy father is it this believer of climate change and it's been very upset about losing a place we love so much he won't consider that just maybe there is a greater thing at play here what is it going to take for this to change\nHow do we those who are convinced that is happening change the way we talk about it and rather than shutting down the conversation nurture it Sarah how would you respond to Katie\nGosh that's a really really great question and I can feel that the pain that she's in and the last that her family is\nStruggling with to describe and you know this is this is the peace around recognizing how difficult it's information as like I got exposed to the science of climate change when I started graduate school and it took me\nLike six years to integrate the scale of difficulty of that information and it it people can get exposed to the science of climate change and it ... they can be in such a vulnerable place that it's actually potentially dangerous for for students and people who are struggling with mental health issues\nSo the the way that we unpack this I think\nIs through and through relationship and trust and empathy on because as we interact as individuals and we come to terms with the scale of the change and the crisis you can have a lot of really based on emotion and fear anger\nAnd anxiety all of these pieces that are we all ... away from those very challenging emotions and often when we feel doesn't motions ... into our partisan corners where we think we know the way the world as and we we\nAnd that's why being on it that yeah this is a really difficult conversation and that's exactly why we're having this conversation is one of the ways to start\nSarah if I could just dig in a little deeper on that I Wonder if this idea of being empathetic and being a little compassionate might also speak\nTo the conversations with folks who feel very fatalistic I mean it's hard not to read the latest report from the UN's climate change which we discuss last week on this program\nAnd not feel like well we're all going to die anyway why bother run up your credit 'cause they're not going to be around and collect you know what I'm saying like it just feels like an intractable problem and I wonder if maybe a little empathy for folks who feel that way would go a long\nWay when I when I so yeah I get it and I I Want to remind remind us that as we sit\nWith the privilege of western lifestyles and we look at the science that we've invested public money into you know remembering that we're living a science fiction fantasy right now and we can look to human history and see that there are many other cultures around us\nAnd specifically in the U.S Native American and indigenous Native American people\nWho have already experienced the kind of cultural eradication that we are looking at down the line and ... that the consequences from climate change if we can look at the stories of human tenacity\nAnd how people struggle and survive through massive massive chef we know these stories and we can inform our strength and our resilience our courage by looking at the stories of for example water protectors and the people who are standing at the front lines right now saying\nThe earth is precious we only have one planet and we're all going to show up and\nI'm informed that the you know the public's eye of the necessity of staying in this place and and things vigilant now so I Would\nJust go go ahead go ahead ... but oh I Would just add that the St Louis is a reasonable reaction if you don't know the full range of solutions\nThat there's a lot of good news here\nTwo years ago we eliminated one of them six main greenhouse gases it will no longer exist on earth Twenty years from now with the golly agreement to phase out HFCs\nTurns out there three or four other super pollutants like methane and black carbon if we can reduce these quickly about three times the current rate\nWe can limit near term warming and prevent runaway climate change we need education about the fact that we can take hold of the climate crisis and actually solve it to exactly to combat that fake lives in which is a serious problem and I I really do feel empathy for people who are overwhelmed by\nAn apologist to begin a little further what our HFCs\nAgencies are hydra floor carbon or manmade gas that ironically are used in refrigeration in air conditioners\nAnd they're growing incredibly quickly because we phased out an earlier set\nOf CFCs chlorofluorocarbons\nTo fix the ozone hole by the way it's worth noting that that happened under Ronald Reagan a Republican so also noting that the acid rain problem was solved under George W Bush a Republican Republicans have historically taken very responsible positions\nShe believes that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction that's next time on here now tomorrow at noon on

our conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about being Native American\nMassachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along that she is indeed of tribal heritage the test was a clock back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders said direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard\nIt's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking head of the midterms\nIf you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant to you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a now if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life what did you discover and how did it change you\nEight five five to three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Sarah ... and Paul blood so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kind of like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shut you down and drains you\nNeed to keep it at that middle area I guess let's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and Paul I wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then\nI see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives there still driving around and gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not ours\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical\nWhen you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take large policy action to reduce emissions in the United states and globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and voting people who will and I don't mean just Democrat and Republican because within those parties there are a few Republicans who\nAcknowledge like uh the congressman from some South Florida um but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace is there at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with U.S policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation and the useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of points it in the direction of being willing to do something so by the way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few common objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses if warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] they have it in that um that that those protections are coming through I mean all of the pieces of protection that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentrations and we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nAnd I I guess the issue is not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like\n[laughter] yes and there's ... there's complexity and how the regional climate and the season out of different places are influenced by the day that the on the Arctic weather system basically a collapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so\nWe do see these complexities and why\nAnd people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for earth planet ... Ben ... authorizations between glacial an inter glacial state abrupt warming into into glacial followed by slow cooling into glacial state\nSo that piecing of glacial into glacial warming that cold warm structure that was fundamentally paced life changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sons\nOf Sarah backup oranges along in the changing geometric relationship between glacial into glacial stay last last me it's so cool it's amazing what it's confusing like bring it down to earth\nFrom me okay so in the last nine years the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states where there's an ice on top of North American and you're Asian continent sea level is lower\nOn it's a colder climate on and then in ... states so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis on this piecing this um oscillation its ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and that heartbeat from cold too warm or cold too warm that heartbeat was paste by the ... and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth\nMake sure following you this yeah this heartbeat this earth heartbeat but we are on hold too warm\nCold too warm it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest the heartbeat is off and the pattern is not what it's been for a million years and we can trace it to us is that what you're saying that's exactly right I like perfect then okay that makes a youthful\nPattern that's been ... that's been happening for the last million years we uh we have fundamentally disturbed that pattern\nI was saying well we're on a super high cholesterol\nSugar fossil fuel diet has gotten or a blood pressure through the roof and the climate system can't take that forever\nThat will go out of control that's a perfect that's a perfect image that makes perfect sense one more thing I wanted to get to pull out and then we got to let you go shortly but\nFor folks who questioned the provenance of the science who the scientists are that came up during the sixty minutes interview who say I just don't trust the people where this data's coming from how do I know that they don't have a political agenda what would you say to someone with that concern to try to work through that\nI I understand that you can distress individual scientists but there's not a conspiracy of\nTens and hundreds of thousands of scientists around the world to create a problem\nActually I find it quite the opposite in many cases their understanding the nature of the problem because they don't want to seem alarmist the truth is that the problem is here now in imminent\nAnd that that's just the factual information on the ground we have already warmed\nA degree and a half Fahrenheit were on her way to well past three or even four Fahrenheit and it could spin out of control and that that's just the factual information I I I think we were very few people actually denied about ten percent Fifteen Percent of the U. S. public actually\nDenied climate science would I think we have to do is galvanized the Seventy five eighty percent who broadly accepted into action\nPublished so former climate advisor for the Clinton White house process or your lecture at American University Center for environmental policy\nAnd a strategic advisor at the progressive Policy Institute poll thanks very much for talking to us thank you judge them and Sarah my re PHD research associate at the University of Washington and founder of the ... Institute Sarah thank you you're so welcome\nThere are good reasons to be concerned about our politics the division the tribal ties it seemed to get in the way of finding agreement and compromises we just discussed\nBut we're not alone no matter how fraud things maybe come here between now and the midterms at least we're not trying to work out a divorce it's lasted more than forty years and that will probably cost about fifty billion dollars", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "17"}
