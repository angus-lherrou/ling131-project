A. M. U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from that\nAll those that are acquaintance ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and now in times past than\nI always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say to threaten to run yeah threatened to run yeah LA's higher than a run for president are are going to support Romney 'cause you know I decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little ... about the word threatened not he floated the idea or he hinted at a rally threatened\nYet that say go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party\nIt was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president but sort of like that sort of a threat but uh you know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I I I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person has a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature of the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story\nAnd then it makes it harder for your bottle\nYou know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews\nBecause I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lot of time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that we are very smart people on the other side and that always understanding\nThe other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way if I got to the other side and weaken my argument\nThat I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so\nSo I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from\nWell when there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press is a communications director where you tried to convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that\nIt pushed back is normal but this kind of ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive\nI hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for hand full that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nYeah no no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know like if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there\nWas to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so having the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press who didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything\nI only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call and CNN had been called on for several weeks and I wanted to send a message to those people that have we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on in the press room we're open for business\nOr and you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet I build my own business and you know came from scratch swim in the square ought to have to I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted previous and Bannon out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly in the job\nHe was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president and even if I accepted a subordinate role which I have would have been happy to do that I'm a team player\nI don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality or does that strike you as somebody that General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ...\nHaving you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for five but even beyond you know let me I didn't learn anything going to like me anymore and then he likes the prize or at home and your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press she could have kept that advice\nI get the sense that the president just didn't agree with it [noise] um no actually\n... you know such damage where there's a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I've been announces ... over him and I alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and say\nIt's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI listen to what you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media for where you gonna lose that war secondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well wait better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him\nBut for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism let him parity with Leslie stall let him have a real conversation with a ... or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had them in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president's or there's a lot of people inside the calm seems like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like Mao props and him telling these stories that\nWere on average ... may be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is oh okay that's right 'cause I'm something inaccurately and and clearly and consistently\nOver ... listen I just left they show where these guys like like they they ... want them all day and night and so and they're calling him a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energize and I understand that and I understand if you're a military leader like some of the John Kelly that\nWould probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want\nAll that stuff to be dialed down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to so so but but we had to do then is you've got to tell them straight you say man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he said that he is well it's energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nAnd and this is always going to be as ... as long as Donald J Trump is the president United States is going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and the people that don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way there are some people were the personality is actually outweighing the policy where they're like okay look I Can't take the personality even though the policies are\nGood and David is in a diner Minnesota David emailed thanks for taking the time to answer questions on NPR my question is\nHave you ever in your personal experiences with Trump seen him do something for the public good out of ethical or moral reasons instead of doing it because of legal reasons are wanting to maintain an image or exchange favors if you can can we hear about it Anthony\nYeah no I don't really I haven't really seen any of that so I don't I don't like being one of those guys that tries to make stuff up and comment on ... and stuff that I haven't really seen\nFor that kind of the richest

few of your\nComments in terms of what you would do if you won the lottery Steven wrote on our Facebook page I check off every vice I never dreamed about ...\nMentally wrote on our Facebook page I'll never win because I don't gamble no lottery for me and Jim wrote on our Facebook page I'll take my chances with finding out if I can handle the wealth or not so easy for you to respond to Jim's comments in terms of\nFinding out if you can handle the wealth once the money going into your parents' hands how did they handle it [noise]\nAnd that's a great question and I'm I'm going to agree with him I'm not gonna lie everything that you know even if I say something negative about the wind today I Am not going to lie on such a hypocrite yes we have a ticket for tonight's drawing\nHuh one way though you\nKnow wait a minute wait a minute you already one wind blowing up a million if you win a lottery ... when was\nIt was it may it it it's\nInteresting because he knew what people here eighty million\nYou know I I never realized how much it decreases like if you take the cash option that Uncle Sam had hands out like\nI Need Fifteen times in that first year it just it really dwindle piano please don't get me wrong I down and she was or not to tie and all that but uh but I Will say that\nYou know it it I'm not going to lie and say that it was a complete cars for my family and when I say my family I'm going to talk about my husband and my\nTwo daughters so in so many ways it was a blessing because our parents did share small portion with my brother and I you know what that means that my kids can literally choose any primary and secondary education goal they won't they go to any school for any amount of time they can do\nAnything they want if you want to travel to Italy to study architecture because that your dream do it you know ... and that's an absolute blast say my husband and I both being and solve for sales we would have been able to afford that any way but it's nice to just have that cushion right um\nSo there are blessings but I Will say that the women has shown me personally the absolute\nDark side of human nature and you know it wasn't my women that I have absolutely experienced it I'm sure my parents would have many many more stories I'm In ... in speaking about my parents it it's strained our relationship you know I've chosen to become\nExtremely private about this when my husband and I moved to a different town to just kind of get away\nBecause my parents one and a state where you cannot remain anonymous and for them that with habits because they love to brag about it they loved the lab actually like it like look at bay where I'm more of the exact opposite and some of that is just out of fear you know I'm I'm\nKind of fear based anyway you know you worry about the people that are going to kidnap your kids for ransom I worry about my parents someone hitting them over the head making sure everyone stays home and\nI don't know I I Know we got to move on in in just a moment but I Wonder how you reflect back on that if you could go back to whatever the store was were your parents bought that winning ticket and see something to them before they bought it what what would you say\nIt would be the same thing that I Would tell\nAnyone who won tonight or if you won two million dollars if one two billion dollars it doesn't matter I think it\nIt's they absolutely need to have the typical advice that you hear you know surround yourself with a great tape a CPA a financial advisor at attorney but my big advice would be to be careful these are not necessarily the people that you\nWent to high school with your office is in a strip mall are handled your last divorce or whatever you know you've had you know the scale of your\nNew state has to match their ability to serve you and you know if you can't or may anonymous consider options that allows you to remain as anonymous is\nAs possible and then you control the message out you know I I Know that there are ways to do it and I think the last one is to just be aware of people's actions no matter how subtle you've gotta create your own litmus test of who becomes your tried right or not you're close family and it's not your friends\n... I really do appreciate you sharing your story with us despite your decision to remain anonymous Sally we'll call you both so we appreciate your sharing that with the snakes were much thank you\n[laughter] we did hear from some of you who have won some lotteries in the past although I still like my rule if you win more she came when twice but DJ in San Diego did win the lottery DJ emailed\nNot a big win but we won twenty six thousand dollars from the California supermodel plus some years ago got all five numbers but not the all important mega number we netted Nineteen point two thousand and one hand it was probably awash with all the money spent on the slips purchased in the years previous to that when\nOn the other hand the Nineteen point two K. was going to know how many people came out of the woodwork our shirt tales grew long the only thing I can remember is the purchase of our first flat screen TV and that went in the divorce shrug\nI continue to play Powerball and mega millions because\nWhy couldn't it be me\nJoining us now to continue our conversation from W GBH in Boston is ... a professor at Boston University's school of business\nWho conducts national studies on inheritance professors ... welcome to the program and having you on also with us is Susan Bradley the founder of the sudden money Institute\nWhich deals with people who need financial planning especially financial transition planning she joins us on a phone line which we apologize for the quality of but we're glad to have her Susan welcome to the program\nThank you so much professor ... let me start with you this gigantic jackpot how unprecedented is this for a jackpot to grow this high I mean I I've heard that one point six billion is the all time record is that right\nWell one point six billion the all time record but it only eclipses the previous record which happened back in January of two thousand and sixteen or by just a small amount the last record was almost one point five nine billion dollars but just to give your listeners an idea of how big move says if you pick the cash option\nAnd you invested in a relatively secure bonds the amount of interest you would get after taxes would be about a hundred thousand dollars per day can you imagine spending one hundred thousand dollars a day in day out and then at the end you'd still have the principal amount left over\nSusan you've worked with about two dozen individuals who've won the lottery give us a sense of how their lives change right away what happens on day one\nShop less capable or in some state of shock as Sally sat her father had a hard time I checked the lady or what have when you when you say so ... and they did they it's an overwhelming um get prevention is is very common and and it's very hard to\nGo silent with is it's very hard not to tell other\nPeople about it and in a perfect world you like to have some quiet time to do a lot of that happening and start to adapt to put the\nFirst ten days are I'm very intense it to you for a kind of thing but in the world of stress management it's cold yet stress not distressed", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "24"}
