I Am pro era\nNoah thanks very much for sharing your story with us we welcome more of your stories of what you've noticed in your school with regards to racial equity either what you've dealt with as a student or maybe what you're dealing with now as a student or a parent or teacher trying to improve\nRacial equity on campus before we bring in our next guest Steve I didn't want to ask you one thing about the way the documentary\nWas made I Wonder how you said about\nTelling the students' stories I mean there is a moment in one episode where either you or a cameraman tries to talk about one student about her cutting class I mean all the kids that you follow go through various struggles with\nIts class with grades with life what kinds of boundaries do you have to sent when you're telling a story about high schoolers\nWell that's a great question um I've always tried in the films I've done over the years is to a\n... have the subject feel like they have real agency in the making of what we're doing a you know the idea we aim for is is that we're really making the film with them not on them\nAnd yes ultimately we have editorial control but we take very seriously that kind of relationship and on this series it was vitally important that they're also be other filmmakers involved we had a diverse team of filmmakers Kevin ... Rebecca parish being Lou\n... you know Charles' story was followed by Kevin ... I mean I found a little bit with Charles but that's really Kevin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry I think that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships that important now the moment you're talking about is with Sierra that's actually a story I happened to be following\nAnd you know you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things at that time I felt was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more of your comments before we bring our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we fail to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period end of sentence\nAgility for funds we'd have watched every episode of America to me I absolutely love it\nI'm shocked at how clueless and the white teachers are especially that physics teacher the school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news of full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Stephen ... for his thoughts\nOn the series we did not get a response but the invitation remains open\nWe also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school next rouse we were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary eat or is that right see that's right\nWas that she more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmanda Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race in public policy\nAt the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called despite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to say thanks for having me also with us here at W. B. easy as David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor still Volkow thanks so much for have professors have you watched the series any part of it some of an older yes festival what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThing that struck me the hardest isn't episode to win one of the parents of student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the end the conversation that we do not have about schools\nThat have the illusion of integration and I said to loosen up immigration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students\nWhen this mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he still happening today that to me is the story of us ... professor Lewis what about you [noise]\nKnow one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in the series but I think one of the things that struck me as the silences some of that some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate in it wasn't the one that is\nThe the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families are the key leaders and that district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nA opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nPay by the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you're eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so deep that in mind in the conversation\nIf you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them tweets do not me [laughter] not ruin this film for you I don't want to Aaron bus if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety\nAt the one a dot org and that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org we're talking about racial\nEquity professor still vote what does that mean what does racial equity look like is it making sure\nThat black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people feel being nice to one another like how would we know racial equity if we had it right\nI mean I think this is and thank you for that question I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to a ... point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution\nSo when you talk about redistribution so now the question becomes who has had the least and now what are those things that they talk about that they meet the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it and I think is ... is the issue and concern give me an example of getting people what they need when they need a young person says we have\nA particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious\nNow there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse wherever that is that person needs to be in the conversation or that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people most often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition professor Lewis ... ... what\nDo you find that the big barriers to advancing toward racial equity is it is it funding is that the people involved is it different for every school in every district what tends to get in the ...\nWell I'm going to talk about the parks in the world and there are a lot of them and I think one of the things that um my colleague John Diamond and I found when we were doing the research for our book was that when you really try to understand why change it so hard it really is\nEspecially in these kind of communities about the folks who have a lot of resources that have been served well by those districts for a long time not wanting change to happen and we talk about this or that kind of form of opportunity hoarding\nBut it's a way of trying to find how race works today differently than it worked in the past in the past we might have said you can't be in my class or we're going to have separate schools all this kind of things today we had this have been near\nA racial integration and we what we do instead is create these racially segregated academic hierarchies within schools and the schools themselves play a big role in creating them and then a lot of the white families and the power families and they just play a big role and making sure that they don't go away\nTomorrow at noon on Ninety point nine W. B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station [noise]\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Americans for the arts committed to transforming America as communities through the arts and arts education

station\nBefore we get back to our conversation here in Chicago are worried about what we'll be talking about in Atlanta tomorrow poison it appears to be Russians preferred weapon of choice and we'll find out who Moscow was targeting and why\nWe like to know what questions you want answered so leave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one egg America's relationship with Russia and what was the Soviet Union has had its fair share of ups and downs but what message do you think Washington should be sending to Moscow now\nEight five five to three six one a one a and sci fi five to three six one two one two will dig deeper into the files of ... and get some of your questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors amend the Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one eight ... how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nBeing Spanish and the woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to wrap myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was whites unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like\nAn advanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way can push too far\nThat we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make\nTo me I I mean it's not in a a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough right when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and then how are those opportunities denied and real time\nAnd because one white student did not get one scholarship does not mean that\nBlack Latino students across the country do not are not see him Akeley denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve that's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out reactions that that finally\nWell I I'm not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdote experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason than there are other reasons is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not\nLiving in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white parents\nCharles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for any one high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin is just that reflect your experience and all my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like there's kind of lie her essay is there's this blanket we put over why kids is like your you know they always going to be one\nRegardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color they're like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of the sleeping bags but we ain't got one leg if everybody in only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also featured documentaries were like\nI wouldn't say like well I I didn't want to like compared to any of the students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interest in us because of what we do without extra curricula and so it was just already saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids aren't good you know but for someone who is in in any extra curricular is who doesn't have any type of\nUm nine students teacher relationship with any adult in the building they like it's hard to get you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there is Lincoln's vice sleeping bags whereas like\nAll other white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have a stake in the schools that parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then\nGot the kids who I mean like me luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but\nOther than that right isn't that they're really so you kind of have to fend for yourself exactly and we like it that's just not the case you know I think it goes to showing 'em which episodes that we must have done it was like\nMost of the kids and his our news um tutoring sessions are usually white fair and all white is so yeah All right and that's that's part like you know personal accountability but that's also to school like you got to have kids of color\nBut that was just the one right there you know so well\nTo that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years\n[noise] you know it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you can take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like Evanston like Brookline mass\nLike Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens and he has a district that tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts tickets that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in and we track them early\nAnd what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids on higher tax get more they get better and better teaching and so we have kids that might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time and so\nWhen we look at schools like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structures that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably\nGoing to uh take racial disparities that exist in our society and and reproduce them in our schools and that this ... the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these track get created and if you look at the history of the really deep\nRacist history and tracking and general\nRace also becomes explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational faces in school or Ninety percent white\nAnd the least advantage educational expect you know places in the same exact school are predominantly black should have us all up in arms but the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nAnd I I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and what a good education is and you know I've heard a PE teachers including Ty Williams the black a future in the series\nLament the fact that as a piece students often just want to be given the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning but just ... it's a game it's in supporting game\nYou mean in terms of a larger kind of a ... as an editor for vacation like having a more well read learned\n... some of the some of the most interesting and I think for far reaching in deep teach in what's going on at lower levels which is not to excuse the system that tremendous talking about but we just read the fine being educated in such narrow ways it's about ACT scores and GPA's\nAnd that you know and that's what we defined as being an educated person\nWell I I hear you on that Steve but at the same time you know I think about I'm not trying to excuse the sooner no I I I hear that and I hear that though I ... I Wonder though professor stove all about you know kids who grow up in in rough for parts of town that have been told your ticket out as your education", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "25"}
