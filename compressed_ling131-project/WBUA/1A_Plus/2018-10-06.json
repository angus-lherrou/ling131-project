with links to an Olympic doping scandal earlier a Dutch authorities said they had foiled a cyber attack against the international chemical weapons watchdog let's explain for\nMen working for Russian military intelligence or caught trying to hack the computer network at the headquarters of the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons OPEC W.\nThat's the group that was investigating the use of chemical weapons in Salzburg England that attack on the four Russian spy and in Syria equipment was found in the trunk of a car there was a wife I intend to hidden under a jacket on the shelf\nReports suggest the set was working when Dutch security officers disrupted the attack\nDavid Sanger let me start with you what what's going on here\nWell what's going on here is that we're beginning to see that the DNC hack and everything that we've been obsessed with rightly so since the twenty sixteen election\nWas to the Russians just a small slice of how they have you cyber as the main way that they see to disrupt and undermine not only foreign governments\nBut those who would be opponents of ... or those who are busy investigating other Russian malfeasance so when you go across the indictment and the other day that we got from the British and from the Dutch\nUh yesterday and and the day before\nWhat it adds up to as as soon as you begin an investigation into Russian malfeasance you should expect hackers from what was formerly known as the G argue the military intelligence unit of the Russian military\nTo be at your doorstep or in the case of the chemical weapons or agency to be in the Marriott Hotel parking lot across the way and what they're doing is seeking to get into computer systems disrupt\nSteel e mails under cut the legitimacy of the organization

asks with the loss and result in widespread dissemination of the CIA tool kit which allows one to spoof hacking from another country\nHow can cyber bread crumbs lead to certainty that another country is actually guilty David what do you think\nA lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems uh years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of the U.S [noise]\nBut the fact of the matter is that a combination of forensic evidence a motive\nPast use so similar tools can get you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go do it\nThe bigger question facing many governments is once they've found this out and perhaps decide to announce it as happened in these most recent cases than the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders and I'm In August we haven't seen them they're all classified that pushes down into the system or the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyber attacks back without having presidential sign off\nTill now that's been something that the only only the president could authorized the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now it's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution pretty good before you strike back\nYou know who to attack yeah great married before we move on\nFrom this first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to shut down a power grid or turn off or you know hydroelectric dam through the Internet\nBut beyond that do we have a sense that certain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing with cyber attacks the world clearly hasn't figured this out is anyone making progress I think about the EU because I hear so much about Internet regulations from there on a consumer level but\nOn a military level is anyone making progress or not that I'm aware of the U.S I think\nIt's still the world leader and in in terms of you know advanced Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear or Russia or China and North Korea or Iran\nBut a ... figuring out or response in how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond or you you're entering really uncharted territory\nVivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to figure this out to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or his Russia really got the whole world kind of running with here on\nLaw honestly what we've seen in the last couple of days of coordination has um indictments and you know raising concerns about I'm signing an otherwise obviously there's a lot of discussions that are taking place\nWhere countries our western allies trying to coordinate some kind of effort to counter the threat that that is that the Russians posed but at the same time again you have so many ah restrictions and so many um uncertainty as to how to approach the cyber world in general and cyber threats\nAnd as David said the U.S trying to really formulate some sort of attack plan or something to counter to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have um we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves\nIn the past but obviously you know the U.S is still trying to figure out a way forward I'm having looked at what happened to us and the two thousand sixteen election still we're talking about the fact that we are vulnerable and two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable on twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves get alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nAlthough it's funny kind of a decentralization of the way that we felt that we are so many different kinds of voting systems might you know way kind of a health salon it helps insulated from ...\nIn fact that we've got all these different utility company yeah that you know don't but but the key element here as we've done a better job at discussing internally how we would do counterattacks than we have organizing the world than the sort of digital Geneva Convention what standards of what's on limits\nOften it let's shift gears and talk about the Nobel Prizes particularly the Nobel Peace prize the winners were announced this morning Dr Denis ... and ... one for their work combating sexual violence as a weapon of war since\nThe announcement from the Nobel Committee said in part quote Dennis Lou quite it is to help or who has devoted his life defending these victims not him a rod is the witness who tells the abuses perpetrated against herself and others\nWere rod is an Iraqi woman she was captured and held by the Islamic state skates captivity after three months and told to her story in a book called the last girl\nDr ... founded a hospital in eastern Congo that treated thousands of women many of whom are survivors of gang rape ... pretty extraordinary people to be winning the prize especially as we've learned more about how sexual violence is being used\nYeah really has to two individuals who seem really deserving the peace prize has been a lot of had a lot of controversy in recent years very politicized\nA couple of people who really been thrust into dangerous situations handle that with with incredible courage and and Dr ... up built this hospital in eastern Congo which is in the middle of nowhere and just a very remote region\nTwenty years ago for maternal care they're just as much health care of that was his intent\nBut it's the Congolese civil war metastasize um rate became a huge issue a huge problem that the various factions un peacekeepers who are involved in in rape there and so he became the voice of\nRape being used as a weapon of war and so he's been at this for Twenty years very prominent a voice but still operating in a very ah a dicey region of very deserving winter I mean\nI I can really speak for the case of um ... who I I spend a lot of time in Iraq and two dozen Fifteen sixteen\nI'm intervening gives you the women who were released from captivity from ice that said\nThey have to obviously psychologically physically or the the the use of sexual assault\nAnd rape as a tool in war is obviously a huge thing but you have to also remember that these women go back to their tried to go back home a lot of their family shunned them because of cultural sensitivities to such things and so their lives are essentially up ended fight that's their families a lotta times don't take them back home\nA lot of these women were impregnated I'm as a result of this and had to really know where to go because\nThey were single mothers which in Iraq as is just completely a taboo\nAnd so I you know it's something that you should raising awareness for that's something really really important you had a lot of people on the ground in Iraq\nTrying to educate these families that this is not of no false to the women that they had no say in the matter but obviously you know changing cultural perceptions that's it's it's an uphill battle and so this one the other way I'm trying to do that and that's a it's it's worth the the know notoriety that just ending\nLet's shift gears and talk about China vice president Mike Pence spoke yesterday accusing China of trying to sway American public opinion and undermined the Trump Administration\nTo put it bluntly President Trump's leadership is working in China wants a different American president there can be no doubt China is meddling in America's democracy\nDavid what is vice president Pence mean by meddling what do we know about what China actually is do well it's\nIt's pretty fascinating because he is appropriating the language of the Russian attacks from on the twenty sixteen election and transferring it over to a different set of activities\nThat the Chinese are are involved in that there's no question that the Chinese have views cyber before in for political purposes but they largely haven't used it here they've used it in Taiwan they've used it in their\nArguments with Tibet they've used it internally a lot they've used it to some degree in Australia and New Zealand\nBut what he is arguing is that in putting together retaliatory tariffs terrorists that are retaliating for terrorists the United states put on trial and that\nThey are aiming at states and districts that are key the President Trump and therefore causing pain\nTo workers there and they're saying that that accounts meddling well if that's the case we've done the same thing and foreign countries where we when we imposed tariffs frequently do it with a political goal in mind you're trying to change the political behavior of the country\nYou are for more information about underwriting called six one seven three five three four

are very unclear [noise] you know sexual assaults don't just happened to Democrats and they don't just happen to Republican and I I think that makes it\nVery very unclear to understand how this debate

about Iran\nAfter the Trump Administration abandoned the nuclear deal that was negotiated during President Obama's tenure and reimposed sanctions Iran took us to court the international court of justice to argue that the u._s. actions violated the terms of the Nineteen fifty five treaty of amity\nWell the Trump Administration hit back this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the U.S is ending that treaty\nThis was a decision frankly that his thirty nine years overdue in July around brought in Marilyn's case and the international court of justice alleging violations of the treaty of amity\nRon six to challenge the United states' decision to seize participation in the Iran nuclear deal into reimpose the sanctions were lifted as part of that deal\nRuns attempted interfere with the sovereign rights of the United states to take a waffle actions necessary to protect our national security\nAnd Iran is abusing I suggested for political and propaganda purposes\nThat was secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking on Wednesday Vivian salami some have said that ending this treaty is largely symbolic or is that so it\nYeah it is an hour and a lot of ways I I think in general it's more just I'm reinforcing the administration says standing efforts to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and um crackdown on Iran and kind of show that they're not messing around and so\nI'm basically this was just one more step in that process but as far as any real uh changes on the ground it really doesn't do much it's really just our sponsor\nTo on the international court of justice ruling that ah that essentially said that sanctions that ... they re imposing sanctions um we're not fair to Iran\nBring my we step back for just a second what is this treaty of amity [noise]\nUh I'm sure that was the question at the state department I just had this vision of some low level staff are going through the basement looking\nTreaty on ... avenue trivial am damage that I could result\nThink through what we've heard about you know this the the big acronym of Jaycee peel away the Iran nuclear deal but what is this treaty of\nAmman well in Nineteen fifty three the U.S helped orchestrate that coup in Iran bringing the shah of Iran back to power or if they were us and Iran were buddy buddy at that time and so two years later\nIt's yeah you brought me back to power sure treaty of anti ... and they were indeed good friends from fifty three until\nThe Seventy nine revolution this is the shah who was deposed in these women revel in the Islamic Revolution of ... Seventy nine so for thirty nine years uh there has been no enmity between us and abroad\nUm this again seems very symbolic I'm just a last little relics that somehow didn't get shredded after the uh the revolution and Seventy nine it was\nGrandson of Theodore Roosevelt CIA operative who almost singlehandedly staged this coup and then they got everybody we put in power to go sign the treaty port Kermit he's getting no respect from the state department these days is\nCarmen Roosevelt of digging it I I liked that name for for a man who had such a history permanent Roosevelt and and know where the American David ... is there any real effect in terms of\nThe sanctions the consequences to the U. S. for refusing to lift them if this treaty of Emmett see is more symbolic we're might there be more tangible impact\nSo the tangible impact is November when President Trump has said that he will impose the full sanctions on Iran He's given allies warning that this is coming\nAnd those sanctions if he does it as he has pronounce would say to any ... company around the world but particularly European companies\nIf you do business with Iran you're not doing business with the United states and it's an effort to choke off the Iranians\nBy making the big aircraft makers Boeing's ready pulled out the big oil a production equipment makers all get out of Iran and they were doing that what's happening now though is that the ... the Europeans are saying we're going to find a method\nTo buy oil from Iran without clearing it in dollars so that the u._s. can effect that with the sanctions and a number of us went up and met a with the Iranian foreign minister when he was at the un\nAh last week and he made an argument to assess who Saturday evening that he believed that this method was going to come together so we're heading toward a conflict between\nThe U.S and its European allies over on\nDo we have a sense I think I feel like the the big issue really is runs nuclear program and the argument from the other nations who are still signatories to this this deal the Iran nuclear deal\nIs that it's it's not perfect but it's good and that it has done something to impede Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon do we have a sense of where we stand in that regard setting the economic stuff aside for a moment just this put any closer on that path\nOr we still kind of in a holding pattern I mean what is was that looks like\nWell the Europeans as you say they they consistently say that they they don't want to North Korea is I mean this is of course before we became buddy buddy and\nPresident Trump declared that he and Kim Jong un or and love\nUh we we didn't want to North Korea is in the sense that we didn't want this to very active or potentially rope nuclear states and so\nI'm a checked Iran was always going to be better than an unchecked Iran and so that was the Europeans argument for why the nuclear deal had to continue despite its imperfections and so um the issue is is that um as far as violations to the actual and denuclearization goes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "06"}
