columnist for the Boston Globe rabbi Jill Jacobs the executive director of trucks and ... from buzzfeed news apologies to those of you who are trying to call in\nCalls [noise] some of which we've had the screen out very quickly now we're going to do our best to put some of the most useful and positive unproductive calls on the air\nTo those of you who've been making that job a little bit harder I think it might be worth sharing a comment from Alexander who emailed I have a message for those who hold this kind of hate in their hearts I don't care who you are I don't care what race you are a part of what creed you follow who you voted for and twenty sixteen I Will find you\nAnd I will love you there's absolutely nothing you can do to stop me\nCharlie ... let's get back to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and then the open people get pushback\nWhen it is driven underground it has given legitimacy and leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert Bowers had there so\nUh ... dot com is a sort of a basically a Twitter clone um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racist begets [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter\nUh for for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know the absolute power of a free speech but when it ended up happening with gab is uh it it became a cesspool it became a place where only the sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a\nA place where white nationalism a and and extreme\nOr bigotry homophobia whatever ah has has been embraced and and uh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say at his name was ... maybe not radicalize necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nA truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nPosted before at the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA A N unproductive vent for a lot of that hatred I'm an after\nAfter um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming in realizing this for the first time\nA note noticed that at that at this place is a dark place to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying words are not bullets in social media posts I have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this ... free speech is different from from action\nAnd I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWhen it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of a free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily in free speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences then then they're sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protected so hard if it means nothing right um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people don't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nRabbi Jacobs I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like Gavin job is not the only place where this kind of speech to lift weights on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment quit First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes curtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given to the new kind of\nSpeed and ... that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome to folks like you\nShirt well first of all it's not new is that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death in life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more truly seeing how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years that certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to ... such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want\nThey also just wanted to say something about that both sides are as um\nThat's that you read there has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae B. T. Q. people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported and involved and from the very top from the president of the United states that the white nationalist see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who's the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power in the United states which of course trap the taps into very old anti Semitic tropes ...\nYeah I'm a I'm Sorry where am I going to do you want to get a little deeper into that a lot of folks a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that in there I'd love to to get your thoughts on that I mean the president\nDid address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism and every other forms of evil and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms\nAnd we come together as one American people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nMust stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must end unquote\nGotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential role in all of this Susan lives in Silver Spring Maryland right outside D.C Susan writes I look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers that his or her statements have far reaching consequences Indira I'd well\nThis was of course incredibly disturbing to have the president once again demonizing the press and calling us enemies of the people\nUm that I interviewed him the tree and with the people I mean this is this absolutely journalists are essentially in a way the life blood of a democracy if we're not able to inform and educate citizens um about what's going on in their country if we are not able to hold\nWords matter and rhetoric and kind of climate bigoted rhetoric matters on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News tomorrow morning at\nFive or Ninety point nine W.

Maryland writes I Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope after the massacre it was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears\nWe were told it was just trumping trumped telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced and root as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAsia W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially accepted\nHate speech with her own words are votes and our money\nThese in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions there needs to be a consistent strong resistance to the hateful devices speech that his anti American\nJournalists needs to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignorant ramps if not you\nWho make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nWell thanks so much for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious situation also very much scientific\nI think there's a strong feeling\nAmong a lot of us that there has been a a much lower except in on the left of people who have a strong religious views and a close connection that if Israel I mean uh I teach at a small just ... here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of us do feel uncomfortable about you know build at a\nYou know express a strong here instead of Israel or it's this religious views that aren't\nUm you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you are how the school deals with it\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we mean there are students who are you know are not particularly\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school and they often find their camps as an friendly they find professors especially a friendly if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh\nSo I mean while it's true I mean I don't think it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence from the left and that that's true I think you are seeing and I think our students feel a certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um\nAnd it's you know I don't know we we felt\nWe do some kids they probably shouldn't need need to shut up you know\nAnd I don't say shut up but the ... you know you can't argue with that we're just kind of who you're going to have to learn to live with that kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard thing\nYeah to pick their battles I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised to do that not\nThe not federal everything will David I'm going to be can be very hard\nDavid let me put that to you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of David comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say Seventy first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course that high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I Want to be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and I'll laugh and very often it expresses itself\nAs as attacks on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not even criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of his trials governmental policies we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies that rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry out violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel that the targets are actually choose who are shopping in a grocery store manager of a store and a synagogue\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is it it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore\nWho's ... who was criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. then said we have somebody at the very top who is in ...\nAnd riling up his people\nMake it to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation we get so many of your calls as we can is well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our ancient rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strengths and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better India would you react to that I feel like part of what\nWorked [laughter] I hate to say in Pittsburgh favorite but one of the things I think helped in this whole process as you described scroll hill\nIf it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had so in crisis struck they just they just rolled out and he knew how to lock arms with one another\nThat's right I mean a squirrel hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community um it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon University in ...\nAnd a lot of the people who live in ... well hell are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentist it's an educated community at tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall is also um you know politically liberal community\nAnd it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton and this last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community as Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help in Pittsburgh favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning I'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta\nJust four months ago and attack or killed five reporters in Indianapolis News written the capital is that\nSo you know I Do think we have to worry about drawing the line um I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\nThen just attack on the one in the air just mentioned CNN is reporting that suspicious package that was addressed to CNN was intercepted in a post office in Atlanta let's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one from Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "30"}
