is called dear to lead daring greatly and rising strong at work and she joins us here in Studio ... brown welcome to one day I'm excited to be here\nI read the book and you say early in the book that it does follow up through a lot of your previous work I imagine there was a point at which you wanted to take some of the findings you head\nBruce you had your developed through your research and apply them were practically especially because you do speak to a lot of business groups across the country around here\nI Do I say I spend about for the past five years I Would say I spend Ninety percent of my time in organizations\nWorking with leaders and talking about leadership innovation and creativity uh recently talking about um AI machine learning and kind of the consequences of that that the rise of the machine [laughter] so\nYou know for me it was probably\nI don't know six or seven years ago um we had this mission at kind of where I work\nAt our organization of making the world are brave our place and it really struck me that if we don't change the way we work we can't change the world because we spend too much time at work\nOn and I think everyone listening at least my experiences than when that's a bad experience with NASA toxic environment when we are in bad relationships at work\nOur whole lives go just fall apart\nOne of the things that you've described in your speeches I forget which of your type talks it was but you talked about how business group started reach out to you and they say they want you to talk about creativity and innovation and and the future but but please don't bring up shame vulnerability or any of that difficult stuff and your response to that was\n[laughter] I can see why you have a problem [laughter] you know David right there yeah I mean that's the thing so if you don't have a\nCulture that\nIs prepared and understands failure sat back and disappointment don't ask people to innovate\nBecause failure is a prerequisite for innovation it's by that you know you bankrupt innovation on its own term it's when you say nothing can fail\nYou know and then what happens and I think we see this a lot today and I think we see it

empathy and vulnerability and how they can help make some of the best employees bosses and workplaces with Bernie brown her new book is called dear to lead\nSpeaking of the world of work we learned today that a high profile woman in the Trump Administration is leaving her job at the end of this year Nikki Haley is America's ambassador to the United nations and this morning she announced her resignation in the resignation letter Haley says she plans to return to the private sector ...\nHe was formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation for being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShe will also be remembered in part for striking back at White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get confused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared and Yvonne guy Jared is such a\nGenius that no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way he did um what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably evolved on and off as just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the scenes\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're that our country because there and I'm a minister I said I'll just have to say I'm certainly thank you to my family Michael at the same and um my two little ones I adore them\nAnd continue ... you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and energy into it um but they have a lot\nReally wanted to make America\nI'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in this lake and [noise] um for the next ... to come in but now\nI don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was I was governor for six years and we dealt with a hurricane a thousand year ... shooting a shooting there was a lot and then to come in\nAnd just getting years have Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to the southwest enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so they should have been out\nMy time and I will say this um if are all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty I can promise you what I'll be doing as campaigning for this one so I look forward to support in front\nThat his invested or Nikki Haley who represents to us to the United nations speaking this morning at the White House announcing that she will be resigning at the end of the year\nBack now to our conversation with Renee brown and maybe by way of a transition we should get to an email ... writes I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed work environments ... have you noticed the difference\nAnd absolute absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune\nFrom the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen increased polarization in our families and our neighborhoods among our friends is at work too and it feels dicey or at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful and especially when there's power differential and it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of these other dividing line\nYeah cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nWe'll see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to turn to open up\nIf that ... toward keeping the professional and the personal separate that work I'd just needs to be the one person I Do to keep my head down and to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we started talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable and being open and compassionate and get that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted\nOr you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love that is going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like it's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of like\nI I think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I'd never seen anything meaningful or significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career\nThat's just not how we get contributions and so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and\nRumble and we use the term rumble because it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle it's a foundational skill set\nI don't think spending what ... what are we spent about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\nIs something that most\nLogical emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high and we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experience as all of who you are to address the problems from reading your\nBook and based on the research that fueled the book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a scar while you know stars tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tigers there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really it was\nActually voided my hypothesis going in so Dr ... yeah it just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at Jesse what I'm going to find but\nNot in this case so we asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders that there is a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred and fifty sea level global leaders\nThree years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were NBA an MBA students at Wharton Kellogg Rice University and then\nTons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when it was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need greater leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear\nBut then we went and talked to several dairy leaders inside so you're not afraid very often and they were like\nWhat I'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long and it was like so that blew my hypothesis and fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership\nIs armor it's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger\nThat having to be the nowhere and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really you know and it's interesting what you said about scars intend to places\nNot only does armor keep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow\nAnd metastasize\nSo we need to create work cultures were armor is not rewarded or needed\n[noise] we asked some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first let's hear from Adam\nMy name is Adam Adam calling from Nashville, Tennessee I'm a paramedic and firefighters and that was such a definitely feel like I Need to do my job perfectly at all times because there are definitely times when ... you're on a lot of jobs\nOn the other hand I worked for department it's very good about what he's done well you\nKnow troll workers and I definitely do a good job of trying to share and better get stressed the job\nAdam thanks very much for calling and sharing your story with the snow contracts Adam's story which is the bill's story she works in a similarly strict workplace with a rather different take\nOn a doctor and a big hospital and it's just really hard to suggest that anyone to feel safe there you have to watch everything you say and do and there's so many corporate compliance policies I Would say like it's not a safe place to be human at all\nIs the bill we appreciate you sharing your story as well bringing it sounds like very or one might think that being in one of these high pressure leadership environments would lead to more common experiences with both of these folks are in places where laws are on the line with wildly different experience is what's the variable that makes a difference there\nYou know we were a stain on the county that's next time on here now\nTomorrow at noon on Ninety point nine W. B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Americans for the arts committed to transforming America as communities through the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts industry which employs four point six million people nationwide\nLearn more at Americans for the arts dot org\nAnd from the Alfred P Sloan Foundation bridging science and the arts by supporting the history of scientific theory misused in eugenics crusade premiering October sixteenth on PBS more at Sloan dot org\nA quick heads up about our conversation on tomorrow's program about climate change the world is talking about a new report by some of the most renowned climate scientists putting a finer point on just how little time we have to do something about our warming planet\nThe report states that we have until about the year twenty forty before we reach a point of no return it also gives reasons for hope that we have the skills to do something if we work together\nWe want to answer your questions about what it would practically take to fight climate change leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one and\nWe'd also love to know what you're working on to fight climate change it a big way\nTell us your story eight five five to three six one a one day or you can use our app won a vox pop to send us a high quality audio file and to keep up to date on future topics you can find one a vox pop V. O. X. P. O. P.\nIn the store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow\nOne day back now to our conversation with ... brown author of the new book dear to lead with regards to arm or Monday sold emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah any boundaries are actually a big party\nImportant um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense it it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I meant to protect feeling good about myself\nOver many and I work for it\nSo there's a difference between say armor an image\nSuch as kind of self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's more it's on a deeper level now it's\nOn a deeper into one of the greatest examples that armor armored leadership versus airing leadership has one form of armor we see a lot and folks is that need to be right that it's that I've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being a learner and getting it right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures in broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ...\nAs a woman of color an immigrant and an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that distrust well here's what are the\nBiggest findings I think is that\nOne of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the last of vulnerability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic incident I mean racism\nHomophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege those are those are everyday traumas and it is real that ... that\nYou know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why it's leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender is another you know I I think the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happen after the Ford testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of wondering away or was it was all got to go yeah who was you know\nBut absolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is ... that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some\nKind of mission statement or vision clarification or posters everywhere thing this is Jeff who are supposed to be and then it's really worth nothing more than the paper on which is printed I work at some companies\nWhere I've been to some companies were the value statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well what what was even start you suggest\nThat we should limit our core values to to yeah just to end the long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list that I really struggled to Barrow down through my two why only two\nWell here's the thing is you don't operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat pester\nI mean it really is [laughter] it's just really a poster so like a movie point in my head that little tone yeah [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know and so what was so\nYou know operation allies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that had taken the time to say you know what\nI some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in and so\nThe two is really kind of backing into the data the men and women who had the capacity to be the most courageous can identify their values and they had two to three values and you know I have you know\nThere's a long list in the book like we talked about and there's hardly Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nAltruism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independent self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to at my ... my two core values for me are facing\nThey're the core values because it's a place where every other thing on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we had a companion work buckets free it's downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational as an end to behaviors\nOn his changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assessed shoot every quarter\nMix on the values that you were to do it\nLike for example one of our values is take the care taking care of each other ourselves and the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you adapt\nAnd so I think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that as a real core finding which has courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it's learning how to rumble with phone or ability living into your values which we're talking about right now\nIt's braving trust understanding how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nDo you need to declare these values I mean I I Would be fascinated to know what you lift me right now fake my to core values are because I Know what they are I went through the list and I finally figured out my too but I don't know that anyone would guess what my to war based on who I Am the work I Do like\nI guess one sure catcher I sure OK face\nNo\nThere's not one of my two chords but its encompassed in one of my two comments but no I mean it's how such as you are I don't know maybe I should maybe I shouldn't and we're talking about vulnerability Joshua no but I'm the host I don't have to doing I'm just I'm In charge here here we got ... no no I was OK okay fine I'll tell you what the\nFreedom and growth those are my two values\nAnd give me an example out of behavior that supports freedom\nUm well\nFor me being out yeah one thing yeah for its freedom I'm being a better\nListener on this program because if I value the freedom to tell my own story I have to then extending that to you and I can't monopolize discussion on my best days I Will do for less talking and former listing",
