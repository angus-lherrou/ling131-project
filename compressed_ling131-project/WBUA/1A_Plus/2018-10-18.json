Elizabeth Warren and President Trump their ongoing feud over Warren claiming to have tribal ancestry the senator has addressed her heritage in the past including at this year's National Congress of American Indians\nI get why some people think they would have to be made here\nYou won't find my family members on any role and I'm not enrolled in a tried and I want to make something clear I respect that distinction I understand that tribal membership is determined by tribes and only by tribes\nMy mother's family was part Native American and my daddy's parents were bitterly opposed to their relationship\nNow in the scheme of things it doesn't matter if Senator Warren really is a verifiable tribal heritage\nClearly it does to her especially after the president referred to her as Pocahontas and said he would give a million dollars to the charity of her choice if she could prove or ancestry that apparently led the senator to take a DNA test who's results she says prove that she is charity\nThat drew criticism from tribal leaders like the Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck Hoskins junior who spoke on MORNING edition\nUm and then we're now at the point where she's taken a DNA test and this I think muddy the waters for a lot of Americans on a subject that they don't know a great deal about so that's what the concern is is that we're a sovereign nation we have a very specific\nMeans by which you are a turkey citizen that's true of all Indian nations and for senator in this context of this ongoing back and forth political a fight or to talk about DNA uh it really undermines tribal interest frankly\nOn top of that the tests did nothing to stop the presidents insults he tweeted quote Pocahontas the bad version sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one one thousand twenty fourth\nFar less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her quote DNA test is useless even they don't want her\nPhoney and quote what\nIs the story actually mean for Native Americans right now and what else matters to these voters that the rest of America should know about joining us via Skype

tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nHi Sheila this is Carol elaborately uh I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to us that we were part of the ... tribe in Oklahoma we\nApplied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted and it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um we can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us Marjorie hand can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but ... broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections is Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back I'm a retired\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community is one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of along are in big part of that is I think really important ... one of the things I Love to think about is shown is was hundred bastard on hunted mastodon hunted best it I think about that long arc\nYeah yeah I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing\nThat you're part of a community that goes back\nMillennia you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether their intrinsic or extra benefits\nOf being an acknowledge member of a tribe that are worth protecting that are worth keeping in their proper places I mean Carol talked about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what other kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our ... our our children are native languages are traditions are land\nThe water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA test is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native [noise]\nYou know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it they take our language and they can modify it they take our spirituality and come modified and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of the family lore or they speak with some smog in title ... like they've lived the life of a native\nLike somebody's ever called them an engine or a our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies out the door even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nI should note by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today that we did a discussion about these DNA testing kids the ones that say fine Dr ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October seventh things we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from we spoke to geneticist\nNamed Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what DNA can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you're going to do one of these home DNA tests\nYou'll find that conversation with Adam Rutherford on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one to let her a dot org Brittany tweeted I Am a county and kick Hanukkah or mohawk\nAnd I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help me to issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou ate progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focused on this\nYou would progressive she must have known why we both Kerry living 'cause we were going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nNorth Dakota has\nA voter identification law that has been stayed by the court in town now last week the Supreme Court\nI decided to essentially and let it go into effect for the November election\nSo what that means his new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election as you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between us and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate\nBook and challenger polls have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve setting the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voters she had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American\nAnd so this voter id law\nCould potentially fall heavily upon Native Americans courts had stayed at because they said that that north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea in the first place\nSo what kinds of ID are we talking about like what is the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box is they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient so if you have\nID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and this election you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that I Do you use in the primary is no longer good for the general\nElection a lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by their supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has that been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about it as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also because the the state has argued that\nA mailing address doesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even added vertically\nVote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast a ballot and the wrong precinct would this would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if your mailing address is somewhere different than where you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population near reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential dress\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you are in North Dakota or elsewhere love to hear from your your North Dakota but email is one a at W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us at one eighty or comment on our Facebook page\nJerry what did you hear from people in North Dakota about how this law is affecting them is this on people's radars is kind of more of a a smaller issue\nI'd say it is and also you have to put it against the larger contact\nI'm Sorry you see it as it is a big issue ...\nOh I think it's really on people's radar absolutely an issue and I also think there's some context around it when I was reporting from North Dakota from the Standing Rock reservation which is in North and South Dakota but the north Dakota part is affected by this\nI'm a you know really one of the things that I was interested in one of the reasons I went there even before the Supreme Court ruling is because voter turnout there is the lowest in the state\n... it was the lowest in the state before this and that's because there are challenges that people their face and getting to the polls so I I think you have this law now becoming a new complication for this election that has the potential to drive turnout even lower and your people reacting to that their their\nExcuse me their tribal governments and nonprofits that are taking steps to try and help people get residential address as if they need them assigned trying to make sure that they can obtain id and looking to mobilize voters and find ways to get them to the polls whether those\nI'm this station and from the Annenberg Foundation committed to supporting educating and engaging communities in the United states and globally for more than twenty five years learned more at Annenberg Foundation dot org [noise]\nFrom American for the arts committed to transforming Americans communities through the arts and arts education supporting the nonprofit arts industry which employs four point six million people nationwide learn more and Americans for the arts dot org\nAnd from the any e Casey foundation\nTomorrow we'll continue our conversation about the mid term elections with a national look at major races and issues we've looked at great panel but we could use your help to focus the discussion what are your main questions in your main concerns about the midterms candidates polls voter turnout controversies or anything else\nLeave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one day which we talk about tomorrow when we talk about the midterms on a national\nLevel it's eight five five to three six one two one two you can also send us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop you can download the app that's V.

A. M. U. dot org perhaps one of the candidates on your radar\nIs Deb Holland who joins us by phone talking about her experiences she's a democratic nominee for New Mexico's first congressional district and she has a Pueblo of Laguna citizen Deb welcome to want to\nThank you so much\nWhy are you what what made you decide to run for Congress\n[noise] well I've been involved in politics in New Mexico for the a number of years and I was just finishing up my term is the state chairwoman of the Democratic party of New Mexico and I just felt that I wanted to continue to\nUh work for my state and worked for the the people I Love here and so uh the seat opened up and I I felt that um I Would have a good chance of winning and so I decided to run to be a strong voice for the people of New Mexico\nNow New Mexico's first district just looking on the map that includes Albuquerque and some of the areas south east of New Mexico is that right\n[laughter] so well there's some areas north and there's some there's some areas east and west there's two tribal communities and the district Sandia Pueblo and the total harshly a Navajo Nation chapter [laughter] so um\nSo it does it geographically it's not large but it has a very diverse population so that's\nGreat now if you win next month so that would make you the first Native American congresswoman in American history ... what would that mean to you\n[noise] well of course what I always say is that I Can't speak for my tribe or any tribe but\nUh uh my perspective growing up uh in to a ... a woman\nUh with my my mom and my grandparents you know teaching may our culture and traditions and just understanding you know having worked for several tribes and and understanding about the issues and the challenges that we face a which\nIncidentally are are the same as a lot of other places are in New Mexico and across our country so I just feel like having that perspective at the table\nWill mean you know something um something good for a for our country a voice that we haven't yet heard\nGive us a sense of what some of those issues are that might be affecting tribal populations in your district that you'd like Congress to pay more attention to or deal with differently\n[noise] sure sure well of course you know there's always housing ah that's always an issue of for a lot of tribal communities but it's also an issue for a lot of rural communities across our state as well uh\nWe are on in my campaign I have a I have we've made renewable energy I'm pretty much the number one issue that I'm campaigning on and I think that ah that would create thousands of jobs for the district and not just in the in the city of Albuquerque but\nIn the rural communities so um so that's one thing turtle communities always always\nAbout our education system\nAnd so that's something that that is high on my list as well as well as health care right we we have of our population here in New Mexico's medicate eligible that includes a twenty two tribal communities that we have here in the state and so uh that's always a an important issue as well\nWe're speaking to dip hauling the Democratic nominee for New Mexico's first congressional district she is the ... of Laguna citizen\n... I I have no context for dealing with tribal populations in politics and you said there is quite an array of diversity among the tribes that would that you would be representing\nIn Congress can you give folks just a sense of what it's like to try to represent the issues of all those different groups do you find that there is a handful of issues the kind of overlap every one or do you really have to be sensitive to what this tribe is asking for versus what that tribe is asking for and and we're the differences are\nSure I mean I think there's some of that ... ... absolutely there's there you know they'll they'll be some competing issues along the way but but really I'm land water\nUh our environment is all I mean that's sort of a\n... those are issues that transcend um\nYou know tribal lines so to speak to issues that that all of us are concerned about and so I'm so I'm I'm a lifelong environmentalist and you know I I'm a I'm somebody who used to go down to the\nTo the field with my grandfather and hold weeds and pick worms off of corn um so I Know I understand the value of clean water and clean land to our people and I think that is that's an issue that\nTranscends a lot of tribes across the country um but\nYou know the issues you were talking about earlier with voting that that is that's definitely an issue that all of us care about as well because we deserve a to have a voice at the table that's something I've been fighting for for a long time I've I've been getting out the vote in Indian communities for nearly Twenty years\nBecause I've always felt that we should have a say in who are elected officials are so um so that's a passion of mine as well and and I want to work to make sure that that our voices are always heard in that respect\nI don't want to keep you too much longer but I Do wonder what you make of this larger surge of Native American candidates this year ... what do you think is behind that\nWell of course ...
