Boston's NPR News station\nThey didn't break that they're pretty good access is obviously a long list of the system\nTrade Center in Manhattan this is\nThe New Yorker radio our co production of WNYC Studios and the New Yorker\nTo the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick if you watch the video of two protesters with Senator Jeff flake in an elevator during the Kavanaugh hearings if you saw them confronting with so much anger at the way women had been treated for so long\nThe way they said to a U.S senator don't look away from me look at me and tell me it doesn't matter if you look at the way flake\nChange disposition afterwards it's all becoming clear that something absolutely remarkable is taking place in America right now this is very much the subjective Rebecca Traister his new book good and Matt\nRevolutionary power of women's anger the book combines a kind of history of women's uprisings with an analysis of the me too movement\nTraister is written for New York magazine el the New York times in the Washington Post\nAnd her last book was called all the single ladies unmarried women and the rise of an independent nation Rebecca Traister and I spoke on the very day that Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh both testify about her sexual assault allegations Rebecca this\nKnow just hours after the Senate Judiciary committee has done its questioning there was a very specific story being told by professor Ford as well as is near us and in others ... very particular ... [noise] what did the specifics Chely\nThe specifics of their stories yeah well we are getting a very full and detailed view\nOf cultures around wells white\nFundamentally patriarchal power centers that begin in you know when people are teenagers the prep school the the you know Deborah Ramirez is story which was about how she was an outsider to this very elite\nUm friday hard drinking badly behaved relatively repercussion free\nUm social circle of extremely wealthy privileged white men who were all on pads toward immense power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young in a responsible I was young and responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it\nAgain that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement\nIt's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt's sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg leg wouldn't have an behave that way it's like an discernible as harm in some way\nIn your book good and bad you write very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf but more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this country how it was built and who would still excludes\nAnd systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter]\nUm this book is in large measure about\nAnger the legitimacy of anger or the ... of anger historically toward toward good\nUm what's that you often [noise] um it was an attempt to get my thoughts clear after the election I was um that take some doing oh God yes [noise]\nDidn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean\nI was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and\nUm there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women I was acutely aware of my identity\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been linked by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better to think more clearly about race and class um that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer\nAnd there was something that had happened right before the election I'd been on part of a pod cast with a bunch of women\nAnd one of them had said about the white young white men who was like the classic Bernie supporter like she had said something like\nWhere are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for Hillary because it's your guys as white men who are not voting for her where the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware of this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leaving beat it is not worth the investment and trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women to not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be philosophically right I understand and have sympathy\nWith that like just let 'em right right you know they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them\nAnd that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys without going in my own head and I think that I part of what I wanted to do with also think about white women\nAnd what impulses and messages are at work on white women and um I felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of waiting is in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how\nAbout my work how do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here but everything was so crowded and it was on a walk with my husband\nUm between Christmas and New Years of that year says twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about like I not knowing what my role was supposed to be what are they what was my work going to be professionally professionally yeah\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight drives I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes well maybe that's what you need to write about is anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to you and what\nBut suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months\nIt is interesting that the law to the exemplars of constructive anger in the book historically a black woman mhm I'm Shirley Chisholm Florence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours I'm In her grade hats\nOr Rosa Parks and in and of course the the mother of Emmett Till\nThat's not by any coincidence that smell the smoke by accident\nNo not at all women of color have often been\nNot only the leading activists organizers and the the people who who first gay voice in forum to a lot of the transformative social and political movements that have that have reshaped America\nUm they also often have done the thinking I mean a poly Murray who somebody I write about in this book Polly Murray was credited\nBy both Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the intellectual work she did laying out the framework for racial and gender inequity in this country and and laying the groundwork for the laws that would ultimately wind up\nI'm protecting and are trying to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address she's still very rarely credited as this leader I'm\nFlorence Kennedy I haven't heard the name for its Kennedy in years I mean she's very much of the generation of Gloria Steinem or little even if she wins or speaking she and she and Gloria Steinem we're speaking partners caught on the road in right to tell us a little bit about four it's kind of so Florence\nKennedy was a ... a black feminist lawyer um she was outrageous\nFor her time but I think she would be outrageous now I like soccer in her demeanor and her willingness to\nBe vocally pro family unapologetically enjoy fully pissed off about everything she was pissed off [laughter] and there was a lot of it she was mad about racism she was mad about sexism and she wasn't going to play nice at all\nYou know you wrote a book about a time when you were you're working in a in a male dominated office mhm and you found yourself in two years you're angry and you're wrong until you write a chili heart asked manager those are in quotes [laughter] a woman\nAs I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said\nUm and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know what I'm In that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah another way\nI'll talk with my eyes about protest songs then and now another next week on

them and I don't say that I just listen to ferment and\nRobinson's partner was in West Virginia man living in manila named Jim stocky and some of the things stuck use telling Robinson are kind of extraordinary\nWhat what this means that if we can get the money that we've been talking\nAbout taking out the other one million dollars All right now that is not the greatest advantage the great advantage to somewhere in the U.S not to say or [noise]\nUm tornadoes that Dr ... trillion dollar\nKnowing the value and go and diamonds and all these other than that\nIf you can find even through

treasures were said to be in secret locations guarded by poor tribal people now if you're thinking how can I get in on this I should tell you that the story\nI'm based in the Philippines including some investigated by the U.S Secret Service is stuck himself wants to fraud at a bank in Maryland\nRobbins who recorded his calls ... suggesting that he might have been suspicious and yet for over a decade up to the time of his death he sent Stuckey hundreds of thousands of dollars his kids lost their inheritance and his wife lost the house\nI said you know you cannot send that man any more money you're enabling him and um after he died I found out he sent him another fourteen thousand and we didn't have fourteen thousand\nJerry Robinson daughter Maggie was left with the tapes on the phone calls and she began trying to understand how her father who's been so conscious so successful in business had fallen for what seems like an obvious scam\nSome um larger number of Renee's\nBut a large sum of money will become a genius again everybody will want to know we're supposed to be\nMega decided to go and meet the man responsible although against expert advice in last week's episode you talk

don't underestimate old men they are people who have been con artist their entire life and if you think they have end of life regrets think again I mean I don't think Jim is going to assault but someone else\nAnd not only that she was afraid that Maggie might get conned herself and he's going to talk\nTo you know he's going to seem nice and you're going to say oh like you know maybe he's not such a guy\nOnce that happens and the breach could in the distance between the two of you that's the moment that objectivity stops that's why it's always very easy to tell when other people have been
