Boston's NPR News station\nAnd when I\nActually ... [noise]\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick [noise]\nWhen Janelle Monet came on the scene in pop music about ten years ago you might not have picked her out right away future star her music was rooted in Seoul and R. and B.\nAnd also punk a new wave and Monet wrote these kind of sigh concept album set in the future starring herself and Android it was just kind of out there kind of weird sometimes and it could've been ridiculous except it wasn't it was great and Janelle Monday actually got the acclaim and recognition that you deserve [noise]\n\nRecently she started acting seriously in film\nAs one of the stars of hidden figures and in moonlight and this year she released an album called dirty computer despite the title it's not science fiction at all she's dealing frankly with the issues that she's facing and that our country is facing\nRight this very moment she joined me in the studio and I wanted to begin at the very beginning\nSo at the New Yorker we have a whole fact checking department [laughter] so I Want to start with the fact checking thing sure I read that as a kid you wrote an entire musical inspired by the Stevie Wonder album Journey Through the secret life of plants all about photosynthesis\nMusical are\nWell my uncle was a huge Stevie Wonder fan and he played the album and then I was like oh we're learning about photosynthesis in our school\nAnd I started to just write about me 'cause I was living with my grandmother at the time we were in between houses and I started to write about me and just this attack on a or not attack attack on humans from plants\nAndrea Hsu I had to be in like elementary school 'cause we rent we have science class and maybe like the fourth of his great\nWho the writers and an even performers are songwriters that were just been inflaming your imagination when you're that young\nWhen I was young I was really influenced because I I was with my family you grew up in a big family like me I have over fifty first cousins while our mother had my grandmother had twelve children well and I have a huge family and so I was just with them a lot and I come from a musically inclined family\nMy great grandmother's are both play oriented piano what their churches um the church was it was a huge inspiration from\nThe ... did you sing in church the in the in the way the singers that I'm from an earlier generation to the way to reach the kind of grew up knowing the music of Sunday Morning on Saturday Night\nYou know I did sing in church but it's not the type of song that she was think would be something in church does not traditional gospel no I actually was that five six year old kid\nWho would be sitting in the few and in my past her would be between yelling and sweating and about to get the holy ghost and I would bust out in the Michael Jackson to beat it and then I'd be escorted out to the children's church [laughter] kinda got kicked out yeah I was ... I was a rebellious Christian\nNow you're also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access to that or was it all through records in radio\nI didn't have access to musical theater and what else did you play as we get our Cinderella I can totally unrelated as we did a production or I went to a predominantly black a high school Latina a Latino and black high school and\nUm you got all the lead singer I didn't actually see money where did you not get to lead the whiz I did not get the whiz I wanted to be Dorothy so you're still mad about it [laughter] I'm I'm kind of deal but I understood it but it crushed me growing up it really comes from you\nKnow at what point did you think I can have a big life like something that's beyond being in high school musical something beyond being a maybe the best singer at your high school something larger than that\nI don't think I registered until I went to New York post high school I went to the American musical and dramatics academy\nAnd I started to learn more and I started to grow\nAnd when I realized that there was more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was just an axis potential that was there\nAnd that led me to leave I left school because I realized that I wanted to tell us your story who we are heroes with utter Lauren Hill Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration\nAnd I love Judy Garland yeah arguing Judy Garland were were my my my heroes are pretty different performers why those two\nThey were just women that I felt really use their voices unique they had a first of all unique\nTone um and they just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland obviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that um I felt like she was a dreamer and she was a strong woman I Know she had a complex life but Lauren Hill in particular I resonated with me as a black\nWoman who did an album and made a career fully being herself she did not shy away from her religious\nBelief she didn't shy away from 'em you know being a mom during a time where people say that she could not have a child who were ruined her career um she she was an actress she was an actor she was a singer uh she was a producer she was a ... and that was how I wanted to model my career\nAnd you know let's your song from an early album is called violet stars happy hunting and this was from an album called metropolis the chase we\nNow man\nMan\n\n[noise]\n\n\nI live in a long time now that sounds like something out of out of a musical is that what you said after right\nYou know what will I wouldn't say a musical when I wanted to do was figure out how I could sing songs have concerts\nWas a huge inspiration to me after I watched Fritz Lang Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist silent found\nWhen I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it inspired all of my work really it was the birth of metropolis the money that\nBy the stars heavy hunting that we just heard but what I wanted to do is figure out how to you take how can I take all of me on stage like am I Am theatrical I Love singing love R B I Love rock and roll 'em I Love you know dressing in his black and white tuxedo to pay homage to my family I Love\nDavid Bowie I'd just gotten into belly at that time I loved pink Floyd the ... the wall I Love\nA Isaac Asimov I Love science fiction how can I blend all these\nThese ah these different elements and and innovate in in in the space of of a music ...\nYou had in those in those early days an alter ego Cindy Mayweather why is that you were hiding behind her but you were projecting this self which was um\nA a complicated thing which all the U.S [laughter] um why use her as it were instead of being yourself and as you are now in in the in the latest um dirty computer well\nI think that Cindy made whether represented represented aspirations for me that's who I strive to be more like I'm not so she is in the future and in the future she's more evolved and she doesn't have eagle all the things that\nMake me imperfect she's able to master those ...\nIt so this is a ... a self critical expression by having an alter ego yes somewhere absolute what we're used to being self critical about in your in your younger self\nWell my younger self I just felt a misunderstood a lot of people will call me weird they relied right oh that's not commercial enough they didn't under they just did not understand how they were going to market or what it was that I was doing and just\nWhat do they want you to be [noise] I don't think it was about\nWanting me to be something I think it was really about not wanting to do the work in the development that it would take to figure out how to bring something new to the industry it was like the quick thing would be\nWell you know change your hair one change her outfits needs is sexually be appealing\nA the songs also that you know they shouldn't be so dense they should be more simple and assess a bowl and\nBut the temptation to fold must have been something financially and in terms of fame and all the things the rewards for the record industry can bring the temptation to kind of compromise a lot must have been significant\nOh yes oh my goodness are you kidding me I'd just been fired from Office Depot because I was responding back to one of my ah three fans that I had at the time I was singing on the libraries that live in the house with six other girls and a boarding house um you know driving my Mitsubishi lot sell them I see that in my trunk I\nUm but what I Will say is I Want to focus on now and right now I'm working with an organization\nWhen we all vote to help get awareness out after studying the twenty twelve election in this past twenty sixteen election there was a seven percent decrease in the black vote imagine if we would have showed\nWhat could have happened\nYou know thank you so much ... thank you for having\nMe\nDirty computer is the title of

B. U. R. Boston NPR News station\n\nWe'll come back to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick the midterm elections are often said to be a referendum on the presidency and that's never been more true than this year in the era of Donald Trump at the same time no matter where you live there are also other issues on your mind is devoted local stuff\nThat is maybe nothing to do with whether you watch Fox or CNN or even how you feel about Donald Trump reporter laws of Griswold has been spending a lot of time following racism the state of Pennsylvania and what she found\nIs that for voters across a wide swath of the state thing that's foremost on people's minds is a gas pipeline it's already under construction and it goes through a lot of people's backyards and they're really unhappy\nAbout it one of the community is a lot of visited was exton Pennsylvania in the suburbs\nOf Philadelphia [noise]\nAccent is a place where two tectonic plates in American politics meet ... Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty six teams in the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultants like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans and yell for al ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance we gone rogue\nWere on a leafy suburban street they're colonial houses which are made of brac inside and final it's a middle class place how are you guys and Danielle is going door to door and she's a suburban mom of two kids under the age of five and she works in marketing\nHave you heard about running for office and now let's use orange around you do okay well I actually live right on Devon drive and I decided to run because for the last five years our neighbors here have been dealing with us\nWe have pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fence saying that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch a novice his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on her Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party um there are\nOne two three four five six rows of pipes\nIt's within five fifty feet of my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and um we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids play on\nYour greatest fears and now with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impacts heavier fears about an impact your life\nUm [noise]\nIt's horrible to think about a couple of weeks ago um python exploded in ... county in Pennsylvania and with no coat pipeline that was only a week old and so\nI actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare of like my like burning in her bed [noise]\nAnd um [noise] I called him and I said John we have to move like you have to move we can't [noise]\nUm and like thankfully in beaver county there are only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred feet away and the skates with their life but they're homeless destroyed um\nThose things seem like national news tons of people but to people like me that's like reality\n[noise] so you know we're here trying to connect some of the dots between what's going on politically nationally as well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national\nPolitics just an example of the egregious ness of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it really affects our daily life and how it can affect anyone anyone let's put it that's why\nI never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occur to me I just wasn't something I ever like maybe I thought\nIt would run for school board or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things we've experienced\nOver the last few years and just the lack of humanity from are the people who represent us [noise] it's it's ... it it makes you feel powerless but I refuse to be powerless\nBecky carbon a Republican has been in office is two thousand twelve\nI reached representative carbon for an interview and she sent the following statement I Am a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community\nThen she lifted her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\nBut here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics both the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking is made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state in America\nAnd\nAnd that's brought in a lot of different players including snow cone and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline refinanced our top priority for highly skilled engineers environmental scientists wildlife biology and geology design on pipelines to follow the safest round with the smallest environmental footprint possible\nATP is a private corporation but they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline\nThe pipeline moved natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the eastern markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas [noise] we were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop with a hundred miles west of accident in the small town of Boulder fell\nBlooms gun shop we not Ralph and ...\nTheir shop is a small building in a modified garage on their property where shot guns are mixed up with things stun guns morning feet arrested and its infested was criticized for\nThirty five years and make a joke you like it is going to get any better people to make\nThe flight line went right through their property and they say edit killed their hay and ruin their drinking water\nWe have no water have noted drink and drink 'cause we are the drinking or two thousand Seventeen there's water behind it that we did we go back then that's the way it come out but it's black men and\nLook unlike under ... and I wondered whether that had something to do with his intense immersion in the play where he plays the fact checker in mortal combat with a with a different writer\nBecause one of one of the of the the ...\nAnd I'm a business or something like ... and if I see a as no but if you if you differentiate between ... one of the skulls of things in my certain things that John and he sort of gave each for whites to\nEverything everything I mean the thing is people who don't aren't familiar with are checking mostly think things are either factor opinion or we check the facts and we leave the Indians alone but to us the bigger the biggest thing that we\nWork on is what I refer to as fact based opinion in other words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to correct they constructed argument I'm\nNot really a science more a part it's kind of back into other things you may there are kind of common sense will judgments that you make of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make common such judgments but you know we are journalists so\nWhen we shouldn't show you how to do it because I mean for you to work on and I'm like ... I Believe you have a phone call scheduled the chef of a Mexican restaurant novel\nOr whatever [laughter] yeah when you train them down so we're I mean the\nPlan and the plan was down to I Know bread cliff check a short restaurant reviewer tables for two written by hand a gold field to herself a former tractor and\nShe was very pleased to hear your check [laughter] way you'll see\nYes yeah and it's a shortly view of a restaurant a Mexican restaurant called ... ... when we started a new checker we sit them down with a manuscript and have them under lined up for what they think is ... fact and what's not\n[noise] would it be right to underline the details from like the the ingredients from the males\nYeah yeah stuff with old say what is the fact of life seasonings seafood seasoning so then she wants you to track that and that's the kind of thing you could both stew off the website and then check was chef yes in your goal is set up with a dull Evan\nWe're going to say that Ron [noise] I ... I\nWould have never heard of a a dissimilar to the beaches soup ...\nThan you do also when when there's kind of like a negative judgment in there you would [noise] us back off and maybe in the ass\nYeah you're just like lava China yeah well ... yeah well ...\nIt's a Green Party restaurant where the Venice Beach aesthetic the problem with that is that that's a little if he says no it doesn't have a Venice Beach for some reason he's offended by that formulation it's a it's her judgment so maybe you could just say like in California which is like um [noise]\n\nAfter you're done with this was set up a job interview or to switch careers\nLike they have a much easier job right now [laughter] so that fresher\n[noise] after I saw\nOf course grasp on what was ... and what was not I walked around the corner to have them work with Parker Henry another attractive to them what am I definitely there was a sad\nThat's all they are in the high dollar diamond anyhow I talked to this day when he\nMarried um you'll be smashing Parker\nAnd Daniel went to the automotive website where they looked at a news prices and photos of the restaurant\nYeah right on the phone yeah yeah and to\nHang on a guy you might not know it would be ... but I don't look in California for everyone is cause we're seeing as I'm as long as\nYou're worth so just because Parker and Daniel ... has the Venice Beach vibe doesn't mean that that's the way the chef smoker wouldn't describe it yeah I don't know I Do\nYeah I like his fantasy so I don't know how are you going to fact check\n\nYou frame it like you have no idea that potentially offensive huh yea hum yea playing down his key city\nJust actually\nI'm a okay now are eleven o'clock Paul is fast approaching okay I mean they did on speaker phone in the library on my cell phone\nYeah [noise]\nHi Justin I'm Down to a New Yorker I'm Wondering if you had a few minutes to a system some questions about the review of of your restaurant and I'm just trying to fact check it and make sure everything's accurate\nYes of course so first off your son's name is that about a\nB.
