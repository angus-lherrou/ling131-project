Boston's NPR News station\n[noise] someone in Manhattan or some radio production of the New Yorker WNYC studio ... ... ...\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nWhen we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn to more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the result not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is if somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all to help has been writing for the New Yorker about election security in what she's found should scare us all\nLogan lamb is a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election you started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nIn the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election dot dot EDU\nOn this website and generally that turns up reports were public presentation and this this particular search didn't turn up instead I found\nIt very curious link and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or name in some sort of done a fire next to their name and I immediately thought while that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and what he found in all of that data astonished them\nThese documents contain supervisor password to be used on election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity experts know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I followed muzzle wild this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself would be a huge story but on top of lamb also found security hole through which you can download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\n... and there were also gyms database and uh gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate or which does the final vote count\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bone answer to the scariest\nScenario I can think of would be\nAn attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electrical books were altering the voter registration databases to disenfranchise voters\nAn attacker could have compromise the Web server and use that as a beach head to get deeper into the theater for election systems networks [noise]\nThis is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched then more information started to trickle out\nThe intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later it the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nLook we have no idea if the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems in twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence that the warning lights are blinking red\nSome states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts Susan green hall is policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia\nAre computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely has machine that don't have a paper ballot and then there's also other machines which count paper ballots those are all the computers and those machines\nCan be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what counted currently\nSecurity folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet and I wonder if you just explain why it is\nUm the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that\nProgram here are the candidates here the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that debunked that assertion which is that in many of these machines that are in the polling location are equipped with wireless modem to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night\nAnd those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and those cellular networks are part of the Internet\n[noise] [noise] we spend a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines were hacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to\nDo with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia that purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\nPersonally this has been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the voter rolls are they in orange county they use electronic pull books and people were showing up\nAnd they were being told you are at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or your name is in here or your address has been changed the vendor for the electronic pull books was a vendor named the our system now the our systems\nHad been targeted by a Russian intelligence spear phishing attack\nAnd um the state board of elections did their own investigation or as did the county\nTo county report and has been made public it wasn't very in depth that didn't consider a cyber attack 'em and concluded that it was a poll worker or malfunctioned [noise] but I think that's an open question as to what happened in North Carolina and election day [noise]\n... in other words\nUm [noise] I Need to know the play\n...\nWill they have the\nNeed to know where\n\nThis one seems nearly ... ... um ...\n\nSinging all the ... um ... the when I'm been kissing me so long [noise] another word\nAnother word\n[noise] but otherwise yeah\nMm\n[noise]\nSeverely abused isn't that you do you ever ... you say you were checked in with a known about the songs that they do how much do cheese out with the song is about\nOh I didn't try I didn't need to I mean for me it for me it's mostly about climate change you know\nBut you've you've been through a certain number of political moments sixties and in many moments in between ... and just how does this seem similar a different\n[noise] um it's just I couldn't have dreamed up all the stuff I've been through and all the countries all dictatorships and you know I'm In through all that if somebody is hit said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil\nAnd it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero embassy so um it leaves you believe me thinking how am I gonna conduct my life it's you know it's the year the bully and um\nOkay the lying no problem no perjury yeah not a problem I'm In ... that that is a new normal\nAnd how has it changed the texture of your life day to day waking up in the morning as yeah proceed through the day well I think\nI mean I've heard other people say this to law oftentimes as hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety [laughter] anxious about the state of the world which is terrible\nAnd so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial Vincent is great advice yeah and um don't expect much I mean keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary get forget which one it was because this\nThis scene appears in so many documentaries of you singing at the march on Washington now and I I I just wonder how you\nVisualize in your mind moments like that in your life what you're now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you were you're there you're holding the guitar you are in a microphone and it's kind of lousy sound system and seen was a half million people or whatever it was\nDo you think about these moments in your past and you know I think\nAs I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph\nI think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said um and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know it um in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah yeah\nYou you mean there's some there's some times a year in the middle of an event that turns out to be iconic and you have no idea\nI think festival a political moment yeah\nI'm I was just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last helicopter in and looking down and seeing these people are like ants you know they're just gobs of people\nAnd so I had a hint then of that this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever and in your mind yeah\nYou know this next song that you're going to do I went to um Charleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these\nThese ... relatives with people who lost people in the church there in this in the slaughter and it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed um that President Obama a win too it seems like a million years ago it does the idea of a\nOf a president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that\nNot only the crowd with him in the field they feel like allies but he's able to sing the song begins a song yeah that lives people locked as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um yes how do you remember that\nThat terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the some\nWell covering this song was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them or in the future of this song just dropped out of the sky shouldn't by the way most offered I did not know and most people didn't know and I need to tune that\nDidn't get started on I mean if I was quicker and tune you can only be knocking that guitar and you're killing on knocking ear hearing it loudly\nAnd they just go ahead yeah okay [laughter] Mm Mm\nMm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nYoung men came to our house a\nFrenchman and they did not have brought him he was\nNot friend he was not keen\nIdeal when they're doing and they let him man\nAnd foreign our the strangers they didn't he sat with them many seemed praying\nBut then a young man to God and nine in the world on yeah Mm\nMm Mm\nIn Charleston in the month of June ... mourners gathered in ...\nThe president came to speak some ...\nAnd the cameras roll and the nation and her\nWould say\nA bar all the living and and\nSo on that day and then that blame\nOh amazing grace cheese the president's hang\nMan\nMm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nAnd we argue whether native name one man hanging around nation shame some sickness but the mind on our cell phones and how we might be made whoa\nNo one can say what must be man and all the living and\nSo on that day that the president has sang\nAmazing grace in my head and sang amazing right\n...\n... ... to\nThe last line is my president just which is just switch yeah for that President and by president he says is the only president you felt of his in that way but\nUm yeah and I had to decide whether I was going to use that are not cause though we wrote it um my president I thought ... [laughter]\nAnd all of them they have to lie cheat and steal do all that stuff um but yeah be states' money was smart he was carrying in spite of whatever the wars were you know and there were some Afghanistan you know I'm border crossings\nUm a lot of it it was just somebody I liked I like um ... uh yeah I met him\nHe also called a friend in London so he could record an audio diary of its day\nWhich could then be posted on his website and it updated listeners about what he was going through what he was eating what he was feeling\nEverybody else why evolved away close calls\nIn a shorter life the gray circles as others so [noise]\nHe was incredibly good looking\nHenry met his wife Joanne at a party in London in Nineteen eighty nine\nMost of my friends friends\nThey are wild and we'll also accept one in special forces was very very glamorous\nI'm actually I like adventurous paper\nThey think it's great talking to people who are adventure as\nHe had recently completed his selection course for the special ear service or SAS a legendary elite commando unit\nIn many ways he enjoying a we're opposites uh she hates the cold or she could think of any more dreadful place in the world in Antarctica\nYet for all their differences they shared a similar sensibility [noise]\nHe really was a tree romantic love parent Trey hidden love a teeny he did tapestry\nHe's ditched the most wonderful tapestries\nTastes legit skating across the snow\nHeat enough the history of all these old explore as them he glamorize satellites that his head and\nWe say that there was no Impact Man that\nHenry worshipped Ernest Shackleton who in many ways a was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded himself he set out to reach the south pole with three other men\nThey got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the pool but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would not make it back\nFor the men who am I a veil\nAnd so I made a decision that always astonished or had any worse Lee\nHe decided to turn back\nThe way that we are the ...\nAnd on his other ... most famous expedition Shackleton had wanted to walk across Antarctica he thought it was the last great tries to be achieved but before even reached Antarctica ship ah the difference\nThat frozen in the ice and Shackleton found him in all his men were ruined on an ice flow more than a hundred miles from the closest I've been with any contact with civilization\nWhat made it so amazing was she was able to guide all the men in his immediate party\nAnd get them back or home alive\nThey have no money for us I I Believe um [noise]\nWell yes I was very interested as a child was also the story absolutely captivated way he's not he's really ... his car and it's a very very divided expeditions\nHe began to burn with this very peculiar ambition would very few share which was the kind of suffer these misery and become a polar explorer ... and the model that he lived by was a Shackleton family motto which was by endurance we conquer\nI should have had warning about when he came back from a trip to south Georgia just stuff Dr ... and was incredibly excited because he had managed to delete beside Shackleton grave\nIt wasn't until\nWhen he was about food aid that he's really talking about wanting to their nights but there's not a photo and chocolate and such\nSo by the time that Henry was talking about doing his first expedition he had two children back and Alicia initially when he decided he wanted to do something that you know how many people say wait a second I Want to go walk to the south pole\nOr you know his kids were a little bit will dirt but a joy and it was very supportive\nOf us was huge believe as in trying to fulfill dreams\nAnd most of the time my rich still\nShe's from fulfilling you're an individual dream\nBecause you feel you have to get permission from the other person and I felt that through my twenties I had fulfilled a lot of my dreams that had lost a son and he went in the army when he was Eighteen and I felt that it was his town really\nSo for his third trip he wanted to walk across Antarctica to fulfill the goal that his hero shock then was not able to achieve but he wanted to do with a low\nCost so focused on the way\nOr the time all the sudden boom the trial or not I am\nEach day with similar I mean Henry would get up early in the morning and they hiked up his lead this usually took about an hour was hardest will be connected to the flag and you begin to haul it does not unlike a mule\nSkiing for Ninety minutes taking a five minute break\nAnd he would walk with his skis burning as much as eight thousand calories than it day\nBy reading craving food ... double curry staking your small chips works on potato X Y Z but have\nYou ever do this particularly in a task and challenge day after day there was something almost primal about a Cold War\nHis singular purpose became to just make his mileage he had to achieve so many miles a day if he was the ultimately accomplishment his goal\nNine barn full ... because I was leaving everybody does in some tough guy the nine ... southern new laws are hard won by colds longer today just ... miles\nOf the funny thing everybody Twenty one ten points ... was a disappointment but it won't notice them all there's all I can do them I Would call a day\nHe would track for fourteen Fifteen sometimes sixteen hours across an alien landscape is covered with a sheet of ice it's possible for losses\nFor a drive through jumping up his ability to see the story it was a very tough to say many polls is or can you take a breath excuse ticks\nA stroke or ... ... during the day was the lead on some little subtle rape yeah much again was twelve debts and will not enough [noise]\nTo to him a lot\nWhile he was at that on a satellite fan\nHave found it much harder than other expeditions and at least if you're with other people you can take time to be at the front whereas if you delete scare\nCriticized miles [noise]\nHave time to quit playing my heart\nFelt\nThe constant strain of making his mileage so that he could reach the point of the expedition before the end of the month of January because in February begins the winter season\nIt couldn't reach a minus a hundred degrees Fahrenheit even Aly shuts down then and at that point that would be no exit\nYou're diesel fuel all of those should\nBe able to hold off to the gold those so there is nothing except the will it says to them old old mayor of your calls recognized as long as you're\nGetting your feet all day it was the guy says to lie to use although\nI listen to his blogs every day and they were pretty good they were ... feet but uh I was\nJust very concerned that was a hundred miles on his and he was a little die he was fifty five when he says instead of [noise]\nFull said\nShe could hear him growing more tired\nBut you wonder what she should do [noise]\nHe ... constantly constantly that he was staying tonight I was in a terrible position as to whether to say I'm right do justice for a minute you know going to make and [noise] you cannot\nMake the end or say he'll do die [noise] really difficult one [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "New Yorker Radio Hour", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "18"}
