{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WBUA", "content": "[noise] the world Trade Center in Manhattan New York and radiolab co production of the New Yorker and W. in the studio [noise] welcome\nTo the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick when we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something to\nAnd said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn to more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy but what we've learned since twenty sixteen is if somebody really did\nWant to hack the election it wouldn't be impossible not at all to help and has been writing for the New Yorker about election security in what she's found should scare us all Logan lamb\nIs a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election you started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nIn the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election dot in a small dot edu\nOr Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website and generally that turns up reports or public presentations and the\nThe particular search didn't turn that up instead I found a very curious link and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or name in some sort of done a fire next to their name and I immediately thought while that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and what he found in all of that data\nAstonished him these documents contain supervisor password to be used on election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity experts know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I followed my the wild this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself would be a huge story but on top of that land also found security hole through which you can download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\nAnd then there were also gyms database and uh gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central have your later which does the final vote count\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bonanza that\nThe scariest scenario I can think of would be\nAn attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic poll books were altering the registration databases to disenfranchise voters\nAn attacker could have compromise the Web server and use that as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise]\nThis is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched\nThen more information started to trickle out\nThe intercept published the NSA report\nThat had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen\nAnd later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise] look we have no idea if the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election systems\nIn twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment we know that\nForeign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence set the warning lights are blinking red\nSome states took this seriously but others seem to have left\nThemselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cyber secure\nThe policy director of national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure the machines used in Georgia\nAre computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely has machines that don't have a paper ballot then there's also other machines which count paper about those are also computers and those machines\nCan be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted currently\nElection security folks on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet\nAnd I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming gets infected with malicious software it it can be transferred to the individual voting machines\nBut furthermore there's another factor that deep bunks that assertion which is that in many of these machines that are in the polling location are equipped with wireless modems to transmit their election results back to the county headquarters on election night\nAnd those wireless modems go over a cellular networks and the cellular networks are part of the Internet\n[noise] [noise] we spend a lot of time talking about hacking voting machines or hacking vote tallies but there's this new way of hacking an election and it has to\nDo with the new restrictive voter ID laws in states like Ohio North Carolina and Georgia that purge voters from the voting rolls who haven't voted in previous elections whose names don't precisely match the name on the voter registration data base [noise]\nPersonally this have been a concern for me because uh on election day in twenty sixteen people were showing up to vote in Durham county North Carolina and um their names weren't on the voter rolls or they they endured Kennedy use electronic pull books\nAnd people were showing up and they were being told you are at the wrong polling location or you've already voted during early voting or you already voted absentee or your name is in here or your address has been changed the vendor\nFor the electronic pull books was a vendor named VR system now the our systems had been\nTargeted by a Russian intelligence spear phishing attack\nAnd um the state board of elections did their own investigation or as did the county\nTo county report has been made public it wasn't very in depth that didn't consider a cyber attack 'em and concluded that it was a poll worker our malfunction [noise] but I think that's an open question as to what happened in North Carolina and election day [noise]\nAnother way\nI Need to know the play\n[noise]\nWill that peas and he knows where\nThis one seems nearly ... ...\nI'm going to miss the\n\nSinging all this ... um ... the when I'm\nSpin kissing me so long [noise] another word\nAnother word yeah\nWhat other way\n[laughter]\nRemind\nUs of beauty of beauty isn't that you do you ever ... you say you were texting within only about the songs that they do how much do cheese out with the song is about\nOh I didn't try uh I didn't need to I mean for me it need for me it's mostly about climate change you know\nBut you you've been through a certain number of\nPolitical moments [laughter] sixties and in many moments in between ... and just how does this seem\nSimilar different\n[noise] um it's just I couldn't have dreamed us up all the stuff I've been through and all the countries all dictatorships and uh you know I'm In through all that if somebody is hit said can you write a story about how bad can it get I couldn't have written it nor could anybody I Know\nThat it's just you know what we are facing in the administration is evil\nAnd it's it's cruel it's there's no empathy zero embassy so um it leaves you leave me thinking how am I gonna conduct my life\nIt's you know it's the year the bully and um to bully people now seems to be okay the lying no problem no perjury and not a problem um and said that that is a new normal and how has it\nChanged the texture of your\nLife day to day waking up in the morning as yeah proceed through the day well I think\nI mean I've heard other people say this to IT law oftentimes hits in the night in the form of this terrible anxiety and you realize that it's real I mean it's not some neurotic anxiety [laughter]\nI'm anxious about the state of the world which is terrible\nAnd so one thing is to one of my things I suggest spend a lot of time in denial than some of the great advice yeah and um don't expect much I mean keep the bar really low yeah keep laughing\nYou know I I was just watching a documentary you forget which one it was because\nThe scene appears in so many documentaries of you singing at the march on Washington and I I I just wonder how you\nVisualize in your mind moments like that in your life which are now distant and their iconic in the minds of other people but you were you're there you're holding this guitar you are in a microphone and it's kind of lousy sound system and seen it was a half million people or whatever it was [noise]\nDo you think about these moments in your past and you know I think as I get\nOlder sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said\nUm and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know it um in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah\nYeah you you mean there's some there's some times a year in the middle of an event that turns out to be iconic and you have no idea I think festival a political moment yeah\nI'm just thinking about Woodstock and it was a little bit of both because I took the last helicopter in and looking down and seeing these people are like ants you know they're just gobs of people\nAnd so I had a hand then of that this is going to be something very big but it was after the fact that you realize oh my goodness that's made a dent in people's lives forever\nAnd in your mind yeah\nYou know this next song that you're going to do I I went to um\nCharleston not just days after the shooting to write about these families and these\nThese ... relatives with people who lost people in the church there in his in his slaughter and it it was extraordinary and then the funeral that followed um that President Obama a win too it seems like a million years ago it does the idea of a\nOf a president I'm capable of showing empathy just such a degree that\nNot only the crowd with him in the field they feel like allies but he's able to sing the song begins a song that lives people locked as opposed to issue a tweet that depresses hello [laughter] um yes how do you remember that\nThat terrible incident and why did you decide to I'm covered the ... [noise]\nWell covering the song was a no brainer I mean it was whatever feelings I had them or in the future of the song just dropped out of the sky shouldn't by the way most offered I did not know and most people didn't know and they need to tuna during his time\nI mean if I was Quaker a tune that guitar and you're killing on knocking ear hearing loudly\nAnd they just go ahead yeah\nMm Mm Mm\nMm Mm\nYoung men came to our house a\nFrenchman they did not have brought him he was\nNot friends he was not keen but\nThey open the door and they let him Maine\nAnd foreign our the strangers that he didn't he sat with them many seemed to print\nBut then a young man to God and nine in the world and on yeah\nMm Mm Mm\nIn Charleston in the month of June ... mourners gathered in ...\nThe president came to speak some points and the cameras roll and the nation and her\nOne could say what must be in a bar all the living and and\nSo on that day and then that\nOh amazing grace cheese the president's sang\nA man thing\nMm Mm\nMm Mm Mm\nAnd we argue whether native name on one man's hanging\nAround nation shame some sickness but the mind oh and how we\nMight be made whoa\nNo one can say what must sees and ball the living and ... and\nSo on that day and he's the president sang\nAmazing grace my president sang a man thing or a\n\n\nYeah the last line is my president which is just switch yeah for that President and vice president he says is the only president you felt of this and that way but\nUm yeah and I had to decide whether I was going to use that are not cause though we wrote it um my president I thought ... [laughter]\nAnd all of them they have to lie cheat and steal do all that stuff um but yeah it'd be states' money was smart he was carrying in spite of whatever the wars were you know and there were some Afghanistan you know I'm border crossings [noise]\nUm a lot of it it was just somebody I liked I like\nUm ... oh yeah I met him I was in the middle of a snowstorm and it was just ... and I went and I met him and I had was freezing out and my feet has shrunk and I couldn't keep by high heels on they stuffed things in there for me you know like cut and why are you were\nHe also called a friend in London so he could record an audio diary of his day which could then be\nPosted on his website and it updated listeners about what he was going through what he was eating what he was feeling\n[noise] bring everybody I'm sure you know most of the day well where are you going to wave of close calls it a shot to light the grace says this is so [noise]\nWell he was incredibly good looking\nHenry met his wife Joanne at a party in London in Nineteen eighty nine\nMost of my friends friends they are wild and we also that someone in special forces was very very glamorous\nI'm actually I could ...\nI think it's great talking to people who are adventure as\nHe had recently completed his selection course for the special ear service or SAS a legendary elite commando unit\nIn many ways he enjoying a we're opposites uh she hates the cold or she could think of any more dreadful place in the world in Antarctica\nYet for all their differences they shared a similar sensibility [noise]\nHe really was a tree romantic love parent\nTrey hidden love a teeny he did tapestry\nHe pitched the most wonderful\nCase you know just getting across the snow\nHe'd love the history of all these old explore as them he glamour eyes that allied said his hat and\nWe face a fit over from that don't know\nHenry worshipped Ernest Shackleton who in many ways a was a failure as and explore on his first expedition that he commanded some self\nHe set out to reach the south pole with three other men they got within Ninety seven miles nautical miles to the poll but he feared that if he kept going his men who were already fading would not make it back\nThose for the men who am I Am a\nNative decision that always astonished to Henry worse Lee\nHe decided to turn back\nThe man that really\nAnd and his other ... most famous expedition that Shackleton had wanted\nTo walk across Antarctica he thought it was the last great tries to be achieved but before even reached Antarctica his ship ah the difference\nThat frozen in the eyes and Shackleton found him in all his men were ruined on an ice flow more than a hundred miles from the closest I've been with any contact with civilization\nWhat made it so amazing was she was able to guide all the men in his immediate party\nAnd get them back all home alive\nI can only say yeah I Know that they have no money for us I I Believe\nSo yes very interested in the Charles de Gaulle civilians your story ... ... dollar raise in your car is a very very divided expeditions\nHe began to burn with this very peculiar ambition would very few share which was the kind of suffer these misery and become a polar explorer ... and the model that he lived by with a Shackleton family motto which was by endurance we conquer\nI should have had warning about when\nHe came back from a trip to south Georgia\nJust stuff Dr ... and was incredibly excited because he had managed to sleep beside Shackleton grave it wasn't until\nWhen he was about four to eight that he does it really took about ... denies the dish photo and Shackleton footsteps\nSo by the time that Henry was talking about doing his first expedition he had two children max and Alicia initially when he decided he wanted to do something that you know how many people say wait a second I Want to go walk to the south pole\nOr you know his kids were a little bit will dirt but a joy and it was very supportive\nOf us were huge believe as in trying to fulfill dreams and most of the time my rich still she's from fulfilling your own individual dreams\nBecause you feel you have to get permission from the other person and I felt that through my twenties I had fulfilled a lot of my dreams that had a little ... and he went into the army when he was Eighteen and I felt that it was his town rarely\nSo for his third trip he wanted to walk across Antarctica to fulfill the goal that his hero shocked and was not able to achieve but he wanted to do it alone\n[noise] excessively yeah there's a way\nFor a long time several dodgy on the trial or not I am\nEach day with similar I mean Henry would get up early in the morning hike up his lead that usually took about an hour was harnessed will be connected to the flag and he would begin to haul the Donald Michael meal\nSkiing for Ninety minutes taking a five minute break\nAnd he would walk with his skis burning as much as eight thousand calories a day\nOr every craving to fish by far the shuttle statesmanship small chips like some potato X Y Z but have\nYou ever do this particularly in a task and challenge day after day there was something almost primal about a Cold War he's\nHis singular purpose became to just make his mileage he had to achieve so many miles a day if he was ultimately accomplished their goal\n... whole ... ... miles today giving everybody a song by nine points out of the malls will hard won by colds that long ago today just ... miles\nOf the funny thing everybody Jay Carney one point three miles was a disappointment but he knows come all there's all I can do and I would call a day\nHe would track for fourteen Fifteen sometimes sixteen hours across an alien landscape\n... ...\nFor ... jumping up his ability to reach me this morning it was a very tough day was many causes or take a breath waiting for my excuse\nTicks strokes the seven pm\nOr ... during the day and it was the lead on\nUs and we'll set of beer and march again was twelve decimal nine not enough [noise]\nTo to him I don't know\nWhile he was at that on a satellite fan\nHe's found it much harder than other expeditions and at least if you're with other people you can take time to be at the front whereas if you're the lead scare\nPrint size miles [noise]\nHave time to quit playing my heart\n\nFelt the constant strain of making his mileage so that he could reach the point of the expedition before the end of the month of January because in February begins the winter season and start to cope with the temperature drops even further it can reach a minus a hundred degrees Fahrenheit\nEven Eli shuts down then and at that point that would be no exit\nFuel off of\nYour tongue loft or they'll go on the show although there is nothing except the wheel which says to them well known many of your calls recognized as a joke\nOn getting your feet all day but it was the guy but will\nIt says to my heart disease and use although\nI listen to his ... every day and they were pretty good they were ... feet but it's a I was\nJust very concerned that ... has miles on his and he was ... he was fifty five when he says that instead of [noise]\nSal said\nShe could hear him growing more tired\nBut you wonder what she should do [noise]\nHe worried constantly constantly that he was being denied [noise] I was in a terrible position as to what to say on right to just less than ... you know it's going to make you cannot\nMake the end or say he'll to die [noise] to really difficult one [noise]", "year":
