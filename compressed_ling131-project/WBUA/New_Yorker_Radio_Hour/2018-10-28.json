{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WBUA", "content": "[noise] ooh\n\n... ...\nTo the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick [noise]\n[noise]\nWhen Janelle Monet came on the seat in pop music about ten years ago you might not have picked her out right away as a future star her music was rooted in Seoul in R. and B.\nAnd also punk and new ways and Monet wrote these kind of sigh concept album set in the future starring herself an Android it was just kind of out there kind of weird sometimes and it could have been ridiculous except it was it was great\nAnd Janelle Monday actually got the acclaim and recognition that you deserve [noise]\n\nMore recently she started acting seriously in film as one of the stars of hidden figures and moonlight and this year she released an album called dirty computer despite the title it's not science fiction at all she's dealing frankly with the issues that she's facing and that our country is facing\nRight this very moment she joined me in the studio and I wanted to begin at the very beginning\nSo at the New Yorker we have a whole fact\nChecking department [laughter] so I Want to start with the fact checking thing sure I read that as a kid you wrote an entire musical inspired by the Stevie Wonder album Journey Through the secret life of plants all about photosynthesis what was it like what was the musical like\nWell my uncle was a huge Stevie Wonder fan and he played the album and then I was like oh we're learning about Photosynth is is in our school\nAnd I started to just write about me 'cause I was living with my grandmother at the time we were in between houses and I started to write about me and\nJust this attack on a or not attack attack on humans from plants Andrea Hsu I had to be in like elementary school because we weren't we had science class and maybe like the fourth or fifth grade\nWho the writers in an even performers are songwriters that were just been inflaming your imagination when you're that young\nWhen I was young I was really influenced because I I was with my family if you were up in a big family like me I have over fifty first cousins swan our mother had my grandmother had twelve children well and I have a huge family and so I was just with them a lot and I come from a musically inclined family\nMy great grandmother's a both play oriented piano what their churches um the church was was a huge inspiration from\nThe ... did you sing in church the in the in the way the singers that I'm from an earlier generation did their way to reach the kind of grew up knowing the music of Sunday Morning on Saturday Night\nYou know I did sing in church but it's not the type of song that you would think would be signing church it's not tradition ... no I actually was that five six year old kid\nWho would be sitting in the few and in my pastor would be between yelling and sweating and back to get the holy ghost and I would bust out in the Michael Jackson to beat it and then I'd be escorted out to the children's church [laughter] kinda got kicked out yeah I was ... I was a rebellious Christian [laughter]\nNow you're also interested in musicals and musical theater and did you have access to that or was it all through records in radio\nI did have access to musical theater and what else did you play as a kid I was Cinderella I can totally unrelated as we did a production or I went to a predominantly black a high school Latina a Latino and black high school and\nUm you got all the lead singer I didn't actually funny what did you not get the lead the whiz I did not get the whiz I wanted to be Dorothy so you're still mad about it [laughter] I'm I'm kind of deal but I understood it but it crushed me growing up it really comes from me\nNow at what point did you think I can have a big life like something that's beyond being in high school musical something beyond being a may be the best singer at your high school something larger than that\nI don't think it registered until I went to New York post high school I went to the American musical and dramatics academy\nAnd I started to learn more and I started to grow and when I realized that there was just more potential that I hadn't tapped into there was just an axis potential that was there\nAnd that led me to leave I left school because I realized that I wanted to tell us your story who your heroes at that time Lauren Hill Lauren Hill was my biggest inspiration\nAnd I love Judy Garland yeah an audio Judy Garland were were my my my heroes are pretty different performers why those two\nThey were just women that I felt really use their voices unit had a first of all unique tone\nUm and they just came across as strong I didn't know a whole lot about Judy Garland obviously I'm from Kansas and the wizard of Oz you know in her being in that\nUm I felt like she was a dreamer and she was a strong woman I Know she had a complex life but Lauren Hill in particular I resonated with me as a black woman who did an album and made a career\nDid not shy away from her religious belief she didn't shy away from 'em you know being a mom during a time where people say that she could not have a child who were ruined her career um she she was an actress she was an actor she was a singer uh she was a producer she was a poly math and that was how I wanted to model my career\nAnd you know let's your song from an early album is called violet stars happy hunting and this was from an album called metropolis the chase\nDown man\nMan\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nYou know violated I haven't heard it in a long time now that sounds like something out of out of a musical is that what you said after right\nYes you know what will I wouldn't say a musical where I wanted to do was figure out how I could sing songs\nHave concepts for them if I wanted to talk about science fiction which was a huge inspiration to me after I watched Fritz Lang Nineteen twenty seven German expressionist silent found\nWhen I watched that metropolis Oh yes it it it inspired all of my work really it was the birth of metropolis the money that\nBy the stars happy hunting that we just heard but what I wanted to do is figure out how to you take how can I take all of me onstage like am I Am theatrical I Love singing I Love ... love rock and roll 'em I Love you know dressing in black and white tuxedo to pay homage to my family I Love\nDavid Bowie I just got into bully at that time I loved pink Floyd the ... the wall I Love\nIsaac Asimov I Love science fiction how can I\nBlend all these these ah these different elements and and innovate in in in the space of of a music ...\nYou had in those in those early days an alter ego Cindy may weather ... not that you were hiding behind her but you were projecting this self which was um\nA a complicated thing which all that you were um why use her as it were instead of being yourself and as you are now in in the in the latest um dirty computer\nWell I think that Cindy made whether represented represented aspirations for me that's who I strive to be more like I'm not so she is in the future and in the future she's more evolved and she doesn't have eagle all the things that\nMake me imperfect she's able to master those ...\nSo this is a ... a self critical expression by having an alter ego yes somewhere absolute what we're used to being self critical about in your in your younger self\nWell my younger self I just felt a misunderstood a lot of people will call me we're there'd be like oh that's not commercial enough they didn't under they just did not understand how they were going to market or what it was it I was doing and just\nWhat do they want you to be [noise] I don't think it was about\nWanting me to be something I think it was really about not wanting to do the work in the development that it would take to figure out how to bring something new to the industry it was like the quick thing would be well you know change your hair one change her outfits needs is sexually\nBe appealing a the songs also that you know they shouldn't be so dense they should be more simple and assess a boy and\nBut the temptation to fold must have been something financially and in terms of fame and all the things the rewards for the record industry can bring the temptation to kind of compromise a lot must have been significant\nOh yes oh my goodness oh you're kidding me I'd just been fired from Office Depot because I was responding back to one of my ah three fans that I had at the time I was singing on the libraries that live in the house with six other girls in a boarding house um you know driving my Mitsubishi lot selling my CDs out of my truck\nUm but what I Will say I want to focus on now and right now I'm working with an organization\nWhen we all vote to help get awareness out after studying the twenty twelve election and this past twenty sixteen election there was a seven percent decrease in the black vote imagine if we would have showed\nWhat could have happened\nYou know thank you so much ... thank\nYou for having me\nDirty

Pennsylvania go narrowly for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and the Philadelphia suburbs are one of those places that political consultant like to talk about is kind of a bellwether\nAlthough the larger county went for Hillary Clinton accent is heavily Republican about two thirds of its voters are Republicans ... ... is running as a Democrat for state assembly and she thinks she has a chance we gone rogue [noise]\nWe're on a leafy suburban street they're colonial houses which are made of Bracken sided with final it's a middle class place how are you guys I'm Danielle is going door to door and she's a suburban mom with two kids under the age of five and she works in marketing\nHave you heard of him running for office Danielle excuse orange rap you do okay well I actually live right on Devon drive and I decided to run because for the last five years are nameless here have been dealing with us\nWe she's pointing to a long stretch of orange plastic fencing that marks the beginning of the controversial pipeline which is supposed to be buried about forty feet behind all the houses on the street\nAnd fighting the pipeline for the last few years is what motivated Danielle to launch and not as his campaign for the Pennsylvania state house taking on her Republican opponent and the establishment in her own party um there are\nOne two three four five six rows of\nPipes it's within five fifty feet of my backyard like Seventy feet from my house and um we're standing right now ten feet from playground that my neighbors kids my kids play on\nYour greatest fears and now with the pipeline I mean if what how does it impacts heavier fears about an impact your life\nUm [noise]\nIt's horrible to think about ... weeks ago I'm a pipeline exploded in India for county in Pennsylvania and with no coat pipeline that was only a week old and so\nI actually was I'm taking a nap in the afternoon shortly after that happened and I jumped out of my bed because I had this nightmare I like my age like burning in their bed [noise]\nAnd um [noise] I called them and I said we have to move like have to move we can stay here [noise] um and like thankfully in beaver county there were only thirty homes within a mile of that explosion and the closest family with five hundred\nThe straight um those things seem like national news to most people but to people like me that's like reality [noise]\nSo you know we're here trying to connect the dots between what's going on politically nationally as well as on a state level I'm with and the pipeline how do you see the pipeline as relating to national\nPolitics just an example of the egregious ness of what's happening at the on the national level and all of these regulatory role backs and how it really affects our daily life and how can affect\nAnyone anyone let's put it that's why I never in my life never in my life I Would run for office never never ever occurred\nTo me I just wasn't something I ever like\nMaybe I thought it would run for school board or something like something small local when my kids were older and I had a little more time on my hands but after all of the things we've experienced over the last few years and just the lack of humanity from are the people who represent us [noise]\nIt's it's ... it it makes you feel powerless but I refuse to be powerless\nDaniels opponent and district one fifty five is Becky carbon a Republican has been in office is two thousand twelve\nI reach representative carbon for an interview\nAnd she sent the following statement I Am a proven record of standing up to oil and gas companies to ensure the health and safety of our community then she listed her opposition to a number of bills which she said would have rolled back health protections standards for oil and gas wells and made it easier for public utilities to use eminent domain\n... but here's the thing about Pennsylvania politics are both the Republican legislature and the Democratic governor Tom Wolfe had signed off on the pipeline fracking has made Pennsylvania the third largest oil and gas producing state\nIn America and and that's brought in a lot of different players including some ... and its parent company energy transfer partners which owns this pipeline project the Mariner east\nWhen we build a pipeline refinanced our top priorities are highly view of engineers environmental scientists wildlife biology and geology design off I Want to follow the safest wrong with the smallest environmental footprint\nATP as a private corporation but they were able to use eminent domain to take people's land against their will in order to lay the pipeline\nThe pipeline moves natural gas liquids from the Marcellus gas fields in the west for three hundred and fifty miles to the eastern markets hawk outside Philly where it shipped overseas [noise] we were following the root of the pipeline through Pennsylvania our second stop with a hundred miles west of action in the small town of ...\nAnd blooms gun shop we met Ralph ... blue\nTheir shop as a small building in a modified garage on their property or shot guns are mixed up with things done done more than the arrests and its infested was criticized\nFor thirty five years and make a joke the large it is it going to get any better for all of them may supply blind\nWent right through their property and they say it had killed their hay and ruined their drinking water\nWe are new order have noted drinking water to drink 'cause we've ever order the nurturing given to thousands Seventeen ... that we go back and the word come out perfect pitch black men and\nAnd I wondered whether that had something to do with his intense immersion than the play where he plays the fact checker in a mortal combat with a with a difficult writer\nBecause one of one of the\nOf the news business or something like ... and if I see a U.S know that if you if you differentiate between ... one of the articles of things in my certain things that John I sort of gifts equal rights to everything everything\nI mean there's a famous people who don't aren't really refreshing most exciting things are either factor opinion or we check the facts and we live within its alone but to us the bigger the biggest thing that we\nWork on is what I refer to as fact race to fit in another words like you have to know the underlying facts in order to correct that constructed argument I'm\nNot really a science more of them are just kind of akin to other things you're there are kind of having such judgments that you make of course that's a sort of squishy ground to make common such judgments but you know we are journalists so\nWhen we shouldn't show you how to do it because we only for you to work on and I'm like God I Believe you have a phone call scheduled at a chef of a Mexican restaurant novel or wherever you train them so we're I mean the\nThe plan and the plan was down to in over a cliff [laughter] check a short restaurant reviewer
