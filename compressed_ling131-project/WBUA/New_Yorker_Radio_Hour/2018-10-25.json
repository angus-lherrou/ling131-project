B. U. H. Brewster and streaming or W. B. U. R. dot org WB are Boston's NPR News station [noise]\n\nLooking as they have to see [noise]\nFrom one World Trade center in Manhattan [noise] this is a New Yorker radio our protectionist ... studios and the New Yorker I'm\nTo the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick the big story going into the mid term elections has been the possibility of a blue wave a democratic upsurge that's notable\nFor the number of women running and for progressive candidates like ... or work in Texas in Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in New York but another story in this election is the very opposite\nThe candidates were running as extremists on the right openly white supremacist candidates even neo Nazis Andrew ... who's been covering the movement known as the old right and he's watching how it influences mainstream politics\nInjury you've been reporting on the fringes of right wing nationalism and all the associated movements people like Mike ... Fitch for example who was involved in pizza gate\nAnd you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbs Nazi lure we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacist had been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start what did the origins of it it's never really\nTerms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely notes that Democrats have engaging that Republicans have engaged in it\nBut it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was first campaigning for president he campaigned and give it a big speech in the show but county Mississippi any talk there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why because\nHe vociferously tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he will separately denied it they're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa\nHe's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that these lines should exist\nSo what does what does Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve King is a congressman from Iowa he's represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kind of stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability and then just in the last couple of years partly because of Trump and partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe um has been saying things like demographics are our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere's no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to mean white people there's no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kinda gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to eat she doesn't delete them he kinda says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff but he never walk back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nAnd when you start that's the way the differences then you'll end up with people that are at each other's throats then adding up than a than black and he predicts will be a greater number that whites that America I'll predict the panic then the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make of that or I mean there are there are much more\nExtreme examples of his rhetoric than that but basically it's\nThat's kind of a turning the tables of saying by talking about uh you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc\nAnyone doing that is there for the race is Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forget how long he waited but Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says\nWe abhor racism so in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the GOP can very comfortably wash their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is the guy they're not pulling funding from him at least not in the way that they're making public\nSo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan field they cannot afford to reject somebody like king\nIt's terrifying it's yeah it means that they've read the tea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber primitive fascism yeah fortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what you're going to fascism and what does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't\nWe weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure but um what is the brink well it can't happen here you know that that notion that you know yeah ... ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here\nI think we're now all starting to see that there is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are in extremely flawed\nSociety with a extremely\nA dicey racial history that I'm perhaps a uniquely so among the countries we're talking about democracy is a very delicate tricky thing right if Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want to vote for the other guy there's no guarantee that they want to vote\nFor the other guy well let's talk about the other guy his opponent kings opponent is a Democrat afford baseball player named J. D. show the show and have a chance and what are the dynamics of that race look like\nHe's much taller so that's generally a good thing in politics\nThe district in Winnebago and you know shaking everyone's hand and being very folksy he's out fundraising king\nHe's still down in the polls incumbency is a very powerful thing in house elections and king has been there for six terms with the district thing it's deep deep red as they say\nIn king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at his Twitter feed but [laughter] I'm racism is not his only thing you know he also\nYou know once ethanol subsidies and he also you know says he wants to support farmers now he's been in Congress for Fifteen Years he has sponsored exactly one bill that passed which was to rename a post office in Iowa so he's not the most effective legislator\nNow that we live in the age of ... are there new politicians on the scene who seemed to be entering the stage or coming onto the stage in the way they might not have the four\nYeah I think someone like course Stewart he was someone who the Virginia a GOP just thought would fizzle out and he's running for Senate he's running for Senate against Tim Kaine who will probably win but you know with this level of support he's doing better than one would expect I mean he\nHe won the primary and his whole national image is based on being standing up for these Confederate monuments\nWe can't turn them down there our heritage he was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota so not the heart of the country are not part of the confederacy and Steve came by the way it used to have a Confederate flag on his desk in the Capitol building which by the way Iowa sent a lot of soldiers to die to fight against the confederacy so it's like gee I Wonder what that flag means to you\nIn New Jersey and the state of New Jersey or New Jersey congressman Seth gross and was dropped by the Republican Party after saying that diversity is crap is that an outlier incident is that a very rare instance of the of the party standing up to some of its extremist voices\nYeah I think he I think the set Grossman thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more in most cases than that you have\nA guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he won a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to run a lot of Republicans in these in these races so he's not going to win the general election\nIt's very scary that a literal Nazi is is running for office in Illinois and that and that this guy set Grossman is running for office in New Jersey but those are outliers I mean so I don't want to paint the picture that you know this is happening everywhere all the time but again the fact that someone like set gross men in New Jersey in New Jersey\nWould have you know concealed his feelings a little bit more\nOf just a few years ago just a couple of years ago but now he's on he's unleashed he's unleashed he's linking to this a blog post\nYou know calling black people inherently dangerous and you know he's just posting this on his website and then he says oh well I'm Jewish so I Can't be racist so I'm falls yeah I can falsify that one of the ...\nThat General Flynn was providing false information ostensibly to people in the administration who were then providing false information to the American people we weren't the only ones who knew that\nThe Russians knew that too and because this had become such a big public thing this is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise it's such a black male so what does it what happened that um so I contacted Don McGahn who White House White House counsel 'em and told him that I needed to come see 'em right away\nTold him what we have learned that\nYou know the vice president of been on face the nation and saying you know I've talked to General Flynn personally and he is assured me that there were no conversations about sanctions so you got the VP out there saying this stuff so we told a Mr McGahn\nHow we knew that it wasn't true how we happened to have recordings of these conversations and why we thought it was a problem\nAnd when you go see 'em a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back and ... was that different are the same or what it would it was a little\nDifferent in the sense that um\nHe was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I you know testified before the sort of one of his first questions was what's it to the department of justice if one White House official allies to another\nAnd what did you make of that [noise] um\nWell I tried to explain to him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official lying to another which\nGod that would help people would be concerned about anyway but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this is a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence was entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood in you know in front of of the public\nThat that wasn't true so we were trying to help them\nYour second meeting with Don McGahn is January twenty seventh also on January twenty seventh I'm an exactly\nBanning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until there was this you\nKnow and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at link\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order as you said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending this\nSo how did you find out about the travel there um I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport\nAnd I get a call I was able to keep one aide with name on a system my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so\nCalls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the New York times and it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of travel ban\nWe spent the weekend\nI'm trying to get our arms around then communicating with the White House um what is it that you're trying to do and by Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitutionality\nOf the travel ban the next morning and in a case so we convened everybody in my conference room and it's been a very long time in there\nI'm Talking through what the challenges were\nWhat the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban we talked about the different challenges but constitutionally and statutory late and otherwise that have been filed [noise]\nUm and if the end of that conversation\nI was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional when\nWhat troubles me beyond that was it became clear that\nTo defend the constitutionality of this I was going to have to send department of justice lawyers and to take the position that this travel ban that applied just a Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion\nAnd this was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and\nThat did not seem like the truth to me\nBut it isn't it usually been job the department of justice to defend\nActions of the administration even if you personally would not have ... you know issued that order or you're the president's you're the executive branch's lawyers writer why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend this\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy grant and perhaps the appropriate thing than to do would be to resign if you can't be part of that [noise] um but not directed apart but not to defend it but here's what's different is that\nI happen to believe ... should go into court and make an argument that's not grounded in truth but the department of justice [noise] I mean\n[noise] if the OJ stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what is true and what is just [noise] so what did you do [noise]\nI knew that I personally couldn't be parked a defending this an argument something that that wasn't granted and trade 'em but you know I thought about what may be the thing to do is reside\nAnd that would have protected my personal integrity I wouldn't have been part of this um but I wasn't like just the head of the civil division or you know some other component of the department [noise]\nI was the acting attorney general of the United states and I felt like I had a responsibility to protect not just my personal integrity with the integrity of the department of justice as well and I thought back to my confirmation hearing\nWhen I'm there were some senators including Senator Sessions who they were all over me and my confirmation hearing about\nWhat I Would do if the president asked me to do something that was a mall for wrong and I think Senator Sessions said you know even if it's just something that would bring disrupt ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and we'll use saying\nYou know none of them were asking me will you resign they were asking me will you say no and they were right about that it wasn't my responsibility in that position I think to resign I think it was my responsibility to sign up so how did\nYou say no they I mean it wasn't like a state public statement it was just the communication\nThat we have the we had there were communications going on at levels below knee and between me and Mr McGahn and I should the directive to the department and then what happens [noise]\nUm I was fired you were fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable [laughter] hired by Donald Trump did that surprise you\nDid you think the story was going to end once you said you weren't going to allow the\nTravel ban to be defended look I certainly recognized there was a very real possibility for like probability that I Would be fired in this in this context but I hoped\nThat maybe there was a chance that by doing this that would cause them to step back\nAnd take a breath and look at what they were doing and more ... okay I Know everybody's got the\nInfo why so loud [laughter] in the United states seems kind of silly now doesn't it um\nBut you know I did harbor this hope that maybe they would step back they would have the kind of process they would get the kind of input I'm there would be real discussion about this um\nI had spent twenty seven years at the department of justice I loved that place [noise] um I did not want to have the period on my service they're being fired\nWhat what's your assessment of the whole series of events\n[noise] um I suppose you could say that the president made a campaign promise and he was making good on that promise but beyond the fact that I Believe that particularly the first one was a lawful and unconstitutional I think it's\nAbsolutely the antithesis of who we are as a country\nAnd [noise]\nSally a long time just Hartman official who is the acting attorney general at the start of the Trump Administration sell you spoke with Jeffrey Donovan at the New York [noise]\nNow\nI'm as you mentioned the travel ban was revised ones ... was revised twice the courts have struck down each diversions including the third and final version until it went to the Supreme Court\nWhich upheld it five to four mhm what's your view of the travel ban in its final form and the Supreme Court's decision about it\nYou know I haven't studied travel ban three the same way that I did the first one that you know I I still despite the other decisions of you know taking out the preference for Christians\nFrom Boston University
