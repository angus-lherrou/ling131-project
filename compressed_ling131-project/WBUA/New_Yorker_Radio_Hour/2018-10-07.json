Boston's NPR News station\nThat they have pretty good I thought it was obviously mom that Lee Lewis with us\nFrom one World Trade center in Manhattan this is\nThe New Yorker radio our production of WNYC Studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick if you watch the video of two protesters with Senator Jeff flake in an elevator during the Kavanaugh hearings if you saw them confronting with so much anger at the way women have been treated for so long\nThe way they said to a U.S senator don't look away from me look at me and tell me it doesn't matter if you look at the way flake change disposition afterwards it's all becoming clear that something absolutely remarkable is taking place in America right now this is very much the subject of Rebecca Traister his new book\nGood and bad revolutionary power of women's anger\nThe book and binds a kind of history of women's uprisings with an analysis of the me too movement\nTraister is written for New York magazine el the New York times in the Washington Post\nAnd her last book was called all the single ladies unmarried women and the rise of an independent nation Rebecca Traister and I spoke on the very day that Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh both testified about her sexual assault allegations\nRebecca there's no way to avoid this we are talking now just hours after the Senate Judiciary committee has\nDone its questioning ... there was a very specific story being told by professor Ford as well as is near us and in others ... very particular ... [noise] what did the specifics tell you\nThe specifics of their stories yeah well we're getting a very full and detailed view\nOf cultures around wealth white\nFundamentally patriarchal power centers that begin in you know when people are teenagers the prep school the the you know Deborah Ramirez is story which was about how she was an outsider to this very elite\nUm friday hard drinking badly behaved relatively repercussion free\nUm social circle of extremely wealthy privileged white men who were all on pads toward immense power\nAnd the narrative of it was when I was young in a responsible I was young in a responsible boys will be boys\nRight who who amongst us has not write like that and that's it again that's about the sort of invisibility of certain kinds of power abuses um I write about in the book and something that I've I've become kind of obsessed with it and thinking both about how\nFor example a black lives matter movement has been talked about in the mainstream press and then watching the same kinds of things around the me too movement\nIt's helped me to understand a little bit about how when power is abused in the direction that is sort of natural the more powerful do something bad or harmful or even violent to the less powerful\nIt's sort of invisible right oh oh he was a drunk boy of course he did this like what young man what Seventeen year old healthy young man with a sex drive in a keg like wouldn't have an behave that way it's like an discernible as harm in some way\nIn your book good and bad you write very early in the book I Am a white woman who's been angry in my life and my work occasionally on my own behalf but more often about politics about inequity and the grotesque unfairness of the world in this country how it was built\nAnd who would still excludes and systematically diminished and then you're off to the races [laughter]\nUm this book is in large measure about anger the legitimacy of anger or the ... of anger historically toward toward good\nUm what's that you often [noise] um it was an attempt to get my thoughts clear after the election I was um that take some doing oh God yes\nI didn't know I was I was wrestling with what my job was I was wrestling with what my work was how do you mean\nI was very muddy about what the story was that I needed to tell I have to say that I haven't I haven't talked about this before and\nUm there's a degree to which I was deeply obsessed by the question of the white women I was acutely aware of my identity\nUm as a white woman the the degree to which my work has been linked by my white miss my work on feminism the degree to which I have been pushed to be better\nTo think more clearly about race and class um that's been a big part of my evolution as a writer and there was something that had happened right before the election I've been on part of a pod cast with a bunch of women\nAnd one of them had said about the white young white men who was the classic Bernie supporter like she had said something like where are you guys out there trying to to persuade people to vote for\nWho are not voting for her where the left white guys go get your boys right that was the phrase that she'd use go get your boys right and it was not a surprise to me that white women had voted for Donald Trump\nBut I was acutely aware of this demographic and I felt some responsibility and I'm very sympathetic to the argument\nWhich is like leave him be it is not worth the investment in trying to persuade white women to be on our side there's a woman in my book just morale is who says she worked on the Hillary campaign and she was like look this was about persuading white women do not be Phyllis Schlafly and that has never ever work they're always going to be philosophically right I understand and\nHave sympathy with that like just let 'em run right you know they want to they want to support a system that fundamentally oppressive them and that oppressive other people great but I felt some that that phrase go get your boys would that going in my own head\nAnd I think that I part of what I wanted to do was also thinking about white women\nAnd what impulses and messages are at work on white women\nAnd um I felt like it was my responsibility to examine race from the perspective of of waiting is in conjunction with looking at gender and then the anger so I I was feeling that but I wasn't sure how to do it right I I and that was the question about my work how do I do that what do I do what is my job what's ... what's the story here\nBut everything was so crowded\nAnd it was on a walk with my husband um between Christmas and New Years of that year assist twenty six you know twenty Seventeen and I was trying to explain to him that despair I was feeling about like I not knowing what my role was supposed to be what it was what was my work going to be professionally professionally\nAnd um I said I just can't think straight dries I'm I'm so mad and he was like well maybe that's what your work is\nAnd I said what do you mean and he goes well maybe that's what you need to write about is anger and as soon as he said it he's not a writer um he was just something he was responding to and what\nBut suddenly in that in that exchange I'm not exaggerating when I said it was the first feeling of like clarity enlighten us in my head that I'd had at that point in two months\nIt is interesting that the law the exemplars of constructive anger in the book historically\nAre black women mhm I'm Shirley Chisholm Florence Kennedy who I remember well watching on public access television for hours I'm In her great hats or Rosa Parks and in and of course the the mother of Emmett Till that's not by any coincidence that smell the smoke by accident\nNo not at all women of color have often been\nNot only the leading activists organizers and the the people who who first gay voice in forum to a lot of the transformative social and political movements that have that have reshaped America\nUm they also often have done the thinking I mean ... poly Murray who somebody I write about in this book Polly Mary was credited\nBy both Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the intellectual work she did laying out the framework for racial and gender inequity in this country and and laying the groundwork for the laws that would ultimately\nWind up I'm protecting and uh trying to ameliorate the kind of gender and racial inequality that she was she was trying to address she's still very rarely credited as this leader um\nIn Florence Kennedy I haven't heard the name for its Kennedy ... years and she's very much of the generation of Gloria Steinem or little even if she ... she and she and glorious than we're speaking partners caught on the road right to tell us a little bit about four it's kind of\nSo Florence Kennedy was a ... a black feminist lawyer um she was outrageous for her\nTime but I think she would be outrageous now I like soccer in her demeanor and her willingness to be\nVocally pro family unapologetically enjoy fully pissed off about everything she was pissed off [laughter] and there was a lot of it she was mad about racism she was mad about sexism and she wasn't going to play nice at all\nYou know you wrote a book about a time when you were you're working in a male dominated office mhm and you found yourself in two years or angry and you're wrong until you write a chili heart asked manager was ... a woman pulled you into a stairway and said you they don't know your furious they think you're sad\nYou know I think as I get older sometimes I Do or somebody to show me a photograph I think oh my God I was there and those people were there and Dr King said what he said\nUm and sometimes going into a quote historic moment you know it and other times you don't know it um in that case I think by midway through the morning you know we all knew it yeah another way\nI'm Talking
