worst but sometimes you got to play the hand you're dealt write so well Bette injured did taking over a CEO and president of Charles Schwab from Charles Schwab himself ten years ago this month\nAnd to hear him tell it which we will he's actually had a pretty good decade well You're welcome to the program sir\nThanks a lot ... it's great to have the opportunity to spend time together or as I noted or in the in the introduction you've been at this company ten years which means uh you took over ten years ago in the middle of the worst financial crisis this country's seen in a generation or more what what were those days like for a financial services company guy\nYou know at that point in time there was very little that you could do the the outcome that your company would experience as a result of that crisis was more the result of the decisions you made prior to when you were deep in the middle of that crisis so are you going to work every day just kinda hanging on for the ride [laughter]\nNo it wasn't quite like that I think uh I think in my first Ninety Days as CEO I was a successful in having the stock price they're probably going to see how does that have made it a decade who are able to achieve that\nYeah um what is it or was it I suppose uh about financial services that they got you're going I mean you found that your first Spanish services you're on financial services company when you were like twenty what two or three or something\nTwenty two actually my uh my formal training was as a pension actuary so I provided consulting services\nEventually that business evolved to where we needed a link between our computer systems and where the money we're sided and we linked up with Schwab and over a few years we became ... largest client and then twelve acquired my farm\nA few years after that you know your boss Charles Schwab who is still the German the board and and are active in the company as I understand it also by the way like the second or third CEO I did in this series lo these many years ago but but anyway\nUm yeah I'm a ... and ... and you will ... originated the concept really at scale of discount retailer brokerage and I wonder if

organization that's generating the net new asset flows that we are the new households lows that we are the new account so\nSo I don't I don't know that I Would go so far as you say people are catching up to us but more people understanding that it is important to not only deliver quality service and quality advice to investors but also do so at a value that leaves more money in their pocket that's a good thing\nYou know we're we're a large institution three and a half trillion dollars we're focused on building an organization and rewarding our stock holders communities employees but but ultimately it all originates with whether we are doing the right thing by our clients and I'm a whole lot more proud of the fact that we also generate less revenue per dollar\nOn every a client asset than anyone else of size so does your mind when he was really important do you\nFeel that way to generating less revenue come on\nAbsolute less revenue per dollar because what it ultimately means chi's relieving more money in the pocket of the investor and and and it was her money to begin with I mean our job is about helping them get outcomes that makes sense and to the extent we do that do reward us with more business\nI think that's a whole lot better way to grow then to try to extract maximum revenue from every client in an ultimately I Would say\nThat chocolate view that is maybe one of the most important legacies of of his founding this company over four decades ago how often do you talk to him every day I just left his office about five minutes before I put the headset on [laughter]\nFair enough so if businesses good uh what do you worry about as a guy who as you said managers reunion something trillion dollars worth of other people's money\nWell certainly the cyber ah environment is significant risk for for all of us um you know you're talking about thousands of the Thames every single day to try to access clients' accounts or access systems and\nAnd of course the
