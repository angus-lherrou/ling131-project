in the scratch and then she will work it out with and defining what they feel comfortable with talking to them\nAbout their boundaries about anything that they would like on that to help them feel safe so then go back to the director on the producers and see if she can work something out everyone else got about then when it comes to the day of filming\nShe is often standing within I shot a doctor um she is usually looking at the monitor to see how the scene is playing a so she's there to comment on the\nChoreography and she will help then protect themselves should tell them how to make things look more Rielle without them having to do something that feels more sexual to them so it's about choreography the same way that we have fight scene choreography\nRoot uh HBO it it kind of
