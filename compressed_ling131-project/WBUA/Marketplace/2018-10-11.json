{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WBUA", "content": "George Foreman a helps your sandwich [laughter] at all before the flight ... no no\nI'm I knew early I was going to be all things to all people all these people are getting spot on now you know previously I was you're the kind of germs were Jay Z right or yeah or even to this day it's like oh you're chemicals drummer right huh [laughter]\nOr even worse Jimmy Fallon gets your Jim and Jim ... yeah 'cause I think I'm a first there was a little if there was you off a little bit you know where people have history like I just didn't pop up you know out of out of nowhere but I'm dealing with that do you ever look around and say I'm a kid from Philadelphia man what am I doing it\nMore [noise] more or less a it's how did I get here often when I go back to Philadelphia I'd do something called chasing ghosts\nAre still in my first car and I keep it up I'm Sorry you still have your first car accident and I still utilize it yeah and I go to my mom's house and I get it and usually I drive around when I go to Philly I'll drive from like midnight to three in the morning literally just chasing ghosts and the\nThing I always do is when I go past\nThe place where the roots used to a mosque on um fit than south street there I'm always like yell like back in Nineteen Ninety two I thought Nineteen Ninety nine was going to be the future you know yeah\nLet alone what I still be a thing in two thousand Eighteen I mean I'm not one of those knock on wood people that we're\nI don't want to jinx it but as you knock on wood or as I as I did it you know their hypothetically but I I just I'm Amazed that no one's kick me out the pool yeah\nYeah we we had um we had ... on the program about two weeks ago and we had a whole thing about she got limited one radical older and you know and she's doing really well and I said how are you made now and she said oh honey you're never made\nUm yeah even you know this is our our technically are twenty some professional year as a group\nAnd I I still work as if this could all end tomorrow that's why people ask like well you do so many things have Nineteen jobs like when did you get to relax and you just don't in my mind it's it's always this could end tomorrow so don't ever sleep you know if he\nDoes it ever surprise you that you have become that guy now to people turn to for advice and mentorship and\nI'm I'm very uncomfortable with that even my Twitter handles says like I'm I'm Better as a student not a teacher like this whole course love is said scholar at ... earlier I your bunch of rappers called me like oh gee [laughter]\nNow I I kinda shrug it that\nWhat would you be here without the Tonight Show I mean you you said that you looked at it that the nature of it as a as a way to sort of fade into the sunset\nI'm I'm resilient so I Would like to think that I've always been something but I Would be a fool if I didn't tell you that the Tonight Show opened up even way more doors than I expected like I I truly thought this was going to be the most gentle mercy killing ever\nKnow as I did I [laughter] I'm just laugh if not all that does not ones that I think like oh this could benefit you\nYou know because I I was reading on the op eds and even though I Love being underestimated huh someone someone had a wrote in a I'm In a block once like like oh this is a sad day for music because watching the roots\nExcept this uh it's nice show gig will be like watching Miles Davis bus going to New York some are saying man and I was actually like good so actually what I Want I Want to be underestimated because I wanted to\nI wanted to to kill all a perceptions of this being a square gig yeah do do you buy the sort of the the conventional wisdom that you've changed late night music [noise]\nUm [noise] I mean there are small nuances but uh I think just the times have changed I think we just got very lucky with the timing the Internet and social media\nHad just started to become a thing or something like ... the idea of viral videos was becoming a thing and we took advantage of it like we were really young kid on the block and it was clear like Letterman wasn't going to start being on Snapchat and\nThat sort of thing so we just took advantage of and then the playing field you know a lot of late night shows were just post jazz music\nThere there were other avenues to explore and we took full advantage of it\nIt's it's interesting because there is a lineage right there's doc severance and from the old Tonight Show and then there's Paul Shaffer probably the next notable down in an interview and the roots\nWeird and you know again like I didn't you know I didn't have posters of ...\nBe me is just making the most of it again like in two thousand eight\nWhen he proposed it to us that\nWe should say you you didn't take the goal for a long time yeah I was like a I mean we just got to to a place where we were making good money on the road like why would we turn\nBack on Seventeen years of climbing the mountain to start all over again and I'm you know the one thing is that where we were failing miserably uh was in our domestic personal lives huh kids were getting older crime or at the airport\nSo it was sort of like we weren't actively asking for it but it was like man if there is a way that we could Celine Dion our way\nInto a position that you use all the stuff is birds right Celine Dion our way into a position where we could still make a good living without having to\nHave lobby called for him and be on the bus for nine hours and that's where it and then just fell into our lap and it was like be careful what you asked for there's a\n... there's going to get old marketplace in and you know ... management on your hair but I Lived for that stuff well well good and in fact that's the really the question right because you have said more than a couple of points\nPlanning something is the joy of actually doing that something and the question of the out of the question that comes out of it is what's it like to work for you how do you run the ban how you run the how do you run you guys on the show\nUm you know there's there's lessons to be learned about it because again where we're at a phase in our lives where we're not twenty two twenty three by ... what forty five now yeah I Wish I was okay for at least for that but it's a sign of\nUm so the things that I Would like to do like you know relentless rehearsals for seven hours in a row in that sort of thing and we used to do\nYou know you got to kind of be considered the fact that it might be soccer night or you know that sort of thing\nNot to mention a lot of our science projects well it's weird because one the roots is just one of the Nineteen things I'm responsible for we're in a very sweet spot right now where we're actually having more fun with each other\nSocially regret that we've ever had I realize that we're going to fall apart if\nAs people we weren't having fun with each other you know what I mean so I think now just were in as as a unit [noise] this is the best it's ever been\nWorking at it right there I was ... thanks for coming to thank you very much appreciate [noise]\n\nComing up if you're not one of the very large players you better be offering some niche products\nTrue in life true also in
