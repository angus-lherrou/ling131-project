C. and so that that was something that I'd always wanted to do and I talk to my professor\nAt the time and she said Shakespeare will always be there but if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it so I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious path [laughter]\nI Love the Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now\nRight now his moments so this show is incredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics or jumping in the air for what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense so what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training and it's this five years you've been where\nHe has shown me up on six wow yeah but yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of the six years I I learned things like juggling first scene that got cut and um I learned a great job which is that right now I can juggle place so that sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I

playing spongebob has actually affected your outlook on life it is made you a more optimistic person totally\nTotally yeah I mean it's hard not to I mean I I have the privileges\nYou know being the sponge two and a half hours [noise]\nEight shows a week um when did you first notice if I don't I don't know it's been a gradual increase yeah um I think I only started to acknowledge it when people started asking me if I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yeah and like at first I was like [noise] no um but\nYeah I mean like\nAnd and I'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly spongebob has these qualities that I aspire to he he's\nSure he's like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his friends end up his community in front of everything else and when the world is crumbling around every one people tend to be taken over by their fear and buy\nTheir hatred and their ability to escape the others and with sponge Bob is able to do is say no I'm not going to do that I Love my community and I love these people I'm not going to let this town destroy itself you know I get to save the world from itself every night and that's like especially these days\n[laughter] [noise] uh that feels really like uh\nAll right are you ready for an asked me another challenge yes I Am fantastic scores you are so even we actually found a pretty

yes Broadway show you may be aware as nine eleven minutes long just a little longer a little longer so we had to figure out like how do we take that\nCrazy fast paced show and create a show that can fill in the evening and has a kind of steaks the emotional stakes that are going to make us want to sit there for an evening so pretty early we sat on the idea there was going to be the end of the world which are pretty high stakes yeah right right and then the exact version of end of the world's changed a bunch\nBut we were kind of always on that idea that it was going to be Armageddon meat sponge Bob\nSponge Bob and his fellow inhabitants of bikini bottom or threatened by a volcano that it's going to destroy it and people are freaking out they looked at each fish are perfectly fish for sure you have\nTo clarify the I just saw myself in every single one of those fish and the squirrels wondering where ... who is who is a mammal and there is a subtle thing where everyone ends up turning on the mammal and even spray paint a sign that says mammals go home\nWhich of course seems like a comment on the current world around us and I'm just wondering when did this entered the script well\nYou know interestingly enough it's been in there a long time in the show Sandy this world is the only land mammal right are you there are aquatic mammals there's a whale but she's the only land mammal thank you I like your ... votes\nWe always thought wrote a story about people turning against each other dealing with fear the idea of scapegoating somebody it just you know that's what
