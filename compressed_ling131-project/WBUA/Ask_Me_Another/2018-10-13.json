school [laughter]\nYeah I Know I'm no I really wasn't I wasn't great at it I went to school because I wanted to be [noise]\nI've wanted to be a number of things really um but I said to myself oh maybe I'll child journalism and and so I I started taking political science courses and communication and I was like oh I think I'm going to be a diplomat and that's really hard to [noise]\nOn so then you know and then I was like okay you know what I'm gonna figure it out\nMaybe law school who knows um and then yeah and then I kept on trying different things until I got here and did you\nDid you take a acting classes or did you just start auditioning like how to transition happened\nWell I went to performance art high school right on when I was a kid I when I was in high school and so I was very familiar with the arts and I really loved it when I left college I started taking acting classes so I just went to like beginning acting and beginning improv and so I kept on taking classes like that and I moved to New York\nAnd I I joined us a school that was sort of like a cold\nIt was scary um but it really did preparing to help\nIt held yeah yeah there were certainly a big on the skin um\nOh yeah they uh they made me cry every day somehow I could not crying a dancing [laughter]\nSo I Would I did was I just started auditioning and then I\nStarted working yes now and this is graduation season and you just gave a commencement speech at your alma mater Andrew received an honorary doctorate to us how to deal with the phone oh God it was\nGreat it was great yeah and I and I I've been doing more of these um within the last two years I've been giving talks a different universities um\nI've gotten better [laughter] and so this one um it was special because I was actually getting a degree along with everybody else and I actually didn't uh get my degree from region is when I went there I was like a semester you're ... yeah\nYeah he credits so this was pretty grim for guys but of course all I I went to a Catholic all women's college now it's not a women's anymore but you know all all of my um the ... there were still nuns teaching our professors\nA and they all came up to like this is nice but you can finish\n[laughter]\nYou can finish you have you just have a few credit slapped him like just leave me alone on line classes call me later [laughter]\nNow you're big acting break came in two thousand and twelve when you were cast in orange is the new black as Murray to re most a Bronx bread character with Colombian roots now it seems that the show managed the impossible it's a huge ensemble cast where everyone supposedly liked each other\nOr what is the secret ingredients just just\nBe around women [laughter]\nHave everyone to be a woman [laughter]\nYou know from experience\nFunny 'cause people like would assume like the opposite ... you know how they brainwashed us in the past it's like Gaddy women riding\nHis you know the ... competition yeah yeah I mean I feel like I mean you can find that anywhere really but I think I mean I always have found myself very comfortable in groups of women and and spaces where it's like female run I mean I went to an all women's college\nBut this was definitely a progressive group and uh everyone really love being there and everybody was really excited to make something that was unlike any other\nYeah and you know what I find very impressive and particularly admirable about you is that you are one hundred percent self made because growing up your parents and your brother were deported when you were just fourteen years old and you were forced to basically fend for yourself\nHow did you manage [laughter] um so\nI you know I think they had a very clear I'm\nAt a very young age that if that did happen I mean I did grow up with the fear of my family being separated that was always very present in our household and so\nI was just always sort of like an outsider looking in actually because I was the only one in the family who was documented who is a citizen so anyway I grew up very confused but\nI always had it I'm very clear in my mind that whatever happened that I was going to continue\nGoing and I was going to be strong and I was going to find a way to succeed and and and that didn't mean I mean I didn't I didn't think oh I'm going to succeed as an actor or this or that I just wanted to succeed in life I just I just wanted to\nFigure out a way to be happy and to um you know figure out everything up and hopefully along the way help my family one day\nAnd in two thousand fourteen you wrote a very powerful op ed piece for the Los Angeles times about your brother your brother your parents deportation ha what was it about two thousand fourteen uh that you decided it is now time for me to tell the story I ...\nI thought maybe my voice could be an asset\nYou're not [laughter] I'm way because especially because of the people the people who are I was hearing like on the news um and and different talk shows really didn't when they talked about immigration it really didn't seem personal to me so I figured well how are these people representing my experience and the experience of millions\nUm I Know what this feels like I Know what family separation is so it's not really that easy it's not we need to have that our conversations about this and then I I decided okay I'll write something and see\nIf can move the needle in any way\nAnd what was the aftermath once that was published\nWho was it was like cats at a bag and there has to do all this work [laughter]\nSo I was like I'm so tired I'm like oh you're struggling in Hollywood and like nobody wants to give them your job [laughter] you know unless those you know some drug dealers girlfriend [noise] um [noise] and and here I Am putting myself in his decision like now\nDo all this work on top of this work yeah\nAnd it also led to obviously you deciding to write a book a whole memoir based on your life yeah a cold in the country we love my family divided and now you not only have this book but you've decided to\nPublish it was being published your latest book is targeted towards a young adult audience yeah ... it is called my family divided one girl's journey of home loss and hope what is different about this version\nUm it's just like an easier read like easier than already that easy book I'm writing money people come up to me all the time it's like last year book I read it in one sitting it's an easier route [laughter]\nYeah I I uh but it's already on our students [laughter]\nThose are the students have been responding to the story so I wrote it for them really it wasn't intended for you an adult\n[noise] so yeah that's why you found it easy [laughter]\nAnd now this memoir your story is being developed as a television series\nWell trying okay I'm In talks right now of developing on either a series or a film um I can take in many different directions but that's sort of like when I'm I'm getting into right now animated\nSeries archer novels yeah yeah I Want to make it into a children's book actually I'm very interested in that and then you know now that already it's Florida's
