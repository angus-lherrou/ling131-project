S.\nOkay so how does this thing work\nSo about two dozen states are enrolled in this cross check program it's free they share information between states keeping the voter registration rolls clean states don't want these duplicated voter registrations\nAnd most often this happens when people move so out when you moved from Florida California did you call the secretary of state in Florida\n[laughter] no I did not\nThat's okay then because you actually weren't breaking the law here's a deal it's not illegal to be registered to vote in two states that said it is illegal to vote in the same election into different stage\nSo Kobach uses cross strict system to go after voter fraud this\nIs where Kobach sign in using cross check Kobach persuaded the Kansas Legislature to give him the power to prosecute these cases by himself so he doesn't have to turn them over to the attorney general's office like the way it's done and all these other states\nOkay so all of a sudden Kris Kobach has the power of a prosecutor what's he doing with it well", "show_name": "Reveal", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "21"}
