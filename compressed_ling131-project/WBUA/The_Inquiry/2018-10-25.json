World Service with me how to marry and then each week one question for expert witnesses and denouncing [noise]\nIt's just sunny morning in Texas\nMing Wang is working to what she's going to find [noise]\nShe opens the door to her not inside tens of thousands of one recurring around in different books [noise]\nKeep his into why then another and slowly tunes on her what she's seen could help kill them to build a Haitian condition known to us [noise]\nDoes he is related to aging kill a hundred thousand people every day\nBut it clearly number of scientists say it doesn't have to be this way\nOr the ... research to carry that remarkable experiments challenging what we thought we knew about how life than\nThe ... of dollars are being spent all over the well connected to extend on line and this link we bring you some of the world's leading was sent to tell me what they found [noise]\nYou'll find out what ... Wang discovered with her one and one scientist was dusty aging process in ourselves\nAs we answer a question that own if you had probably ... [noise]\nHow long can we live [noise]\nPark one\nIt's all in this case\n[noise]\nWe're having a tremendous development in life expectancy we have doubled our lifetime in a very short period and we should really be happy to we were born right on the spot in history\n... thinks that witness cool Christians [noise] what does adults that so many years then one day decided she'd had enough of treating ... he now runs the Danish aging ... well he's trying to tell people getting in the first place [noise]\nWe all know what age ... from the outside [noise] what is actually due to a ...\nWell ... accumulation of damage from the molecular level that didn't spread to the\nCells and tissues and organs and to the whole organism mates kind of all the hits that we get all the time on the molecules and then when we can't keep up with the repairing than a staging\nStarch and when does it all began when do we start to decline that is in the mid thirties they start in there so I'm such a seven seven it's ... yeah now do you stop Oh thanks for the good news [laughter]\nSorry and there's more bad news once we still have to go downhill we go downhill fast\nIt's twice as dangerous being forty two compared to thirty five then again it's twice its dangers being forty nine compared to forty two and so on so your risk of death is increasing eleven twelve percent every year\nAnd a damn their mortality risk levels off around one hundred one hundred and five where the yearly risk of dying it's about fifty sixty percent so if you're really optimistic try and you could say that it never get any worse than fifty fifty\nAnd when you're thinking about these islands there's a lot stunts against team when you age as your molecules tissues and organs get tired and damaged you're susceptible to a whole range of diseases\nThe studies show actually they are like additional Oregon on to us because they can't even friends how the way they have and all his show how we respond to different medications\nAnd sometimes they make us sick the on the other hand they also play that important to keep us how the\nMainland wanted to know whether a micro biome has an effect on how we age so she decided to do an experiment in what she needed was an animal with a short life span she chose a particular kind of one ... ...\nSo that make them while they're from all that it's not ... subject yeah [noise]\n\nShe wanted to find out what would happen if you go to the worms micro biology wouldn't live longer [noise]\nShe chose one of the kinds of bacteria that lives inside a ... gun tweaked it seems to make different varieties and then sent them to separate groups of one [noise]\n\nA few weeks later she went to see the worms expecting them all to be dead now they've reached the end of the lifespan [noise]\nI was so excited because when we find him feel cases animal I not that they're still alive when we checked them I was jumping up down because he is totally unexpected and how long did some of the ... about fifty percent longer fifty percent yeah that's\nExtraordinary so you had most of the ones who are living for three weeks and there was some that lift fool four and a half four and a half yes I'm was that much more than you would have expected\nYeah I think scientists sometimes we do research it's kinda like Campbell in [laughter] so we have some crazy idea than you know we we did sigh of way to test them but you never know whether your idea is ride around and those moments where you\nFind that reads out that's the best moment\nAnd so they went on to test other things would have different microbiomes give worms will Tony a longer life with a better quality of life in that final days\nSo the way way way way kind of look at how they if they have when they're older because worm when that getting older their physical activity has declined so they move slower and also become a letter that al ... [noise]\nShe's got a video of some of these elderly ones [noise] and she's right you can tell their own blog younger ones regal energetically around them the older ones move slowly their skin sucking as they go [noise]\nI don't think they showed rank habits but it can tell that body structure is not as good as it used to be\nThe ones with the new like right by most any wrinkles around more quickly in their old age but they were less susceptible to disease to\n[noise] make wine is now carrying out tests on nice to see where the changing then like right by and extend their life and so there's a chance that one day don't just might be able to prescribe pills which do the same for us\nSome my colleagues say okay you know I think people can live to two hundred say ... years so personally I think why inject for me is already the number\n[noise] so how long can we live full [noise]\nWe've heard about ... to pick it up to a hundred and says he finds\nAnd how it different micro biome could give us fifty percent more time on us [noise]\nThe bases inventions or a bounce addressing the symptoms\nOf aging the coals well then if we can go straight to the tools [noise]\nTime for a final expert witness [noise]\nOh\nHeart for fighting you're so but I Do\nOh\nYou wouldn't believe the number of people have had got in touch with me that loan hiring is professor of molecular genetics to the University of Exeter in the u._k. scientist to walk on aging as 'cause a lot of people like scientists\nBefore now it's been a bit of a holy grail actually in our field now people are beginning to realize that this is a possibility and not wanting to get them that I think it's going to be huge\nNetwork all begins with the building blocks of our bodies ourselves\nSo basically the organs might have different type of tissue your tissue tomato different types of cells now so I just hope that some cells and say your liver kidneys or whatever will be dividing to replace some cells that are kind of dynamic I didn't want to know the more time to cell divides the greater chance of becoming what we would ...\nSome lessons comes from the ... which means to grow old and that's exactly what happened to these cells they've grown old income to the end of their life cycle but instead of dying they hang around I'm putting in a destructive manner\nThey cannot communicate with the cells ran them so it's in essence so we're basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affect all of the cells run them so it's almost like a self thing I I'm an old south and you guys have been around here about the same sort of a matter of time as I have so you must be able to say you should be thinking about ... does well\nWhile so it's almost some contamination with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive the cells around it and just messing\nAs we grow older more and more of a self becomes innocent until ... is overwhelmed\nDo they make the cells around them HPV Austin\nThese innocent south stop functioning as they should which is don't to me one of the things that leads to diseases like dimension consent type two diabetes\n\nProfession Harry's wants to know whether she could get these cells to stump behaving like a little cells behave more like young one\nHappening that was I had a new is that true in my lap and she was finding a fates and we have some ... and I had some chemicals\nAnd she suggested send you a sense that some of these chemicals on these skin cells and see what happened\nAbout a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me\nAnd when you look through the microscope what were you expecting to me\nThat they would still my own self so they look kind of lacy under a microscope\nAnd we have a particular die that we can put on our cell coaches the tens blue if that's the math and so when I was expecting to say\nIs that the south would be so blue and still looking old and she ... they went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like themselves to professor Harry said you've got the wrong side of these young sales going through it again and that\nAnd she did and she did it I think again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again people about me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly ... suspicious scientists and yeah they were taught to basically throw rocks that you're right there and if it said that that it's probably ...\nHow many rogue city services for about nine she did it about nine times and finally I kind of looked at them to actually maybe you're onto something here\nShe done something that no one thought possible\nShe'd effectively rejuvenated old cells and ... and\nThey said why loan Harry's is now getting phone calls from scientists and investors from all over the well is the first experiment is reverse aging and human cells they think the discovery could be the secret to a much longer life\nSo when it comes to our lifespan extinct loan Harry's would be the most ambitious of on our expert witnesses instead\nAs human beings I think we have enough trouble maximum lifespan especially what I wanted to share such to end up in either new generation of anti degenerative drugs within away off yet but in the future for things like dementia and cardiovascular disease what I'm hoping is that\nThis will allow us one treatment which will address several of those at one so that people who would have died at age will then go on to live than not all of his life and\nSo how long can we name [noise] who we know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty two someone's already got that song from what we had that steak I it's like to ride with the discovery of an expert witnesses alone\nOne day we may be able to replace a damaged organs\nTake supplements that give us a useful micro buying stuff ourselves aging [noise] how many years could all of this at all what if we go by to imbalance prediction if you're a millennia like me born in Nineteen eighty one you should be able to get to a hundred and Seventy five\nBy the time we get ten and Twenty one sixteen who knows what else will be possible [noise]\n\nThis inquiry
