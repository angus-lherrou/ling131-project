undergraduate days yeah so did you get onto the surface rather better than the economy of the eighties and nineties and the early to says\nThe financial crisis highlights the extent to which was being tortured universities was increasingly irrelevant\nWhen did you call in was head of graduate studies at University College London a top rated economics departments she saw how unhappy with students were with a mismatch between what they were learning and close ... there were seeing on the news as first banks and then the whole financial system began crushing down\nWe're all watching this and in some sense struggling trying to understand what was going on there was a sense of students being very complex and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning in our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics Tom says a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions that the crisis and Christmas was a good sort of catalyst because\nAt Christmas people have thrown together with their relatives\nAnd one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that you're not classes\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be taught courses which seemed to weigh a financial crisis was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the profession has become\nWindy calling is it also widely used university textbooks in retrospect she admits these books must not subjects that we usually important in terms of understanding the crash things as basic as\nHow finance works I can\nLot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks which we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy side or the one published in two thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system\nAnd this was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics is taught in universities around the world\nAnd has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think it was true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care about what's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we all depend if they get bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration filled by students and their teachers around the world\nHas given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these windy and many others of building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionately about and so I have to put my own hand up here on the court charity\nMm\nBut will it different curriculum being\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper calls the tune bankers and politicians founded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's models allowed them to justify the housing bubble\nMethods ... comics professor at Stanford University in the U.S [noise] she's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and saying what people want to hear well turning a blind eye to the bond who even criminal behavior by bank because that can threaten financial stability\nThere is definitely a problem it is a very very shocking may remain really fantastic country in the sense of how they explored the system but in the end ignoring the biggest elephants in the room and all the flooding sentences and all that deception and fraud and all the excessive\nEndangerment sets an entirely unnecessary it's just taken as a given it's just what they accept the system and does she think this has changed following the crisis\nWhat you hear is more and out you know very shockingly you know stuff happens then you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big oil and crisis just wakes you up because you notice it\nAnd then he's like oh you know we really had terrible regulations before let's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and say well I did my best can we prevent it stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz it comes down to the continued reliance record numbers on the ... unrealistic notion that the market is always right\nHe dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers the wind belief that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens as been\nAt the center of you might say conservative economics seems Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood\nThat wasn't true I think it'd be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices\nBut somehow in the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives I'd miss used his ideas even more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work in the seventies and eighties\nAdvances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will have often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of invisible hand than supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys themselves things in their self interest and threads freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust Stiglitz won the Nobel Prize for economics by identifying some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple it's just that somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that others didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOf theirs didn't the fact is that\nWe're perfect close their eyes at in Dr needed their students the markets basically worked perfectly wider economist\nExpects humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\n\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the heart of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were signs only works\nIf you imagine all humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to the economy can be counted [noise] journalists country muscles book who cooked Smith spinner argues the traditional economic\nTheories and methods only makes sense if you imagine humanity be self centered so unlike humans as almost a different species in fact\nSome economists have given the

that is always acting additive south in chest and all of a set of characteristics characteristics that we have been told to view as a male\nAnd even more of it is sort of all the characteristics that economics guys to great lengths trying to excluded from these models like\nEmotions family the faulty failings compassion and altruism and all of the things that we have been told that these are not economic event event and not anything that we need to studying economics they sent me the same things that we have been torched give you a female and there'll be the after the Chrysler people were saying\nThis greed is good seal off the the and this very narrow idea of what human beings are it's not good we need to bring these other values back in\nWe can't solve our economic problems without the courage to the U.S health with all that makes us human and failed economic models in economic theory now is actually based on that\nI agree with Katrin Schumann that people are simply rational ...

required\nThe financial crisis happened in my view must because the tools didn't exist in economics to understand what was happening but because the wrong tools we used an challenging questions were
