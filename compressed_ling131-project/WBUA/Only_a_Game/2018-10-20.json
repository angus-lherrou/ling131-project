it's time for three stories you should now we're going to start this week by analyzing a new scientific study\nI'm not joking but I promised that will be fun I'm joined by Michael ... of the athletic and by north ... at the Boston Globe welcome back to you about next severe thank you Karen [noise] so I don't normally followed the latest research out of the Aspen Institute but this week our friend\nReport and they study the dangers and benefits of high school sports and no surprise football was ranked at the very worst for causing injuries\nBut it was also ranked number two for what they called psycho social benefits\nAnd football would have been ranked number one for psycho social benefits if not for the fact that football players are also more likely to engage in risky behaviors like\nExcessive drinking but that to me seems like a self selecting kind of thing like kids who are going to be attracted to risky behaviors are also going to be at attractive too risky sport of football\nSo this really sums up to me the issue that we've been grappling with for about the past decade which is is there a way to make football less dangerous without turning off the kids that need it the most and those are the kids were attracted to the dangers of football and I'm all questions and answers and ... what do you think\nSo first of all my perspective on football is that kids don't need to play it in high school high school football scares me a ... just because all the research shows that when your brain is younger that's when it's the most vulnerable and the thing that I thought looking at the study was just that\nThe psycho social benefit seemed more related to playing a team sport than playing football specifically so even as a football writer I looked at it and thought\nWell yeah that's great but don't you think it's maybe just being outside and being on a team and making friends yeah well I\nI don't know if I have an issue of high school football as much as I Do like pop Warner ... really little kids but I think that you know at a high school level you know that's kind of like those awkward years where you're trying to find yourself the teams are usually pretty big and so you're a part of a really large community\nAnd you have the whole town behind you you know I Know from my years from cover in high school football\nI Know just what that sport can do to just bring people together\nAnd to also raise it self esteem of the athletes that perform because you've got eleven guys saw it on the field as one if you play high school basketball the gym maybe Mt\nIf you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself 'cause there's no one there to cheer you even when you cross the finish line I Know that run across country [laughter] but [noise] but football I can totally understand why it's viewed positively by the participants that doesn't make it any less dangerous\nYeah I mean we were you brought up youth football and certainly the solution there has been to suggest that kids under fourteen just plays flag football and said that they don't really need to\nTell 'em in there that yeah and I'm totally ... reservoir and yeah yeah yeah and um\nYou know Tom rainy and the Manning's none of them play tackle football until they they were a little bit older\nBut what was interesting to me in this study because I I have thought hey what if we just need high school football flag football like with with the with the community still show up would you still get those hundred kids who are all working towards the same thing\nAnd this study really made me question my own sort of point of view on that because then I Wonder these kids who are looking for are risky behavior [laughter]\nI'm not sure they're going to find it in flag football so it's a problem there's definitely more work to do [noise]\nMichael a basketball we need some basketball help us out [laughter]\nWe have our latest effort to fix an issue for college basketball at all boys the obvious solution\nMe that the G League is a now offer an alternative to the agencies one and done rule by providing the ultimate incentive to have a leap prospect from high school Eighteen years old ... before the draft\nTo come and play for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year\nYou choose a lot of money especially when you consider that this is more than the Mac salary for WMBA player and that's another topic that we can discuss later but the best part about the select contracts with the league is going to offer is that the players are able to sell their likeness urban assigned with an agent\nBut there is a risk to this one being you're playing in the ... so you're playing with grown men so you may not be able to establish yourself or separate yourself from your perspective as you say in college when you're playing against God's your own age\nThe Julie does not provide the platform that a billion dollar industry like the NCAA will while I applaud the Julie for trying to provide an alternative I think that the NCAA\nCould actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players but just allowing them to have the ability to hire an agent to sell their likeness and dishonest shoot is I think that could resolve the issue of paying the players I just wonder can the NCAA ever just step up and just solve its own problem\nWell so I Would say that no I have absolutely no confidence in the end\nOf all ages sort of one day and waking up and just dying like oh we're going to do the right\nCool that said probably the best possible outcome from is right or at least as I see it would be that the threat of elite high school players\nAnd would be enough to push the NC double A. to reform they're not going to do it on their own because they just feel like it [laughter] I mean I think the only way it works and this seems like a an uphill battle is is\nThe alternative is a good enough one that can actually be a source of real pressure on the inside of light which would be the first time that there's an alternative that's been able to do that\nIf guys are actually getting drafted out of the G lead into those top spots then I think I could work but Michael you promised that we could talk about the WNBA as she is so I'm going to hold you to that WNBA players get paid less than these half high schoolers would\nI didn't immediately make that connection like\nHey this is really prove that something is a little off here and it really shows how ingrained this idea is that men male athletes should always get paid more than female athletes\nAnd no one is suggesting that WNBA players should get paid as much as NBA players you know what I Do you know the bird has said that there's a bias that exists here and I really think the idea of\nMinor league players\nAnd leave that hasn't even like they don't they're not even on to not only ...\nAnd the fact that they would\nMaybe going as the better television do you eat\nRight right I mean if we need a stronger indication that there is a bias I don't think we'd find one they meant [laughter]\nI totally agree I I I think it's really unfair Dennis\nRoss is my favorite basketball player like male or female like I Love the interplay and then you have this deal that sort of like a slap in the face of sort of reminds you that yeah in this country we reward mill um athletes much more significantly than we do females\nWell we I mean the percentage of total revenue that goes to player salaries and the WMBA as significant one eight to twenty five percent ... percent [noise]\nSo there's only a game tradition we save our most important topic for last nor I hear you\nYeah I think this is going to mark the end of my tenure as the Boston Globe patriots supporter because I'm sure that I Am today is from a holiday for the spotlight investigative team\nI wrote a piece recently about touchdown and big play celebrations and it was kind of a something that the NFL has been letting players do a little bit more\nI Love when guys get really creative about it I went around and and did a little digging in the patriots locker room and pulled a bunch of guys to come up with kind of a grading system ah or how to look at a celebration and decide if it's up to snuff and I have a confession for you guys because\nWhat all the patriots players said was that you just can't celebrate when you're losing and this that actually happened in the cold got an interception a couple of weeks ago in a game and they were down by two scored and they started celebrating during this down there you know because the ads on the cameras\nOn them and obviously on TV you see the score right below and you're like ooh guys rough\nAnd I go around and they're all saying well you can't you can't celebrate when you're losing and I'm thinking in the back of my mind and this is why I'm not a professional athlete but can't [laughter] it would depend on how much earlier [laughter] I just believe in everybody's rate to hype them\nUp I support that as well and like if you pick up Tom Brady you should you know let everybody know yeah picked on me a stone but if you're getting your butt kicked you just look kind of silly\nI Love all of these you know it's so funny the NFL and football traditionalists student way up to ask for so long and they were like football is a team sport it's not about the individual and like celebration is unseemly and meanwhile we get the celebrations that are like\nRegister at B.

these are not normal times we're going to take this week's developments one by one starting with the arrest on Wednesday as Steve Penny the organization's former presidents did you ever think you'd see something like this well\nFirst of all unfortunately it's becoming all too common that we start to segment we talked about using and for all the wrong reasons this guy's on blue since the penny guy he took it on the lam\nThis guy rant on sports organization right and he's not in the lamb and they have to track him down any gallons burger and they have to bring him back on smell taxes\nA grand jury in Texas has indicted penny for allegedly destroying or hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison for sexually abusing athletes and I really really want to see what's in those missing documentary\nAbout you as does everyone else including I suspect someone Nassar's victims I think one way or another either disguise trial er into discovery the eight zillion lawsuits that are going to be filed against you say ... we're going to see what's in the documents and it's not going to be great\n[noise] so let's talk about Mary Bono she was an which I never thought I Would do it again [laughter] right right well she was announced last friday as\nUSA Gymnastics new interim president by Tuesday she had resigned there were two major issues first stop does the fact that means bono worked for a law firm that also represented Larry Nassar disqualify her from running USA Gymnastics\nYes next question All right next question [laughter] the second issue to me is a bit more complicated in September a month before she got the job Mary Bono treated an image and in it she was using a marker\nBlackout this ... on her Gulf shoes and as anti Colin Kaepernick tweets go this one was pretty tame I might disagree with her point of view but I respect her right to express it yeah\nWell first of all I missed the memo in which Mary Bono became qualified or on USA your true second of all she managed to alienate both Nike and Simone Biles\nWhen you've alienated the primary corporate sugar daddy and the face of your sport it's really time to go and it's pretty convincing evidence that you shouldn't have been there in the first place\nI mean what's the USA Gymnastics do at this point at all bring anybody back\nThe Olympics will bring people back you will see what will probably be a Nike fueled run up to the next Olympics where whoever represents the United states in God Knows Simone Biles is going to be one of them\nAre going to be the redemption team they're going to be the ones who bring honesty and non criminal behavior back to women's gymnastics and it will sell because the Olympics will help us oh\nSurely you and I have been saying for a while that the best thing that the NFL could do regarding players who choose to Neal is absolutely nothing and they seem to have listened to us are you surprised\nNo because we're smart Karen and more people to listen to [laughter] no I mean the basic probably NFL had with the whole anthrax thing was they got three or four owners who were off the reservation Jerry Jones bombing mayor down in Houston a church singing and kill and those guys are pretty much marginalize if they didn't depart the league entirely what churches\nAnd once cooler heads prevail\nOr they realized that probably forty percent of their fans are at the beer stand during the anthem anyway and the ones that you know are offended by this they can afford to offend what I really love\nAbout this story is that they actually came up with actual data\nThat showed that tweets made by the president didn't try fans off to a football what turned fans after football was those owners speaking up right and finally Charlie I Want to draw your attention she they can yeah\nIce lions because the country only has enough ice hockey players to field one team they had never played a game against an opponent so why has this team made international news\nFirst of all I Want to Jersey Jersey so bad [laughter] apparently Sidney Crosby and Nathan McKinnon help these guys come to Toronto to play

one this is an option McKinnon even said hey these guys came really fast which is pretty good considering most of them didn't escape before last year\nThere was a video because of course it's

hearing\nGiven and it's time for three stories you should now we're going to start this week by analyzing a new scientific study I'm not joking but I promise that will be fun I'm joined by Michael ... of the athletic and by north ... at the Boston Globe welcome back to you about next severe thank you Karen [noise]\nSo I don't normally followed the latest research out of the Aspen Institute but\nInteresting report and they study the dangers and benefits of high school sports and no surprise football was ranked at the very worst for causing injuries\nBut it was also ranked number two for what they called psycho social benefits\nAnd football would have been ranked number one for psycho social benefits if not for the fact that football players are also more likely to engage in risky behaviors like\nExcessive drinking but that to me seems like a self selecting kind of thing like kids who are going to be attracted to risky behaviors are also going to be at attracted too risky sport of football\nSo this really sums up to me the issue that we've been grappling with for about the past decade which is is there a way to make football less dangerous without turning off the kids that need it the most and those are the kids who are attracted to the dangers of football and I'm all questions and answers and ... what do you think\nSo first of all my perspective on football is that kids don't need to play it in high school high school football scares me a rank leaders because all the research shows that when your brain is younger thoughts when it's the most vulnerable and the thing that I thought looking at the study was just that\nThe psycho social benefit seemed more related to playing a team sport mhm than playing football specifically so even as a football writer I looked at it and thought well yeah that's great but don't you think it's maybe just being outside and being on a team and making friends yeah well I\nI don't know if I have an issue with high school football as much as I Do like pop Warner ... really little kids\nBut I think that you know at a high school level you know that's kind of like those awkward years where you're trying to find yourself the teams are usually pretty big and so you're a part of a really large community and you have the whole town behind you you know I Know from my years from cover in high school football\nI Know just what that sport can do to just bring people together\nAnd to also raised the self esteem of the athletes that perform because you've got eleven guys saw it on the field as one if you play high school basketball the gym maybe Mt\nIf you play um cross country for sure you're really by yourself 'cause there's no one there to cheer you even when you cross the finish line I Know that run across country [laughter] but [noise] but football I can totally understand why it's viewed positively by the participants that doesn't make it any less dangerous\nYeah I mean we were you brought up youth football and certainly the solution there has been to suggest that kids under fourteen just plays flag football and said that they don't really need to\nAll of 'em in there with that yeah and I'm totally reading far and yeah yeah yeah and\nYou know Tom rainy and the Manning's none of them play tackle football until they they were a little bit older\nBut what was interesting to me in this study because I I have thought hey what if we just need high school football flag football like with with the with the community still show up would you still get those hundred kids who are all working towards the same thing\nAnd this study really made me question my own sort of point of view on that because then I Wonder these kids who are looking for are risky behavior [laughter]\nI'm not sure they're going to find it in flag football so it's a problem there's definitely more work to do [noise]\nMichael a basketball we need some basketball help with that [laughter]\nWe have our latest effort to fix an issue for college basketball at all boys the obvious solution to\nMe that the G League is a now offer an alternative to the in sees one and done rule by providing the ultimate incentive to have a leap prospect from high school Eighteen years old ... before the draft to come and play for a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars a year\nYou choose a lot of money especially when you consider that this is more than the Mac salary for WMBA player and that's another topic that we can discuss later but the best part about the select contracts with the league is going to offer is that the players are able to sell their likeness urban assigned with an agent\nAnd put there is a risk to this one being you're playing in the G ... so you're playing with grown men so you may not be able to establish yourself or separate yourself\nFrom your perspective as you say in college when you're playing against guys your own age\nThe G League is not provide the platform that ... billion dollar industry like the NCAA will while I applaud the G League for trying to provide an alternative I think that the NCAA\nCould actually benefit their athletes and especially the elite basketball players but just allowing them to have the ability to hire an agent to show their lightness and decide shoot is I think that could resolve the issue of paying the players I just wonder can the NCAA ever just step up and just solve its own problem\nWell so I Would say that no I have absolutely no confidence in the end\nOf all ages sort of one day waking up and deciding like oh we're going to do the right thing\nWho all that said probably the best possible outcome from is right or at least as I see it would be that the threat of elite high school players\nWould be enough to push the NC double A. to reform they're not going to do it on their own because they just feel like it [laughter] I mean I think the only way it works and this seems like a an uphill battle is that\nThe alternative is a good enough one I can actually be a source of real pressure on the inside of light which would be the first time that there's an alternative that's been able to do that\nIf guys are actually getting drafted out of the G League into those top spots then I think I could work that Michael you promised that we could talk about the WNBA as she is so I'm going to hold you to that WNBA players get paid less than these half high schoolers would\nI didn't immediately make that connection like\nHey this is really proof that something is a little off year it it really shows how ingrained this idea is that men male athletes should always get paid more than female athletes\nAnd no one is suggesting that WNBA players should get paid as much as NBA players you know what I Do you know the bird has said that there's a bias that exists here and I really think the idea of\nMinor league players and leave that hasn't\nEven like they don't they're not even on to not only a union and the fact that they would maybe Maureen has\nA better television do you eat\nRight right I mean if we need a stronger indication that there is a bias I don't think we'd find one they meant [laughter]\nI totally agree I I think it's really unfair Dennis Ross is my favorite basketball player like male or female like I Love the interplay and then you have this deal that sort of like a slap in the face of sort of reminds you that yeah in this country we reward mill um athletes much more significantly than we do females\nWell we I mean the percentage of total revenue that goes to player salaries and the WNBA as significant one eight to twenty five percent right in the ... have to sort of ... percent [noise] so there's only a game tradition we save our most important topic for last nor I hear you\nYeah I think this is going to mark the end of my tenure as the Boston Globe patriots supporter because I'm sure that I Am today is from a holiday for the spotlight investigative team\nI wrote a piece about touchdown and big play celebrations and it was kind of a something that the NFL has been letting players do a little bit more I Love when guys get really creative about it I went around and and did a little digging in the patriots locker room and\nPulled a bunch of guys to come up with kind of a grading system a how to look at a celebration and decide if it's not just nuts\nAnd I have a confession for you guys because\nWhat all the patriots players said was that you just can't celebrate when you're losing and this it actually happened the call I got an interception a couple of weeks ago in a game and they were down by two scored\nAnd they started celebrating during this down there you know was the ads on cameras ... obviously on TV you see the score right below and you're like ooh guys rough\nAnd I'm going around and they're all saying well you can't you can't celebrate when you're losing and I'm thinking in the back of my mind and this is why I'm not a professional athlete but\nCan't [laughter] depends on how much earlier [laughter] I just believe in everybody's rate to hype\nThem up I support that as well and like if you pick up Tom Brady you should you know let everybody know yeah I picked up Tom let me just don't know if you're getting your butt kicked you just look kind of silly\nI Love all of these you know it's so funny the NFL and football traditionalists student way up to ask for so long and they were like football is a team sport it's not about the individual and like celebration it's unseemly and meanwhile we get the celebrations that are like\nFrom Boston University this was Ninety point nine W.

it's time for this week's news with Charlie Pierce hey Charlie\nIn the segment by talking about USA Gymnastics but these are not normal times we're going to take this week's developments one by one starting with the arrest on Wednesday as Steve Penny the organization's former presidents did you ever think you'd see something like this well\nFirst of all unfortunately it's becoming all too common that we start to segment we both argument using true and for all the wrong reasons\nThis guy's on blue since the penny guy he took it on the lam this guy rant on sports organization right and he's on the lam and they have to track him down any gallons burger napping bringing back ...\nA grand jury in Texas has indicted penny for allegedly destroying or hiding documents relating to Dr Larry Nassar who has been sentenced to more than a hundred years in prison for sexually abusing athletes and I really really want to see what's in those missing document\nDo you as does everyone else including I suspect someone Nassar's victims I think one way or another either at this guy's trial er into discovery the eight zillion lawsuits that are going to be filed against you say ... we're going to see what's in the documents and it's not going to be great\n[noise] so let's talk about Mary Bono she was\nAn which I never thought I Would do it again [laughter] right right well she was announced\nLast friday as USA Gymnastics new interim president by Tuesday she had resigned there were two major issues first stop\nDoes the fact that means bono worked for a law firm that also represented Larry Nassar disqualify her from running USA Gymnastics yes next question All right next question [laughter]\nThe second issue to me is a bit more complicated in September a month before she got the job Mary Bono treated an image and in it she was using a marker that blackout the swoosh on her Gulf shoes\nAnd as anti Colin Kaepernick tweets go this one was pretty tame I might disagree with her point of view but I respect her right to express it\nYeah well first of all I missed the memo in which Mary Bono became qualified or on USA true true second of all she managed to alienate both Nike and Simone Biles\nWhen you've alienated the primary corporate sugar daddy and the face of your sport it's really time to go and it's pretty convincing evidence that you shouldn't have been there in the first place\nI mean what's the USA Gymnastics do at this point at all bring anybody back\nThe Olympics will bring people back you will see what will probably be a Nike fueled run up\nTo the next Olympics where whoever represents the United states in God Knows Simone Biles is going to be one of them are going to be the redemption team they're going to be the ones who bring honesty and non criminal behavior back to women's gymnastics and it will sell because the Olympics will help us oh\nSurely you and I have been saying for a while that the best thing that the NFL could do regarding players who choose to Neal\nIs absolutely nothing and they seem to have listened to us are you surprised no because we're smart Karen and more people to listen to it [laughter]\nNo I mean the basic probably NFL had with the whole anthem thing would they got three or four owners who were off the reservation Jerry Jones bomb McNair down in Houston a church singing and kill and those guys have been pretty much marginalized if they didn't depart the league entirely when churches and and once cooler heads prevail\nOr they realize that probably forty percent of their fans are at the beer stand during the anthem anyway and the ones that you know are offended by this they can afford to offend what I really love about\nThis story is that they actually came up with actual data\nThat showed that tweets made by the president didn't try fans off to football what turned fans after football was those owners speaking up right and finally Charlie I Want to draw your attention she they can yeah\nIce lions because the country only has enough ice hockey players to field one team they had never played a game against an opponent so why has this team made international news\nFirst of all I Want Jersey Jersey nice so bad [laughter] apparently Sidney Crosby and Nathan McKinnon help these guys come to Toronto to play against the team of\nFirefighters and then Crosby image in and played for the gang [laughter] ... which we don't do the last story on our on our segment every week is usually a funny one this isn't a funny one this is an option McKinnon even said hey these guys came really fast\nWhich is pretty good considering most of them didn't escape before last year\nThere was a video because of course it's sponsored by a coffee company and my favorite but it's one of the Kenyan players reaches out and like pot Sidney Crosby on the face and says is a really huge [laughter]\nI've always been and you can sell hockey anywhere if you give it a chance you could sell hockey in Kenya I Hope the ice lines practice very hard and are in the next Olympics they will be the biggest thing there\n[laughter] you can find the sports writing a Charlie Pierce at Sports Illustrated from time to time and he joins us each week here on me again thanks Charlie thanks [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIn the fall of Nineteen sixty three the beach boys celebrated a national hero just\nTwo months earlier Craig Breedlove and the jet engine powered spirit of America\nHad set a new land speed record [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nBut ... didn't stop there only against Gary ... [noise]\nOn October Fifteen Nineteen sixty four Craig Breedlove hurdles across Utah's Bonneville salt flats he reached a top speed of five hundred twenty six miles per hour [laughter]\nBreedlove\nHad just surpassed his own land speed record but things began to go wrong as he\nTried to slow down the first problem was with the emergency parachute\nLet's shoot broke off and I didn't know that that had happened\nBut he did know about some of the other things that we're going wrong the steering was malfunctioning and then there were the brakes\nHe tries to breaks they melt that's writer Samuel ... he has no breaks he's going five hundred miles an hour he's running out of course and he's got no way to stop\nSo I came down the corps and went through the place that I'm supposed to be stopped\nWent through is understatement in the extreme\nSo I was still traveling a good four hundred miles an hour\nCrew members gave chase in cars but their top speeds were just Seventy or eighty miles per hour they knew spirit of America wouldn't stop before it reached a construction site at the edge of the highway\nI had to make it over a wooden bridge that the bill and ended up knocking down a telephone pole by highway eighty and went over and embankment at about two hundred twenty miles an hour and a car went airborne\nBreedlove wouldn't tell me if he was terrified when that happened he's too logical into analytical to betray emotion but put yourself in the cockpit of spirit of America as it launched skyward wouldn't you be and wouldn't that make you rethink your career choice [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Only a Game", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "20"}
