sexual assault\nA woman by the name of Catherine me or guys come forward in a long piece in the German magazine Der Spiegel she waited until now because back in two thousand ten and all those settled with her out of court and pair three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars but the stipulation that she never talk about the report that assault again but she has a new lawyer\nThere's a police

you've done and Baylor a cabin on me and you wonder how you're going to keep your enthusiasm level high that we used to be paid closer attention\nI'm going to try to be optimistic and say that this was going to get the sort of traction that it needs and it's going to it and that people are gonna pay attention to it I Wish I were more optimistic than I Am totally what do you think\nI I definitely don't have the optimism mostly because uh we live in a system here where the powerful or as always have lifted where the powerless or not\nThis woman has every piece of evidence possible you have sponsors who are kind of backing away from all the way you have teams who are suspending him a giving him a break but it should go much further than that to the point that a woman's fewer must be

they're monitoring the situation very closely just because this is the area that you trafficking when you saw Addison Russell get forty games were major league baseball after his domestic violence situation is this needle moving at all in your opinion\nYeah I mean it's moving it's a you know I always described us as like a giant cruise ship with a teeny tiny writer and turning this at all it's very difficult\nBut you know for someone like me who studies college football and sexual violence in particular it wasn't much but urban Meyer he got a little bit of punishment but it it's going to take a long time and a lot of work to get the kind of change that we're hoping for\nTyler Europe so in the last few weeks one of the major dissenters in this athletic moment of protests outside of Colin Kaepernick his former teammate greed was originally signed by the Carolina Panthers read isn't all pro level almost all world levels safety at this point and was one of the main people who kneeled next to Colin Kaepernick back in August twenty sixteen\nAfter Jerry Richardson's reign of massage knee and also sexism and also racism and also everything bad in the world that could be around one owner him leaving the Panthers last shares opened up a new leadership where owner David Pepper has said that he sides of the protests that being said\nIt doesn't feel as if the Panthers have done anything monumental by hiring a dissenter hiring a protester who was ousted from the league has a collusion case with the NFL they've been nothing but hire the right person for the job but at the same time it almost feels as if protesters during the cap on the air are finding their way back into the league for us then\nYeah I think that number one do you get a medal for doing the right thing to you is is that what we do here just to get my question for you on this I'm thinking is this cynicism\nIn met you finally got a player that you needed when you're the Panthers or is it the fact that now that you hire Eric reads that collusion lawsuit that he's got currently against the NFL now goes away\n... it was a good question I mean it doesn't matter that they hired him because he's a good football player I'm\nGoing back to the discussion we just had and Tyler brought this up um if we want to talk about the impact on me to on sports the fact that Richard since not there is because of Sports Illustrated reporting about his massage any and races on and that's where that's tied into me to write so we can see a direct impact here\nAnd it's hard you don't want to give them cookies for doing the thing that they should do [laughter] I don't know it's so complicated I'm really happy that readers back\nI think we can mix a piece of actually being happy that somebody who deserves the job got one and also having skepticism that it's this long for it to happen to the entire NFC South needed\nOr they never happened in the first place why why are we waiting until October for\nExactly Arab greed was not on a preseason roster every was on the training camp roster it took multiple mental fall and the gridiron for ... to even get proposed that he should have a job or the general manager Marty hardly ... strictly a football decision and that's when this starts to feel duplicitous like we need to actually speak about it\nYeah and he's not being silent I always want to point out that his presser which is great by the way it's a yeah I mean his unpacking of us history and oppression in this country should be used in classrooms and he's being very clear in his messaging as he has always been\nA Eric and I talked about this at Lincoln during the twenty Seventeen season all year with the forty niners last year and I remember saying to him listen you can't beat the flag so you're going to have to go head first on shaping your message on what this is all about stay on target if you don't stay on target and they're going to shape it for you and you're going to lose or what he did to me was fantastic\nI Am going to finish things off with football as well and people hate it when I say it but sports are filtered through the following one's white owners white coaches white season ticket buyers white media and black players\nThrough the lens players perform a service for the owners and they entertain the fan base they have no other rights or concerns they're paid a ton and they're expected to be grateful but it'll Thomas the safety for the Seattle Seahawks he held out earlier this season for a better contract\nRisk the short window of opportunity and the fans called them selfish and he came back and what happened he broke his leg and well being cut it off the field he flipped the middle finger to his and sideline and some fans burned his Jersey my reaction was into burned his Jersey it was to buy one Jessica\n[laughter] who got your Jersey money you know if\nThere's some way to support and also to make sure that the right people are being hurt by this\nYeah I think that's a great point and it made me think a lot about this story with JR Smith they came up recently in the NBA and he put a tattoo on his leg and then all of this question about covering it up and and sort of this discussion of who owns and putting that in quotes like who owns\nThe ... and what did they owe us Jessica sometimes refer to them as owners [laughter] right yeah you're talking about them is owners the language of sports is very specific right I think the anger that comes with hearing some\nSome of these issues with the fact that we don't really understand the metrics of how capitalism can work right you belong to the people who pay your paycheck and that's wrong at the basis of it right so the NBA says they are with actually we do on your skin and he has one of two choices Eby says if I had it we know you don't I Want a brand on my leg\nOr he says the money is more important to my kids which he did say I'm just gonna keep pushing and so I think it's powerful that people like roll Thomas and St are Smith are standing up to these corporations that are telling them they're not worth that much when the reality is\nIf there's a lady on bill on the field as we've seen with the Steelers often\nOften doesn't go the team is bad losses a crew people get fired in that just because you wouldn't pay somebody their worst my guess for\nThis week's

Thirteen ... weird season on Sunday they started the day with the best record in the national league forty eight hours later after two games at home they're finished\nYeah I mean we're ... we're not home game do you know I mean you know which of course we're going to run exactly right you know we're ... years off yeah you know they went through these spells of what looked like the chimney unfortunately one of those hit at the wrong time\nMobs of lately they scored one run or fewer forty times this year and still one Ninety five games so I guess they should get a medal for that\nYeah outside for the red Sox winning a hundred and eight games with that Bolton that sat on the top just most inexplicable thing of the year\nIt's incredible the only team to score one runner fewer more times than the cubs was the Orioles and they lost a hundred and fifty in game when so when did Ninety five with that sort of a semi coffins is doing something there is news this week in a novel move tennis channel will begin showing\nWait for it tennis more specifically the women's tennis tour which went out on its own and the disastrous venture it would be in sports\nFor the last two years women's tennis outside of the grand slams has been virtually invisible meanwhile for the past five years many Los Angeles Dodgers fans haven't been able to watch the games in their market because some cable networks won't carry sports nut LA\nWith the combination of court cutting in contempt you think people are realizing that life goes on or if you're just a die hard sports men do you just wait forever until these corporations figure it out\nYeah I think both are true and I also think there is another phenomenon going on and that is the phenomenon of finding a way to be a fan without attending games that without necessarily watching on TV [laughter] I mean we always it'd be a fan for better\nBut now you can be a financial fantasy sports you can be a fan through memorabilia all kinds of ways to do you give me a fan through media nostalgia yup what this thing with the women's tennis thing reminds me most of\nIs a phenomenal late to stash decision that the NHL made years ago to get off ESPN and not a sports fanatic right when they went to ... with a spike TV for the playoffs remember that I went to like you could turn back before that they went to a sports channel\nYou know they were ESPN only professional league you have that time and he is the end it the more you know they did it among the SPN they did what ESPN dot which is the hype them to the moon and then they moved on to sports you know that's what this reminds me also\nKnow they made a big mistake and I think the good news is at least if you're a fan of W T H tennis and I am because I watched women as much as I watched the man I'm happy that they're back you can actually watch them for the season and you know finally Charlie you know show would be complete without at least some discussion of the
