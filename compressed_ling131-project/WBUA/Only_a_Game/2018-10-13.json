[laughter]\nI'm not even going to pretend Karen I'm I'm a Homer\nBut Jason what you just said about being said is exactly my thoughts I keep hearing people say and this is crazy to me like oh the red Sox are playing a lot better than they have recently like there too and I'm like why are you talking about like we don't actually need another championship\nWill never satisfy Erin Hatton the game you\nRealize care and that there are six year olds in New England who have only been one duck but Red Sox play a more if I was just it it and they have waited long enough to children\nAll right so I Want to move us out of New England and talk about Jenny butler he had an exciting return to let it simmer whole practice on Wednesday\nButler's looking for a trade and she's just so hated trade he reportedly played brilliantly during practice well screaming things like you bleeping need me and other things I Can't see on the radio and then he sat down with ESPN's Rachel Nichols\nWhat is the right way to do it no I Can't control that when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game that's wrong me me and my finest numerous sure that's what you're going to do inside the lines\nAnd this is a is it not the right way for it to come to think it was the wrong thing to do well to do I think that\nI was honest okay let's try that again yes yes it was the wrong thing to do\nWhat I Know it's ridiculous to expect athletes to be role models they're not elementary school teachers after all their athletes but has frustrating as your situation might be if you were an athlete kids are going to do what you do so it's not okay maybe understandable but not OK\nCharlotte I Know you sometimes enjoy it when the NBA\nVentures WW story so I'm gonna let them or you know we do a little concerned\nAbout very worried about my reputation look I think that what athletes are very good at these days is owning a news cycle Jimmy Butler new exactly what he was doing and the report about his practice came out and two hours later he was on the jump with Rachel\nI don't really care like I I don't know if I Would say it's okay or not I think that kids are going to act like idiots no matter what so I don't think that one athlete trying to get more airtime isn't necessarily going to be like a role model issue I Do think that if I were his teammates it'd be like\nMan but I I think that it's all pretty calculated\nCharlotte so cynical you think the fact that ESPN was on to rules campus for this melt down with advance warning\nWas somehow a bit of choreography on team bottlers part\nI don't want to say I said that but I didn't and not care and also I have seen you\nBeen a [laughter]\nI don't know if you are one of the cast does you know this is where\nThe NBA is now it's almost become less in common with a traditional sports league in more like the marvel comics universe where these players are kind of superhero like and they have enemies both on their own squads Anon squads elsewhere\nI I'm just going to leave it at you know Charlotte and made the point that the media is being used here and as a member of the media I'm just going to say hey I don't like being use really\nAnd like [laughter] will give me just just just use me up [laughter] or feel whether\nOur gang you probably know that once more the Alabama Crimson Tide of the number one college football team in the country and you surely know at Alabama head coach Nick Saban hair is once\nAgain so key lobster [laughter] that's really nice\nBut all is not well in Tuscaloosa because those variety good for nothing Alabama students are getting increasingly ambivalent about attending one sided football games once more\nNick Saban is on a war against his own student body we're talking friendly fire for their paltry attendance Crimson Tide football games\nHis poor Crimson Tide players\nLook up the stairs in the middle of games\nAnd it looks like a Miami Marlins game up there [laughter] but here is a thought for Alabama\nPlays some exciting football games that begin at reasonable times\nNick Saban actually got himself worked up about the student crowd at a football game that began at eleven am Charlotte on a Saturday So they realize that it's legal for a college student to wake up before noon on a weekend [laughter] also\nAlabama was playing in Louisiana Lafayette me no no disrespect to Louisiana Lafayette but you know what the score was at halftime what was the score it was seven hundred and Ninety five thousand\n[laughter]\nForty nine to nothing it was forty eight to nothing about half\nPart of this is a little weird of a take I realized pardon me kind of Caesar he's coming from okay I Want to hear and I do because like here's this\nTeam that you have you've devoted in your life to making this insane powerhouse and you are the best college football team that has made me ever existed and then people stop going to your games I'd be like\nWhat I like are you kidding I did for you [laughter]\nI mean I also did it for the millions of dollars and the prestige and the chance to you know do whatever I Want after this but I Do kind of understand what you're you're\nA fancy pants traveling Sports Illustrated correspondent now you have been to these major college events you know that big time college boards of two thousand Eighteen the last thing that has anything to do with our students boosters vision prime sponsor\nOkay here's a thought maybe they should pay the students\nTo go to the game now Charlie while they're perfect exactly and the tourism needs to die why would get you out of bed before noon what I Want to figure out a number\nOn it doesn't take much for a college student in college if you paid me like twenty bucks to go to a football game and ...\nDollars now I Believe this is an NC double a violation of an iron lead\nViolation than paying the players right you can also give me just like a pair of sneakers and an

WNBA stars where men signature shoes what gives\nBut now it's time for the week's news with Charlie Pierce Hi Charlie older women you all you want to talk about his shoe speaking of shoes Philadelphia Seventy Sixers energy oil and beat has signed a five year jail with Under Armour it'll making the highest compensated player at his position and he told ESPN quote\nThere's a stereotype about big men that we can't sell shoes is that kind of shoes look really weird and aside Seventeen\nYes I mean as someone who want\nAnd a charity auction an autograph Shaquille O'Neal show out on yeah which I Believe we're using as a car for the problem with with that they looked fine on the big men right but when you put them on a shelf\nThey look like art on [laughter] but if anybody can do it it's Joelle NBA who has charisma beyond belief um so I mean he's going to make a lot of money at this and he says he's not really a center anyway he thinks of itself a guard I mean you might as well think of his own the Martian for all I'm concerned but you know this is the way the world is\nYeah I mean he said I'm not really a big man and of course he's certainly big he's seven feet tall but he says he can do at all which I guess means you can shoot\nWhich means the couch except for the Philadelphia Seventy Sixers have just had a stroke [laughter] the college basketball\nCorruption trial has been underway for a while now Charlie but the big allegations are starting to drop anything here that shocked shocked you\nYes what shocked me all along which is the FBI spending my money to become the enforcement arm of the NC double a\nThere is nothing you can do there isn't a bright big enough to make me care about this bribery dry it's re criminalizing an underground economy the whole thing is just silly\nThe players are the ones are going to get hurt most and the NC double a which was on the ropes and staggering has now found its way back to what it perceives to be the moral high ground and I couldn't be more disgusted\nSpeaking of the players are the ones that get hurt the New York times brought up an interesting question this week and that's who's the real victim here the prosecutors say the victim is the university's\nFans might say at us but the New York times suggests that it Brian tags Boeing whose father agreed to take money from Adidas and as a result tags is now playing in Australia\nWell there's nothing wrong with playing in Australia has a really nice place but it's also not national television\nYou know I think Brian Bull is going to be fine I think he's going to do as a friendship in Australia and come back and get drafted pretty high but again the fact remains is this this whole notion that somehow the universities have been victimized by these guys taking money from shoe company guys as though the university's\nHaven't been accepting that as business as usual for Thirty years is one of the ways they've turned the bribery laws in this thing into a pretzel\nCharlie last week on this show we learned that the woman who is accusing event is star Christiana ... of rape had compelling evidence in the form of a legal document in which we're now although admitted to non consensual sex\nNow or in all this lawyer is saying that document with acquired in a computer hacking altered so now what\nWell this is one of the eight thousand reasons why I didn't go to law school\nI think certainly burden of proof is on ... on his lawyers to prove the thing was hacked that sounds like a very expeditious discovery all of a sudden otherwise let's let this thing get litigated but I don't envy the judge it All right because there's clearly a lot of money on the side of Mr ... who is capable of buying a lot of forensic you've written a lot\nAnd how hard it is you know you're out what is true and when people start calling into question legal documents I really get confused\nWhat can we ... well I mean you know given the nature of how much we rely on computers these days there's always going to be somebody who knows more about it than you do so I mean a lot of institutions have been undermined or quote unquote disrupted which is apparently the term of art for it I mean I guess you just have to trust your instinct and understand that the legal process will grind on\nEuropean soccer has long had a problem with racist fans and Chelsea has decided that just banning offenders from the stadium isn't changing things instead they're going to give offenders the opportunity to quote spend some time with our diversity officers\nWhat you did wrong and this time isn't going to be spent in a classroom\nRight oh they're going to take them to Auschwitz which I Will guarantee you most of these people will not connect with the black people their insulting it's a good idea you know maybe they should all get on an airplane and go to the new anti lynching memorial down in Alabama that Brian Stevenson slice put up\nI like inventive thinking on this sort of thing going on a road trip and go see what the end result of what you're doing it\nAnd finally Charlie I'm just going to let you explain what was mysterious about the guy wearing number Thirteen when Hawaii face Wyoming last Saturday Night\nHe wasn't if\nThey're worried about it'd be Wyoming by the way in this game Seventeen to Thirteen but they're starting quarterback Colin McDonald\nHe had some sort of injury that they did not want to disclose\nSomebody came out on the field warmed up wearing his Jersey [laughter] you know throwing the throwing the potato to throw the guy on his third base you know one of these this is a real throwback to the the wild west days of sports and I love it\nI think it's probably something you can only use wants though [laughter] right

Mehlman\nPetra zealous says Nike's tradition of socially conscious branding goes back all the way that the seventies when they released their first women's running line they named their shoes after kind of\nAll these like cause I feminist sayings so you know there's like the liberator today it all seems kind of cheesy like\nBig deal women's empowerment branding but back then you just didn't have a lot of\nNike has run ads featuring pair Olympians runners who are overweight or in their eighties and in Nineteen Ninety four the company reached out to a man named Rick Munoz they wanted to put them in a commercial here's wreck\nI said to myself if they go through with this it's just going to be unlike anything that anyone has ever seen before just do it didn't really go into this territory and then you know using a person nobody knew who who is this guy he's the nobody but he's got a story that\nRick Munoz has always had good handwriting that's not like you want it to a future him in a commercial but it's a good place to start a story Rick grew up in LA without his dad with that any siblings without any grandparents without any aunts and uncles just him and his mom\nAnd you would think that there would be this super duper closeness between the two of us are and it was actually the opposite she didn't express affection she just worked all day came home cook dinner and we went our\nSeparate ways so when Rick teachers started telling him he had nice penmanship it mattered\nThe only people who could give me positive feedback were the teacher's\nRick focus more and more on his handwriting about a decade and a half later the same sort of thing happened when he started run the\nRead the Astros tonight in game one of the American league championship series that game starts right after eight o'clock in the forecast mostly clear tonight losing the lower forty\nTomorrow mostly sunny hides in the upper fifties Monday partly sunny where the chance of showers in the fifties\nWB wash supporters include gory in oriental rugs to the ... lower falls him nodded rugs tribal village pieces plus contemporary custom carpet gory and rugs dot com\nThe pike school pre K through grade nine in Andover mouth open house Sunday November fourth discover the power of positive energy at ... dot org and Fox hill village of westward\nFor over twenty five years helping knows in their sixties and seventies seek an active lifestyle at every stage of retirement ... village dot com [noise]\nI'm Karen given it's time for three stories you should now we're down to just four teams find for the world series and I know one of our guests this week is very excited about that Sports Illustrated Charlotte while they're welcome back\nThank you Karen I'm thrilled to be here Jason gay Wall Street journal I guess that means you're playing the role of the person who is not excited about this baseball season\nI'm a ... about everything current you know that\nI I Am super excited about the red Sox which made being in the press box when they claim strictly I got into ... I've got some bad luck by like couldn't watch for the end of the ninth inning because I was so nervous and I was freaked out and they want and I was like this is the mother in law yeah no one like that\nDid you on cork champagne or around\nIt was like cracker jacks wind up in the air and the ... um no but I think you know I was\nSuper invested in in the LDS as I think a lot of people were because you know Yankees Red Sox first time meeting in the postseason since two thousand four when I was also really invested but what was interesting to me about the series is that I went into it assuming that every fan would be jazz for the rivalry\nAnd yet when I went to Fenway in Yankee Stadium also I found that fans weren't as dedicated to hating the other team as I expected them to be\nDo you think that part of the issue I mean besides the fact that the dragon was slain for but also the red Sox and the Yankees these current teams are kind of like couple of jerks the red Sox Yankees they need more jerks for that rivalry to be really if\nThey know Jason that's exactly what people said at Fenway they were like we don't have the same characters you know there's there's not a lot not to like Aaron\nOver data I\nGo to the locker room and I get yelled at by Yankees PR are trying to talk to him and judges like sorry like he was very nice about it\nAll right thanks and what do you think\nI think the Houston Astros fares are sick\nGo road dogs they were so annoyed that they had to play all their games I Wonder where they play their games of eight in the morning ... when the Yankees are playing prime time the actors are just fed up with all of the east coast media bias\nSo speaking of east coast media bias we should acknowledge the media bias of this panel which is we are three Red Sox fans right\nI mean Jason doesn't care about anything\nTo do better and I said it like I had a lab you're you're wearing Red Sox Jersey so it's just going to get out you know I wanted to have roosters [laughter]\nI'm not even going to pretend Karen I'm I'm a Homer\nBut Jason what you just said about being said it is exactly my thoughts I keep hearing people say and this is crazy to me like oh the red Sox are playing a lot better than they have recently like they do and I'm like why are you talking about like we don't actually need another championship\nWe're never satisfy Erin Hatton the time I go you\nRealize care and that there are six year olds in New England who have only been one duck but Red Sox play a more if I was just it's ... and they have waited long enough of the children\nAll right so I Want to move us out of New England and talk about Sammy butler he had an exciting return to minute it's never whole practice on Wednesday\nButler's looking for a trade and to facilitate a trade he reportedly played brilliantly during practice well screaming things like you bleeping need me and other things I Can't see on the radio and then he sat down with ESPN's Rachel Nichols\nWhat is the right way to do it no I Can't control that when I'm Out there competing like that's my love of the game that's wrong me me and my finest numerous sure if that's what you're going to do inside of the line\nAnd this is a is it not the right way for it to come out and do you think it was the wrong thing to do well okay thing to do I think that\nI was on his okay let's try that again yes yes it was the wrong thing to do\nWhat I Know it's ridiculous to expect athletes to be role models they're not elementary school teachers after all their athletes but has frustrating as your situation might be if you were an athlete kids are going to do what you do so it's not okay maybe understandable but not OK\nCharlotte I Know you sometimes enjoy it when the NBA\nVentures into WWE or you saw what going to let them or you know we do a little concerned\nAbout ... about my reputation look I think that what athletes are very good at these days is owning a news cycle Jimmy Butler knew exactly what he was doing and the report about his practice came out and two hours later he was on the jump with Rachel\nI don't really care like I I don't know if I Would say it's okay or not I think that kids are going to act like idiots no matter what so I don't think that one athlete trying to get more airtime isn't necessarily going to be like a role model issue I Do think that if I were his teammates it'd be like\nMan but I I think that it's all pretty calculated\nCharlotte's so cynical you think the fact that ESPN was onto rules campus for this melt down with advanced warning was somehow a bit of choreography on team bottlers part gee\nI don't want to say I said that but I didn't and not [laughter]\nAnd also I have seen you walk into the ...\nUh [laughter] I don't know if you are one of the cats don't\nKnow this is where the NBA is now it's almost become less in common with a traditional sports league in more like the marvel comics universe where these players are kind of superhero like and they have enemies both on their own squads and on squads elsewhere\nI I'm just going to leave it at you know Charlotte made the point that the media is being used here and as a member of the media I'm just going to say hey I don't like the news really and like\n[laughter] okay we'll give me those are\nJust just just use me a bill whether\nOur gang you probably know that once more the Alabama Crimson Tide of the number one college football team in the country and you surely know Alabama head coach Nick Saban hair is once\nAgain so key unless it's really nice\nBut all is not well in Tuscaloosa because those ... good for nothing Alabama students are getting increasingly ambivalent about attending one sided football games once more Nick Saban is on a war against his own student body we're talking friendly fire\nFor their paltry attendance at Crimson Tide football games his poor Crimson Tide players look up in the stands in the middle of games and it looks like a Miami Marlins game up there [laughter] but here is a thought for Alabama\nPlay some exciting football games begin at reasonable times\nNick Saban actually got himself worked up about the student crowd at a football game that began at eleven am Charlotte on a Saturday does he realize that it's legal for a college student to wake up before noon on a weekend [laughter] also\nAlabama was playing in Louisiana Lafayette me no\nNo disrespect to Louisiana Lafayette but do you know what the score was at halftime what was the score it was seven hundred and Ninety five thousand\nDollars [laughter] okay\nForty nine to nothing it was forty eight to nothing about half\nPart of this is a little weird of a take I realized pardon me kind of Caesar he's coming from okay I Want to hear and I do because like here's this team that you have you've devoted your life to making this insane powerhouse and you are the best college football team that has maybe ever existed\nAnd then people stop going to your games I'd be like what I like are you kidding I get free [laughter] I mean I also did it for the millions of dollars and the prestige and the chance to you know do whatever I Want after this but I Do kind of\nUnderstand what you're you're a fancy pants traveling Sports Illustrated corresponded now you've been to these major college events you know that big time college boards of two thousand Eighteen the last thing that has anything to do with our students boosters of our vision and prime sponsor\nOkay here's a thought maybe they should pay the students to go to the game now\nCharlie while they're out of it that are going to have a tourism needs to die why\nWould get you out of bed before noon what I Want to figure out a number\nOn it doesn't take much for a college student in college if you paid me like twenty bucks to go to a football game and won eight\nDollars now I Believe this is an NC double a violation of an\nIron violation and paying the players right you could also give me just like a pair of sneakers and an escalator\nDefinitely [laughter]\nI mean to me this whole thing reeks of like kids get off my lawn right leg [laughter]\nHope to pass it on to my two sons\nTo be motion\nAnd it's okay to stand up for Johnny notice it's okay to stand up for him um he was a great quarterback and don't forget him and don't forget my dad's\nA\nAfter\nUpdating his

whoops more than Twenty years ago but nowadays most WNBA stars where men signature shoes what gift\nBut now it's time for the week's news with Charlie Pierce Hi Charlie hold your women you all want to talk about his shoe speaking of shoes Philadelphia Seventy Sixers synergy oil indeed has signed a five year geo with Under Armour it'll making the highest compensated player at his position and he told ESPN quote\nThere's a stereotype about big men that we can't sell shoes is that'd be kind of shoes look really weird and aside Seventeen\nYet I mean speaking as someone who want\nAnd a charity auction an autograph Shaquille O'Neal show out on which I Believe we're using his car for the problem with with that they looked fine on the big men right but when you put them on a shelf\nThey look like art object [laughter] but if anybody can do it it's Joelle envied who has charisma beyond belief um so I mean you've got to make a lot of money at this and he says he's not really a center anyway thanks for myself we regard I mean you might think of his own the Martian for all I'm concerned but you know this is the way the world is\nYeah I mean he said I'm not really a big man and of course he certainly big he's seven feet tall but he says he can do at all which I guess means he can shoot\n... lions called yourself as a split up his research is to just have a stroke [laughter] the college basketball\nCorruption trial has been underway for a while now Charlie but the big allegations are starting to drop anything here that shocked shocked you\nYes what shocked me all along which is the FBI spending my money to become you force been armor the NC double a\nThere is nothing you can do there isn't a bride big enough to make me care about this bribery trial it's re criminalizing an underground economy the whole thing is just silly the players are the ones who are going to get hurt most and the NC double a\nWhich was on the ropes and staggering has now found its way back to what it perceives to be the moral high ground and I couldn't be more disgusted\nSpeaking of the players are the ones that get hurt the New York times brought up an interesting question this week and that's who's the real victim here the prosecutors say the victim is the university's\nFans might say it's us but the New York times suggest that it's Bryan tags Boeing whose father agreed to take money from Adidas and as a result tags is now playing in Australia\nWell there's nothing wrong with lane and Australia has a really nice place but it's also not national television\nYou know I think Brian Bull and going to be fine I think he's going to do as a friendship in Australia and come back and get drafted pretty high but again the fact remains is this this whole notion that somehow the universities have been victimized by these guys taking money from shoe company guys as though the university's\nHaven't been accepting that as business as usual for Thirty years is one of the ways they've turned the bribery laws in this thing into a pretzel\nCharlie last week on the show we learned that the woman who is accusing event is dark Christiana Rinaldi of rape had compelling evidence in the form of a legal document in which we're now although admitted to non consensual sex\nNow we're in all this lawyer is saying that document was acquired in a computer hacking altered so now what\nWell this is one of the reasons why I didn't go to law school\nI think certainly burden of proof is on ... on his lawyers to prove the thing was hacked that sounds like a very expeditious ... otherwise let's let this thing get litigated but I don't envy the judge it All right because it's clearly a lot of money on the side of Mr ... who's capable of buying a lot of forensics you've written\nA lot in your other jobs about\nWhat is true and when people start calling into question legal documents I really get confused\nWhat can we ... well I mean you know given the nature of how much we rely on computers these days there's always going to be somebody who knows more about it than you do so I mean a lot of institutions have been undermined or quote unquote disrupted which is apparently the term of art for it I mean I guess you just have to trust your instincts and understand that the legal process will grind on\nEuropean soccer has long had a problem with racist fans and Chelsea has decided that just fanning offenders from the stadium isn't changing things\nInstead they're going to give offenders the opportunity to quote spend some time with our diversity officers understanding what you did wrong and it's time isn't going to be spent in that classroom\nRight oh they're going to take them to Auschwitz which I Will guarantee you most of these people will not connect with the black people their insulting it's a good idea you know maybe they should all get on an airplane and go to the new anti lynching memorial down in Alabama that Brian Stevenson explains put up I like inventive thinking on this sort of thing\nGoing on a road trip and go see what the end result of what you're doing it\nAnd finally Charlie I'm just going to let you explain what with mysterious about the guy wearing number Thirteen when Hawaii face Wyoming last Saturday Night\nHe wasn't in\nThe water but it'd be Wyoming by the way new games Seventeen to Thirteen but they're starting quarterback coal McDonald he had some sort of injury that they did not want to disclose somebody came out onto the field warmed up wearing his Jersey\n[laughter] you know throwing the throwing the potato to throw the guy on his third base you know one of these this is a real throwback to the the wild west days of sports and I love it I think it's probably something you can only use wants to do [laughter] right you\nCan find that's
