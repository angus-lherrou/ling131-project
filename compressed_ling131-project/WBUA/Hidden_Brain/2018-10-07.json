I'm from Detroit Michigan\nBrandi drew has a story that may sound familiar to you a story of poverty and that is the kind of story that may lead people to quit conclusions so pay attention to euro round is now in her late thirties a few years ago her life unraveled by the time\nShe around the dining services department at a senior living facility she'd been with a company that ran it for more than a decade one day she made a mistake\nHas just in a rush to get home that was our because daycare close as I say I get off at five\nIt was like maybe ten mile drive busy traffic area and and I knew I had to pick up diapers and easiest thing for me I thought would be to pick 'em up a fire pit the baby at\n... around new stopped at a store ran in and grab the diapers you swipe your credit card and had the subject how station and raced out onto\nIt turns out she used the wrong card not her own by the company\nCredit card and what's crazy is I didn't realize at that moment I didn't realize until my supervisor column in and said hey let's discourages had she not said anything I don't think I Would have\nRealized that Randy carried the card and kiss you needed to buy dining supplies of water and she never had a problem before never been reprimanded she thought an apology and an explanation would do and her response was well you\nKnow we have to determine nature van I'm like no I didn't know that like can I just pay you back it was only like twelve month [noise] and she said now in cases like that you automatically have to terminate them play\nAs this crime crime and like a day because I couldn't believe that I didn't want to go home and tell my kids what had happened\nAnd I didn't want to tell my has now and have them I just didn't know what to do at that point I found like a ... I found like a failure as a parent because I didn't provide a a good example even though\nA mistake brandy on more than her husband so the last of the job hit hard she felt like a loser she tried to bring in money doing odd jobs like cooking takeoff meals but the stress grew brandy and her husband began fighting jihad supported him when he\nShe'd expected he'd do the same for her but he felt his situation was different he'd been laid off brandy was fired he was mad that she'd made a stupid mistake\nThe final argument was that um I left the house that morning I was going to job interviews I had two interviews that day and I didn't parts is toilet paper son when he got home from work that day there was no toilet\nPaper when I came in with the kids who just immediate started yelling [noise] you can't keep yourself together you can't do this you can't do that so I walked right back out the door and I never looked back\nSomeone who is poor as often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems how do I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like a utility bill or gas money or credit card payment\nIs you're you're checking the prices and remembering the prices and figure out if you buy took charge will you have enough money for breakfast you are for getting things are paying less attention to your runs deal could homework to all of the other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity of tomorrow and we think it's something that poor people do people do here's another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJustice the poor focus on the money they do not have the lonely tend to focus on the\nFriends they do not have the result\nIs they try too hard to be locked in a conversation\nThe lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to what's actually being set the conversation\nFalter instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward are flat footed what happens as a result people avoid the aqua conversationalist and the only person becomes even lonely [noise] this lands offers a new way of thinking\nAbout white people who find themselves in scarcity seem to do things that\nTo an outsider look stupid when you're in a whole why would you take yourself even deeper center says we're asking the wrong question\nWhat if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty\nMakes everyone less capable than it's the it's it's you\nAnd I tomorrow will be to become poor or what all of us and have the same as like the poverty is in some sense changing arm lines\nHow do we know this isn't some leading theory to excuse irresponsible behavior and out in ... wanted to test that hypothesis\nOf all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugarcane farmers actually created a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich\nBut like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once the money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor in a month after harvest well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next central and now that are tested the farmers on their long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched other research that shows for example that farmers who are well off tend to read that feels more regularly and farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short I'm thinking\nTo be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually do or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely but they might be another former scarcity you have experience\nOn Sundays we get to leave that for pm some days we don't leave tell why am I [laughter] and then usually start the next day at five thirty or six in the morning it usually work eighty hours a week and\nWhen we come back we'll find out how being overworked and exhausted can produce its own form of scarcity [noise] I'm Shankar Vedantam [noise] and you're listening to hidden brain from NPR\nTo Boston's largest radio

that when something you desperately need is in short supply your brain tends to focus on that thing this focus can be so intense that impede your ability to think about anything else\nWhat happens when the thing you're missing is time when you're so busy it feels like you don't have time to brief\nLet me tell you the story of a young woman named Katie she asked us to use her middle name for reasons that will be clear in a moment\nFor as long as she can remember Katy has been driven really driven\nUm when I was in high school I was determined to be valedictorian so I took a sophomore level on our biology course as a freshman in high school and I studied around the clock I had no cards I walked through the hallways with a note cards that there was a holiday party I bought the new cards and I also studied till two or three in the morning\nShe says she wanted to be perfect at school she eventually got to medical school where she felt she graduated at the top of her class and quickly started her residency didn't use ... was grueling\nYou can get in at five thirty or six in the morning and you round on all your patience and then you you round with the team that means you go to all the patients and\nCheck in on their plan and adjusts medications et cetera is necessary and then there's usually a lunch conference where we have education and then in the afternoon we might take new patients and and keep following up on our patients\nAnd on some days that we get to leave at four pm some days we don't leave until one AM [laughter] and then you usually start the next day at five thirty or six in the morning and again [noise] um and you get one day off a week usually work eighty hours a week\nThat's Katie's workload grew she started to seal she couldn't afford to waste a single moment instead of spending anytime relaxing she started to focus only on things directly related to her success at work\nWhen I first started it it was just like really busy so I Try to come home and I felt like you know I just don't have a lot of hours so I Need to make the most of them and it was like okay I Need to make sure I'm exercising keeping my body healthy and they need to read and stay on top of things so I come home\nAfter pretty long day and I might go walking for half an hour and then I'd read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to try to get in more exercise than like I never know and I'll get enough exercise and so I started spending all my free daylight hours walking or running outside\nAre going to the gym for three hours a day plus like working Fifteen hours and trying to read and then go to sleep\nAs she focused intensely on to things she believed was key to her professional success [noise] Katie lost sight of things on the periphery [noise] she didn't know it but she was entering the tunnel of scarcity [noise] in her case it was ... he brought on by a lack of time\nThough I wasn't going to the grocery store and my house wasn't impact yet and it was stressing me how [laughter] it was just a mess [noise] and um [noise]\nI've my clothes piled up I had a lot of dirty clothes and coming home just so overwhelming I didn't want to be there and that's part of I think when I was walking so much just to get out of the house and get away from all the things that haven't done an ounce of forgot to pay a bill in the mix of all of the [noise]\nDid you forget to do what Mildred you forget [noise] um it was my energy\nAfter the break we're going to switch gears and move from scarcity and do excess\nWhich turns out that having too much\nWhen you're really wealthy it's not uncommon to have the experience that everyone is out to get a piece of you and so it breeds a kind of suspicion why you being nice to me or you just trying to give me give you something\nI'm Shankar based on them and you're listening to hidden brain this\nIs NPR [noise]\nThis is Ninety point nine W.

to be rich\nSays all of our friends they talk and a half and it I have to have a really sad and\nReally rich after six would on my farmer private jets your island the state of the Caribbean rich I mean it's one and then what would it cost ten dollars\nMost of us would never know what that's like [noise] but if you've ever seen at least a little curious about the lives of the river will face this next segment is for you\nBroke Harrington as a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager [noise] roof discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers none aloft about the private lives of their clients and they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\n\nWe'll look ahead and bring thank you for having me on the show\nDo their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance financial life but everything about their life give me some examples of the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager\nI Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins a series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me um maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that is the financial is that your wealth manager needs to know about\nThere can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets preferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSo it's really interesting because these professionals in some ways get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spots\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that the average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife some children but they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy\nHave the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm trying to be a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand financing the law but this kind of wrote also calls for a certain psychological makeup but what kind of pushing it becomes a wealth manager\nWill several to people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter] so you you have to have us\nEmpathy and the desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seem to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack him around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou write in your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to please their clients or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of her clients once called her from outside a restaurant in London\nTelling me that story so this is one of the first stories that I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was a while I was training to be a wealth manager Eleanor told the story over lunch of receiving a phone call\nFrom my clients who lives in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it and the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter]\nSo imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix a problem like this but Eleanor somehow did she she determined where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay\n... there are sometimes a client's do make request like this not because the are acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named\nDavid yes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the clients said that he was in Japan and he was\nMeeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed the desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand sides of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon and David said on on your wealth manager not your fish monger and the client said well today you're the fish longer and so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up that story I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese\nFellow who wanted to thousands I just smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will\nTo do what I wanted one I wanted and not ask any questions one thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they're not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have\nTroubles marriages and we were children just like you know everybody else\n... but wells you argue Ken compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids or parents will last wealth manager to break some bad news\nTo the next generation to to his or her own children sometimes the the wealth manager has to broker a truce between feuding family members say one family member feels that they've been done done by unfairly\nIn the inheritance plan and has to be somehow brought back in so that they don't sue the family\nThe big risk here is if you have a disgruntled family member who sues the lawsuit process and many countries makes public many many private documents that would reveal the extent in nature of the family's wealth all of which has had been carefully guarded secrets\nLike yesterday is going to just broke", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "07"}
