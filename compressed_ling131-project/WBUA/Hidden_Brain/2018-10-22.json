Mara Liasson and Scott Detrow hey everyone pay us much either the narrative has changed so many times it's election cycle are we just seeing a normal tightening\nIt was like early September just after the summer when everyone started to hip thing where people were starting to look at Arizona Tennessee in Texas all my goodness everyone wants to talk about the Texas senator yeah this is the right to go right well you know some of that has fallen back to political gravity and political reality\nYou know a lot of people will get to the cabinet confirmation battle and the fact that Republican enthusiasm spiked\nBut a lot of this is just natural tightening and in states like Tennessee and Texas there just happen to be more Republicans there\nWe started the cycle with Republicans very hopeful that they could pick up three four five seats because the Senate battleground is full of red states where Donald Trump is extremely popular\nAnd to me what's been the interesting thing about this cycle is the those dreams have gone away that yes there was that blip of democratic hopefulness and the fall that oh maybe they could pick up a couple and hold their own everywhere and maybe even the perennial pipe dream of Texas\nCame up again but now we're back to where we were and Republicans are doing worse I think in the Senate battleground than they should be given the map and given the great economy that they've got\nWe entered that final few weeks of an election that's kind of the dark side of the moon where there's not many from data points but suddenly you see wild shift in how a political observers view things\nThe Democrats might be fine after all the Democrats might be totally screwed I I think it's just hard to tell especially in a midterm where it seems legitimate that enthusiasm is higher than before we just don't know what that means in terms of who shows up to vote compared to typical midterm still\nWant us to talk about a few specific races that we're looking at maybe we could all just go around and talk about what particular race has been really interesting to us and why maybe it tells us something bigger are broader about the overall political culture at Mars you want to start\nWe dive into Wednesday to sneak they did not get a lot of attention and to do that we have NPR's Ron Elving here I'm going to be with us from around the story I Want you to help us understand is the departure of Don McGahn he left his job this week as White House counsel let me start by just explaining\nWhat his job wise and white matter is that he left\nThe bare bones of these years already out of his office\nIn the west wing where he oversaw dozens of other attorneys handling all the legal business for the White House Don McGahn is going back to the private practice of law he was previously a partner in the powerhouse national from Jones Day might be going back there might be going somewhere else he will be replaced\nBelow me who is well known in Republican legal circles but while Siblani is going through his background check for another couple of weeks\nThe acting white house counsel will be Emmett flood okay an Emmett flood has been in the White House working as a special counsel a particularly working on outside investigations and he's well known in Washington for his work for vice president Dick Cheney President George W. Bush and President Bill Clinton so he is a\nVeteran of impeachment proceedings\nShe like as in listening to describe all of this field Harry inside already to me right in terms of who's who and who they all worked for and and it sounds sort of like\nWe're hearing about one well connected guy taking over for the last well connected guy in up pretty high powered job that that maybe doesn't resonate for most folks and is that a fair assessment\nIt is a totally fair assessment it's but this is a moment when this kind of story ought to be hurting when we need to think about it and that was the name Horton card in this White House for nearly two years\nHe reportedly restraint President Trump a number of times when he was on the verge of a fire in various people including the attorney general Jeff Sessions and Robert Mueller the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election\nThat's a report that it's hard to confirm but this is clear McGahn orchestrated the selection process that led to two new Supreme Court justices that's Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh and scores of other new federal judges at the trial court of appeals court levels all over the country\nAnd a lot of conservatives consider that to be President Trump's highest accomplishment\nRunning it take you back to one thing you just mentioned earlier and name there Robert Mueller and McGahn sat down with the Mueller team as part of their investigation isn't that right\nYes indeed you did and that was apparently condoned within the White House as part of a strategy to cooperate and wrap up the mother investigation or in a year if at all possible uh it's been reported that McGahn met with members of Mueller's team several times for a total of thirty hours now does that mean he's been defending Trump nonstop campaign\nAll that time as a good loyal soldier and a veteran of twenty sixteen Trump campaign or does it mean something else and we should mention here that are Emmett flood she has been handling much of the mole or met her and is reportedly taking a somewhat more confrontational approach to that as opposed to that cooperative\nArrangement that they were trying to pursue a year ago\nI Do want to ask you about the job itself did Don McGahn represent the White House the the institution of the presidency what did he represent Donald Trump the man the president himself\nTradition says the White House counsel represents the White House the institution the presidency\nBut if he is not the president's personal attorney where does the person of the president stop in the office of the presidency begins\nAnd maybe that ambiguity which has really been with us for very long time they created this office way back in the Nineteen forties maybe that ambiguity be speaks the larger ambivalence that we've always felt about this grand office of the presidency of the United states\nVersus it's human inhabitants are we loyal to the institution and the tradition of the office or to the humans who have held the office where it is one in the other begin drawing that lines never been easy but it's never been more important\nAll right well thank you so much that is NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches up on some of the headlines that we may have missed because of all the other news it's\nBeen happening think Iraq [noise]\n\n\n\nThis is the politics show from NPR we're going to take a quick break and we'll be right back [noise]\nBoston's largest radio news rooms W.

H. Y. Y.\nJoe thanks for joining us great to be here you mean you can start with you can you know it's just a way of the land start with the basics of who is running\nWell the Republican incumbent in this race is Tom MacArthur some might remember him because of this contentious town hall in May of last year where his constituents really grilled him about his authoring a key amendment to the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare\nIn one support from House Republicans of course didn't become law and we'll talk a little bit more about that\nHe is running against Andy Kim he had a string of national security roles in the Obama administration including serving as an Iraq expert at the state department and the Iraq director on national security council\nAnd you've been there on the ground in the district so talk to us a little bit about what it's like\nBoth of the candidates have been really busy campaigning all across the district which is quite large we've also seen a lot of political star power in this district so\nFormer vice president Joe Biden has been stumping with Andy Kemp there's also been a lot of money flowing into the district Andy Kim took into point three million from donors in his bid to unseat MacArthur which is one million more than MacArthur has but because there is a wealthy former insurance executive so he can dump some of his own money into the race\nThat it was just a little bit more detail about who lives in his district I mean it's a pretty wide geographic district right when you look at it on the map it kinda goes from the western to the eastern edge of New Jersey\nRight there really is a yin and yang to this district so it starts in the suburbs of Philadelphia kind of wealthier more democratic suburbs and then it stretches all the way to the Jersey shore and the Atlantic ocean which gets more Republican there are a lot of vets and seniors who live out\nThat way so it's a swing district ... it went for Obama twice and then it switched and voted for Trump in twenty sixteen\nTo the Republican in the race MacArthur had a fairly easy time getting elected the past couple of times\nBut it looks like the race is much much tighter than that I mean given to go talk to us a little bit about why Democrats see this as potentially vulnerable seats\nBut when you saw MacArthur you\nKnow really go all in on that repeal effort and this amendment that he put forward in a contentious town hall that went viral that suddenly gave Democrats an opening to be able to think okay let's put someone in place here who could have a chance and in a wave year this is the kind of see that goes\nIn general is that what you're hearing a lot undergrad from voters is about health care\nYeah a lot of voters are talking about health care especially Democrats who are getting kind of jazz up behind Kim who's been attacking MacArthur on his support for the repeal of Obamacare\nRepeal health care has become a hot button political issue for candidates around the country that I think what we're seeing in the New Jersey third congressional district is it's kind of playing out in a really intense way in part because\nMacArthur authored this amendment to the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act that really would have changed the current health care structure Joe can you walk us through what this MacArthur amendment was\nSure so it would have allowed states some flexibility MacArthur says in in in how it uh interpreted the law would have allowed states to opt out of parts of the law\nAnd Kim and Democrats have hit MacArthur because they said that it would allow insurers to stop covering people with preexisting conditions MacArthur disagrees where it actually falls is that insurers would have to cover people with preexisting conditions but they wouldn't necessarily have to cover treatment for those preexisting conditions\nYou know stepping back and looking at what's happening across the country healthcare has amazingly become the top issue that Democrats are running on across the country was a huge flip\nFrom twenty ten when Republicans were really using healthcare against Democrats Democrats this time around are using it in their favor\nAs the Affordable CARE Act has grown more popular in fact half of all ads in September that were run we're about health care and most of those work ... and in New Jersey it's even more acute two thirds of all the ads that have been run in the month of September\nWere healthcare related that is really phenomenal and you're seeing Republicans all over the country now to talk about their support for maintaining preexisting conditions\nOr a line that we might not have heard say four years ago it's amazing to see Republicans on their back foot on the issue that got them in the house and the first place that ... thank you so much You're welcome and thank you to Joe Hernandez from NPR member station WHYY you gotta\n[noise]\n\n\nThis is the politics show for NPR and we'll

NPR's Nate Rott who covers the environment\nHey hey hey I just a couple of weeks ago the United nations released a fairly large comprehensive climate report that I Will say as a layperson a seemed pretty dire um what what are the experts saying at this point about climate change and specifically what did we get from that report\nThe longer the short of it was essentially that the world is not doing enough to cut carbon dioxide even with the commitments that you know countries are made with the Paris climate accord\nSo barring the invention of some non existent technology that can poll you know massive amounts of carbon dioxide or the atmosphere ... level warm and is going to reach a really dangerous level far sooner than people think possibly my last time assuming I Lived through LA traffic\nAnd certainly in the lifetime of our children which I think is kind of shocking for a lot of people\nYeah it seems sooner than I had certainly anticipated some of these threats becoming a reality which was really eye opening\nAnd I should say that since the twenty sixteen election I think there have also been a number of pretty large scale natural disasters California had its largest wildfire in state history and\nJust last week hurricane Michael was the strongest storm to hit the Florida Panhandle in recorded history so I'm curious how you say if you get a sense of\nWhether voters see the environment as an issue that is being discussed politically\nI don't think voters see it as a top issue it usually in polling it's something that voters do care about uh but it's not a top issue it's not like health care or those kind of like bread and butter issues not because it's not important but I think because just as you just talked about it seems like\nFor people it feels like it's far away it's something that can do that with later", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "22"}
