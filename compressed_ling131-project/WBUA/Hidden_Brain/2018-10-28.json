drama of current politics in the United states there is one truth that has endured through the force two years of Donald Trump's presidents and he just\nKept the support of the core group of voters who propelled them into the White House [noise] or not it was hard\nSomeone that's not a policy\nThe approval of disorders often white and often working class has meant the Republican Party as a whole has to be loyal to Trump view Republicans running for high office can expect to win\nWithout the Trump base as Trump himself once famously said\nI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters okay like in a crowded [noise]\nThis week on hidden brain we explore two competing perspectives on Trump's supporters and their motivations and one paints a sympathetic picture focusing on class divisions and economic pain\nIs the group that feels belittled and ignored and you know what some level they write\nThe other is more critical race as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society I think Republicans are using it to their advantage [noise]\nJoined William studies gender\nSlash and work in the United states just currently professor of law at the University of California Hastings College of law she's also the author wrote the book white working class overcoming ... in America Joan welcome to hit and bright\nDelighted to be here we've heard a lot about the white working class since the twenty sixteen election I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty years you need to find three different groups\nOne is the poor on within a meeting annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars\nThat's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income and then that topped the professional manager elite is the top twenty percent by household income um and I find that as top twenty percent in my household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle the middle ... fifty three percent with the median household income in the in the seventies that's the group that's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nYou have some startling statistics about wages in this middle group over the last half century uh what's happened to them economically uh starting let's in Nineteen Seventy\n[noise] since Nineteen Seventy the wages and economic prospects of this group have absolute the tanked I'm actually more recent\nStatistics have come out since the book and the most dramatic is that virtually all Americans born in the Nineteen forties did better than their parents virtually all\nJones says blue collar families feel resentment not only to the people above them on the social ladder but sometimes to those beneath her she told me a personal story about her sister in law who comes from a blue collar background she walked at a daycare that's of low income families and she found herself getting frustrated with some of the mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag for Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on\nPublic assistance and she can shop at Macy's and height I Can't even afford shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... she was very angry when the the she was in head start she was teaching in ... as a head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying white Americans white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor\nAnd they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as\nKeeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty years straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living\nDrug sex rock and roll um didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise] Mm\nJoan says working class people have come to a few but government benefits of government programs are not for them when her own working class father in law started to suffer from dementia Joan suggested to her mother in law actually apply for some help her reaction was striking\nMe and her reaction was oh I'm not even going to bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us it just cares about the poor [noise]\nUm and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they deliver it to help and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her slumps and you\nKnow it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people were designing the programs and of the political elites to make sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped the ball\nThis is a there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book is it the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan in their outlook and people who are not\nHow's it going to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or Shanghai but there are also people in the u._k. and in the U.S who are routed to the community in a way that's very different\nAnd in some ways they resent the people who are accustomed politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same ties with the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there's there it does map on to class but brags that end Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the who the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump\nBut the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP the twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third\nThe people who voted both for brags that and for Trump where those people who are left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people who have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nThey actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity in contrast to the professional managerial lead or more focused on individual achievement and self development\n[noise] when you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to the work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the extremes that your husband had with his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes it's a it's a form of social display but it's also a form of saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work is what you do to support your family um so it's complicated hard work is valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups but the hard work is a matter of of of persevering\nAnd staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life\nUm elites are completely defined by their jobs you know what am I I Am a lawyer I and a techie\nUm this total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of\nSort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole life fucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives [noise] ooh\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many residue people believe that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out on the book Joan this idea is a much more controversial idea among the white working class white\nGoing to college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course college debt is what could tripled I'm In recent years so it's very risky to start to go to college on many of them ultimately drop out there's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from\nNon elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as a very very risky\nIn addition that they they typically don't get in to the same colleges and social science studies show that\nOr if you give people an identical school record\nAnd one from an elite family and one from a ... a white working class family that white working class family has to kid has to actually be about three times as good as the delete family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jong says researchers sent out two sets of resumes to employers\nExcept for one difference one set off um blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music the other set off elite signals water polo classical music or Mr water polo sixteen times the number of call backs as Mr country music\nSo you may go through all of this process encourage all of this\nThat and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to use you may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway [noise]\nJoan Williams argues that these last differences rooted not just an economic hardship but in psychological shame and cultural humiliation play out in politics when we come back we'll explore different theories about why the white working\nClass tip the twenty sixteen presidential election
