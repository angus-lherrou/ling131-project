about them but what is it that is so fascinating about these moments in life at the University of Chicago psychologist Nick Epley thinks he might have one answer he's the author of the book mind wise\nTo understand how at the things about coincidences I Need to take a moment and explain his broader work to you first\n... book examines how we read the mental states and intentions of other people [noise] this is a remarkably useful skill let me sometimes miss apply it\nWe sometimes attribute intention analogy to things that aren't even living [noise] especially when they're out of the ordinary for example we don't personify a sunny day but we give hurricanes a name Katrina Sandy Andrew [noise]\nAfter Hurricane Katrina the mayor of New Orleans said God must be mad at America [noise] no this isn't new\nFor centuries people have described intentioned ... natural forces we think's charms droughts and earthquakes must have a mind of that around\nThis general tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or intent or [noise] or meaning is often quite a successful thing to do [noise] turns out we live with other people who do have intentions and goals and foresight and planning and meaning behind their\nActions and so by and large that tendency to make those kinds of attribution to other people there's a good way to learn about each other is a good way to explain why are the people did something in the past two British how they're likely to behave in the future but the problem with\nAny kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much and that's what happens in these cases where you're trying to explain the behavior of something that doesn't really have\nA sensible explanation for some random event some chance occurrence some physical an anomaly some weather pattern or that crops up that might not in fact have have a mind behind\nThis is why we're fascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways\nWhat we found was that when people were given a description of an object that made it sound unpredictable that you couldn't anticipate its actions\nThat's when people described it or reported that it had more mental states they were more willing to say that the object has a mind of its own that it has intentions for instance\nAnd I don't think this is totally counter intuitive that that is a mind if you if you see for instance of billiard ball sitting on a table another ball comes along and hits it and that ball rolls off in their predicted direction where you don't you don't need anything to explain that but if you've got a ball sitting on the table\nAnd suddenly starts rolling around randomly\nWell then you've got something to explain in these cases sometimes people look to the inside of an agent give it in mind maybe the ball is possessed maybe there's a demon controlling it a moving it around the table sometimes people attribute in mind or something when it's not there but they do that as an effort to explain\nWhat's going on in this uh autonomous and there's no tournaments agent and they're more likely to do that when an agent behave somewhat unpredictably\nI was over at a friend's house and uh my friend has a wonderful pool and um he had set the\nThis underwater Roomba for lack of a better term to clean the bottom of the pools that sort of rolls around the bottom of the pool\nAnd it goes into completely random fashion right so just runs a couple of hours of cleaning the bottom of the pool and I find myself fascinated just watching it because the fact that you can't predict what it's going to do next makes it just more interesting and more a lot even away then something that moves in a very predictable fashion\nAbsolutely something that moves robotically very predictably that is just the mindless machine but when you're rumors going around randomly well now it wants to go over there a little bit not wants to move over here and now it realizes that didn't clean that side of the pool over there are things that we have randomly\nCrazy you don't you don't think it's like your mother writer or your your your uh you know your spouse whose vacuuming or the living room but it starts to look at them did a little bit more mindful in fact the rumors are good example people actually do name that ... you can buy outfits to address it up\nOr if you Google this uh online you'll find all kinds of examples of\nPeople thinking of their room buzz having perhaps a little bit more of a mind than it really does\nI Want to talk to you that have been about the subject of coincidences and I thought of you and your work because it feels to me that when something unusual happens to us and we stopped and we say\nThat is weird I was just reading this word in a book a second ago and someone in the room around me mentions the very same word and and it makes you stop and look up just like I stop and look at that underwater Roomba\nAbsolutely that's a case where something unusual happens was unpredictable and you try to explain it you can explain\nThese kinds of random coincidences in lots of different ways there are lots of ... different kinds of causal structures we might be able to put on it um but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\n[noise] basis what underwater ... have to do with coincidences [noise] like a robot\nThat that's something unexpected coincidence this crowd for meaning or explanation because they are out of the ordinary we stopped to see patterns even when there aren't any\nMy favorite example of this in the world of psychology is actually phenomena first documented by my PHD advisor Tom Gilovich having\nA brilliant psychologist Amos traverse the illusion of the hot hand in vast [noise]\nBasketball players get on a roll people believe the basketball players get hot\nThere are times when they're on and the chance of making a vast retire after they just made one\nThen after they've just missed one\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same but stay or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo of your name\nSo we originally looked at whether people name Denis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry but we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great direct rays of medical professionals\nThere is a guy named able who was able to document that was a review on this paper and now every time you say this I'm going to jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer gravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples brick looked at a massive database of millions of Americans names from the recently released Nineteen forty cents is joy examine if they were brought patterns like\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working is Baker's butchers working as butchers miners workings minor masons workings Mason so we looked at every\nSurname there is a currently the top two thousand surname that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're laughing at them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forties census with something like a\nI think it's a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters\nBe carpenters is that the name carpenter probably originated from families who were in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both names and the choices quite\nPossibly but if you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations\nThere's a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did and a fifty percent chance that he did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality you're talking about a probability of less than one thousand already over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you know when a woman named carpenter ... county farmer for example that that's really it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude\n\nRent them is looked at large data sets in public records like the Social Security death index or state marriage records databases with information about millions of Americans\nAnd he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny effects like for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different months this isn't as common as you might think beyond what you might expect by me a chance\nAnd there's about seven percent bias in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that\nIf that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of them just as equal as him as a tiny invisible nudge it won't shape what everyone does all the time but it is\nIt's when you multiply these smaller effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples read says that if you really love your butt day the effect gets even larger or operational\nDefinition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number so if you got married on the thirteenth of the month you weren't quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen as his birthday number\nAgain Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names and our birthdays and have positive associations with that\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that and the the best bit of evidence I have that I've never bothered to publish this there's one part of people's names I don't like that much\nAnd that's their middle names you know the the joke about that is the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's a no when he was really in trouble and my additional come as no if he might be a serial killer Sunday right in the middle name is not nearly as love this the first or the last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for ambivalence sometimes we dislike it with another person has the same birthday if you were born on April twentieth you\nMight hate the fact Hitler was born on that day to read finds that if a consumer product happens to have your name on it but as poorly belt you are more likely to hate that product people just like seeing something inferior in the world that has that name on it\n\nAs Brennan I were talking I realized something a little uncomfortable I myself\nHad fallen prey to in the city is you know as you're talking right now I'm realizing something about myself for the very first time there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was Shankar out my name and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as ... and I I've always been drawn to the fact that\nI find the philosophy of event that it'd be very interesting and the fact that Shankar I taught that philosophy\nI thought was just charming but now as I'm listening to you said this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit eager to\nRead his work very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think in your jak decision at the same time it does make you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you ... do you ever think about yourself in a city you go to some is affecting we're getting a little\nPersonal here but uh I I I Can't resist being a little bit personal I Would say the probably the most dramatic examples that my son Matthew I'm his his last name as Poland his mother's last name was pulling my lessons Pelham and I\nEntered a relationship with her before I developed this did not after I developed the theory to validate the so Europe has them and you got into a relationship with a woman named pulled in Poland\nAnd we are very different in most other ways that's about as much as I said are you saying that the names played some kind of a role I I have to think it did I have to think and we were from different backgrounds different um\nDifferent religions I mean where we come from very different worlds and yet I was very attracted to her\nAt a worse yet she was attracted to me right yeah [laughter] I said\nI and I understand why you would sort of called this charming and I think if you do this work for a while there is a certain smile that comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you sort of see you you understand sort of the choices that human beings make but I Do think there's something disturbing about it because I think\nThere is a very strong sense that I think most of us have I have the sense even though I've been covering the world of the unconscious mind for the last ten years I have the sense of my choices that deliberate choices that I thought about that my ... and making them intentionally and the idea that you're coming in and telling me that they had these hidden factors\nThat come in and change how I think about myself it is a disturbing idea\nIt is a little bit disturbing and of course most people do what you and I did which has said well of course that applies to the rest of all but I in particular but never fall prey to re implicit racial bias or implicit he gets his him so most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings\nBut I've become in the past decade or so comfortable enough for the study that I have to admit that I really never know for sure\nExactly why did something I mean sometimes I have a pretty good idea\nBut I don't I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know what why and do what I Do I mean there's just too much research ... much of what you've documented in reporting on\nThat show that buys these were completely unaware of no just sometimes powerfully drive us in very particular direction so I think I've just kind of let go of it ... it was disturbing to me when I first began to study it the Serbian as well as delightful and now it's become more delightful unless disturbing [noise]\n\nSomehow you're wondering how does any of this matter [noise] who cares if people blowing\nOn the twenty third of July\nWho cares if someone named Betsy carpet to gravitate towards carpentry why does it matter if I prefer a philosopher whose name a similar to my own ... at least raise is tough\nQuestions about the degree to which we have free will so I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it and the sense that it suggests that very important decisions\nHave at least a little nudge ing influence\nUm based on things that you're completely unaware of so people are more likely than they should be by chance to marry another person who happens to share their birthday number that's not an objectively great reason to get married you should get married because you shared values you're both Republicans you're both rabid Marxist\nBut learning that these subtle little influences can affect what you do\nA apparently to some people's ... I find it delightful but some people might find it pretty threatening I don't think that it proves that there is no such things free well but it to me it does suggest that we don't always have free will sometimes we make a decision\nFor one reason that we hold ourself when really the more powerful underlying reason is something we could have never put our fingers on\nAnd this isn't just a matter of being drawn to someone who shares your birthday in general we tend to prefer things and people who have something to do with us and that can be a big problem\nAbsolutely I Do a little bit of research on social justice and that's one of the things that concerns me most is that we tend to focus on people who are more like us who speak our language who speaker idiom\nWho look like us who worship like us and we have much less attention to the problem with people who don't on the other hand I think this this finding like any funding in psychology and behavioral economics can be used for good or evil and it the way it works in the world can be used for good or bad and so a great example", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "14"}
