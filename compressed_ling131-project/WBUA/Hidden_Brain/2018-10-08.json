Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman can be as far as I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nHe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of had had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning when he was governor for re election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that you've heard she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had a change of heart in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane but\nHe's showing me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAnd ... can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote is in Florida\nYet still you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now\nAnd the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within the community have said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this community power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you know that has been there a number of times\nSo this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate I should point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo skittish and it was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically and the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians [noise]\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being this hardliner on immigration you know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill Nelson really just wants to have open\nBorders ... one of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but some were voters throughout the country that's really the case here in Florida as well because this was not the only statewide race and and we've seen that but other races are having an impact on the Senate race absolutely\nIn fact I had one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls\nOr you lead in last for ... for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said as the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and was yelling at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry nothing over the finish line\nOr an incentive Florida I think we can be pretty confident for probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most fifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country or a Dominican mountain are Oh thanks so much You're welcome an alcoholic thank you thank you this is the politics show from NPR we'll be right back oh\nWith Boston largest radio newsroom WB like gives you a range of coverage you can't find anywhere else from Boston to Beijing this is Ninety point nine W.

to the politics showman yarns gotten\nJohn from what's happening here has much more to do that even the board members of the bridge we're just\nWe're here with a special broadcast and through the mid term elections in so far this year there's been a lot of talk about it being the year of the woman but in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight a lot of Republicans and suddenly talking about a backlash to own the blood\nDrug jihad against this innocent man was good and decent man\nWe're finding out that the the viewer a white male it's okay to be white guys you're out your\nDoor and that's all I didn't get paid for them in the polls show male voters are suddenly\nEnergize because I think it could easily as well turn out to me the era of the man who feel like the target is on their back all the time and it's not fair\nAnd it may have a lot to do with calls from President Trump saying the real victim of the me too movement is innocent men\nA person who was never meant says and I just things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job mom I don't know what to do mom what do I do what do I do my mom\nIs this backlash real and what does it mean for the four hundred and thirty five house seats and thirty five Senate seats up for grabs in the next few weeks we've got White House correspondent camera key political correspondent Asma Khalid\nAnd political editor Domenico Montanaro here to sort this all out to everybody hey how's it going to ... we saw a shift in all of this over the last few weeks especially when it came to how President Trump talked about this you saw President Trump act very timid lead toward\nChristine Blasey Ford in part because the White House wasn't sure how this was going to play politically\nBut certainly she was a very credible witness well\nGuess what that changed in fact our NPR NewsHour Marist Poll that came out this week found a twelve point uptick enthusiasm\nAmong Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election was very important when we pulled them back in July it was sixty eight percent now that eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men yeah what stood out to me in in that poll was in what's called the generic\nBallot so who are you more what party are you more likely to vote for in the mid term yeah there was a six point jump among men\nNow they were more likely to vote for Republican than for a Democrat just in the past week yeah they're just going in the past week and that is absolutely everything to do with the Kavanaugh hearings yeah there's a certain amount of backlash that has taken place you know there's\nSo much focus so much of our focus and everyone's focus following the hearing was on how women reacted um especially women on the left and there were women coming forward telling their stories that were women volunteering for campaigns and that there was a big surge in campaign donations\nBut there was something else happening two men were angry\nTo and we just heard all of those uh clips of President Trump over the last few days\nYou just did a story on this this isn't a new thing from President Trump no not only is it not a new thing from President Trump it's not a new thing in American culture and politics so President Trump really ran on some of this grievance and and some of this\nFear among people are particularly among white Republican men\nThat the culture has shifted beneath them that you know that they're being left behind that they're being left behind so President Trump and his campaign talked about the forgotten man he talked a lot of political correctness run amok\nAnd I I was talking to Frank Luntz who's Republican pollster um and he was saying that President Trump tapped into something that\nThis is politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you might've missed and to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran\nTo be with you it's got some of the things we're going to talk about what is in big deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh so let's start\nWith this in the middle of all of this partisanship in toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that's right the Congress passed an\nBill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money to run that agency and all the functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum set on person's giving you a bigger seats in Congress has not giving you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress to do that also to band so phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was\nFor each cigarette you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated the Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott is a renewed effort to stop the shipping up synthetic opioids things like ... there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses\nA just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction offend no would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority\nThey're also going to lead them to support period for Medicaid patients Hoge bootie for treatment\nAnd they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs and also there's\nGoing to be more money more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller\nOkay shifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married\nThat's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that that can be so that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send to passengers and diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations or go to account for roughly half the couples at the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're at or a sexual couple right now you can't get a\nVisa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences you can get a heterosexual marriage in just about any country in the world but in fewer than ten percent of the United nations countries is that possible so is there a plan\nFor for people who live in a country without same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt\nThat's NPR's Ron Elving catching up on some of the news we missed this week as he does every single week here on the politics shell from NPR Nike Ron thank you [noise]\n\nAnd as I
