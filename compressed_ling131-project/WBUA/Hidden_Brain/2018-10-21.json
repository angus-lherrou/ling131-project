most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward explanation we use our upbringing in life experiences as the basis for a political beliefs we imagine\nThat

drives that shaped the music we listen to the food we eat the politicians we ...\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences from biology\n[noise]\nOn a regular basis right before an election someone was Sharon article with me about how science\nProves that the brains of liberals are stunted or post on Twitter let's say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\nThese claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences gave us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nJohn ... is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln he has spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives he is co author of the book predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences\nJohn welcome to HiddenBrain thank you Shankar pleasure to be with you\nWhen most of us think about how we came to our political views John we have a relatively straightforward explanation that has to do with our upbringing and background how does that theory go well\nWhenever asked my students where their political views come from the first thing I say as our parents\nAnd here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi\nWe are constantly reinvigorated by immigrants can interact country their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream like shoot down here in the first ...\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think you know immigration defense or police law and order and I think this is really at the core of of who we are and have a quarter of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us and it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police\nOr I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to [noise]\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know the ... they only makes sense that they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\nBall\nNow there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians be in the ... of political considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nJohn one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures and he found they reacted very differently\nPicture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house that are just been leveled by a hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe had people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a lot from journal activity or skin conduct on which is a common way of seeing if somebody is just having a reaction having a physiological arousal to that a stimulus\nAnd what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images cars or they have some emotional content but we tend to find that ...\nImages and conservatives are more reactive for the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who was conservative\nThat is true there's been a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different\nAnd the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we had the most luck with a pictures of mutilation uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people\nYou know without knowing anything about them all in all week would look at was the brain scan results and we could be incredibly\nAccurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the base about liberals brains when they looked at\nA mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the U.S to matter of sensory to\nPart of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I took him in the ... century with the active\nBut it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of some of these stepping on a rocky now goes right through there but you're just a matter of sensors to it'd be active and what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation matter of sensory too conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted uh just means that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you\nKnow\nThere's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins identical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has\nSimilar but not identical jeans if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins each twin Paris raised in the same household each pet it's the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as it grew\nAnd fraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology non environment is the driver I asked John what studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to data that a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda need\nNot long ago it's fairly dated data set\nA but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views\nAnd when we subject these data to the standard twin design approach we did indeed uh find that there the political views were quite heritable [noise] um although people oftentimes mystery this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views come from a genetics but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science that many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was less genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent that comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not zero\nBut apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that [noise]\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a loser link in the political orientation of identical twins then in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that\nThere is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences and\nExactly no that's well put an end again that's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say [noise]\nOne of the big implications of all of this war ... besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have with fresh inside\nA and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we are able to see the difference is between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talk to me about that idea Jon\nYes when other traits have been understood\nYou know something like handed us you know we used to think that uh if you were left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits my father was left handed and the teacher you know this is long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to to write with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left handed is very biological this is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people realized that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do\nA then people are much more tolerant of that so we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather were oriented to the world in a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this was the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat what you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when\nWe had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was often to the left of the more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a sorting of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years\n[noise] what I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nThis very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats and think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things [noise]\nUm [noise] Ralph Waldo Emerson has a great quote I'm Sorry I Can't give it to your verbatim but it's basically that ah the division between those people who are supporters of tradition and those people who are supportive of innovation is very old and a structure of the world since time began\n[noise]\nJohn hitting as a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln here spent years studying the psychological\nIn a sense the southerners those who are are going to favor secession\nThey're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interesting that you didn't oppose slavery per se wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand and that was a very controversial issue\nAnd many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in the science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery they put that\nHead of the democracy so now the conflict just the sense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of\nHow our differences can be a source of strength that they can also be in a credible\nSource of weakness and the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history and the answers been yeah and that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no\nAnd I'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually willing to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to at least concede the possibility that maybe there are others who have something of that the old ... it may be that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know\nAnd I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future\nI think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think that could be wrong there's a sense that if you believe in democracy so much there's only so far you're\nWilling to go and and so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family rights of family we have every family people fight the coral they disagree about all sorts of things but if there's loving the family the conflict only goes so far the love breaks down then actually the conflict can rip the family part\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah the twentieth century the bonds of democracy what tested again when we come back the political upheaval those are the Nineteen sixties and they're echoes today you know stay with us [noise]\n\nYou're listening to hidden brain I'm Shankar Vedantam this is NPR [noise]\n[noise]\nFrom Boston University this is Ninety point nine W.

lions and meeting her age we\nHad our last word on this ... himself\nOn Martin Luther king junior is leading the civil rights struggle there are deep partisan divisions in the country it's another moment of crisis when it seems like the nation is coming apart\nAmerica has given the negro people a bad check a check which has come back\nInsufficient phone [noise]\nKing finds that process isn't achieved by reaching quickly for consensus he finds in fact the progress comes from triggering conflict\nWhere are we trying to remember on the river down ... segregation you were there among the street to\nThe holes now we're shark or religion or ...\nYears historian David most I think what was so brilliant about king but also before\nHim if you look at the along the line from the early twenty century the N. double ACP was trying to think about how do we make change and what they thought was we're going to embrace democracy we're going to hug democracy tightly and we're going to reveal the hypocrisy [noise]\nStill believe about I insufficient funds in the grid bouts of opportunity is late so we've come to cash this check a check that we're getting about ... demand the riches of freedom and the ... just to [noise]\nWhat leaders of the civil rights movement figure it out is that ... actually can be a plus not just a minor so if you can bring it out if you can expose that if you can put it in front of people in show that the principals they hold dear are being violated that\nIn some cases at least forces people to choose sometimes they choose wrong unfortunately but sometimes they actually fight with principals so this is basically a what Martin Luther king was trying to do he he wanted to pick some of the most challenging places to protest Birmingham, Alabama Selma\nKnowing that there were um some some pretty tough people on the other side some pretty brutal of a police and sheriff's on the other side who are going to take that opportunity to beat up the protesters used dogs water cannons so so what he realized is\nThat if if you could make people in their living rooms the this violence and then bring it out and you know in the light of day then suddenly the piracy which unfortunately was that the heart of the country at that point we were talking about equal protection but we weren't living equal protection [noise]\n\nWithout television I don't think you could possibly have done it but with television he was able to go marketing peacefully protest peacefully and the reaction do came and it came from the other side and put on display disappointing\nAnd elsewhere so increase in the ... you know sitting all day and the legislative body can leave you with Adam\n... to what you mean once again is this link between conflict tied to the deep\nFaith in the democracy even how imperfect I mean in perfect is an understatement\n... new is not free [noise] one hundred years later who\nThe life of the negro is still sadly crippled by the amount of segregation\nAnd the name of it when you think about some of the other leaders of the time there were certainly people who were advocating some portion of what the south was saying and Eighteen sixty one there were people who are saying look this system is so broken it is so\nFixing it we actually have to break it down and I think the point that you're making is really well made which is that king wrapped himself into flak you wrap themselves in this ideal of the American democracy and that potentially is what made the conscious productive\nRight so look you know there were a lot of things he was concerned about but he said let's take these principles and actually try to see if we can all live by them\nMhm Mm mhm I think we need to remember American democracy is far from perfect but it is extraordinarily resilient and his generated\nTremendous progress economic progress social progress political a lot slower than we'd all like by boys things can go very badly and we all know that and so the question is can you continue to make progress [noise]\nSo which of these historical analogies describes the current moment in the United states are we on the brink of a new chapter in democracy or on the brink of divorce [noise] I asked David about a number of more recent developments that race troubling signals\nAbout the health of our democracy [noise]\nHas a rock Obama for such a very soon have people here in the articles for president give them back into the costumes and prices\nRational actually showed is that ... their team lost\n[noise] how these modern conflicts business as usual [noise]\nOr something changed I think both I mean it depends what you want the comparison to be I think that relative to much of the twentieth century we've been more parts
