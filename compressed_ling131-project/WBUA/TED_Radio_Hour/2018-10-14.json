[noise] it's a legal thing\nIn certain books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing [noise] the great age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things\nNow I can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James mouse and wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father died before his eyes they're legal things\n[noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the time and slavery\nBut person isn't and indeed who has the capacity for one or more legal rights you know one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men were actually Freeman were persons\nSlaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now all human beings\nDoes not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons like it has more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so it can you explain how\nThat works so a person and things are both in terms of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are\nSo for example in the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal writing [noise]\nEven live in these recent changes as a positive steps or broadening the definition of legal person all to include animals so that's a cause he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since she read the book animal liberation and Peter Singer ... ... ... [noise]\nNow my red Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and and indeed I was moved by it because I had become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defended defenseless and I'd never realized how voiceless and defenseless\nBillions of non human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and my Nineteen eighty five I realize that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals ... I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them has also become legal per se is now at that time\nThere was very little known about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective and that time was to essentially [noise] change the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and I'm In Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success them so much to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that's the\nOne critical legal movement is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals [noise] came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London\nAnd after he got there James decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized\nAs he wanted to get a set of God parents because in Eighteen century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London signed him bring him to a shift the anti marry that was set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is gone parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and the demand is that he issue a common law written hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd a British heaviest corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the dictators required to bring the detainee and they give a legal is fishing reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty\nWell lord man still had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSummers that was a legal thing he was not eligible for a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he issued the writ of habeas corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on July twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so odious that the common law would not\nAt that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate the free man who walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as the war was concerned they had nothing whatsoever and common\nLaw\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers that of course a non human version of James hammers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James how much time we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the non human animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far are chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds\nAnd hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can gather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear\nThat they are autonomous being that they are conscious\nThat they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on and we filed a hundred and sixty pages of affidavits and we say altogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to be inflamed is something that Ryan's against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise] so\nSo how did you identify the chimpanzees you wanted to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\nOnce we understood that we decided to simultaneously file suits on behalf of all five chimpanzees who we could identify who are being held captive in the state of\nNew York and where were they being held captive\nSupport for

about hacking the law and we're just hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I Would make it voluntary once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random sexual the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who were students just in that you do a second random selection of those interested in making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the country so making sure you had gender balanced you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime ...\nTo me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different ah but so much better from my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to fund the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this almost self selection but it wouldn't be people who wants a political power I mean there's also these are famous for its budget battles and people I'm not I'm Sorry I'm\nLike it's got to the galaxy guy or Douglas Adams ducked with us it's just I just got my dog goes out I'm saying are the people who want political power\nA specifically that people who should not let her political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self switch if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory\nBut I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage the vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hands up for two years is that kind of income I Would\nProbably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have\nRandomly selected in fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a comment in the world to instigate a ... like the chamber in one solution chamber once full tuition buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the soldiers shouldn't chamber and look\nAt the elected chamber full of politicians busily back stabbing each other and engaging the typical political out place and go well why do we need that for about a but this was a path to is the ideal\nSelection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute this in our parliament try this side of your friends I think we should populated out parliament with randomly selected people\nRely judging my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling box\nThe perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly don't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would be the perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least is obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really\nSpread on a global scale in your lifetime [noise]\nYeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to first get these students assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening now after the average citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost\nA million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe it'll spreads I could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state\nLegislature with a second buddy selected by association that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge ... battle is to try and convince people and then in French powers to um to try to\nYes ah yeah I'm not going to be easy a political changes every easy\nOr especially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to innovate on to try something new I think\nHalf system's broken\nAnd the noticed a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find his full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas that hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you wanted to\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is\nThe fact Mario he's a legal advocate\nThere's a ... year getting ... who has this book between facts and norms and he says [noise] democracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to build together\nWhat are we are one another we want to go together in law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules in institutions that shape our lives and I I Love this idea of law as the kind of\nThe thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand in real life on the other hand between facts in arms\nBut that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there's a huge gap often times the people who need those were the most have never even heard of them\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nOr both [noise]\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to get the power of the law to the people\nHere say Martin on the head stage\n[noise] I Want to say about someone I'm going to call them Ravi ... released from a community of hurts people included out on the west coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because multinational corporation constructed a menu\nThen [noise] Twenty years later the same company built the cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nIndia got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company had violated many of them\nDust from that factory covers rub his moustache and everything he wears Ravi says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water\nThey get sick\nRobbie has appealed to the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\nHe said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen Ravi none to decided to use the last means of protests he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gate to that factory with a bucket of patrolling his hats intending to set himself on fire\nRavi is not alone in his desperation the un estimates that
