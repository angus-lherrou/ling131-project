cities that make space for everyone and especially the most vulnerable [noise] were you um were you born in like a yeah I actually was in I spent\nMost of my life was like oh this is your home which is your homes as you we became human in the world you know this is accurate that is\nThe man ... she's a writer in Lagos, Nigeria but the kind of\nDifferent is generally about writing these issues human rights new I focus on the rights of the urban poor\nCan you describe what goes is like like what what would I see if I went there mhm so I guess it depends\nOn which legal she live and right and I think that maybe this was unanimous though where the where cities up once and\nLike you can be in the same physical space but because of your identity or your social location you experience a completely different things or for instance illegals that I experience is different from the legal that my daughter as many experiences\nSo you're driving down the fed mainland bridge and he lived here right are you left as the case may be and you can see some of the fishing gentlemen that have now been termed slums\nAlong the side of the bridge and you can see the land feeling that's being

the defenses along those lines\nAnd ... and ... get only the bend over the past me forty or fifty years in like a ... thanks in part to an explosion and population growth now the changing economy class\nHas become much more human than [noise] um class mobility is not as\nClear cut as possible as it used to be and my grandfather's generation it was it wasn't easy to send one or two children to school and have them access jobs and then have them than their siblings or their cousins to school and assuming he sort of lift the whole family\nOut of poverty in one or two generations right and that's no longer possible [noise]\nBullets humanity bay except this idea from the pet stage [noise]\n\nThere's so much that is possible in ... lost so much that isn't very often the difference between possibility and impossibility simply who you\nAre belonging and Lagos is a fluid concept determined by ethnic origin sexual orientation and gender but most visibly in Austin was violently cloud\nBefore when I became a country Fisher people from the inland creek such as it comes down to legalize let alone and their status villages along the coast about six years later that my grandfather who does not equally quickly also arrived in Lagos\nOvertime he built in Las just carry out the lands of via mapping out now bustling neighborhood's when they were just waist high wild grass\nShe died when I was nine and by that time of my family like the families of those fish if people knew labor so\nAmong the euro by we have a saying equal Willie ... which can be translated to mean that late last welcome anyone\nBut that seeing is becoming less and less true\nMany like oceans including the descendants of those ... people who arrived generations before my grandfather and not being pushed out to make room for an emergent city that has been described as the new to buy\nIf you leave all since ... big dreams even and its leaders and successive governments have cared aspirations towards and make us in the republic teachers not exist\nUnfortunately instead of focusing on the eradication of poverty as you would expect the strategy of choice focuses on imaging the floor last up to buy the governor announced plans to demolish every single waterfall sentiment in Lagos\nThere more than forty of these indigenous communities all over the city over three hundred\nThousand people living in them or to buy me\nA hundred year old fishing village where the population about three quarters of Monaco and similar potential\nFor beach front luxury [laughter] was one of the first to be targeted [noise]\nIt it's almost like and this and this happens all around the world it's it's almost like um cities wants to hide people who are poor people who live in ... in places that that are characterized Islam's like they want to hide those places from the gaze of the world mhm\nYes to attract foreign investment you know you have to look like where the foreign investment is coming from so you read\nAnything that doesn't look like that even though nothing looks like that I mean by definition the whole of legal to the slum right let's be honest if we take\nThe technical definition of lack of\nSanitation services lack of infrastructure\nThe whole city is a slum\nBut I'm more and more you hear agencies of government officials talked about ultra modern projects on what they really mean is stuff that's like steel and concrete than glass and mirrors and you look like the New York's skyline type if that's it so you can use is sort of rhetoric to\nPush out poor populations or at least that's what the hope will happen\nBut the truth is like in the end\nFor people to just disappear\nRight so if you push them further and further away from wherever it is that you want to make into a shiny suburb or you know look how [noise] where do you think they're going to go [noise]\nThe conditions that cause us to define as such in neighborhoods are slumps can be effective you improved but not without recognizing humanity and the agency of the people living in them\nAnd Lagos swept public goods are rarely publicly available slum dwellers often at the forefront of innovating solutions\nAfter being disconnected from the grid for months because the power company couldn't figure out how to collective oneself movements designed a system that collects device German sentences and goes everyone cheaper rates into the bargain\nOne program that hires look bad boys that security you know every chick and every high does she know troublemakers are more likely to get caught him and fortunately for these and few of us end up and gave him a criminal activity\nSums are an imperfect housing was the news but they also prime examples of the innovation adaptability and resilience after Sunday's Sean\nAnd hot of every functional city\nWe have our own identity our own risen\nAnd as anyone in Las Vegas and tell you for Lakers are very often\nThe source of the city's character without spoiling us would not\nBe known for its music guards and less energy or even the fact that you can buy\nAn ice ... or a puppy through your car window [noise]\n\nShe spent a time in some of these neighborhoods that that I guess are divided slums and what what's your experience for what were they like for you I mean I remember the first time I went into\nOne son that's literally built on like an island of garbage\nThat's sort of it's packed really tightened the and then\nIt's layered sodas and then there was sort of some sort of carpeting or sound or something\nBut then if you go into the police and you see the people\nWho live here and they have\nAll kinds of ... they're making marginal profits on a daily basis but enough to pay their rent to send their kids to school to scale up their businesses where that's possible and to save and you realize from interacting with the people in particular that is not that much\nThat is so significantly different about them\nAnd there are people who have economic wherewithal to live elsewhere who just don't want to because they're the quality of life that comes from living in such close proximity to your friends and your family\nAnd your colleagues in your church members or your the people you go to more squeeze didn't sense of community that is so rich that is almost impossible to

helping NPR advance journalistic excellence in the digital age\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raz\nAnd on the show today ideas about cities and how we can build more humane ones and just before the break we were hearing from architect the ... in Michigan says designed could be part of the solution but it largely depends on how we use technology\nTechnology was a big part of the problem in the twentieth century ... when we invented the automobile what happened is the world all bent towards the invention and we recreated our landscape around in the twenty first century\nTechnology can be part of the solution is it bends to the needs\nOf the world and so what do I mean by that takes the economist vehicle I don't think the economist vehicle is exciting because it's a driverless car I think what's exciting about the autonomous vehicle is the promise that we just have these small urban vehicles that could safely coal mingle with pedestrians and bicycle\nThat would enable us to design Jew main streets again streets without curves maybe streets like wouldn't walkways on fire island [noise]\nOr maybe we can design streets where's the cobblestone of the twenty first century something that captures kinetic energy melts know helps you with your fitness when you walk\nOr remember those big ladder fire trucks what if we can replace them at all the asphalt that comes with them with drones and robots to rescue people from burning buildings and if you think that's outlandish you'd be amazed you know how much of that technology is already being used today in rescue activity\nBut now it like you to really imagine with me [noise] imagine if we could design the Hubbard craft wheelchair [noise] write an invention\nThat would not only allow equal access but would enable us to build\nThe Italian hill town of\nThe twenty first century [noise] I think you'd be amazed to know that it's just a few of these inventions responsive to human need\nWould completely transformed the way we could build our city [noise]\n\nMean this thing is right let's say we do\nIs like with the help of technology or or whatever I mean there will still be\nSome level of inhumanity in them right in right not is it possible to have no social discord at all\nYou know part of why I gave the talk I gave a tad was being cognizant of the fact that there are a lot of technology in the room a technologist can be wonderful people but they can also be a bit a historical and what I was hoping to convey to a room full of technologists is we need them to invent stuff\nThat helps us build more humane cities right firefighting drones and the and the you know different kind of a wheelchair and so forth so we can look at all those foods and standards that we have to build with\nAnd change them so we can maybe have a kind of back to the future moment and think about what was great about cities before the twentieth century they could maybe inhabit our cities and the twenty first and twenty second century because technology is allowed us to change those standards [noise]\nUm but that's not the goal the goal is the standards are changing so we can design this infrastructure so we creates more social friction cities\nAt their best our engines social friction so if you look at the Arab Spring and you saw what was happening in ... where we saw what it was happening in Tunisia it's the cities tend to be the platform for social change in nations\nAnd social friction requires a kind of lay in my book I call it an infrastructure of opportunity\nThis idea that you're building public spaces subway systems\nThe farmers' market places where people who are from different walks of life\nAnd meet eyeball to eyeball the social friction is fundamentally what advances civilization and I think that's really the heart of\nThe architect John ... is a professor at Columbia in his latest book is called a country of\nCities a manifesto for urban America you can see his little talk at ... dot com\nOn the show today buildings you named cities ideas about many of the challenges that cities now face\nWhen your mayor for eight years you get a chance to meet people from all over\nIs Richard Barrington he was the mayor of Albuquerque New Mexico from two thousand nine to two thousand Seventeen\nAnd you'll meet people at the grocery store you'll meet people on the street you start having conversations you'll do deep dives and your community and you you start becoming keenly aware that as much as you think you understand you just haven't\nWalked a mile new shoes during which time as mayor Albuquerque sun light in its homeless population and lots more people panhandling and the streets\nRichard wanted to come up with a more humane approach for how to deal with it\nSo I saw a gentleman on a dry fifteenth twenty Fifteen I Believe was the day I was on my way back to city hall from lunch meeting and he was holding a sign that says he wants a job\nAnd listen I'm a student and I'm not a genius but I went back to my staff\nAnd I said listen I saw gentleman holding a sign that said he wants a job why don't we do something different [noise] why don't we make government less complicated rather than more complicated why don't we take this man in his word\nAnd I grew up in ... in Nebraska around a rural environment I knew there was dignity and work I saw people today my grandparents and my parents work hard and there's just something about having a reason to get up in the morning and accomplish something that's been engrained in me since I was a child\nAnd so we just wanted to take that and present an opportunity\nTo worry about what happened in my city when we decided to think differently about panhandling and lift people up through the dignity of work\nYou're more from Richard bury on the stage\nBecause there is a better one because\nI Believe is a better way to get the money you need them panhandling on the corner I Believe there is a better way to help your brothers and sisters and need then handing a few\nOut the car window we know there's dignity and work we also know that people are much more likely to invest in themselves if they believe that their community is willing to invest in them first\nAnd because we're all wired to be kind and compassionate always feels good to have a couple of dollars to someone that is a need\nBut if you talk to panhandlers many of them will tell you that your few dollars don't necessarily go towards feeding the body that go towards feeding ...\nIs the Albuquerque the beautiful place where a mile high Sandia Mountains on the east the real granted runs the center of our city where there's always something to do always a waste of whole litter to pick up\nSo if you're going to have an initiative like this in your city have to ask us all to questions first one is is there anything left to do in your city then if the answer is no would you please give me your mayors phone number because I Need some advice\nIs this are yours listens to panhandling working if you're taking ... approach ... near solutions aren't working and I know you're not getting\nTo the root of the problem in your city so they have something to do you need people that have nothing to do the good news is is not that complicated [noise]\nSilk so would you do we took an old van from our motor pool a old dodge van but some tires on it I mean sure the brakes worked and uh then we reached out to St\nMartin's hope works in Albuquerque and we asked for their health or a nonprofit that works with the homeless and they do a lot of great things from feeding programs to housing programs to employment programs we took a fifty thousand dollars we created a pilot program and we hired them\nTo be the facilitators to do the paperwork to pay the individuals that worked for the day to do all of\nThe functional things that needed to be done to run the program\nBut more importantly we had this notion that if you lift somebody up for the day they are naturally going to feel better about themselves about their circumstances somebody believed in them today and they may have an opportunity and may be inclined to try to reach out for some of the services that maybe they hadn't reached out for before so we wanted to make those available here\nAnd the seven thousand jobs that have been created day jobs or through the better way program we've been able to impact a almost a sixteen or Seventeen hundred people in those three hundred and sixty five of them have actually reached out for mental health services substance abuse services the things that they need to do to make improvements in their lives and so", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year": "2018",
