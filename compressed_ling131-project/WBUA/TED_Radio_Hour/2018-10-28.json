things a little easier to deal with\nI don't like doing radio ever unless I'm totally in control really because I have a face for TV not right now that is true this is Mason diet she's a stand up comedian and I'm Florian ever around things on drunk [laughter]\nNow the reason why may soon as a little self conscious about doing radio is become a disability she has which in her stand up routine she tackles head on here she is on the stage\nName as many tunes diet and I am not drunk but they don't deliver me what he called my\nThinks different time\nIn six different direction suffocating for

know little disabled [noise]\nAlso I got to tell you I got Ninety nine problems on hold Li it's just one as if\nThere was on oppression Olympics I Would win the gold medal I'm Palestinian Muslim I'm female I'm disabled and I live in New Jersey\n[noise]\nI remember when I was in San Francisco I remember watching your talk in the audience and oh you saw it live young the so called so when you came out and you started to talk the audience was like kind of uncomfortable right because you\nYou were talking about how you shake like ... and and but within just a few seconds you were able to disarm the entire\nYou know massive room full of people by just kind of putting people at ease which is that something you do consciously or or are you aware that initially I\nDo naturally because men stand up comedian for Fifteen Years and when I started doing stand up comedy I was ... New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time\nAnd I didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is that I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I Move on and a strong funny relate of all the way people are able to move on\nWith me [noise] yeah because I think for for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think\nSo because I mean this has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television that this has made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability\nWho's proud yeah I'm ashamed and talking about it in a way that they've never heard before but we have been mobbed because like\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe in can't my father's months were what you can do it yet you can can [noise]\nIf my three older sisters were mop it I was not been in my three older sisters went to public school my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aids we all got my mother slipper [noise]\n\nMy father taught me and I walk when I was five years old my placing my heels on his feet and just walking another tactic that he used this he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me [laughter]\n[laughter] my inner river was very strong and\n[laughter]\nBy the first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion who had been punched one too many times [noise]\n[noise]\nSo so when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like up until the age of five you\nYou weren't able to walk right I was able to walk out fine but I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school and um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk\nAnd I think what's so amazing about this is the fact that he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try [noise]\n[noise] what did you realize that you were funny [laughter] so my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning\nRealize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach and she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg\nAnd when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she used comedy I was like wait a minute\nWhen I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard prior you know Alan Rosie O'Donnell those were the people who were not typically beautiful possibly had disability you know how different races like Margaret Cho\nWas how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV and so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm his daring [laughter]\nYou know it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right or the challenges through humor right\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and justify telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started\nPost nine eleven in New York City my friend and I found that the New York are American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just wanted to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat beyond and people are like\nTalking about guys are talking about several probably you know I'm like but I really just want to talk about beyond say that [laughter] so it gets exhausting\nHaving to constantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life it's important now that I Do battle because having grown up with you know one fight in Jersey and one foot in the middle east\nI'm really worried about where we are right now in this country and when I did that Ted Talk I didn't know how important\nIt was to say a Muslim in front of every one I really thought it was the disability that was going to be the thing that I was championing [noise]\nGrowing up there were only six Aaron in my town and they were all my family now there are twenty hours in town and they are still my family [noise] I don't think I wouldn't even notice three weren't Italian

Catherine the MacArthur Foundation a Mac found dot org\nIt's a tad radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj and on the show too\nPainfully funny ideas about humor and how it helps us deal with the chaos of life so we're just hearing from comedian and again for ... and she and a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they're trying to\nOpen up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required\nLittle patient [laughter]\nYeah I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIn that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint and shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away [noise]\nSo that trip and again took with the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming in too long after it came out something happened back in New York at least one again usually felt welcomed and accepted\nAnd group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the NCAA that's the New York city subway system now actually offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use about our thoughts but\nOh why not watch your own poster campaign right that does not things about my lungs so myself comedians you know be dollar decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign\nWe raised money work with the NCAA for over five months that was approved in into we're supposed to do up\nUh the NCAA decided to oppose reciting political content let's look at a couple of those posters here one I'm a Muslim Muslims [noise]\nOnce they get on the Muslims they have great for the recipe for us\nAsk what a mere mention of Muslims in a positive light was considered political but it is it it's about justice so we had to change our fighting bigotry with delightful to try to do the biting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nBasically what I'm saying is a couple of dirt back comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one [noise]\nWas a very weird feeling I was like a blonde girls feel like oh let's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail\nSometimes I get voice mail saying that if they continue telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny\nBut just changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapon [noise]\n\nWill you talk a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment in the film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was pretty successful\nYeah so I mean you know one of our stops in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called made that religion we're going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was all the New Testament or the Koran\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous price is like an outdated calendar salivating already and the rules are salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that were totally book stimulates the girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death of a throng of her on\nIt in the old man\nPeople guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was the violin um came from the cry\nMary said my lord how can I have a son when no man has touched me\nDo we just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half greedy stopping them so why would we hold Islam to his ... standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God it's\nNot a whole lot of different three of them do you know [noise] some credible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely ... and that's one of the things that like I performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nAmerican people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they want to open the door for you and they want to\nBe good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found than I've said this before and it's so dorky but it's true is that if you approach people with love you're going to get loving return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found the way I like to look at it as you\nYou got one person to live in a couple of you will laugh and then over a lifetime you might get like a million people chuckling and those chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular um shifting perception\nAnd that is social change but it takes time and it takes like millions of these chocolate

funny ideas about how humor can telescope with things that on their face aren't very funny\nThis is this is Kevin real as you just said the writer and they stand up comedian versus measures that are too [noise]\n[noise] she's ... she's referring though\nWas marketed as [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is what Kevin does for a living\nBut being funny is also a way you deal with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation or a shield but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life\nAnd that's what I did as a as a young person I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that\nIdeas and thoughts and stories that might otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nLike at least in the beginning\nIt was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and she felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean that's like kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuate it in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in waves\nAnd you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark hopeless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly than the way I didn't want people to see that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight of shame and embarrassment and killed\nKevin real tells his
