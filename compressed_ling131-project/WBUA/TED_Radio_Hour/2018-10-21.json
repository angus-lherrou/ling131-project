I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown now I Am most just in Iowa and again you can't believe drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and\nProcessed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nHas all of them can be bought and any store not that they were any good but they were there\nMost bombs cooked like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or\nThe stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading and go to restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden\nSo now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave lights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself lights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you\n\nGet ... and like what you're saying there are a lot of that has to do with with the fact that like ... food all over the world right [noise] you know I think part of the problem\nIs you know this didn't go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes if you want to mango you're gonna be able to get a mango\nIf you want it to ... you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables and winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need to everything that you you were a guy that a lot of people that look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of mock Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of heat well\nI Do think you know I did this book called the basics begin before six or a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have\nLabels and you know or the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because I had her broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n[noise]\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now there is no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health votes have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not orange craving whoppers ... we have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone and that's the hard part\nBut by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food [noise]\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only\nWe can make food more important not\nLess and save ourselves by doing so we have to choose that path factor [noise]\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at ten dot com [noise] um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I'd say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next [laughter] who knows how long is a great recipe that you put out years ago was that\nPasta and spaghetti sardines bread crumbs\nRight about that yeah great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta why the hell I we can get sweet potato pie which is why we shouldn't Haley of come from a housing pastas gonna kill ya\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay so am I getting that saying that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate Seventy four percent ... Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] is it [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert ... he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco so\nThere are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know I'm not sure which one did you know I mean ... that's even someone famous now\nApple puree or evaporated canes you yeah my favorite because cages so you know just healthy guy yeah what happens when you evaporate changes you get sugar\n... studies sugar how it's managed to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they processed food diet because it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive [noise]\nAnd like any addictive substance ... says sugar can be toxic especially because so many of us eat too much of it has Robert Lustig on the head stage\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from life luck life luck with Norton works to help protect identities and the information on devices from cyber criminals learned more life lock dot com [noise]\nFrom twenty for you and me a personal genetic service working to help people understand their DNA learn more at twenty three and me dot com slash NPR radio\nAnd from the doors do charitable foundation whos clinical scientists development towards support promising early career physician scientists and their research efforts to improve human health\nIt's the Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raz and I'm sure it's a date food why we eat what we eat and why our food is sometimes so much more than what we put on our plates\nWe all think we taste food and ... and yet that's an illusion in the sense that uh most of what you're tasting the fruit to the floor Olympics you the Hubble the smoky are actually being dictated by nostrils when I've raised in his wonderful job of ... and\nThe information I get from my nose and makes me believe they're coming from I ...\nThis is Charles Spence a head of the crust middle research ... Oxford University [noise] what is the cross model research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... here in the psychology department where we look at how the census interacts\nN gas our mouth and nose interact when we eat but said or mouse and our years\nWe didn't experiments where we're feeding people a potato chips and each time they put it into a potato chip we would change the sound that they could sometimes making their own crunching ... [noise] sometimes quiet sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise]\nRebel showed up as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas the country has the freshness of these other groups that Carl says how our food sounds even looks\nCan change how it tastes\nOne might ... white wine out to be she read within ... tasteless food dye\nAnd they've done appropriately you'll find the experts the wind make says we'll get fooled into scouting leaving tasting what they think because of red wine ... all the ... of tobacco and the dark chocolates in the state and fruits and so I don't even know what they're actually tasting um it used to watch\nAll of this Charles says\nFeeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles Spence on the stage\nHere this morning there I'll tell you about the perfect meal will convince we can taste the food we can enjoy the flavors on the road was of the wind in the glass\nReflects what what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we even drink out of the question is how to study how the measure is I'm a tendency among scientists that been your against strong as if the people like your eye and a brain scanner\nOh so the brain light up this is going to your brain on flavor or New York a strong army\nRunning is one problem here which is that in fact if your mattress off one of these brain scan is kind of lie on your back where they had climbed stale with a true when you're married that periodically square in a some drink you can't let it before you had all kinds of jokes and spoil the brain scan alignment\nBut it's kind of tells you something to do something useful but it doesn't play by the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal is one of those depressions [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal [laughter]\nI'm actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be of some very very simple it can be ... by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere these up and we'll stick in people's minds as as best meals but\n... what I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because the social aspects of dining um I mean no one has ever had that perfect meal when the fighting with a partner say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seem to stick with doesn't resonate in the end you can have quite capture when you get ... as your mood you pretty relaxed your holiday stress to play with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met a friend who's just come back from a a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red line that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we've all learned versions which I'm going to problem solve rose a paradox so used to describe a northern Europeans um but to ... go for that so holidays to the Mediterranean\nNess sitting somewhere or on the side of the sea sipping not Rosie wind blew looking into that love his eyes\nSome ... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all out and not tasteless like the past when you've ever had so great that you want to buy a boat or a case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you have in that you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed [noise] your friends are like this is really cheap birthday\nYeah and you say well how is it something about when the bottles when they're playing with a cold and that you know sport the wind things ... ... we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments in certain states of\nMind and all mental state and the environment both together that kind of impact what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile anyway some miss attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation and puts a lot of pleasure into what we think about the food [noise]\nIn fact since Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of labor and has been in these methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nIf you're in a good mood food tastes good isn't a bad mood they never tasted good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wine glass but I'll bring the everything else the thousands of seeing all the smell of assaulting the ah the walls of the San ... all of that is play against their parents\nOn top chef capturing that inside a in the dishes or any of that too much than star restaurant in in Switzerland what are you going to mention star restaurant\nA white type across the room table was no glasses and I play like nothing there's just a plastic car people wait and see what he calls me here seven o'clock hour here on everyone's here in the restaurant and I can say well we'll tables the falls nothing will happen until somebody picks up seriously that plastic how\nI Wonder if they get up there for\nThe little one you arrive tower and it makes it moving sounded as soon as some of the title of it that would be laughing\nAnd then you can guaranteed within a minute you have the whole restaurant full of moving fires laughing Dina's and that is the moment when the first is comes out because then he has successfully nothing more than one euro table in Homs the mood and he knows that will improve evil that type of uh two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise]\nWow so aside from from a neurological perspective [noise] do we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case\n[laughter] uh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all kind of classic example of just how important the environment is\nWhat we taste I work with ... just a few stuff here in London\nAnd he's been I'm sending our question has several weeks after ... his restaurant\nLet's say what'd you remember yeah and he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that can constructing something they remember the experience they felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they reaching\nOur most shots that you talk to are they on board with with your ideas did did they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say that was just totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nUh because there are still some chefs who say no no\nIt is just the sourcing the preparation\nBut nothing else that was the case so I'm your restaurant um do you serve the food in their plastic cutlery nah that's a silver isn't it\nAnd what is your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking at it and they ... so the the St Louis things in the one hand but clearly you can never sort of ... food just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment\nAnd there's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be able to say certainly the ... I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now putting up stuff out there and Venus\nWho who are already thing for the first time in history saying we don't need to just now about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind but those that were setting [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book is called the perfect meal you\nCan see his entire talked had had that NPR I don't work\nSo let's get shifted a little bit more creative about what's on our plate because that's\nWhat my ... my name is Marshall bicker and you are in a log in Indian where's lagging in getting\n... ... it's very difficult for you to pronounce your back into that you were out in the center of the Netherlands\nAnd in the center of the Netherlands about once a week my cell and his wife have what some might consider an unusual ingredient with dinner\nAnd it's ah something that we were friends is over or a rice dish or I'm", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "21"}
