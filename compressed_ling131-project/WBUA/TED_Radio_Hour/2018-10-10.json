who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine\nCould make it cheap and easy to create humans you are\nYou're basically talking like super heroes right perfect vision superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right\nThose are the you know that I think that's the science fiction association of what\nCRISPR could allow [noise] we have\nLong lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leader muscles\nOr lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that\nCould in theory you allow an individual to upgrade their gee you know\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to painter or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably there's a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associate\nA gene variant they have essentially masks their cells and the HIV virus can't get inside so what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child\nEven though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still a game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select the traits do inherit from the parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet absolutely\nSo do you consider that a an enhancement or is that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting a gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes your five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species\nFunctioning but I mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping feeling that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of have sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and make that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease\nThat's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt so I think this comes down to the question of of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affects that individual\nBut that individuals children ... and their children and their children and their children and so that's\nWhere I think you have this very radio issue of directing future evolution [noise] you know\nEven saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to the point where you could use it him embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nWere being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n... ... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the unsinkable power to control evolution you can check out his head stock at ... dot com [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n... today show we're asking a very important question is who are we\nOkay by like do you have the answer deem know who we are uh\nI Know who I Am [laughter] the heck out of here I have a a a\nAn inkling of who we are this is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind in human nature\n[noise] so what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell it [noise] there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that and he quips us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack hair set to begin to understand what Steven Pinker Jeff ed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with is okay I'll do my best\n[noise] [noise] okay just to get us started human beings\nHave debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is\nWhether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slate\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting very\nThat was Steven Pinker unattached age back in two thousand two ideas\nSpecially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that man\nHas no nature from historian was they aren't you got man has no instincts when the anthropologist fast we want to give the human brain and capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non\nScientists go without ... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people have found congenial foremost if I if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the way than some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political fear of human nature in fact I\nIf we weren't blind place we can perfect mankind the angel dream of a fascination with any of our seasons through social engineering whereas if we're born with certain things and for some of them like some damage to selfishness prejudice and violence [noise] first of all\nThere are a number of reasons to doubt for human mind a blank slate\nJust come from a common sense as many people have\nTold me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that can come into the world with certain him from power forgotten all come from the outside\nOh and anyone who\nHas both a child and a house that I certainly noticed that the child exposed to speak for acquiring human language when I see how well presumably because of some in a difference between them and\nAnyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not single shovel [noise]\nSo for years that debate about nature versus nurture has been just a debate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has\nMainly argued that this shouldn't be a debate that who we are comes down to both our genes and our environment\nIs a mistake to think that uh if there's an effect of the environment that shows that were blank slates or conversely if there is such a thing as human nature than we are our robots and were programs to uh walk into walls and be completely insensitive to our environment [noise]\nNow open for lunch or an all three floors

something that happens consciousness is the word that we use to sex inscribed\nAll the different kinds of experiences that that we can have ...\nI think pretty much sympathy for conscious system there is something it is like to be that system whereas for something that isn't conscious [noise] there is [noise]\nAnd how consciousness even happens and if we can recreate it artificially it's a question that we're still trying to figure out because what's more fundamental about being a human then knowing\nWe exist [noise] an al ... explains more from Ted stage [noise]\nLast spring this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all there is without that as well\nAs myself there's nothing at all and when we suffer we suffer consciously whether it's through mental illness or pen and if we can experience joy and suffering what about other animals\nMight they be conscious she did they have a sense of self and ask them she says get faster and smarter\nMaybe they'll come a point maybe not too far away when my I find develops a sense of its ... existence now I actually think the prospects for conscious I pretty much in the store I'm going to tell you our conscious experiences of the world around us\nAnd about sounds within it all kinds of control to the ... that happened with free and because of all living voted [noise]\nI Love this idea of a controlled hallucination is is that is that what we experience that how we experience the world that it's\nIt's a controlled hallucination were just essentially hallucinating all the time\nI Love the strike zone I Wish I could take credit for it but but I Can't but I Love the fries because it\nPoints out that everything that we see consciously or unconsciously but let's talk about consciousness for now is a construction of the bright I mean it's easy to think that we are in our eyes and objective reality is revealed to us through the windows of our eyes yeah and what conscious perception is is basically just\nSomebody sitting inside us go looking out there and I see a red table they send you a passing a law again there's the batter writers ahead\nReal back to reality [noise]\nThat's right\nBut the truth is that all perceptions are acts of interpretation that\nThe brain applies encounter sensory die so I think that the way I Can't think of this is the\nHead that there is no light in the skull
