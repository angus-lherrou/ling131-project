NPR I'm Guy rise and on the show\nToday ideas about hacking the law to better serve everyone and for animal rights lawyer Stephen Wise that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like eight years even live\nLike have you look at this pencil\nIt's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing [noise]\nAnd so her book she might have or the cars you own they're all legal thing\nThe great apes that you'll see behind me they too are legal things now\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James mouse and he wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father die before his eyes they're legal things\n[noise] [noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing [noise] and like a legal person [noise]\nBut well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights it can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being it at the time of slavery\nAnd the person isn't emptied who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defining a very narrow way I mean like\nYou mean like ... men or actually\nFreeman were persons\nBut slaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now not all human beings are considered to be the person [noise]\nDoes not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons like it is more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations are considered to be legal persons are they are indeed so it can you explain how that works\nSo a person and things are both terms of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are so for example in\nThe last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real\nLegal rights [noise] [noise] [noise] even live in these recent changes as positive that means or broadening the definition of legal person all to include animals that's caused he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation Peter Singer [noise]\nNow my red Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and and indeed I was moved by it because I become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defenseless and I never realized how voiceless in defenseless billions\nOf non human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and my Nineteen eighty five I realized that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little known about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective and that time was to essentially [noise] change the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would\nBe your dream that was my goal and I'm In Nineteen eighty five I decided to that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand sitting before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success them so much to be done and as I began to try to understand what the legal history was of of slavery and freedom and rights that the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago\nThat was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and\nAfter he got there James decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was to get us all baptized\nAs he wanted to get a set of God parents because the Eighteenth century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Summers that had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart that hired slave captures the Kansas City of London signed him bring them to shift the ana marry that was set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is God parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and demanded that issue a common law of hideous corpus on behalf of James Somerset\nAnd I hate to say this corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the dictators required to bring the detainee and they get all legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well\nLord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSummers that was a legal thing he was not eligible for a British ... corpus only if you could be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume without deciding that Jane Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have your support person James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of\nHearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was so odious that the common law would not support any order James free at that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate Asian the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as low as concerned they had nothing whatsoever and common\nLaw\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers at the ... of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started looking for my lord Mansfield so how did you find your James ... we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the nonhuman animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far or chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds\nAnd hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can\nGather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear that they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on an army filed a hundred and sixty pages of affidavits and we say altogether\nIt shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to be inflamed is something that runs against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise]\nSo so how did you identify the chimpanzees you wanted to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose the state of New York\nOnce we understood that we decided to simultaneously file suits on behalf of all five chimpanzees who we can identify who are being held captive in the state of New York and where were they being held captive\nHillside school dot net in historic New England enjoy autumn in New England with thirty seven historic sites in more

elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I Would make it voluntarily once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty\nCourse if there was a financial incentive that my uh increase you would then\nFor those who were still interested in that you do a second random selection of those interests of making sure you actually match the demographic profiles of countries and making sure you had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't the millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and\nTo me that the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different but so much better for my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bounce ideas off each other\nTo find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limousine that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it than that already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John Adams and people I'm ... I'm Sorry uh\nTeach Like it's got to the galaxy guy Douglas Adams talked with us it's just I just got my dog of atoms saying are the people who want political power I specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also propose it if you pay these people two or three times the average wage the vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hands up for two years is that kind of income I Would\nOf course probably wants to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical systems so you would have to change as one elected and one randomly selected\nIn fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a comment in the world to instigate a one elected chamber and one saw titian chamber institution buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians\nBusily back stabbing each other and engaging the typical political power place and go well why do we need that for his chamber uh this is a path to old is the ideal\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute this in our parliament's tried to say to your friends I think we should populate out parliament with randomly selected people\nRely judging my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling thoughts the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples isn't it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly\nDon't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would be the perfect of costs not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least it's obviously yes\n[noise] I mean realistically if it is something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime [noise]\nYeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to get these ... assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting\nAside almost a million pounds to\nA sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so\nI can see that the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe it spreads I could see within my lifetime they're being for example a U.S state legislature with a second buddy selected bustle titian that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge meal battle is to try to convince people and then entrenched powers to um to try that\nYes uh yeah I'm not I think it will be easy a political changes every easy uh especially fundamental political changed such as this but\nUh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political latest potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to innovate try something new I think half system's broken\nAnd noticed a change [noise]\nRead headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find as full talk at ... dot com\n\nAbout hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you want to do\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is\nThe fact Mario he's a legal advocate\nThere's this philosopher ... us\nWho had this book between facts and norms and he says democracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to build together\nWhat are we are one another where do we want to go together and then law is the thing that takes the conclusions the findings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules in institutions that shape our lives\nAnd I I Love this idea of law as the kind of the thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand in real life on the other hand between facts and norms\nBut that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut a huge gap oftentimes people who need those rules are the most have never even heard of them\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nOr both\nMe back again to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law to the people\nHere say Martin on the head stage [noise]\nI Want to tell you about someone I'm going to call them Ravi none of the reviews from a community of hurts people included out on the west coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because a multinational corporation constructed a manufacturing facility on the land where they lived\nThen Twenty years later the same company goes to cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nIndia got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company had violated many of them\nJust from that factory covers rub his moustache and everything he wears rubbish says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water\nThey get sick Robbie has appealed\nTo the company for years he said I've I've written so many letters my family could cremate me with that they wouldn't need to buy any would\nHe said the company ignored every one of those letters and so in two thousand Thirteen rubbing none the decided to use the last means of protests he thought he had left he walked to the gate so that factory with a bucket of\nPatrolling its head intending to set himself on fire\nRavi is not alone in his desperation the un estimates that worldwide four billion people live without basic access to justice but we've been choosing to ignore it\nRight now in Sierra Leone in Cambodia in Ethiopia\nFarmers are being pigeonholed
