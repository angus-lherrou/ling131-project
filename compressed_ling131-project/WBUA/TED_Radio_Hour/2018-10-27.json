of life so we're just hearing from comedian again for ... and she and a group of Muslim comedians traveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they were trying to open up the conversation\nAbout Islamophobia which at times\nLittle patient [laughter] yeah I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes\nBut when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more people without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah and what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a is a joint um shared experience\nLike a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nA trip you took with the other comedians\nThey turned it into a movie called the Muslims are coming in too long after it came up something happened back in New York at least one again usually felt welcomed and accepted\nAnd hate group spent three hundred thousand\nDollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use a better Fox but [noise]\nOh why not macho own poster campaign right that does nice things about Muslims so myself comedians you know be dollar decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign\nWe raised money work with

a Muslim Muslims [noise]\nLet's see what the truth about Muslims they have great for the recipe for us are considered political by the MTA\nOr the mere mention of Muslims in a positive light was considered political but it is it it's about justice so we decided to change our fighting bigotry would delightful posters campaign abiding bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nSo basically what I'm saying is a couple of dirt bags comedians took on a major New York city agency and the comedians one [noise]\nWith a very weird feeling I was like as a blonde girls feel like oh what's\nMy work is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny\nBut just changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\nReally talk a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment of film or I think you're Birmingham, Alabama and it will like it was\nPretty successful yeah so I mean you know one of our stops in Birmingham, Alabama where we'd like set up a table called name that religion we're going to read it and you're going to tell us if it was all the New Testament or the Koran\nIf your

would we hold Islam to separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God you\nKnow a lot of drivers in three of them do you remember during some credible to me that you actually saw the wheels turning people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that\nThe American people are not built to hate you know what I mean they actually want to be friendly and they went off your coffee and they wanna open the door for you and they want to be good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found that I've had this before and it's so dorky but it is true is that if you approach people with low\nAnd and that's what I stand as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing performing on

was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\n\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas thoughts and\nStories that might otherwise be too uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for Kevin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away in a car accident and\nIt was an experience that really radically changed my life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and felt like I was shattered in just a million different pieces I mean it's kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuate it in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in waves\nAnd you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark hopeless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly been a long way I didn't want people to see that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight of you know
