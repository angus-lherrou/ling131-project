suddenly struck me\nOne I just go home and start to do things differently I got an a train and I just made up incredible edible [laughter] and it was a really simple model really simple um it was just

water and I'm the label is head gluten free interesting\nWell and it is [laughter] this is food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat and become staples of the western diet\nThing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government's through direct and indirect subsidies encourage the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields of hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um\nBut if you look in the late nineteenth early twentieth century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown in our most just in Iowa and again you can't believe drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nOf the heyday of value added food which contains as many ... corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals was home cooked breads desserts and soups because all of them can be bought at any store not that they are any good but they were there\nMost bombs cook like mine a piece of royal meet a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or\nThe stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you\n\nGet ... and ... like what you were saying earlier ally that has to do with with the fact that like ... food all over the world right [noise] you know I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this could go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables and winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything that you you are a guy that a lot of people that look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of Mark Bittman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat well\nI Do think you know I did this book called the ... going before six or a few years ago and um\nBasically it's a strategy that you were plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever but I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know or the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because I had a broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can\nAs you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients in plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not born craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but\nBy improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important\nOurselves by doing so we have to choose that path factor [noise]\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire talk at Penn dot com [noise] um well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I say the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next ... who knows how long is a great recipe that you put out years ago was that\nPasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs\nRight about that yeah great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta why the hell we can get sweet potatoes pasta which is which paleo come from a housing prices gonna kill ya [noise] [noise]\nOkay so am I saying that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you have to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate at Seventy four percent ... Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] is it [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nIt says Dr Robert ... he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco so there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know I'm not sure which did you know I mean them or are that's even has the most famous now apple\nPuree or evaporated canes yeah my favorite because cages so you know just healthy guy what happens when you evaporate dangerous you get sugar\n... studies sugar how he managed to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they processed food diet\nBecause it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive [noise]\nAnd like any addictive substance Robert says sugar can be toxic especially because so many of us eat too much of it ... on the stage\nAnd the Cancer Center at Beth Israel Deaconess learned about the standard of cure can be as promising research at B.

[noise] sometimes quiet sometimes boosting just certain frequencies [noise]\nRebel show that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas the country has the freshness of these other groups that Charles says how our food sounds\nEven looks can change how it tastes\nOne might ... white wine ... within ... tasteless food dye\nAddict inappropriate you'll find the experts the wind make says we'll get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think is a red wine all the ... the tobacco in the dark chocolates in the state and fruits and so I won't even though they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles Spence on the head stage\nUm here this morning there I'll tell you about the perfect meal will convince we can taste the food we can enjoy the flavor was narrowed was of the wind and the glass\nRevival of what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we even drink out of the question is how to study of housing measures I Am a tendency among scientists that been your against strong as it's the same people like your eye and a brain scanner gives them something sweet something to drink a fee which parts of the brain lights up the hill that it's going to your brain\nBut I think is one problem here which is that in fact if your mattress up one of the brain scan is kind of lie on your back where they had climbed stale with Cuban your marriage\nThat periodically squid sin or some drink you know what to be full of your head all kind of joke now spoil that the brain scan alignment but it's kind of tells you something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal is one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal\nI'm actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be of some very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese up and we'll stick in people's minds as as best meals but ... what I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because the social aspects of dining um I mean no one has ever had that perfect meal when the fighting with our partner say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seem to stick with us and resonate and then you can have quite capture when you get ... as your mood ... pretty relaxed your holiday less stressed Tripoli with your family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were thinking\nThat phenomenon how we've all learned versions of it um\nIt was going to problem solve rose a paradox ... used to describe a northern Europeans um\nBut you can only who gave for that so holidays to the Mediterranean ness sitting somewhere or on the side of the sea sipping not Rosie wind blew looking into that love his eyes some virus\nThey hear the sounds of the sea smells associates all out and not tasteless like the past month and when you've ever had a so great that you want to buy a boat or a case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you have an ... or you bring it back and then you're disappointed [noise]\nYour friends are like this is really cheap birthday yeah and you say well how is it something about when the buckles when they're playing with a cold and that you know sport the wind things not ... we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments in certain states of\nMind on all mental state and the environment both together that kind of impact what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile anyway some miss attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation and put some of that pledge of into what we think about the food [noise]\nIn fact just Charles these ideas about how we experience to have actually convince some chefs to try out certain methods of labor and has been in these methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nIf you're in a good mood to taste good if you're in a bad mood they never tasted good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wine glass but our brain has everything else this island or the ... the smell of assaulting the or the walls of the summer box all of that play against the experience\nAnd top chef capturing that inside a in the dishes they are so that he that too much to install restaurant in the bay in Switzerland when he got his tuition star restaurant a white table cloths there's no room table was no glasses or in a place where nothing because of a plastic tire\nPeople wait say what he calls me here seven o'clock hour here and everyone's here in the restaurant and I can say well we'll tables the full\nNothing will happen until somebody picks up seriously that plastic how I Wonder if they get up you know there\nAre a little one you arrive tower and it makes it moving sounded and sort of some of the first table that there'll be laughing\nAnd then you can guarantee within a minute you have the whole restaurant full of moving fires laughing Dina's and that is the moment when it first comes out because then he has successfully nothing more than one euro table in Homs the mood and he knows that will improve even the type of uh two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise]\nWow so it's like from from a neurological perspective [noise] do we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case\n[laughter] uh no so we don't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all\nKind of classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with that I actually just a few stuff here in London\nAnd he's been I'm sending a question as for several weeks have to be living his restaurant\nLet's say what'd you remember yeah he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that can constructing something they remember the experience that I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they were reaching\nOur most chefs that you talk to are they on board with with your ideas did did they think yeah it is it is about the experience he's right or they or did they say that this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste of food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in color rich school days just the sourcing the preparation but nothing\nOkay so um you know restaurants um do you serve the food we now plastic cutlery nine as a silver isn't it and what is your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking at it and they ... so the the St Louis things in the one hand but clearly you can never sort of food just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment\nNice gonna contextual factors are always that it cannot be able to say certainly the ... I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now putting up starting out there and Venus\nWho who are already thing for the first time in history saying we don't need to just now about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were setting [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book it's called the perfect meal\nYou can see his entire talk head to head that NPR do or\nSay let's get shifted a little bit more creative about what's on our plate because that's what my ... my name is Marshall bigger and you are in a log in Indian whereas like an Indian\n... am it very difficult for you to have the right candidate I guess we're not having them as in the center of the Netherlands\nAnd in the center of the Netherlands about once a week my cell and his wife have what some might consider an unusual ingredient with dinner\nAnd it's ah something that that we were for instance over a a rice dish or I'm", "year": "2018", "show_name": "TED Radio Hour", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "24"}
