... who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR calf nine\nCould make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you're basically talking like superheroes right like perfect lesion superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right those are the yoga I think that's that's the science fiction association of what\nCRISPR could allow [noise] we have\nLong lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leader muscles\nOr lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart\nDisease and as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have the technology that could in theory you\nAllow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient to pain or or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that the technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably there is a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have\n... that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks theirselves and the HIV virus can't get inside so what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child\nEven though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nWe might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select the traits do inherit from their parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into the genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents it's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like the like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the finger you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or is that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting a gene editing into kind of\nTwo different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that fall right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes easier five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders sweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of have sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and said that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel [laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease\nThat's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt so I think this comes down to the question of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course what we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so\nThat's where I think you have this very rainy issue of directing future evolution [noise]\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it ... embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] have started ... is working on a book about all this it's called a crack in creation gene editing and the I think of all power to control evolution you can check out his head stock at ... dot com [noise]\n\nToday show we're asking a very important question which is who are we\nOkay by like you have the answer deem know who we are I\nKnow who I Am [laughter] either you or I have a a a an inkling of who we are Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature\n[noise] so what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell there are some intricately complex circuitry in the brain a\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equip us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here set to begin to understand what Steven Pinker Jeff ed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out just even can you can you help us with this [laughter] okay I'll do my best\n[noise] [noise] okay just to get us started human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is\nWhether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slate\nThat all of a run for Congress from socialize Asian culture parenting [noise]\nIn two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that man\nHas no nature from historian was they aren't you got to Manhattan though instincts and the anthropologist actually want to give the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non\nHochul inclined Stephen J gold\n... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number political reasons why people are found congenial foremost I get more blank slate and by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut or something it's written on the way than some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality and other\nPolitical fear of human nature in fact I if we were blind way we can perfect mankind ... dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if you were born with certain things and perhaps some of them might some damage to health and fitness prejudiced and violence [noise]\nFirst of all there are number of reason to doubt ... human line in the blank slate and some of them just come from a common sense as many people have told me over the years anyone who's had more than one child knows that can come into the world with certain temperament and how they've done all come from the outside [noise]\nAnyone who a\nHandful of a child in a house that I certainly noticed that the child exposed speech for choir is human language where every house that won't presumably because of some in a difference between them and\nAnyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationships knows that the minds of men in the minds of women are not going anywhere shovel [noise]\nSo for years that debate about nature versus nurture has been Jeff that debate it's one or the other but Steven Pinker has mainly argued that\nThis shouldn't be a debate that who we are comes down to both our genes and our environment\nIs a mistake to think that uh if there is some effect of the environment that shows that were blanks weights or conversely if there is such a thing as human nature than we are our robots and were programs to uh walk into walls and be completely insensitive to our environment [noise]\n\nSupport\nFor the Ted radio hour comes from the University of Florida

being conscious\nLifted ... he's a professor of neuroscience at the University of sex in the u._k.\nConsciousness is any kind of experience at all whether it's a visual experience of the world around us whether it's an emotional\nExperience of feeling sad or jealousy or happy or excited for ... for instance of intending to do something or being the\nCause is something that happens consciousness is the word that we use to sex inscribed all the different kinds of experiences that that we can have ...\nI think pretty much sympathy for conscious system there was something it is like to be that system whereas for something that isn't conscious [noise] better than [noise]\nAnd how consciousness even happens and if we can recreate it artificially it's a question that we're still trying to figure out because what's more fundamental\nAbout being a human then knowing we exist\n[noise] and I'll set explains more from the stage [noise]\nLast spring this question is so important because consciousness for each of us is all there is without that as well\nAs myself there's nothing at all and when we suffer we suffer consciously whether it's three mental illness or paying and if we can experience joy and suffering what about other animals\nMight they be conscious to do they have a sense of self and ask them teachers get faster and smarter\nMaybe they'll come a point maybe not too far away when my I find developed sense of ... existence now I actually think the prospects for conscious a on a pretty remarks Mr I'm going to tell you our conscious experiences of the world around us and about films within it\nAll kinds of control to these ... that happened with tree and because of all live in ...
