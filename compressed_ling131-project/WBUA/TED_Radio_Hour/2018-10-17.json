was the idea behind it you ...\nOur defendants and criminal cases [noise] that's right and I like lots of people had no idea what was going on and I'm going to legal system and my daughter in law school [noise] um I joined the criminal defense connected and why you and step into Manhattan criminal court\nAnd never was able to look away again this is Robyn Steinberg [noise] what I saw so shocked me that I thought this can't be happening in our country and we can't possibly think this passes for chocolate [noise]\nUm and I committed myself to then becoming a public defender where I spent most of my career [noise]\nThere's a story that we tell ourselves about our justice system that it's blind but it's just everyone is treated equally under the law but it's not true [noise] what\nWould you begin to realize very very early on as a public defender is how we defined crime policing occurs in this country who were prosecuting in our state local courts\nIs deeply deeply defined by class in by race and so I just wanted to fight for each and every one of my clients as hard as I could\nBut definitely you were pushing up\nAgainst an enormous expansive criminal legal system that was not just crushing my individual clients that their families and their entire communities [noise] here's more from Robin diverted 'em and Ted's age and\nI'm not ... so fundamental to the American vacation editors enshrined in our constitution\nAnd yet in America\nI'm if addicted to imprison us from slavery is laughing harsh ration it always has been we all know the shocking numbers the United states incarcerated for more people per capita than almost any nation on the planet\nBut what you may not know is that on any given night in America almost half a million people go to sleep and those concrete gel south who have not been convicted of anything these mothers\nAnd fathers and sons and daughters are there for one reason and one reason only they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom and that\nPrice is called the mail [noise]\nHow much does it generally cost to post bail so when somebody is arrested um judges can set bail and an amount um in their own

most families their families are making decisions about buying a gallon of milk for their children or putting that money towards bail\nIt's inconceivable to lots of Americans that you can't just go to an ATM machine and pull at five hundred dollars but that's the reality for most people coming through the criminal legal system [noise] so\nThat's given up at ten o'clock on radio Boston We're not

radio hour from NPR I'm Guy Raj\nAnd on the show today ideas about hacking the law to better serve everyone and for animal rights lawyer Stephen Wise that means changing laws to better serve non human animals like apes Steven was\nLike to have you look at the pencil\nIt's a thing [noise] it's a legal thing [noise]\nIn certain books you might have or the cars you own they're all legal things\nThe right age that you'll see behind me they too are legal things now\nI can I can do that to a legal thing I can do whatever I Want to my book or my car\nThese great apes you'll see the photographs were taken by man named James Madison who wrote a book called James and other apes and he tells his book how almost every one of them is an orphan saw his mother father died before his eyes they're legal things\n[noise] so so what is actually the difference between a legal thing and like a legal person [noise]\nUh well since Roman times thing has been an entity who lacks the capacity for legal rights\nIt can be a pencil it can be a computer it can be a human being at the time and slavery\nPerson isn't emptied who has the capacity for one or more legal rights at one time it was a defined as a very narrow way\nI mean like you mean like ... men were actually Freeman were persons ...\nSlaves were not sometimes women were not sometimes children were not now no more human being\nDoes not have legal rights right and the person dies and basically now all humans are legal persons like it has more complicated than that right because like in the U.S corporations\nAre considered to be legal persons uh they are indeed so it can you explain how that works so a person and things are both in terms of art and and that's up to the legislatures in courts as to what or who those entities are\nSo for example in the last few years the New Zealand parliament has designated a river as a person who has real legal rights and national park is real legal rights the Columbia Supreme Court has said that the Amazon rain forest in the country of Columbia is a person who has real legal rights [noise]\nEven live in these recent changes as positive status or broadening the definition of legal person or to include animals that's caused he's been dedicated to for nearly forty years ever since he read the book animal liberation and Peter Singer ... ... [noise]\nNow my red Peter Singer spoke in Nineteen eighty one I had a full head of lush brown hair and and indeed I was moved by it because I had become a worry because I wanted to speak for the voiceless defend the defense list and I never realized how voiceless and defenseless the billions of\nNon human animals are and I began to work as an animal protection lawyer and by Nineteen eighty five I realize that I was trying to accomplish something that was literally impossible the reason being that all of my clients\nAll the animals his interest I was trying to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them has also become legal persons now at that time\nThere was very little known about her spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on one I knew it was going to take a long time [noise]\nSo your objective and that time was to essentially [noise] changed the designation of non human animals from illegal things to legal persons that was your goal that would be your dream\nThat was my goal and uh in Nineteen eighty five I decided that he would likely be Thirty years of preparation about two thousand Fifteen before I'd be ready to file the first\nLawsuits and that would have a reasonable chance of success them so much to be done and as I began to try to\nUnderstand what the legal history was of slavery and freedom and rights that the one critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal\nRights to animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and\nAfter I got there James decided he was going to escape one of the first things he did was to get himself baptized\nBecause he wanted to get a set of God parents because in Eighteen century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Summers that had a confrontation with Charles Stuart than James dropped out of sight\nAnd enraged Charles Stuart than hired slave captures the Kansas City of London signed him bring him to shift the anti married that was to set sail for Jamaica where James was to be sold in the slave markets will now James is Scott parents swung into action\nThey approached the most powerful judge lord Mansfield who is chief judge of the ... bench and the demand is that he issue a common law written of hideous corpus on behalf\nOf James Somerset and heritage hideous corpus it's meant to protect any of us who are detained against her will the detainees required to bring the detainee in illegally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty\nWell lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSummers that was a legal thing he was not eligible\nFor a writ of habeas corpus only if you could be a legal person so Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have just corpus and James his body was brought in by the captain to shift there were a series of hearings over the next six months on July twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield said that slavery was odious that the common law would not\nAt that moment James Somerset underwent a legal trans substantiate the free man who walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as the war was concerned they had nothing whatsoever and common\nLaw\nSo inspired by this case you realized you needed to find your James Summers that of course a non human version of James numbers and\nI started to look for my James Somerset I started to look for my lord Mansfield so how did you find a gym summers we began with those non human animals who we believe are cognitively complex extraordinarily so and that we can prove that so the non human animal so we have the gun suing on behalf of\nSo far are chimpanzees and elephants and the reason we started with chimpanzees is because of all the hundreds and hundreds\nAnd hundreds of\nArticles that that detailed legal studies about the cognition of chimpanzees that we can gather in one place and bring to the attention of the court to make it clear\nThat they are autonomous beings and that they are conscious that they are self conscious that they can use symbols that they have language like abilities that goes on and on and we filed a hundred and sixty\nPages of affidavits and we say altogether it shows that these are extraordinarily cognitively complex beings to the point of being autonomous and judge\nTo allow an autonomous being to being slaves is something that Ryan's against every idea of justice and you have to step in and stop this [noise]\nSo so how did you identify the chimpanzees you want to represent and then where to even file a lawsuit\nWhat we did is we spent seven years looking at the law of all fifty states and twenty English speaking countries trying to understand what jurisdiction the law would be reasonably on our side so we chose to the state of New York\nOnce we understood that we decided to simultaneously file suits on behalf of all five chimpanzees who we could identify who are being held captive in the state of\nNew and where were they being held captive\nOut or in legal seafood flagship restaurants legal harbor side now over for lunch on all three

and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers\nSo I I Would make a voluntary once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who was still interested in that you do a second random selection of those interests of making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the country so making sure you had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be a millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and to me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different but so much better for my perspective that sort of wisdom of crowds idea\nThat actually you need diversity bounce ideas off each other to fund the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the people who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be\nPeople who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John how does somebody go I'm not saying I'm Sorry I'm like it's got to the galaxy going out Douglas Adams with us you know this is talk of Adam's saying\nAre the people who want political power a specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory\nBut I Would also proposed that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage the vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hands up for two years is that kind of income I Would of\nProbably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a ... system so you would have to ...\nRandomly selected in fact there's a a regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first a parliament in the world to instigate a one in like the chamber in one solution chamber once would soon buddy\nI wouldn't be surprised if people looked at the ... and look at the elected chamber full of politicians\nBusily back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political power place and go well why do we need that for sure but uh but this is a path to is the ideal\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to use to treat these you now parliament's trying to say to your friends oh I think we should populated parliament with randomly selected people\nRely jerky what if my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling box the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these modern examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly\nDon't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least it's obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime\nYeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to first get these students assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies UK Government is now putting aside almost\nA million pounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see the the word is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe ... spreads I could see within my lifetime they're being for example\nA U.S state legislature with the second buddies selected bustle titian that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a hugely ill battle is to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try this\nYes ah yeah it does it I'm not going to be easy to political changes every easy a specially fundamental political changed such as this but uh I'm hoping that there'll be a generation of political leaders potentially at a local city state level who say yeah I Want to innovate\nOn to try something new I think half system's broken\nAnd noticed a change\nRed headache he runs the ... foundation which advocates for random selection democracy you can find his full talk at ... dot com\n\nOn the show today ideas that hacking the law\nHow did you even start to think about what you want to do\nI did study law\nBecause of a kind of dreamy idea about what the law is this is the fact Mario he's a legal advocate\nThere's this philosophy you're getting ... who has this book between ... and he says [noise] democracy should be this big open conversation about fundamental questions like what kind of world we want to do it together\nWhat are we are one another where we want to go together in that law is the thing that takes the conclusions the\nFindings from those conversations and turns them into actual rules and institutions that shape our lives and I I Love this idea of law as a kind of the thing that translates between our dreams about justice on the one hand in real life on the other hand between facts in arms\nBut that is not the world we live in\nA lot of the rules in a lot of places are decent\nBut there's a huge gap oftentimes people who need those were the most has never even heard of them [noise]\nAnd um the systems that are supposed to enforce those rules are corrupt or broken\nOr both [noise]\nHe began to see this problem when he was a young lawyer so he wanted to figure out a way to give the power of the law [noise] to the people here say they learn on the head stage\n[noise] I Want to tell you that someone I'm going to call them Ravi none to release from a community of hurts people included out on the west coast of India same place my own family comes from\nWhen he was ten years old his entire community was forced to move because multinational corporation constructed uh\nThen Twenty years later the same company goes to cement factory one hundred meters from where they live now\nMaybe as got strong environmental regulations on paper but this company has violated many of them\nDust from that factory covers rub his moustache and everything he wears really says that if people or animals eat anything that grows in his village or drink the water\nThey get sick\nRubbing has appealed to

in two thousand Thirteen rubbing none the decided to use the last means of protests he thought he had left\nHe walked to the gates of that factory with a bucket of patrol and his head intending to set himself on fire\nRavi is not alone in his desperation the un estimates that worldwide four billion people live without basic access to justice but we've been choosing to ignore it\nRight now in Sierra
