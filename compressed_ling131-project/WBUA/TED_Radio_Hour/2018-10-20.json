radio hour from NPR and guy Raj and Sam show ideas about food a connection to it and its power to change so much about\nThe way we live I just buy a bottle of water and I'm the label is head gluten free interest as\nWell and it is [laughter] this is food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat had become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell and easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call Monica cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all cultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late nineteenth early twentieth century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown in our you know I was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contained as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought and any store not that they were any good but they were there\nMost bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or\nThe stupidest food ever minute rice\nFor dessert store bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses if women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave lights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself lights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food cheese the very stuff that will kill you\nGet ... and ... like what you're saying earlier a lot of that has to do with with the fact that like we ship food all over the world right [noise] you know I think part of the problem\nIs you know this didn't go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes if you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango\nIf you want it to ... you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nI mean you are an omnivore you need everything that you you were a guy that a lot of people that look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you are a food to eat like I think of my Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of heat well I\nBe six vegan before six or\nA few years ago and um\nBasically it's a strategy that you were plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinner time and then do whatever but I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know or the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because I had her broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can\nAs you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animals and of course John food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients in plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming if this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad\nBut back to animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not born craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone and that's the hard part but\nBy improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food [noise] we can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories but our carbon footprint\nWe can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so we have to choose that path thank you [noise]\nFood writer Mark Bittman you can see his entire attack at Penn dot com\nUm well I Know you have to leave marks thank you thank you for doing this and I I tell you the one one of the things I really miss being paleo now for the next [laughter] who knows how long is a great recipe that you put out here every day I was a pasta and spaghetti or deans bread crumbs\nHearing about that yeah great use of sardines great how can you not eat pasta or what the hell I mean you can get sweet potatoes pasta which is which is Haley of come from a housing pastas gonna kill ya [noise] [noise]\nOkay so am I getting that saying that like forty percent of stuff in grocery stores isn't real food but but if you had to estimate what what percentage of the stuff in grocery stores has added sugar\nI don't have to estimate Seventy four percent ... Seventy four percent of all of the food in the store\nHas been spiked with added sugar in some fashion [noise] is it [noise] hidden in plain sight Oh absolutely\nThis is Dr Robert Lustig he's a pediatrician and a researcher at the University of California in San Francisco\nSo there are fifty six names for sugar I mean did you know kind of wish that you know I mean ... that's even you know some famous now\nApple puree or evaporated changes yeah my favorite because cages so you know just healthy guy yeah what happens when you evaporate changes you get sugar\n... studies sugar how he managed to sneak its way into our diet and what it does to our bodies\nWe've replaced a real food diet where they processed food diet\nBecause it's cheaper it's portable it's convenient kids like it and it's addictive [noise]\nAnd like any addictive substance ... says sugar can be toxic especially because so many of us eat too much and here's Robert ... on the head stage\nThe governor's academy a boarding school north of Boston shaping the leaders of tomorrow since Seventeen sixty three open house October twenty seventh always governors dot org\nAnd J. B. fashion door in Chelsea dedicated to bringing your peace of mind at home with Marvin windows and doors offering design installation and service Jamie sash dot com\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\nAnd the\nGuy rise and I'm sure it's a food why we eat what we eat and why our food is sometimes so much more than what we put on our plates\nWe all think we taste food and all my aunts and yet that's an illusion in the sense that uh most of what you're tasting fruit you the floor or let me see the Hubble the to the smoky are actually being because he bought nostrils rubbery\nThe information I get from my nose and making me believe as if it's coming from I ... this is Charles Spence a head of the crust Myrtle research ... at Oxford University what is the cross motor research laboratory [noise]\nUm ... here in the psychology department where we look at how the census interacts\nN gas our mouth and nose interact when we eat that said or mouse and our years\nWe didn't experiments where we're feeding people a potato chips and each time they put it into a potato chip we would change the sound that they could sometimes making their own crunching ...\nSometimes quiet sometimes boosting just certain frequency [noise] rebel show that as soon as you change the sound it changed the Christmas the conscience of freshness or these other groups that\nCharles says how our food sounds even looks can change how it tastes\nOne might ... white wine ... within ... tasteless food dye and they've done appropriately you'll find the experts the wind make says we'll get fooled into\nSpelling leaving tasty what they think is a red wine all the ... the ... on the top chocolates in the state and fruits and so even though they're actually tasting um it used to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles stance on the head stage\nUm here this morning and say I'll tell you about the perfect meal will convince we can taste the food we enjoy the flavors on the road was of the wind and the blast\nBut if I look at what's going on is crazy by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink out of the question how to study it has the measure is I'm a tendency among the scientists that when you're a guest strong as it does take people like your eye a brain scanner gives them something sweet something to drink at the top of the brain lights up this is that your brain on flavor or New York astronomy\nRunning is one problem here which is that in fact if you imagine yourself more of these brain scan is kind of lie on your back where they had climbed stale with a Cuban your marriage\nThat periodically square sin ah some drink you know what to do for your head all kind of jolt an old spoiled the brain scan alignment but it's got to tell you something I was going to solve it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal [laughter]\nI'm actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be of some very very simple it can be fishing trips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often will stick in people's minds as us the best meals but ... would I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining um I didn't know what does that have that perfect meal when the fighting with a partner say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seemed to stick with doesn't resonate in that and you can never quite capture when you get ... as your moods you pretty relaxed ... their family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you are sort of thinking\nThat phenomenon has a name that we've all learned versions of it um\nIt was from the province all rosy paradox ... let's say use to describe a northern Europeans um meticulously who gave for that so holidays to the Mediterranean missing some well uh on the side of the sea sipping not rose they wind blew looking into that love his eyes\nSome ... you can hear the sounds of the sea smells of associates all out and not tasteless like the best buy said while you've ever had a so great that you want to buy bumped or case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you have an ... ah you bring it back and then you're disappointed [noise]\nYour friends are like this is really cheap birthday\nYeah and he said why is it something about when they when they are playing with a cold and not you know to spoil the wind things not just a tool we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in\nCertain environments in certain states of mind on all mental state and the environment both together kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile anyway some myths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation and put some of that pleasure into what we think about the food [noise]\nIn fact is Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood to taste good if you're in a bad mood they'd never tastes good it is illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but all brain has everything else this island of ... the smell of the cells in the ah the\nI play against the experience on top chef capturing that inside in the dishes they are so then he that tuition style restaurant in Switzerland tuition and start up\nA white type across the ... ... it was an eye glasses and I played no nothing just a plastic car people wait and see what he calls me here seven o'clock hour here and everyone seems restaurant now I can say well we'll tables full nothing will happen\nUntil somebody picks up seriously that\nPlastic how I Wonder if they get up you know the little one euro tower and it makes it moving sound and sort of some of those type of it that will be laughing\nAnd then you can guaranteed within a minute you'll have a whole restaurant full of moving fire was laughing Dina's ... is the moment when the first is comes out because then he had successfully nothing more than one euro table in Homs the mood and he knows that will improve even the type of uh two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise]\nWow so aside from from a neurological perspective [noise] do we fully understand what's happening like why that's the case\n[laughter] uh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the\nCase it's all of a classic example of just how important the environment is what we taste I work with ... just a few stuff here in London and he's being I'm sending out question as several weeks have to ... his restaurant\nLet's say what'd you remember yeah he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something they experience but I felt about it in the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they were reaching\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they on board with with your ideas do do they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say that this is totally absurd it's all about the food and the taste the food\nOr because there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in Colorado School days justice sourcing the preparation\nBut nothing else but he says their case so I'm your restaurant um do you serve the food we plastic cutlery na ... silver and where's your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking at it and they ...\nSo the the St Louis things on the one hand but clearly you can never sort of serve who just ... it's always on something in a certain environment\nThere's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided [noise] certainly I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now pumping up starting out there and\nVenus who who are already thing for the first time in history saying we don't need to just now about the ingredients and cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the mind those that were sitting [noise]\nCharles Spence wrote about his research on how we experience food in his latest book it's called the perfect meal\nYou can see his entire talk head to head that NPR gotta work\nSo let's get shifted a little bit more creative about what's on our plates because that's what Marcel ... does there my name is Marshall bicker and you are in a log in Indian where it's like an Indian\nReferencing I'm [noise] I'm very good for you to finance yes it is a rag can't do that you were out everything is in the center of the Netherlands\nAnd in the center of the Netherlands about once a week my cell and his wife have what some might consider an unusual ingredient with dinner\nAnd it's something that we were
