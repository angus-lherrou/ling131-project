friday I'm Ira Flatow broadcasting today from the studios of Casey Gail you on the campus of California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks California\nLater in the hour an update on where world nations stand on curbing carbon emissions and avoiding it climate catastrophe but first\nThursday morning two astronauts on route to the international space station had to abort their launch after a booster rocket malfunction\nMade an emergency dissent back to earth and they're happy to report both are doing well both landing safely Rachel Feldman science editor of popular science issue to bring us up to date on the launch and other selected subjects in Science Welcome back right Joe thanks for having me Ira\nAnything more about what went wrong there\nYet so we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure\nAnd they had to undergo what's known as a a ballistic Landay ballistic descent which is so called because usually they add make kind of on a shallow angle as they come down to create a little bit of left and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rock literally coming down more like a projectile now this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because ah they were supposed to come back down to the ground in the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an aborted landing during a lunch and um the Russian space agencies that immediately they would begin investigating around us so far that that's all we know\nWell the good news about it that it worked right [laughter] right [laughter] right and again this is a rare but the kind of thing\nThat astronaut training for all the time you're not something that happens a lot but certainly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so you know not something we want to have happen but something that is certainly on the roster of things they have learned how to handle\nWell ... ... but with the Soyuz capsule being the only way for human\nVersion isn't this ... you know a little bit of a problem there's no other way to get up there\nRight so there are um I Believe three so use missions\nPlanned that are now kind of up in the air because the Russian space agency again\nIs undertaking this investigation\nAnd so it's possible some of those will be put on hold and even if they're not uh you know those two crew members who were counted on who are now on the ground instead of on I asked that I mean that there's there's probably going to be a gap in staffing you know we have three people on the space station right now\nBut they're scheduled to come back in December now they could extend their stay a bit about this study is capsule they have up there that's going to bring them home\nI Believe it's only a it can only stay up there through sometime in January so\nUh that's the longest there'll be able to say before coming back down and that means that the speciation probably will be an crude for some amount of time which is something that we know should be possible there are procedures in place for it but I don't believe it's ever happened before\nOf every seventh Eighteenth details and ticket information at Lexus Broadway in Boston dot com [noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow this is less than a month until the mid term elections on November sex and there's a lot of talk about hacking and voters security\nThe federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated\nYet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure how can we security systems\nHow does this affect voting behavior\nAnd our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to four to five five\nEight four for ... you can also tweet us ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms\nLet me bring on my gas Lawrence Norden is a deputy director of the Brennan Center Democracy Program at New York University Welcome to science friday\nThanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\nLife to be here and it's nice to have you um\nLarry mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do there\nI'm not sure that we know in tire early what they were trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election and two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is a tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase of political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns\nAnd their emails those are those are two separate things uh if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases are again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases or the roles that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were phishing attacks against um [noise]\nUh election officials we know that it looks like at least one election systems vendor which uh manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWas that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the software wasn't taken off is that what you're talking about in that case there is that something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company the our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter] they may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them\nI'm ... and again they manufacture IPO books and and deal with registration databases\nOr electronic publics or what you can kind of what our use their off in a a tablets or or or or computers that are used to check people in\n'em and uh uh as I said I last I checked I think they have they they may have denied that they were actually successfully breach but at least in one of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was\nSome that are that sounded like them uh that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromised\nWell um [noise] um well that's actually quite a controversial question ... you mentioned um well so let's start off by making\nI'm I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um\nYou know perhaps to influence the the elections ranging from um affect any of the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack into say machines and systems um in the first um distinction we would make is between the voter registration systems which I'm wary was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked those are voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nOr potentially the scanners that are used to scan scan on paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer that question is actually quite um quite controversial you\nMade a reference to the DEF CON um activities and so what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting\nMachine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known that um you know a a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine and do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all\nI'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access that in order to have a actually ineffective attack on them um you would need some sort of inside job\nUm that would require 'em a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily detected and so\nUm but I mean I think that's where the controversy is that um it's my sense that the computer science community thing 'cause it's easier to actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against on the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials to\n... hour a day right um well I mean I tend to kind of um if I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is\nI'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um our inner taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that\nUm the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't\nHave any sort of paper record of the election being there in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we are doing that um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could I think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and there weren't mistakes and the programming so\nUm so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking\nThat the machines right now for twenty Eighteen are well taken\nCare of and are highly unlikely to be subjected to the sorts of attacks that we see a DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the state's the moving directions to make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that\nI I if I could just jump in real quick point um I I\nI I think there to build on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but um [noise] more importantly there's there are there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and an example of that my an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly um that comes up on on websites and gets reported out and uh we we have seen in fact not in the United states or that I Know of but in other countries ... election reporting attacks\nUm and um if if you get ... incorrect numbers there in in the environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is\nUm a lot of false information put out\nThat level of interference from the Russians and the two thousand sixteen election casting doubt on election outcomes if you don't have as a as we don't in in in that it's Thirteen states at least in in some polling places and

Ira Flatow Mac in December of twenty Fifteen\nHundred Ninety five of the world's nations took their first steps down a long on a clear road to addressing climate change in signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote well below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point\nThe agreement to ask countries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius\nBut how much does half a degree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change VIP see see this week cash shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years\nIs Dr Kelly da Vinci is senior associate with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much great to be with you\nI Want to send out a shout out to our listeners began with this question as we barrel toward a one and a half degree increase in global temperature oh your worries are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to forty two five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at science friday I'm so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nBut even a one point five degree increase is gonna bring some pretty big change\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right so the Paris Agreement actually has these two goals as you said\nTo limit warming well below two degrees and pursue efforts for one point five degrees Celsius of warming and that was because for some of the most vulnerable countries you can think of that small island developing states on one point five degrees Celsius is also going to harm wellbeing to a tremendous extent [noise]\nSo what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder is it to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\nOn and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nIn ... for example\nFor example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found I for example for extreme heat\nThe percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming on at least once every five years it's two and a half times worse with two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer and when you don't have any ice on on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and while that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted our species losses on two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects and I almost forty percent worse or under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the ... in the Arctic\nI said these are some really big numbers one of the most devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs where the report found that under one point five degrees\nNeed to Ninety percent of the further decline in coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent I which is just tremendous\nYou know does it look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the back to orange or a degree [noise]\nSo what the report finds is that both um two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen\nUm to make that transition happened on right now on emissions are roughly fifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide\nPer year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and decriminalization rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand\nIncreasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nOn a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them do we need\nTo know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can you can you answer at least who commission do what they do they use [noise]\nSure so on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being\nUm reviewed publicly reviewed and I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assess all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says I'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case on there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon in Korea\nUm about a week ago and that all of the government signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators come make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policy makers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report\n[noise] ah we have a lot of people want to talk about what I'm going to go to the phones to Janice in South Carolina Janice\n[noise] yes hello so so I'm an agriculture and I think what\nEnds up confusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it what really hurts us in our culture is the high temperature is at record highs so for example in the Midwest is corn\nGets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to jail or in the Central Valley of California wouldn't tomatoes\nWhen the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen and so this is really critical of the er the highs not just the average temperatures\nAnd fixes by growing more plants that's with the little ice age was about\nThe north American force grew back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the out to the atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had a little ice age and I wish more the scientist will talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel ...\nOther things like that that will instill make us more\nPlants and we didn't have them for food and fuel I buy you are you a farmer no I'm a\nResearcher actually but I have a small farm and on the developer energy super which makes food for food feed them fuel all of the same maker and it uses little water and nitrogen you know and everybody thinks we're going to have some you know puts the two of them for what all the planets will pick it up as we switched to the renewables using plants\nBurnt let me go to come and thanks for your call what about the ...
