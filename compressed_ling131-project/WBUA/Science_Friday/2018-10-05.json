capital backed and thank you thank you well as we continue\nTo follow everything with Brett Kavanaugh at the U.S Capitol today a number of Senate races\nAre in the balance with four weeks or so to go until election day let's get to our Senate tracker series this week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon host and senior producer at Nevada public radio Hi Joe\nHey how you doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen or a relative newcomer to politics compared to hell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else should we know better\nOh just a quick uh bio she's sixty one she's the mother of a college aged daughter her husband's a radiologist she lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college\nShe was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree\nA programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise when former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she won and twenty sixteen meeting Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid represented the state of did that it lets us into one of the ads from Jacky Rosen that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable gum be type things you see outside a car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller\nCalling senators buying less because Dean Heller beds with the political when first promising to vote against the land to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt in Nevada Dean Heller from Nevada is a no\nYou're right now I Can't support legislation to ensure that we should go but\nThen Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders\nFrom President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about you were there but they're going to be held her focus\nPromise and voted for repeal the deciding vote just or how\nHow big of an issue is that flip by Dean Heller\nIt's a pretty big issue in those ads have\nSeemed to be making I'm quite a mark here you know that this was the vote about a year ago maybe a little bit more Heller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd then he changed his tune and ... it was such a huge change the Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you probably ought to tell people why\nIt just for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or any other issue\nOr what about Dean Heller um here's one of his ads\nLike I don't have time for politicians talk but don't deliver telling me what\nYou're going to see it was just doing\nDean Heller and get things done forty pieces of legislation to help our veterans parties with apple\nDelivered to the actual Dean Heller is our ... our\nOur boys\nInteresting to note that all the people speaking of that ad or women\nYeah that really really stand out look I I don't trust falls but by the late a CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen\nMy fourteenth points over Heller fifty two to thirty percent that's a huge drop from the summer when ... was at about fifty percent with women\nWhat else do we know about ... other than the fact that he sort of straddling between supporting his party and you know voting against his party occasionally\nYeah now that's really the kind of become a central issue although he ... until this race he was a modest not quite a centrist much just sort of you know he would always vote unreliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um\nThis is the nuclear waste site in Nevada\nYeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste or for the country\nOr the health care issue he seemed you know reliably sort of in the middle it's sort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire a got involved he's been called a peacemaker by the New York times he he called ... and and said you know I don't oppose Trump on this\nUm that's what the hell are seem to change his vote and um they Adelson intern and have a given to his campaign war chest\nIs Adelson a huge player still in Nevada politics\nHuge huge player he's worth tens of billions of dollars maybe the most maybe the richest man in the world um yeah he's front and center you need him on\nYour side in order to hold office there\nYou'll just this will be the ... election to see if that is this is the case\nOr any sense of how the cat or a nomination fight is playing with voters in Nevada\n... said that sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh was a checkup it did explode across the social media landscape here um\nAnd and of course that CNN poll I just talked about showed a huge drop with women supporters for Heller but I haven't seen a poll asking a direct question of how women feel about Heller in the aftermath of the Kavanaugh hearings\nWhat would you say is the biggest issue for voters in Nevada this November\nThis election is I think it's not the heart and soul of Nevada I Do think President Trump will be on the minds of voters Democrats or Republicans everything when they go to the polls because through his words his tweets his actions he has made politics about values", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "05"}
