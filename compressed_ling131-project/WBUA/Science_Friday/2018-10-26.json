NPR's lead politics editor hide him and go hey they're so obviously we're going to be keeping close track of this story and learning more about who the suspect is who has been arrested what we know for sure though is just how divisive these crimes have become in American politics and I wonder if you can tell us why [noise] well\nI you know I mean the polarization that has been at an all time high for quite some time uh you know you look back at a couple of different arrows and American history maybe the Nineteen sixties and the civil war I come a closest or worse than than today but there's not much in between\nUh and you know President Trump let's be Frank has been somebody who has\nCreated the sense that the press is the enemy of the people he continues to say fake news at his rallies and a point the finger at the pen that we're all kept in at the rallies or behind the riser is I was at a rally in Houston people were very nice to me going in\nA happy to take my question a lovely people to chat with and talked to by the end and through the middle of as a crescendo of just anti a media stuff so that is what comes to be seen and President Trump has been somebody who has been a take no prisoners\nYou know I'm kind of politician for anybody who\nDisagrees with him but the medical the president's started this week by calling for unity and then he's come to this place of that you're describing now and I want to hear from a White House press secretary Sarah Sanders who was speaking on Thursday\nOr if the price of that I could not have been more presidential yesterday when he spoke directly to the ...\nViolence let's not get lost in who is responsible for this heinous act it is the person who made and that the suspicious packages let's not forget that that is ultimately the person that is responsible and will be held responsible by this administration now clearly\nThe president thinks he's being unfairly linked to the person who did this but why hasn't he been able to stick to that message of unity that he started this with\nI mean it's pretty typical pattern of President Trump's I mean this is somebody who anytime he has criticized or become the sort of a focus of criticism\nThen he doubled down he trickles down he digs that uh you know that trench and is going to fight for every inch and you know to some respects but Sarah Sanders that is true or the people the person who committed this act um is going to be held responsible\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm ...\nI'm Peter O'Dowd and we're waiting for a news conference from the Justice Department just a few minutes from now will be learning new details in our top story today one person\nIs in custody in South Florida in connection with a series of suspicious packages meal to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump let's bring in Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent Carrie or tell us about this man who is in custody now in Florida\nNPR's identifying him as Caesar ... fifty six years old from South Miami as you said and his background includes a long wrap sheet a number of charges for related to drugs and fast\nAnd also charge in two thousand two for a threatening to throw place project or discharge an explosive device he also has a bankruptcy in his past and we also know he's a registered Republican\nYou said that he has a district lung criminal record and the police were aware of him would do we know what led them to him at this point in this investigation\nWe are going to wait to hear from the Justice Department the FBI the postal inspectors in others about what exactly are led authorities to have this man's so quickly this is a remarkably swift investigation as President Trump has already said this morning\nWe do know that a number of devices were not exploded so they were in ... in essence a mother load of evidence for the FBI lab in Quantico the FBI lab has been looking at whether there was any DNA are fingerprints on those devices we don't yet know whether this suspect may have left those traces which led authorities to him so quickly\nCan you talk about the fact that these bombs did not explode a was one of the big question leading up to this arrest was it on purpose that the suspect with ... you know just a bad bomb maker or was it um you know something else I'm sure that something investigators will be tracking\nNow authorities are likely to shed a little more light on that at the news conference I suspect but it's important to note that um as of yesterday the NYPD and federal authorities were advising anyone who came across such a suspicious package one of those manila envelopes\nTo treat it as if it were dangerous and to not touch it and not handle it call histories and at the local level are called the FBI so it's not yet clear to me whether this person or if he is in fact the uh the bomber\nOr wanting to hurt somebody and just didn't know how or whether there was some other uh issue at play in his making these devices\nAre once again we're talking to you I NPR's Carrie Johnson and waiting for federal officials at the department of justice to\nGive a news conference on the latest on the investigation into the male bombings and it's happening at the bottom of the hour carry a the ... do they expect that they're going to be making anymore do they have an idea of the men they arrested today was acting as as a lone wolf\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions yesterday said that he is I'm expecting to bring to justice any and all people involved in this right now we know that Cesar ... the only person in federal custody I think it's the ... are going to be looking for a while yet to see if he had any help\nAny assistance whatsoever we don't yet know the answer to that question\nWhat about the white van we saw pictures of it on the TV all morning long do we know that it belongs to the suspect because of course there were images\nOf the presidents are also you know stickers bashing CNN visible in the window I mean it's very early in his investigation but do we know anything about why investigators a came and got to that than\nWe do know that Cesar ... was taken into custody in or near in auto zone business and that shortly thereafter people with FBI jackets and other law enforcement\nWere seen securing this white van and transporting it up possibly to evaluate it for ... century purposes or other purposes authorities have not on the record get connected that van ...\nIs there any notion at this point as to whether or not he was considered armed or dangerous at the time or any uh arms apprehended\nOut we don't yet know the answer to that question\nManhunt underway for this individual that involve federal and local authorities across multiple states and we do know he is in custody now we have no reports of any law enforcement officers injured or hurt in any way in connection with that at ranch\nOkay Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent stay put if you will were awaiting this press conference from\nThe Justice Department of but for now let's turn to the political side of this of course it's a major part of the story a Republican strategist Alison Stewart is with us now ALS welcome to you thank you Peter great to be here and we also have democratic strategist and hosts\nThat he'll TV Jamal Simmons a speaker or ... or ALS want to start with you know have a suspect in custody ... what are your thoughts going into this it has been a very\nPolitically fraught past couple of days\nAnd it has been and it's been a very tense time and of course we can all say our our greatest gratitude and thanks to the FBI and law enforcement and those who put their their lives on the line to to make this apprehension so swift and\nI bring bring about a a sense of calm and and of course look we're in a very politically charged climate and it's a very uh an intense time in in our politics I\nI think if we're looking at this through the the political lens ... we have to give some credit to the president this afternoon who who did say that this is a time for Americans to unify\nAnd while we don't know the cause of this or the motive of of this is a ... this is a time to bring the nation together and the president was was wise to say than anyone involved in this will be brought to justice in the face the full extent of the law\nAnd to rightly claimed in called this they despicable a despicable act of political violence and it's time to\nHave peace in the United states\n... I'm Sorry I interrupted you do want to bring you into this conversation do you think the president can do that can unify the country right now\nI really want him to do I really want him to try um I have been support it so far that every time he is spoken out on the she'd give words that are about Seventy five percent like ... and then ... minutes or hours later each other's desert sweet something\nThat was to blame on the victims like the media\nOr you know tries to lessen the some some way to make light of it in some way and I think the president um his job right now it's not but it also increased job is to bring people together I Would love to see the president\nDo something but maybe it called President Obama may be called President Clinton and offered his is health and and and made sure that the FBI all the other\nSources or look at their disposal they were protected it you know and make sure the attorney general Jeff Sessions all ages older to make sure he was going to be okay this is the moment we're supposed to reach out and not just with words but also with the actions well that's what\nThe president has has not apparently reached out to any of those do home the on the the male bombings their bombs were addressed\nUm but I Wonder Alice if you could tell us about the suspect we don't know a lot about him but if you were to believe the pro Trump ... stickers on the windows of his van he is apparently a Trump supporter so how would you as a Republican strategist Alice advise leaders of the party to address\nIt more than anything it's important that we not jump to conclusions and not speculate prematurely what his motives were but as you say looking at that van with a lot of the the photographs you saw\nAnd there was also that sticker on there with mention of CNN and it was not in a favorable term\nAnd I am a contributor CNN I met that building where this about what happened the other day or at least once a week and it it's frightening but I think from a Republican standpoint we need to send a message\nThat a while we can disagree politically we need to do so in a non violent way and we need to do so in a calm way and uh the best way to show if you're disappointed with the way things are in this country is to go vote and let your emotions\nBe heard at the ballot box and I think it needs to be consistent and I will say\nThat in my view the call to end the race to the bottom starts at the top and it needs to be a farm in a consistent message and as Jamal said it needs to not be Justin word but also an action\nWe were in your saying starting at the top meeting with the president a gel absolutely how do you think Democrats should deal with it\n[noise] well I think Democrats would be the same light it isn't a time to play all the things I oh why disagree with the rhetoric that the president has been using so last year and a half a couple of years regards the media locker opting all the chance all the things that we don't look all through the mall I disagree with those I'm\nWilling to say maybe he didn't know\nWords maybe even if you did you never thought anybody would take\nActions upon those words I don't blame the president for the actions that have occurred but after those actions occurred the president now knows those words have impact now we can judge him was full knowledge how he ... what he does next and we're so far\nI'm just sort of get back at the other side is there is some sort of political motive which of course we don't know exactly the details yet so I I think that's such a publicly the big I'm a motivation there\nOkay hang hang with us if you can and justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department just remind us who is uh that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a line up we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general of the United states Jeff Sessions the FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and that's important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI's New York field office has been particularly active we have a\nWe have an official from the FBI is New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill\nA we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service and somebody from the Capitol police as well so this is a murders row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact I have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time on stage at the Justice Department\nAnswer unanswered questions did he have any help\nDid he have any help and are there other devices out there as we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom Steyer a prolific democratic donor has confirmed\nThat he was addressed such a package and there may be other such devices out there we've got to find that out a law enforcement desperately is going to be hunting for those things because they fear they're dangerous even if they don't go offer detonate\nUm they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there they also want to find out whether this man had any help\nAnd what he was planning next if anything as for motives it's not clear right now there is a social media account that's been linked to the suspect fifty six year old Cesar ... from South Florida\nIn that Twitter account he has gone off after prominent Democrats including some of whom have who have been an address the use of these suspicious packages and that's one hint as to his motive but of course law enforcement is going to be digging ever deeper for more evidence and more information\nThat's NPR's Carrie Johnson I'm ... and just to to reset for the audience where we stand now authorities arrested a South Florida man this morning in connection with a wave of suspicious packages addressed this week to political critics of President Trump law enforcement has confirmed that that man is Caesar say fifty six years old as an address in Davey Florida\nAnd has a criminal record also has some ties to New York\nUh the arrest followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and Carrie Johnson you just mentioned that a democratic fundraiser Tom Sawyer has said that he was the recipient of or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages did he issue a statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah through spokesman he said I'm ... it's confirmed that a suspicious package mail to Tom Sawyer was intercepted had a male facility in California he says\nWe're thankful every one we work with is safe and sound that's our first priority but he says were seen as systematic attack on our democracy and the rule of law that extends much further than one isolated incident in Florida\nAnd he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild\nA democracy for each and every American I'm trying to find some unity ah during this very a dark period where many prominent Democrats have and that that ah recipients are intended recipient of these suspicious devices over the last few days right I'm\nJust thinking that if you are a prominent critic of the president and you have not yet been targeted but perhaps you could be because of positions\nThat you've taken and again we don't know fully know the motivation but this so far though the people who've gotten these packages haven't critics of the president I'm curious if you have you been hearing from people who who are concerned that they could be next to that they're taking precautions in case they are\nI have been hearing from people former officials in the federal government and the Obama administration\nWho are trying to be more mindful of how they handle mail where they open mail and I'm being basically on the lookout for one of these suspicious looking a yellow mental envelopes with patenting that we've seen on the news for the last two days of course on some of the targets\nA were intended recipients of of these devices are really well known the attorney former attorney general Eric Holder\nThe former CIA director John Brennan this morning in New York another package was intercepted intended for the former director of national intelligence Jim Clapper and another one this morning in Florida intended for New Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker the list just kept growing\nMe that were done yet without have all those packages for all those people that you just mentioned where they all ... exactly the same so that you would continue to know what to look for a ... in in the mail string\nAh for the vast majority of those packages the FBI or local police are both have confirmed that these were similar looking packages that you have seen\nNPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson I Wonder if we can bring back in a loop William Hunter former FBI special agent to the teachers in the criminal Justice Department Radford University in Virginia a new country there yeah I'm here yes\nSo you've seen on TV a lot of CNN had described as as Kerry just did what the packages of looked like\nIt at what point or if there are packages that are are more and more packages to come at what point um can you identify those is coming from either this suspect or somebody connected with the suspect or maybe some buddy who's a a copycat as often happens in cases like these\nYeah yeah it's it's extremely difficult I mean you know it's obviously a easy to get some of these materials that that it's a lot of materials or are they common and so it's really going to take a a a close\nLook by law enforcement to confirm whether or not it is I'm the same suspect over copycat 'em so\nYou know we're talking about um review of ... the FBI a lab back in the field office looking at the actual forensics so it's not going to be an easy call a quick\nCall until it's actually you've had a a thorough look at these things\nAt what point will you feel that the threat is over\nThere the threat is over yeah that's\nThat's a great question I mean I I think as a as a couple of games so first there's got to a charity destruction so um if he's willing to talk and that's a that's a big gift um you know you can have a sense of of house for ...\n... you know what his lowly age what else is out there the other thing is just physical evidence and the electronic average is you get in and with a search warrant and you're able to take a look at is I'm a computer his phone records\nThat lake give you a really good sense of what all he's done I mean there may be just a ton of evidence at his house or this call business and that's going to give you an idea of how extensive the lights off so I Would say within the next\nYou know twenty four hours you're going to have search orange executed you're going to have a ... a man and you should have a good idea of how far does go on with this particular suspect but then there's a whole question of\nAgain is working with someone else a tracking down any potential each other associates that made and healthy\nAnd it's ... special agent Luke really am hunch NPR's Carrie Johnson it looks like it would be like very soon\nTo the Justice Department for this press conference about the arrest that happened today just very quickly we know that there was an all white van with all sorts of political details apparently pro Trump ... spent details on the side of it do we know is for sure if this vehicle is directly tied to the stuff that he was arrested\nHere's what we do know law enforcement is proceeding on the idea that it is somehow connected to the fact that they have not said it is his definitively on the record I expect we're going to hear a lot more about that in the next two minutes or so when it's a news conference start as law enforcement decides to tell us\nWhat if anything this individual is charged with and how they know that\nAnd does he says I actually individual you're talking about a fifty six years old of daily Florida where is he right\nNow he is in federal custody or he was taken into custody in South Florida and the likelihood is that he as um everybody's are trying to find out more from him about whether he had any help whether they're additional packages out there and and any number of other questions they want to know to protect public safety\nWe have gotten a warning that this press conference with attorney general Jeff Sessions is going to be getting started with in the next few seconds I Want to say thank you dilute William ... former FBI special agent thanks very much for your incite pleasure good to\nBe here and Republican strategist Alice Stewart's hum we uh we want to thank you to please hang tight because we do expect to hear from attorney general Jeff Sessions in just a moment\n[noise] thank\nYou all for being here over the past week more than a dozen suspicious packages have been sent to through the United states\nPostal service through a
