a call late for for seven to for eight to five five where you can tweet us ... fry phone eight for for seven to for eight to five five or tweet at scifri ...\nBut first last week's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change gave us a sobering look at what a world worn by two degrees Celsius might look like\nThen on the heels of that report Exxon Mobil announced that it was throwing financial support behind the U.S carbon tax it's a big step for one of the world's largest oil companies which last year was sued by its own employees for misleading statements about the environmental and financial impact of fossil fuels\nAnd has a history of denying the climate science settled\nHere with the story as well as other short subjects in science is on there are finding a staff writer for vox mayor welcome back to science friday\nThanks for having me again so Exxon says it's going to back us carbon tax on a surface that sounds like a good thing but what exactly are they proposing\nThey're proposing to back a lobbying effort launched by conservative former secretaries of state George Schultz and James Baker\nThis is a group called the climate leadership council and it proposes starting with a forty dollars per ton price on carbon dioxide emissions and that price would rise over time then they would use that money to go back to people like you and me essentially in the form of a dividend or rebate and the estimated it would start at about two thousand dollars a year for a family of four\nThere is a catch though and Exxon wants ... ... a roll back some other environmental regulations and one big catches that they want immunity from climate change related lawsuit that want damages for these companies it's the same deal that the the gun producers have [noise]\nYeah pretty much it's kind of analogous to what they got and it's what I'm other industries have also tried to get\nShould ship with climate change it its spin ahead of the industry in acknowledging it's a problem\nThey've had researchers who helped to author the PCC report and yet they are also being sued for misleading people about the impact of fossil fuels years ago and in two thousand they took out ads in newspapers saying that the science was not settled I mean should we be taking this seriously or is it just another\nYou know and make us look good sort of thing\nThat's always the question isn't it I mean the thing to remember what Exxon is that they are an investor owned company so they do have to answer to their shareholders and they've been getting a lot of pressure in shareholder meetings to better address climate change also climate change poses a business rest for them um in terms of their facilities and\nIf they aren't out ahead on that they might get slapped with a carbon policy that they don't like that doesn't actually work in their favor and another way a carbon tax might actually benefit them is that it would target the dirtier fuels first

rearrange the you know these free range pigs come from has raised with speech to Rome and forced to learn more they'll usually range dot com [noise]\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of C sections happening all over the world listen to this to worldwide rate\nHas nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three brothers used by C section now\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind this uptick what are the effect on mothers in babies and what did you ... can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section raped globally\nAlso what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nYou can tweet us ... fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy's an author author on that a Lancet series he's also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing\nThank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThank you tell us the Lancet series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions that must have buried around the world [noise]\nWell it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries over UC sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous on thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um\nAccess and a and a large part of it has to do with and women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first is area and so it's it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em too much too soon and too little too late so in that country's than overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure\nAnd in countries such as in Africa that um don't have enough access probably are under using at the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... about right\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having um has this area and we're way\nOver most talking about over by us there's it's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\n[noise] well I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction that that you write women who are wealthier who had insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted norm is part of the culture in in Brazil\nMhm are there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the province [noise]\nAnd again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to ... and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nOn ... is his area and is not a low risk um surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are there are small but serious risks are both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and\nWith um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states were increasing maternal mortality rate\n... you mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like in\nOne of the not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when women really needs it and I think it's important to stay in the ... there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nWant to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday or to go\nThank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um [noise] but there's also this idea of of plan C sections right the do the do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen has been your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the in the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have a delivery biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver on in our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions or a patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers needs to realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the right considering delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing\n[noise] yeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones to make a recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nUm it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\n'em the progress string labor in terms of the cervical ... is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on the brain delivery unit that might put some pressure on us to make quicker decisions to move towards delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that um patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nA highly what's your reaction to [noise]\nOh I Would completely agree with her that the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having invention of birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her\nAnd her physiology two two best achieved ... birth\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Lauren welcome to science friday [noise]\nIra thank you You're welcome good\nThough I actually had an emergency C section at thirty why leave 'em and I think for that for that [noise] um but when I got pregnant ... back in time\nI really wasn't given the option of having that overt after effects and uh I kind of had to do all of that\nI'm at the Senate ... though I had to look at me but I I had to look at a rate what were the very end mighty your pregnancy and um it really was a it was like my provider\nThat you want to have the time I was like oh I'll have to read that that is but I wasn't given that risk and benefits of those people to make a truly at it that says that um and so I think that um I was able to\nActually win that Senate rain heat and then I changed my mind at thirty six and I could I really ... them with that and I was able to how to do that but I like what a lot of it\nI really had to say okay in a lot of information very emotional and it was really hard to find that back ... when I get let me get a great great call him and get a ... a reaction\nA Tony look you know truth be told armistice should [laughter] and I'm One of three you back in the day everybody had to have one she's such an after another and learn was sort of thing you know I didn't know that maybe I didn't have to have\nThat's all you can make a mess I view dot org the loose visual arts center there might be introducing Tony ... retrospective now open for usual listen hard on him I see you\nIn this age school buses leader and gifted education from preschool to greater open house Sunday October twenty eight inspiring for young minds seeds schools auto org\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of she sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr Holly Kennedy professor of mid were free of the Yale School of nursing or to Tony ... vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line and let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get everybody let me ask you how you you worked on research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach there compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out that W World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help\nHelp us look at decreasing says Erin's and and one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have\nA collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on we very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was so saturated with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections and\nSo one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped the integration of midwifery across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice\nAnd so you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest C section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent adverse are attended by mid was in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives\nAnd then they met that with outcomes and uh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of berserk attended by mid west so that's not a causation it as an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um when you have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery knows then they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado when you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary ... um first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heart rate monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd then the last obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using science and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really try to make sure that people were using scientific\nModern definitions for progress in labor\nA old definitions were assumes that women would move much faster and labor than nowhere more modern data really prove to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAnd I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiasm for Iraq and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nMisspoke here it's a bit of Israel and I would do if you were only from so now I'm here to Austin and so there's there's so many method that to the hospital you go\nC section Ina unfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on says there and delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there an delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environments the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr we have a tweeter that's relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that your your your report\nHow it will be a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or where wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for this area and to really um level that playing field in in any in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one\nIn in time or perceived to be in time [noise]\n[noise] your your\nIssue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the u._s. ah where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery than is his area and delivery however the hospital does\nAnd that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patience um and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of\nObstetrician decision making here and the U.S on the reimbursement is greater but it really goes more toward the hospitals side because of the length of today and let's go to Sharon in Somerville Mass Hi Sarah\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were at\nMandated by the doctor due to complications through a chronic disease and so I'm I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get the perspective of how this\nIs actually playing out I'm among laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends think things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just asked if he could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that\nEnd of his questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know push the baby out ... and and that was really upsetting to me because my two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think that's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions and I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um in different directions slides I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute or Tony are only would I Would\nI Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that you have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... since the Syrian or fully ... fully discuss I'm Antonia\nWhat about this ... who charge of sexism\nTheir point well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how a baby is born\nI'm the person who gets birth to the baby becomes the parents uh after that happens I'm it's no less are no more regardless of what the motive delivery ... delivery on certainly makes you just as much as the mother on as having a vegetable delivery\nRewards and probably Kennedy professor ...
