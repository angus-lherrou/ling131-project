a lot of language that requires time it requires patients\nKendall Phillips is a professor of rhetorical studies at Syracuse University in upstate New York\nIt's also hard to analyze the argument or reasoning of a treat to two hundred eighty characters is not a way for me to lay out a logical argument with a major premise a minor permits to the conclusion it's much easier to just use a two word phrase were hash tag that usually ends up adding to that kind of political division between my side and their side\nTo more and more we have to learn to be critical consumers are the messages around

frustrating when people are reading things that are kind of your swayed that you're like no really read between the light and see what they are saying and I think when you don't really understand the
