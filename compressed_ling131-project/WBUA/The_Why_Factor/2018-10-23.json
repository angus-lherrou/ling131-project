Comstock knows women\nWe know for example that it takes a woman on average who has an auto immune condition five years and five different doctors to get an accurate diagnosis a so there's a dearth of research\nWomen have largely also been even excluded from pharmaceutical research so even knowing how medications work we often don't know how these are working in women\nAlso of even argues that there are a few financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies to do expensive research into food that people can simply pick up from the local green grocer\nAnd women are having it anymore and as women are not finding what they're looking for in the conventional medical model they are taking back their health if you will by taking more responsibility for themselves so many women are looking to things like\nNutrition changing their diets what supplements might be helpful what botanical medicines they can use what are some of the mind body connection that they can explore through therapy or body work or how do we incorporate meditation and yoga\nStacked food and medicine hush tack gluten free hash tag seafood\nThis idea of healing yourself using food was attractive to Maxine Ali\n... Instagram post me will probably be a bowl of maybe a smoothie greens movie\nShe goes so into it that she became a wellness program taking care to post everything she at on Instagram\nMight be some sort of seafood sprinkle on TALK maybe some edible flower [laughter]\nAnd then you'd have this caption which is describing how wonderful your morning was because he had this movie an oily amazing benefits so that you might list out all the different ... what they do you like it's a great for your immune system\nIs great for energy I feel so revitalized I often eating this and that was the kind of full amount of wellness Instagram post\nShe was inspired by an Internet celebrity I came across the purse by a really well known wellness blogger and she in particular had talked about how she used her diet to cheer itself of a chronic illness\nI spoke to Maxine who was also suffering due to a chronic illness\nSo also just ... is a digestive disorder to read your energy of the tea to all the time you call rainy thing oh\nI'd reached a point with my health or I didn't feel like the medical institution could offer me much because the medical institution treats health very much on an acute basis as ... you have a\nAn illness you get a diagnosis you get treated and then you go on your way but when you go to chronic illness like also to collect is there's no treatment models for that there's no long term plan it's just if you have a flare up here is symbol medication and then we wait until the next ... to me I didn't feel like\nThat was ever going to walk me and so I tended to kind of distance myself from\nFrom Maxine she lived to food I'm had died to questions which stokes who couldn't I started seeing for you to very much and the key to\nHealing that so I cut out bleeding Garry refined sugar and meet each fish all about it was all very much plump based foods will this change in diet health thing\nI think to an extent it was all very much psychological I've told you everything about why wasn't each chain stores it didn't leave a whole lot to be eating so I was incredibly nutrient deficient so I lost my period for three and a half years\nI'm new to the diet due to the dye yeah and what you're describing sounds quite dangerous thing absolutely it's definitely dangerous\nOf viva believes that things have to change to\nProvide the best medicine and the best safety for women we really have to start understanding why first of all women are so disenfranchised you know this is not being seen not being heard not being taken seriously being dismissed being insulted being disregarded and these are all\nDocumented phenomenon in the medical literature about this medical biased against women\nBut also start to look at some of the therapies that women really want to have as part of their care and start to do more and better research on those\n\nIt's a strange paradox [noise] so many women are flocking to these practices which was dismissed and seen as not being violent [noise] and yet some of these women seek out wellness off to having their own pain and illnesses dismissed by the medical establishment in the first place [noise]\nIn some ways I find it inspiring the women are taking things into their own ... instead of giving up a bean seeking the healing they need\nAnd yet this can leave women vulnerable to practices which may not necessarily help that much often\nAbout maybe the power of wellness the women is less about whether a practice will die it works or not\nWomen want to look out for themselves in a holistic way day in day out rather than just hung up to adulthood when there's an emergency [noise]\nDoesn't take much himself with in this level of self cat\nMaybe the biggest benefit women get out of wellness is it an allows them to be in control of their own ... and ...
