like to be drawing in that mystery\nWhat I'd like myself as being uh taken up to the typical pessimist we have the technology already which could allow a better life to the seven billion people on this planet and we have potential much better technology to provide much more food\nBut she the energy et cetera by the middle of the century which of course is a big gap between the way the world

climate panel that went nearly red alert this week has issued general warnings for most it's thirty year history I guess I Do not John was the lead author of two earlier assessments\nHe wrote the stuff that amounted to the Nobel Peace prize and won the prize in two thousand seven ... is now dean of Boston University's school of global studies welcome back for his ... what's the lesson of your\nLong history in this game and what ... what does what are the insiders inside line on this report I\nThink it's an important report but it's not surprising report in the surprise is how we keep getting surprised about the same thing again and again and again I don't think it's a more frightening report in previous months a as you're interested we've been sleeping\nSo we haven't been hitting what the BCC has been saying we haven't been hitting ... nature has been telling us all around us not just in Florida\nAnd ... all over Europe\nAnd uh so so in in some ways you know uh it's it's like you did seem to think it should be to the game and again and again\nWhat what's new in these cascading feedback loops for example\nSo I I think what's new here is this one point five degree sort of which has become the new ah a scare a dog get that off the ... world is going to somehow become a is reverse simply different my point is that the world is already is what should be different\nThat for hundreds of millions of people in the world the Buddhist people what some of the ... the word climate change is not something you talk about the future that's\nHe's famous changes something that is here that is happening that is happening now and my um issue but the report if any is that it's maybe not fighting enough it's it's trying to fight in the future\nWithout really fully telling us about the president I can see why they're doing it because\nThey want to spoil or other mostly you and meet people who people who are affluent into action and this is one more tempted saying he'll guard please do something and do it now I think that's the that's a good message\nBut there's another message and the messages that climate change is happening now it's happening in ... it's happening in Pakistan it's happening in Haiti it's happening in malicious it's happening\nIn in in ... too and it's happening and this is the key point it is happening mostly not most is happening with grievous consequences in places which had the ... to do with causing the problem\nSo those who had nice to do with making the mess\nOn at the front forefront of having to deal with that that is why I think climate is a justice issue in this report as well as previous IPC seat reports I don't think I've done justice to climate as a justice of ...\nYou know we can get ahead or in so many aspects would stick with justice what are the one of the blocks you know understanding or just our humanity don't see that as as as the eye of the store and say how many other\nI think it does the humanity um that is at best here I think it just hit has not science and I mean I can see that keeps coming up in ... I'm a fan of like BCC every part of it but this is no longer the question of science the big tank is big challenges knocked\nWhether we have enough science or not the big challenges whether we have enough action or not and why is that not happening that just eat a question of our humanity as you portrait I eat a ... it takes in ... as a species are fully evolved to look at ourselves and I said why religious speeches and I'm not sure we are\nAnd the second thing is I think this is David enough technology there's enough science there's enough knowledge for us to make a difference I Am not convinced any more but there is enough visited them in our species\nDo act in time and to act for the benefit of the entire species if I can say something other harsh or your\n... all of us who saved the climate change sheet asleep do not actually did get to see just leave enough\nBecause we've all figured out that we probably will shrimp it's kind of like a border that was\nThat was about to go down we all talked we go down with it and now suddenly realize oh maybe not maybe some of us will make it to the outside and at that point your challenges are you going to lend a hand to those who will go down and the fact of the matter is we have not been doing that\nYou know politicians take a lot of heat and they should for being unwilling to risk their jobs but I mean every one of us I think is is is afraid of doing something serious would risk our own jobs\nSo yes oh yes I I think that is we we have kind of made made the bat that somehow the guards of technology and the guards of the free market ... village somehow find a solution and time\nFor us to be saved and maybe the right but the problem is that not all of us and we'll be saved and as I said it is those who had released to do with causing the mess that are having to face the consequences\nThere are limits here on our humanity and shame on us but there's also years and years along like butter conditioning\nWe're told over and over again that it's it's great to be rich anybody can strive for it ... degrees a mechanism mechanization but of privilege of leisure of fun that we are defined as human would be very hard to get up at this point [laughter]\nYes and frankly you know when I see that you know it's a it's a question of justice here's here's the thing\nOf fighters nature target deport what does nature to have to ... what does nature have against the Buddhist people in the woods and the fact of the matter is that if you are for you will end up living in the most ... places\nAnd if you are the Buddhist living in the most ... places you it is most likely that you do not have the ability to deal with those disasters ... so the disaster comes to Florida and the disaster comes to Karachi Mumbai\nBut if you are on the edge in Mumbai you're much less likely to have the resources to deal with it and and the point I'm making about you know this is no longer the future to issue with this this report and we just talk about climate as if it's something fought in the distance or maybe not that far in the distance but still something in the future\nBut to cross the world it is not a future to look at the heat waves going around ... ... a look at flights my country Pakistan this now for the last six seven years\nIt continuous floods every year there's a flooded with a number of deaths at the same time that our drugs at the same time there are a heat wave sticking more lives in Karachi this summer at that time more people died in the heat wave\nThen through terrorism in the diet ... right right and this is a violent place anyhow so the point I'm making is that nature of this telling us that the normal than you know automobile is the climactic change not model\nFor a lot of places and who's paying the price is the Buddhist the those who are least able\nTo do something about this those who were released responsible for causing the mess\nAnd we still talk down through the poor and the great minds of the west including that one of them and might raise are going to tell the world or how to how to deal with the problem that we in the ... so many\nStudents are we we made ourselves coming and going west produced the industrial revolution that created the problem and divided the world\nAnd still somehow we expect that those geniuses although I Love how I'm going to solve this problem I think I Want to I maybe you can tell us oh what do the late ... foot print people the world in in Texas the hunted Africa in China um has to offer this conversation that we're not hearing\nI Do do do they do have to offer an idea of an ideal\nOf life that is not as driven by the ideal of growth as a marvelous but here's the thing that we should also be concerned about the light footprint people as you as you put that I've seen the same word you and I are\nAnd they're saying that these heavy for ... ... ... ... people are taking too many resources away from me and maybe I Need to be in the same place and so what ... Martin Greece was exactly right on his you cannot you can not\nWhy the finger to the Buddhist people of the world and say why do you want to drive a car and why do you want to use the French\nAnd I if we are not able to change our lifestyle we cannot uh Atta didn't sleep 'til the poorest of the world you know if you used to being\nSave the planet for our future generation that cannot work and it's evident that it is not what can\nYou imagine I Want you to review your own history in this in this battle or you go back to real Nineteen Ninety to President George W. Bush wanted his better weekends\n\nI'm Christopher lead and this is open source in the ever energetic and plus one magazine on line one article yesterday jumped out from all the commentary we've seen climate and the un report\nIt said among other things when it comes to the centrist ... not ... which is the Tribune or response to global warming generally the automotive is not the ... is wearing new clothes it said his whole suit is on fire\n... Singh ... wrote the piece and joins us by phone using executive director of the Brooklyn Institute\nFor social research his book in progress on politics and the ... of these and through the scene the manmade Iran edgy look I'm I'm a drinking problem maker is where you said in that article is the goal of containing heat rise is on its face impossible\nPresident Trump says the same but he's not bothered by explaining that\nUm well it's not that it's not\nPossible um it's that the ... like doing it with in the systems that we have right so\nI'm the most frequently gesture to is the you know Paris climate accord um which are sort of a contradictory in and out themselves um they want to achieve this uh these stated targets of you know less than one point five and ... and probably you know\nTalking out around too but they want to do it with our existing social economic and political systems and I'm actually a lot of what I'm Talking to Jon just as a ... I Would just agree with so much of it\nUm I Would spin it ever since it differently though and I emphasize some different things\nWhich is that there's a word that it seems to be missing 'em from these conversations which is capitalism um it's not that humanity is in fact doing all these things\nI'm humanity doesn't stand in a way of um some of the mitigation at an adaptation efforts that could be done um it's that we have a socio economic system that is predicated on the kind of extractive um fuel sources and general extractive regimes right whether we're talking about social systems\nUm economic systems and of course a fossil fuels and planetary boundaries that keep it going in the way that we know it\nUsed to be good in your article is high carbon economic growth in profits to cross a and I wonder if I'm hearing your definition of capitalism in the modern world\n[laughter] I mean it it's funny\nI'm In that same article I get into this question of of definitions to sort of obliquely at the end um because like the truth is there's a lot of things we can do and I listen to a whole host of them the article um\nAnd and the\nThere's a lot of things we can do and whether or not what happens on the other side of that and I I tend to agree absolutely with Dr and John but he was saying that the problem is not the future I cannot shots that enough um that that we are living through that\nYou know right now um and there's a lot that we can do and whether what what comes out of that land what sort of springs sport is capitalism we want to call it something else post capitalism is it real like socialism like God Knows um but it is so dramatically different\nThan the socio economic order we have now and it's\nAnd it's fundamental to understand and so and that's why it's so hard to hear and and I think for many people\nUm people who who you know do you propose these sort of small bore reforms whether it be you know like having a cap and trade system using market incentives when in fact we knew we need broad have a political transformation um\nAnd the other thing I Would emphasize is uh I you know ... ... talking to Tom was correct in saying that you know this will hit 'em hardest areas that have a ...\nThat have contributed to lease on but that's not just sort of an iron right it's a he said it's not nature targeting people um the truth is the same system that whole that\nThat I'm Dr such extraordinary inequality in our world and such extraordinary I'm\nIn balance of power between global north in global south also drive and support and are necessary for the maintenance of capitalism as we know it does if we're going to have in mind that change seriously we have to take capitalism seriously\nYou're talking about the world the capitalism created in some sense but come back to the Trump Christian New York times you don't believe that he's not responded to this and they think he's stupid and he doesn't get it but you point out this is very phone scores on this problem\nEstimated that by the end of the century the\nFour degrees centigrade and there's a way I Want you to explain it in which he has incorporated this into his\nThinking about the world you call it and he might do right wing climate realism unpack that\nSure happy to um\nYou know I Do think that there's off in a way in which we talk about these conversations again as if everyone like the world is going to end right it's the apocalypse like um everyone's going to die so this is that we're all gonna die right foot quote from Douglas Adams on but the truth is actually a\nThere are a lot of people that blow\nA and leek and it's sort of very easily or imagined in our minds but then the demographics um the wealth levels on the placement\nOf the people that are actually going to do pretty well through this area and um and I do sort of think there is an eighth and you know whether a Trump actually believe it or not God Knows I'm not going to speculate about what he actually believes are not um but I Do think there was something in that um\n[noise] in that study that was fascinating 'cause they were basically saying they were leaving that denialism behind oh there's no such thing a with a Chinese has a and yelling instead with yup\nIt's going to happen and it's too late and there's nothing to do about it on and what's so fascinating to me there\nIs one that isn't on a statement or at least partially right they're saying the things that they were trying to overturn the fuel efficiency standards and the truth is like just a couple of fuel efficiency standards that they are right that's not going to turn\nThat's not going to turn the tide on the air right when they say business as usual and I have the natural scientific literature often says I'm a ... or degree or more increase like do not think if you change now saying that that's what's gonna happen on those things are true and\nI think that sets up something that um again is sort of missing from this conversation which is that it's a political conflict um you know\nIt's strange because yeah ... ... ... rising um\nCrisis is not going to be good for ... days may be good for his ten best friends they have their opinions they have their mountaintops they have their\nTheir um you know martial law goes\nThat's going to be pretty soggy for the first five floors I Want to sort of do you um have you with us capitalism in your view figure among the obstacles burgers here or the owners of the problem\nI I think uh the beliefs that come with the more loose that we have on a major part of the problem in the sense that it is this belief in the gospel of growth [noise]\nUh and of continues to grow up in the plan is that is a really serious liberals not inflict\nA and and and everyone's growth rate that's that's the thing that everyone has to constantly grew at some point that's going to meet you won't won't might be time to change but different people read the more differently by my estimation it's feast a billion people in the wound up to date\n... to ... at least two billion people in the will to do live in what I call the age of ...\nThe ... in the mid ... would we have to do something to stop climate they haven't actually adopt do nightmare that has fee for them\nAnd and that means that they have to be a doozy sources and use them to adapt to this ... my only issue might wonder don't issue but my only question I think from ... who I I also agree with this\nI Am not ask for doing the climate will force us to change the more you\nKnow unfortunately I think the more stronger and more to do is to be\nAble to make sure force of habit or privilege or these because the dominance of power\nAnd and and and ... and and the because uh I don't see the video to meet the type of changes that need or\nWhat what is it political change that could work toward your dream\nTo me please uh yes and I mean shoot seriously uh I I there's a lot say trade with on\nThe uh I Do you think you can see\n'em a couple of things that could that could be hopeful for the political picture and I I Will say that\nThat ... ah it's likely these are these are I don't even know if\nI'd go fifty fifty which I think what I'm professor reached that um you know could be even worse than that on\n... for example I think there's a growing awareness of of the problems I'm In a in the global north um which I think most people have a I've noted is the sort of primary source of the problem I'm", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radio Open
