hovers as management\nIs not a natural and not the death or sinking of a community it is nothing that is that is rebellious violent anti God and anti human\nMost manifestation of all the forces opposed\nTo God I ask Chris Hedges at the outset to locate his idea of that nothing is in our world today that's\nA culture which we've created a commercial culture which orchestrate\nAlienation loneliness unhappiness a sense of inadequacy\nAnd promises us that if we invest in that culture both financially him personally which is a culture that at its core is about the cult of the self\nWe can find the happiness that they have destroyed ...\nBut of course as proof understood every time\nWe buy their experience whether just commercially or emotionally or their product it is only the starting point for new desires ...\nAnd what in biblical terms it is is a culture of a dollar tree and the writers of the Bible understood and idols demand in the beginning the sacrifice of others but in the end like luck [noise]\nThey always demand your sacrifice you your sacrificed on that alter and I think that spiritual malaise that cult of the self has created tremendous depression and unhappiness\nOffering dinner seven nights a week as well as private events summer restaurant dot com and Harvard Square is forty his annual October fest in Hong parade this Sunday noon to six details at Harvard Square dot com\nI'm Christopher lightened this was open source Chris Hedges our guest is a preacher's kid who grew up in Maine which Colgate made a name for himself covering wars all over the world to the New York times\nThen he took up the allergy in big books as a sort of sidelined and reached a personal professional breaking point resisting the Iraq War from inside his famous newspaper\nAt the cost of his job\nHe's our guest of the Cambridge forum and the first parents church in Harvard Square his new book is America the farewell tour\nYou're leaving one huge zone my favorite zone out which is George Bush and the Iraq War\nTo my mind the light in line is it that is pretty much the bone in our it's worse than the opponent throat\nAnd set the stage for where we're at an illegal immoral irrational five trillion dollar or maybe a lot more war that goes on today which the United states chose war shows torture ignited terrorism\nAnd ... and ... literally kill the country in front of our eyes corrupted the Democratic opposition including our print John Kerry\nAnd destroyed the media I mean the war began and went to its end with the cheerleading of those institutions including your friend Tom Friedman\nWe didn't have Fargo David every rocks and they're still working I mean the point is only that to see Trump he is symptomatic of all that the trail of the working class\nAt the same time he's the most I Wanna say viable person who ever tip the tables on Jeb Bush and then on the Clintons I don't want to give them any credit for it exactly but here's a question for my friend Chris Hedges [noise]\nDo you find your heart really rooting for the record is the Trump or his so to speak or you certainly to root for the establishment where where's your heart procedures\nHeart is with at this point the sixty or Seventy first\nAre being pushed towards a modern form of serfdom in the ... system\nAnd you bring up the war so and it was you know at a very contentious relationship with the New York times I'd been in the middle east bureau chief for the New York times was denouncing the war\nWas booed off of a commencement stage and of course I actually knew the middle east and knew the instrumental war unlike banker and\nAnd I was given a former written reprimand and told I was no longer be allowed to speak publicly about criticizing the war and I left the paper over that issue so when you talk about all those people who are wrong being still in power but that's misleading because\nThey may have been wrong but they played their role and the role of this was ... the role of the liberal elites is to discredit\nAnd you can read the review of this book in the New York times the Washington Post because that's exactly what they do to discredit\nThe critics on the left because they set the moral parameters and they are essentially given their place in a capital is democracy\nBecause they make sure nobody crosses those parameters nobody actually questions the system of capitalism nobody questions the intentions of going into Iraq they make concede afterwards that it didn't go quite as it should\nSo they played their role perfectly which is why they're still they're not they're all\nKnow we can't talk about leaders I mean this has come a complete misreading of what's happened in this country it's far more serious than that and I think one of the things that inform this book was the two years I spent writing a book on the Christian right\nMm because the Christian right is really the advocacy but before that let me just respond one more thing on the war so in in and you know from the book in and this is from court but late empire and McCoy\nThe historian McCoy who wrote a very good book called shadows on the American century which I recommend he writes that empires that they're beginning actually use military force very carefully and very judiciously empires at the end\nIn decline engage in catastrophic military adventure ism that fuels\nThe decline in an attempt to restore last greatness so you look at for instance the end of the scene an empire\nThey invade Sicily the entire Athenians leaders sunk most of the soldiers are killed the umpires over you look at the Suez Crisis the British Empire is in decline from the end of World War one until Nineteen fifty six Nasser nationalize the Suez Canal the British invade with a French\nAnd have to retreat and humiliation the pound sterling has dropped ... as the world's reserve currency and the British economy goes into a tailspin that's the death will coy actually gives it a day which I Would never do twenty thirty\nBut the so we have Seventeen years of warfare there is a front page story about the debt did you read the ... I read the times tonight I just read that what may soon exceed the cost of the U.S military interest on us debt\nWithin a decade more than nine hundred billion and interest payments will be do annually this is what happens\nAt the end of empire you extend yourself militarily beyond your ability\nTo sustain it financially and the cost in order to carry out this military adventure ... this is the city's ... is to just hollow out the country from the inside so cities writes\nThat the charity that Athens imposed on others and it finally imposed on itself why because the military adventure ism\nIs so costly your roads are not maintained your public libraries are school you're\nYou know the crown jewel of American democracy or is our public school system and we are watching it be destroyed ... and so as you follow the country out from the inside you use the harsher forms of control which I spent Twenty years reporting on\nOn the outer reaches of empire militarized police suspension of civil liberties wholesale surveillance\nRevoking basic rights like due process militarized drones it's all coming to a town near you\nAnd and that's how empires go down so yes the military adventure ism is important but it's just a piece\nAnd we've got to stop personalizing this issue around Trump we've got to stop thinking that the Democratic parties are going to cough up some magic candidate\nMy study of the Christian right was called American Fascists the Christian right in the war in America I was trying to reach out to them and I'm\nBill Moyers did not want me to use the word fascist and I actually when I finished the two years of reporting I sat down with Robert ... wrote anatomy of fascism and Fritz Stern who wrote the politics of cultural despairing left Germany as an Eighteen year old two of our greatest scholars on fascism and I was with them for several hours\nAnd I just threw everything I had found and I wanted them to be able to argue me out of using that word\nAnd at least to my mind they could not\nTell me what's wrong with this sort of idiot definition and sanctions and fascism the ... in a binding of genes in stands for the unification of\nWar making power police power opinion making power the electoral machinery churches media the whole thing in one to my mind God Knows what's ahead but in the this is why I go back to the Iraq War\nThat was all of those institutions bound together unanimously that was pretty bad and still\nYeah but Chris ... it was different so as bad as it was and we can't divorce the war\nFrom the re configuration of the society into a corporate oligarchy we have the largest social inequality in American history worse than the gilded age ... ... and so the war is part of a peace I mean why are we still at war in Afghanistan the Taliban controlled more territory\nIn Afghanistan and when we went in Seventeen years ago why because Northrop Grumman Raytheon Halliburton they're making a fortune\nGets propelled forward by the primacy of profit\nAt the expense of everything else why are we expanding NATO which doesn't make any sense why are we expanding NATO to the Ukraine well because and and let's not forget that Reagan had promised Gorbachev that NATO would not be expanded beyond the German borders after the unification of Germany why\nBecause it's a billion dollar industry I was just in Poland I got up the airport there's a giant billboard from racy on me because if you have to weaken figure the old Soviet Bloc military machine to make a compatible with NATO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestruction including suicide aren't epidemic but we live in a period of relative stability\nBut with a financial crash which is coming it's going to come I don't know when but it's coming and with the dropping of the dollar as the world's reserve currency that\nFinancial crisis and all of totalitarian movements rise to full fluid and out of a crisis\nBecause our movements have been destroyed our press has been quoted or democratic institutions don't work then I worry that the monsters are really come out don't you want to\nGo deeper into a sort of your last point you were making on I'm from Detroit and\nYou know your oldest sister somehow from an area where nine out of a young black man end up in prison and I was wanting to write influence college and University of Michigan or start a company and so as long as things which are fooling some of my endeavors of notice that I'm often the only young black guy in the room and especially from a neighborhood like minds\nI still like in some ways Austin and the social justice races refrain will system as if it's more powerful than the people on one of those people's always ... you know you can come you know through your circumstances so I'm trying to put the power into the people in their potential and not necessarily in the system\nBut I I Would just say for sort of marginalized communities by Missouri some sort of the so the problem in\nMarginalized communities is\nA structural problem and as they carried out the kind of corporate coup d'etat which really began in earnest under factor and Reagan they changed the whole paradigm stirred hall writes about this you didn't look to government anymore government into that famous Reagan line you know government is not the solution is part of the problem\nAnd the stern hall writes quite stupidly they told the beleaguered white working class that there was an assault on their national identity\nAnd the Clintons rose to power on this people forget\nBut Jesse Jackson's rainbow coalition was dismantled by the Clintons who are using coded racist language and wanted to out law and order the Republicans Biden was a big factor in this\nSo it was actually the Democrats that accelerated mass incarceration from about seven hundred thousand under Clinton by the time he was out two million now half of the people in our prison system were never charged with physically harming another person\nThe other thing Clinton did they destroyed the courts Ninety four percent of the people in prison never had a jury trial and the students I teach with the longest senses\nAre the ones who went to trial unfortunately they trusted the system but the system makes an example of them because as Michelle Alexander points out if everyone went to trial the system would crash it's built on the deals\nSo one of the things that always breaks my heart in the prison is and and it's one of the reasons I teach in the prison is that the structural racism which is so\nPronounced as to make it as you know from Detroit almost impossible to make a living in the legal economy has effectively sold a lot of these people this idea that it's your fault you made mistakes\nYou know August Wilson at a great line he said all the great black warriors in this country are in jail because when the society\nDenied them the ability to get what they needed for their family they just found another way to get it\nAnd I think that there was a conscious effort on the part of the corporate state\nTo deny they always talk about stem you know it's all vocational to deny would I Would call an education\nTo the oppressed\nTo hide the fact that these structures of power are designed to destroy their lives you know from Detroit\nYou lock up the men and you of the women and children and that's what happens on why because if if you have are a victim it on the average is every six months in a poor community you finally the third or fourth time you're a victim you don't talk to your neighbors 'cause you know you're going to be a victim\nIt's why they make it so unpleasant when you visit a prison\nAnd the children are terrorized I mean there's no other word for it\nAnd people stand out in the rain for hours without bathroom facilities 'cause they don't want their terrified of any unity the most stew political class in America\nAre African Americans they are the one class that tends to actually understand what their interests are which is why they're all being raised from the voter rolls including by the Democratic party so my feeling is and this comes out of Rosa luck somewhere\nLike very much lemons only intellectual equal and which Lenin would admit she was right where Lenin was wrong\nLuxembourg would say yes you have to do what you do we have\nHave to address despair but at the same time we have to educate and so I Would say yes what you're doing is fantastic unimportant but\nAt the same time consciousness consciousness consciousness and you know there was nobody better to start with the mouth them [noise]\nHi [noise] when I was in grammar school we went through drills for what we would do if there was a nuclear Holocaust and some of us in the room probably remember we\nUsed to joke about it and say you sit down\nAnd you put your head between your knees and you kept your ass goodbye and there is a certain aspect of all of this that made me remember that what would you suggest is already happening now that we could start that you personally find promising in addition to overthrowing corporation well\nI write about it at the end the last chapter is called freedom and I was at Standing Rock I\nActually gave a talk in Boston a couple of years ago and all of the activists because there was a pipeline running through Boston and they said you know we've gone to our elected officials we've done petitions I said no what you have to do is go out and buy junk cars\nAnd when the construction equipment comes in to build a pipeline you've got to drive all the junk cars to block everything and take the batteries out and walk away\nThat's the kind of stuff we got to do it's the activists who
