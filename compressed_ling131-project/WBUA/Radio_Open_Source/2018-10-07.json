Hofer\nNazis in Nineteen forty five for his part of the anti Hitler resistance\nNothingness towards the west is sliding the Jews who ... who has managed river\nNot the death or sinking of a community it is nothing that is that is rebellious violence anti God\nMost manifestation of all the forces opposed to God I asked Chris Hedges at the outset to locate\nHere's an idea of that nothing is in our world today\nThat's a culture which we've created a commercial culture which workers straits alienation\nLoneliness unhappiness a sense of inadequacy\nAnd promises us that if we invest in that culture both financially and personally which is a culture\nThat at its core is about the cult of the self\nWe can find the happiness that they have destroyed ... but of course as proof understood every time we buy their experience whether just commercially or emotionally or their product it is only the starting point for new desires\n... and what in biblical terms it is is a culture of a dollar tree and the writers of the Bible understood and idols demand in the beginning the sacrifice of others but in the end\nLike luck [noise] they always demand your sacrifice you your sacrificed on that alter and I think that spiritual malaise that cult of the self has created tremendous depression and unhappiness\nFor over twenty five years helping those in their sixties and seventies seek an active lifestyle at every stage of retirement vox hill village dot com [noise]\n\nI'm Chris you provide and this is open source Chris Hedges our guest is a preacher's kid who grew up in Maine which Colgate middle name for himself covering wars all over the world to New York times\nThen he took up the allergy in big books as a sort of sidelined and reached a personal professional breaking point resisting the Iraq War from inside his famous newspaper\nAt the cost of his job\nHe's our guest of the Cambridge forum and the first parents church in Harvard Square his new book is America the farewell tour\nYou're leaving one huge zone my favorite zone out which is George Bush and the Iraq War\nTo my mind the light in line is it that is pretty much the bone in our\nIt's worse than the Boehner throat and set the stage for where we're at an illegal immoral irrational five trillion dollar or maybe a lot more war that goes on today which the United states chose war Joe's torture ignited terrorism\nAnd ... and ... literally killed a country\nIn front of our eyes corrupted the Democratic opposition including our friend John Kerry\nAnd destroyed the media I mean the war began and went to its end with the cheerleading of those institutions including your friends are in prison and\nWe didn't have Fargo David then every rocks and they're still working I mean anyway the point is only that to see Trump he is symptomatic of all that\nThe trail of the working class\nAt the same time he's the most I wouldn't say viable person who ever tip the tables on Jeb Bush and then on the Clintons I don't want to give them any credit for it exactly but here's a question for my friend Chris Hedges [noise]\nDo you find your heart really rooting for the record is the Trump or his so to speak or you certainly to root for the establishment where where's your heart procedures\nMy heart is with at this point the sixty or Seventy percent of Americans\nWho are being pushed towards a modern form of serfdom in the oligarchy system and you bring up the war so and he was you know at a very contentious relationship with the New York times I'd been in the middle east bureau chief for the New York times was denouncing the war was booed off of a commencement stage\nAnd of course I actually knew the middle east I knew the instrumental war unlike Pinker and and I was\nGiven a formal written reprimand and told I was no longer be allowed to speak publicly about criticizing the war and I left the paper over that issue so when you talk about all those people who are wrong beams still in power but that's misleading because\nThey may have been wrong but they played their role and the role of this was ... the role of the liberal elites\nIs to discredit\nYou can read the review of this book in the New York times the Washington Post because it's\nTo discredit the critics on the left because they set the moral parameters and they are essentially given their place in a capitalist democracy\nBecause they make sure nobody crosses those parameters nobody actually questions the system of capitalism nobody questions the intentions of going into Iraq they make concede afterwards\nThat it didn't go quite as it should so they played their role perfectly which is why they're still they're not they're all\nKnow we can't talk about leaders I mean this has come a complete misreading of what's happened in this country it's far more serious than that and I think one of the things that inform this book was the two years I spent writing a book on the Christian right\nMm because the Christian right is really the amnesty but before that let me just respond one more thing on the war so in in and you know from the book in and this is from a court but late empire\nAndme according to historian McCoy who wrote a very good book called shadows on the American century which I recommend he writes that empires that they're beginning actually use military force very carefully and very judiciously empires at the end in decline\nEngage in catastrophic military adventure is um\nThat fuels the decline in an attempt to restore last greatness so you look at for instance the end of the scene an empire they invade Sicily the entire or the ... most of the soldiers would kill the umpires over you look at\nThe Suez Crisis the British Empire is in decline from the end of World War one until Nineteen fifty six Nasser nationalize the Suez Canal the British invade with the French\nAnd have to retreat and humiliation the pound sterling is dropped ... as the world's reserve currency and the British economy goes into a tailspin that's the death will coy actually gives it a day which I Would never do twenty thirty\nBut the so we have Seventeen years of warfare there's a front page story about the debt did you read the\n... I read the times tonight I just read that what may soon exceed the cost of the U.S military interest on us debt within a decade more than nine hundred billion and interest payments will be do annually this is what happens at the end of empire you extend yourself militarily\nBeyond your ability to sustain it financially and\nThe cost in order to carry out this military adventure ... this is ... ... is to just hollow out the country from the inside so it's a city is writes\nThat the tyranny of that Athens imposed on others and it finally imposed on itself why\nBecause the military adventure ism\nIs so costly your roads are not maintained your public libraries are school you're you know the crown jewel of American democracy or is our public school system and we are watching it be destroyed ... and so as you follow the country out from the inside\nYou use the harsher forms of control which I spent Twenty years reporting on\nOn the outer reaches of empire militarized police suspension of civil liberties wholesale surveillance\nRevoking basic rights like due process militarized drones it's all coming to a town near you\nAnd and that's how empires go down so yes the military adventure ism is important but it's just a piece\nAnd we've got to stop personalized in this issue around Trump we've got to stop thinking that the Democratic parties are going to cough up some magic Kennedy and the Christian right my study of the Christian right was called American Fascists the Christian right in the war in America\nI was trying to reach out to them and I'm Bill Moyers did not want me to use the word fascist\nAnd I actually when I finished the two years of reporting I sat down with rubber Paxton wrote anatomy and fascism and Fritz Stern who wrote the politics of cultural despairing left Germany as an Eighteen year old two of our greatest scholars on fascism and I was with them for several hours\nAnd I just threw everything I had found\nAnd I wanted them to\nBe able to argue me out of using that word and ... at least to my mind they could not\nMe what's wrong with this sort of idiot definition of sanctions and fascism the ... and binding of genes it stands for the unification of\nWar making part police power opinion making power the the electoral machinery churches media the whole thing\nGod Knows what's ahead but in the this is why I go back to the Iraq War that was all of those institutions bound to get a unanimous they that was pretty bad and still\nYeah but Chris ... it was different so as bad as it was and we can't divorce the war\nFrom the re configuration of the society into a corporate oligarchy we have the largest social inequality in American history worse than the gilded age ... and so the war is part of a peace I mean why are we still at war in Afghanistan the Taliban controls more territory\nIn Afghanistan then when we went in Seventeen years ago why because Northrop Grumman Raytheon Halliburton they're making a fortune\nGets propelled forward by the primacy of profit\nAt the expense of everything else why are we expanding NATO which doesn't make any sense why are we expanding NATO to the Ukraine well because and and let's not forget that Reagan had promised Gorbachev that NATO would not be expanded beyond the German borders after the unification of Germany why\nBecause it's a billion dollar industry I was just in Poland I got up the airport there's a giant billboard from Raytheon because if you have to re can figure the old Soviet Bloc military machine to make a compatible with NATO\nMore and more triumvirate dot com [noise]\n\nI'm Christopher like this is open source where in an old fashioned citizen forum in what happens to be a church hall\nIn Harvard Square Chris Hedges is our guest this hour and his audience is about to get into the act\nSo my question is regarding the global kind of presence of the American empire so his empire retreats what does it mean for the rest of the right words plus I think what can the specially developing nations can do about it\nRight what happens is the moment the dollar is no longer the reserve currency because it has an artificial value in essence because of that the moment that it has dropped\nThan the empire has to contract because we can't pay for nobody wants to buy treasury bonds the value of the dollar drops imports become extremely expensive and\nWhat I worry and you know I Would add the fact that our financial system is once again being grossly mismanaged by Citibank and Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo and everyone else what they've done since the two thousand a crash\nIs been handed by the fed out of electronic ether according to the University of Missouri their estimate twenty six trillion dollars trillion and what have they done with it they have been as trying to did rebuild the infrastructure and create jobs invest in the real economy\nThey have taken that money and\nUh use it to buy back their own stock that's why the whole idea of the overheated stock market as a sign of economic health is nuts\nThey hoard it or they've gambled with it so the times had a story I guess a couple of weeks ago about the next\nDot com bubble being the fracking industry because like the dot com industry the fracking industry is based on projected profits not actual fracking in fact there's a huge money loser the two hundred eighty billion event invested in fracking so the money was given to them it virtually zero percent interest there has to be repaid\nSo what have they done they've gone to the beleaguered population and impose harsher harsher forms of debt peonage it's why even if you have medical insurance\nYou're getting all these new costs and co pays and why we have one point five trillion in student debt is why we have Thirteen ... trillion in personal household that\nUm and it's why cities and I open the book in Scranton are facing insolvency and so I open the book there where they're selling off\nMunicipal assets their pension funds have dropped forty percent because of the crash of two thousand and eight\nAnd so they're selling off their sewer system their parking authority of their utilities in a desperate effort to stay solvent but then they don't have anything left to sell so my fear is that the system the Malay the economy is so widespread the pathologies of self destruction\nIncluding suicide aren't epidemic but we live in a period of relative stability\nBut with a financial crash\nWhich is coming it's going to come I don't know when but it's coming and with the dropping of the dollar as the world's reserve currency\nThat financial crisis and all of totalitarian movements rise to full fluid and out of a crisis because our movements have been destroyed our press has been quoted or democratic institutions don't work then I worry that the monsters are really come out\nUnless you\nGo deeper into the story last point you were making on uh from Detroit and you know you're on the ticket from out of there I'm from an area where nine out of tune young black man and open presents and I was the one thing to influence college and University of Michigan or start a company and so a lot of things that just or in some of my endeavors of notice that I'm often the only young\nWell it's a delight in some ways often and the social justice phrases reframe will system as if it's more powerful than the people\nOn one of those symbols always from the kids you know you can come you know through your circumstances so I'm trying to put the power into the people in their potential and not necessarily in the system but I I Would just say for sort of marginalized communities around Missouri was the so the problem\nIn marginalized communities is\nA structural problem and as they carried out the kind of corporate coup d'etat which really began in earnest under factor and Reagan they've changed the whole paradigm stirred hall writes about this you didn't look to government anymore governance of the famous Reagan line you know government is not the solution is part of the problem\nAnd the stern hall writes quite stupidly they told the beleaguered white working class that there was an assault on their national identity\nAnd the Clintons rose to power on those people forget but Jesse Jackson's\nRainbow coalition was dismantled by the Clintons who are using coded racist language and wanted to out law and order the Republicans Biden was a big factor in this\nSo it was actually the Democrats that accelerated mass incarceration from about seven hundred thousand under Clinton to by the time he was out two million now half of the people in our prison system were never charged with physically harming another person\nThe other thing Clinton did they destroyed the courts Ninety four percent of the people in prison never had a jury trial and the students I teach with the longest senses\nAre the ones who went to trial unfortunately they trusted the system but the system makes an example of them because as Michelle Alexander points out if everyone went to trial the system would crash it's built on the deals so\nOne of the things that always breaks my heart in the prison is and and it's one of the reasons I teach in the prison is that the structural racism which is so\nPronounced as to make it as you know from Detroit almost impossible to make a living in the legal economy has effectively\nSold a lot of these people this idea that it's your fault you made mistakes you know August Wilson out a great line he said all the great black warriors in this country are in jail because when the society denied them the ability to get what they needed for their family they just found another way to\nGet it and I think that there was a conscious effort on the part of the corporate state to deny they always talk about stem you know it's all vocational to deny what I Would call an education to the oppressed\nTo hide the fact that these structures of power are designed to destroy their lives you know from Detroit\nYou lock up the men and your vet the women and children and that's what happens on why because if if you have a victim in on the average is every six months in a poor community you finally the third or fourth time you're a victim you don't talk to your neighbors because you know you're going to be a victim\nIt's why they make it so unpleasant when you visit a prison\nAnd the children are terrorized I mean there is no other word for it\nAnd people stand out in the rain for hours without bathroom facilities 'cause they don't want their terrified of any unity the most stew political class in America are African Americans they are the one class that tends to actually understand what\nTheir interests are which is why they're all being raised from the voter rolls including by the Democratic party so my feeling is and this comes out of Rosa ... why like very much lemons only intellectual equal and which Lenin would admit she was right where Lenin was wrong\nLooks would say yes you have to do what you do we have to address\nHunger we have to address despair\nBut at the same time we have to educate and so I Would say yes what you're doing is fantastic an important but at the same time consciousness consciousness consciousness and you know there's nobody better to start with the mouth them [noise]\n\nWhen I was in grammar school we went through drills for what we would do if there was a nuclear Holocaust and some of us in the room probably remember we\nUsed to joke about it and say you sit down and you put your head between your knees and you kept your asked goodbye and there is a certain aspect of all of this that makes me remember that\nWhat would you suggest it's already happening now that we could start that you personally find promising in addition to overthrowing corporations\nI write about it at the end the last chapter is called freedom\nStanding Rock I\nActually gave a talk in Boston a couple of years ago and all of the activists because there was a pipeline running through Boston and they said you know we've gone to our elected officials we've done petitions I said no what you have to do is go out and buy junk cars\nAnd when the construction equipment comes in to build a pipeline you've got to drive all the junk cars to block everything and take the batteries out and walk away\nThat's the kind of stuff we got to do it's the activists who got on the railroad tracks in the northwest to stop the bit of an tar sands fuel that's what we got to do and they will be vicious", "show_name": "Radio Open Source", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "07"}
