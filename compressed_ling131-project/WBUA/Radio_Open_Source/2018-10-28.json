God Knows\nJohn screaming makes it plain for us as a diplomat in retirement now at Brown university Sarah Leah Whitson is the human rights watch I on the middle east and North Africa\nFor the last decade and more you know jazz Raymond's era he says Mohammed bin Salman is a scary departure from the Saudi royalty he used to know what's your view of India as\nWell I think ... is that accurate in describing him as scary everything that had been that many doing domestically inside the country are generally a and extra territorially far away from the country's borders is very very scary\nUm and I think that in several generations of Saturday leaders have been something on is\nUniquely scary because he has\nConcentrated power in a way that we've never seen before in Saudi Arabia\n[noise] you know how did he get the reformer tag I mean so women will be able to drive cars they might even go to the movies on a weekend or when I see\nLabeling Saudi Saudi ... out of the age of oil in the new new industry in high technology ah redeem him in their eyes after all this\n[noise] and somebody else do that rule\nWell I mean I I mean there's no\nDoubt the decision to allow women to drive it was very positive one and one that I think has extremely broad support in Saudi Arabia where more than fifty percent of the population\nIs under the age of thirty a ... and so he was right to know that the er aggressive policy the kingdom are you from an evil is of the kingdom banning women on driving for example I'm a ... an ending that would meet with much support\nOr however he has very deliberately taken that measure and other uh liberalizing measures let's say like a reopening movie theaters\nOr in the country in a way that makes clear that he decides and nobody else has a say in fact he's buried liberally jailed a activists including women's rights activists who campaigned for the women's rights\nTo drive sure and not because he wants them to have a very clear message that only he gets to decide what changes in the country\nAre envious so I made a sort of still visit United States including Harvard and MIT and that their presidents or whatnot many\nDoesn't key billionaires in this country as well as on from how did he get that notion and how did he get the assignment in to be part of this alliance anti Iran alliance with Trump with Israel\n[noise] well when you look at and Samantha such a from deputy crown prince as the favorite son of king ... non uh to basically carrying out a coup against Mohammed bin Nayef the man who was crown prince\nOr in Saudi Arabia but also interior minister and Saudi Arabia for many decades and who had extremely close ties with the Pentagon and the CIA\nAnd the state department for many decades um Mohammed bin Salman was able to come in and elbow\nUh he cousin out of office at the gate acceptance and approval\nOr in the Washington establishment abolition because he was deliberately marketed as such a and and\nMy home to be accepted by the way he and by Israel uh ... the supporters of Israel and the very very strong support that he received the partnership a he had\nWith leading voices and leading figures particularly from the ... but also from Israel um led to his emergence as a force of power as unacceptable force of power or even the United\nStates and and the quid pro quo I think has been very clear ah in that he has been very much a aligned and and for the first time publicly aligned with Israel are talking about having a relationship with Israel that has never before happened on but also\nAre not coming out against a Jared Kushner's so called now dead of course peace plan a as well as remaining silent on the move of the embassy to Jerusalem\nWho was the only who's gonna who has a say now from the CIA Israel to the royal family as to whether he stays or goes after this\nAwful 'cause she'll be murder\nWell it's it's it's I ... you know it's not known who can make a change um the problem is that even if king says man uh\nWanted to change his son from power he is widely reported to have dementia and they have very limited moments of Lou city\nSo whether he is wearing off of the crisis that his son his throughout the country into a and\nHas the capacity to move out of office and replace him\nThat's a big question mark 'em the next capacity for change might come from other royal prince says other other power centers in the country who Mohammed bin Salman has alienated in his gracious\nA central location of power and the ruthless\nA attacks jailing ah defunding of everyone else in the country who might be a threat to him um for all those who might want to change him if there is some kind of an internal Saudi crew a it may well succeed if it has the support of the United states\nJury origins and by Steve Simon joins us from Amherst College among Middle East policy wonks you known Steve is the rare one with the deep back on and the religious cultures region\nDesigner was Brock Obama's middle aged men on the national Security Council last or hurts if you were working on a book titled the long goodbye United States in the middle east from Islamic

before I think quite\nQuite rightly the United States isn't much of a president's ah here in this equation uh and uh I think that's part of a boy or a general trend of the United states distancing

source or just Shereen on the\nTeachers education at Michigan State university and she tries to teach the\nRest of us on line about the Saudi war on Yemen\nWhere she ... up welcome to open stores Shereen\nTell us about Yemen located for us and then describe this war and I have to say we're all embarrassed not to know more about it and embarrassment to our journalism right there but tell us what you know who's\nWell think well thank you for having me on the show and also thank you for recognizing not because it's been a really a long struggle for us if it the last three and a half years to try to shed light on this issue given its um\nYou know incredible tool that it's taken on so many millions of human beings lives in Yemen are about Yemen is um you know Saudi Arabia southern at Saudi Arabia southern border it is um the middle east poorest country and\nUm has seen a lot of ups upheaval especially after the twenty eleven uprisings that took over in various parts of the Arab world including him and\nUm and unfortunately we are here today because some of the Saudi intervention that began in twenty Fifteen and has now lead to creating the world's worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen\nUm going a picture what kinds of people what livelihoods no oil I take it I'm\nNo oil which is why you don't hear about it very much um but the previous president of a thirty three years in Yemen was a strong ally of the U. S. and I'm a you know under the Obama administration the drone wars began\nIn Yemen offensively to to read the country of ... um [noise] and after the President Assad to step down I'm following the twenty love and protest\nUm his vice president was placed as interim president for two years\nHis term expired and he was given an extra year and after that expired as well it was a lot of um uh people in the country they were still calls for our constitution injury drafting the constitution Yemen unlike its neighbors is not a salt in it it's not a um kingdom it's not a\nAn Emirates and you know there's a spirit of a democracy in Yemen\nAnd unfortunately that was um co-opted from the people and a civil war began um largely you know people trying to vie for power seeing a I'm a\n... a power shift was taking place in Yemen but you know all of this we we hear about Yemen as a civil war right now and um that can be further from the truth because how is it a civil war in that review\nImagery and let me ask you is also there's also pictured as a as a an Iranian adventure to and then what has to be governor is it or isn't it\nAbsolutely not this is what Saudi Arabia has been saying about Yemen to says what they've told Americans and apparently the American seem to still believe it I just say to your guest Steve Simon talked about their interventionist policy in Iran and how they were the Obama administration was convinced that this was a a good way of dealing with Iran in Yemen and we know that Iran is not in Yemen\nYemen is located at a strategic location which is the port's um the streets of ... where about four million barrels of oil travel every every single day of course there is a strategic importance there for the Obama administration to protect\nAnd frankly the Saudis told them that this was going to be a very quick war they called it decisive storm they expected it to and within a couple of weeks maybe a month or so at most they didn't expect any kind of resistance in the country they didn't expect that this country that this conflict to John for so long\nBut you know here we are three and a half years later the Saudis have blockaded the country Lansing area which is why millions of people are literally starving to death yet we're expected were expected to believe that the Iranians are somehow\nManaging to smuggle weapons there's no evidence of that ... um there's no Iranian presence on the ground is is not Syria um and like your first guest Stephen I'm ginger mentioned this is a very much a one sided war\nSurvey was Richard I'm Wondering for you at human rights watch somebody has made the constructors who just in the least\nAh the crown prince and sort of do as parents would have to stop that war tomorrow what could stop it actually\nWell absolutely I mean Saudi Arabia could stop the war Saudi Arabia is the primary aggressor in this war though it hides behind a coalition and Saudi Arabia started this war in Yemen\nUm agree completely with the commentator a previously that this was a fantasy that would be a war of a couple of weeks\nAnd the only real reason\nYoung crown prince could justify a new title is minister of defense as someone who actually had an experience fighting and winning a war in fact he's shown and proven himself to be the opposite of qualified for that was a resident I law\n[laughter] and it read that resume were absolutely except if anything this is the resume that prove why not only he should be fired but he should be jailed I mean Saudi Arabia has been carrying out\nThe most atrocious war crimes or in a a Yemen a bombarding uh schools universities\nHospitals are using cluster munitions littering the the the the country ah and I must also emphasize it primarily using American and British weapons\nAnd the role of America in this war is not just to sell\nA weapons or or even to you know generally vaguely support\nA Saudi Arabia and the more the United states of the party to this war the United states is actively providing me feeling assistance\nHas actively provided targeting assistance obviously they bad targeting assistance and so whatever is happening in this war and I think there's a party to it or if complicit in it and is responsible for the\nOf violations little laws of war the war crimes that are taking place\nAnd again and just to go back to the to your commentator Mr Simon ... comments unfortunately\nUh the the support for the war in Yemen is by far the greatest foreign policy failing of the Obama administration and it's it's really quite tragic or that the price the bill for the Iran deal was signed by the Yemeni people\nSusana stranger tell there are Republicans in Congress who who hate this war against Yemen um what what's the possibility of mobilizing American opinion and government it then you got the power against it\n[noise] I think that there's this looming possibility that a ... murder\nWill prompt Congress\nTo intervene in and do something to bring a U.S assistance to the show dean and wrote the war effort to an end and at the same time to put\nDiplomatic pressure on the Saudis and the ... to support a un brokered peace process in Yemen there's a slim chance of that I'm\nA I'm skeptical that the Republicans will be able to mobilize a coalition on the hill a really to make that\nWork and it's not something that can be done quickly either because it would probably panic or some kind of legislation [noise] so um you know it it it wouldn't be a miracle cure even if it happened and I think the chances are slim but there is a chance\nTo censor um get us out of that war somehow\nI think it's true as you heard earlier that the United states wants to be less involved in some ways in the middle east and we don't have a ambassadors there that's a perfect example\nBut let's not take from that phrase the idea that we're somehow disconnected from this war I Want to emphasize what you just heard without the United states this war couldn't be going on\nWe are providing the targeting assistance and the refueling\nSo we are involved in some ways you know worse and more and a deeper way than we have been in the past because we're involved through others over who not only we have no control but we over we desire to exercise no control the worst piece of this isn't this war really is not about Yemen\nNobody cares about Yemen it's just the battleground and having lived through other wars like the one in Nicaragua which had nothing to do with Nicaragua just required Nicaragua's to supply the dead people so outside forces could make their point that's what's happening in Libya in er in Yemen\nUm and as for the fact that a Yemen was the worst foreign policy disaster of the Obama administration it certainly looks that way now but if you were from Libya or slow down or Syria you could see that there's a lot of competition\nIs even and it's not about you know what is it about that\nI think it's about Saudi Arabia's desire to show that it can crush every she uh influenced movement which will then described as being pro Iran Saudi Arabia has tapped into an obsession in America with Iran\nJust like the way so many dictators tapped into our obsession against communism and they use that obsession has a way to get themselves permission to do whatever they want we have to convince ourselves to such a degree about the evil of Iran", "show_name": "Radio Open Source", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "28"}
