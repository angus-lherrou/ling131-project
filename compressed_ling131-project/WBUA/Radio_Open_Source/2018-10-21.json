courageous\nYoung man who sees is upon words on language and literacy as his weapon\nAs his only weapon but I think he's also creating a character who sees is I'm a weapon of character or\nStrong

fight which is a little differently in different autobiographies but it's critical\nYeah it is critical critical Douglas the self creation but Douglas tells the story that one day on a Sunday when he had returned from temporarily running away to the woods he stood up to Kobe and according to the dog was they fought for two hours now I don't believe it lasted two hours a day to kill each other\nBut double stands up with his fist and might seem off at the age of Seventeen\nNow in any other circumstances a slave who resisted is master and such a way would be prosecuted or hang a or at least Seoul South\nNewton country day dot org\n\nI'm Christopher Lyden this is open source Frederick Douglass was a famous days before he formally bought himself out of slavery he was speaking all over New England and the north\nOn his mission to make visible the wounds of this system on my soul and David lights telling the doctors presence was everywhere including the British Isles\nAh it wasn't even in his mid twenties and he could hold an audience for an hour and a half and have them laughing and crying that was power and the only power he had\nSpeaking about that gays [laughter] I feel that gays and so many pictures every one of them striking storytelling expressions\nYeah they are everywhere and one dog was one and wanted him to sit for photographs he also cultivated these photographs over and over he liked doing that and ah if you didn't like the profile of the photographer took in the morning and go back in the afternoon and get it done right [laughter]\nUm the other hand to visit she had a presence she had an incredible charisma\nAnd one of the things I found many many many accounts of where people in the press\nOr in letters describing the first time they saw the first time they heard Douglas speak or or the second time they heard Douglas and comparing it to the first\nThere are many descriptions of the sounds of his voice his mannerisms his style and so forth and this was we need to remember the golden age of oratory order of photography and the birth of photography\nAnd Douglas love mode during the day by the way he love the things that mode during the day and it's worth it kind of remembering that he is born Eighteen Eighteen before steamboats\nThe railroad the rotary press which he will use of course to great extent the telegraph\nAll of the these these elements of Nineteen century mode ... which made possible a massive and you know reform movement like anti slavery that was born before that even happens but he lives all the way to electric light boats\nDid it like come to Eighteen fifty two and a speech it is now sort of classic in a lot of young kids know that the fourth of July speech maybe his great masterpiece may be his popular masterpiece for all the time the fourth of July speech\nDouglas gives an Eighteen fifty two is in my opinion the rhetorical master piece of American abolition of ah one of the great speeches in American history it's now canonized in lots of collections of oratory and speeches and even\nLiterature and read it street corners on a threat is already corners of the state of Vermont has ...\nHas a statewide policy on the fourth every town is supposed to read it but the speech itself the context is\nIn part everything\nIt's summer of Eighteen fifty two ago Tom's cabin it's just been published is digging in the world by storm it's a presidential election year\nIt's two years into the attempted enforcement of the fugitive slave act they're rescues going on around the country several of them already Kirk Douglas as participated in two or three of them\nThe crisis over slavery is beginning to break apart the political parties and Douglas gets invited by his friends in Rochester the ladies anti slavery society of Rochester New York\nTo give a speech and currency in hall which was this big beautiful new hall and Rochester\nKeep fit about six hundred people [noise] place was packed\nAnd Dr ... there's a letter and we started was tells us he worked harder on that speech than anything else you'd ever written except perhaps the narrative\nAnd he said he spent three weeks\nThis speech is I call it a symphony and three movement is an opening up six pages or so or he sets his audience cities in a calm voice she talks about founding fathers as geniuses the declaration of independence\nOr independence is a celebration for six pages or so and then the pronouns rain down on your you you you you're dressed as his audience the audience in that room that day but this speech was addressed the nation he already headed printed up\nReady to take on the road to sell for probably fifty cents a copy the second movement of speech which is the whole middle of the speech the longest part of the speech comes after he says but pardon me why have you invited me here to speak on your fourth of July\nThe fourth of July is yours you may rejoice high must mourn you you you you you do not meaning white America does not include me and my people in this celebration\nBut have a well those I represent to do with your national independence\nYou're a high independence only reviews measurable\nDistance between us the blessings in which you this day rejoice or not enjoyed in common the rich inheritance of justice\nLiberty prosperity and independence recruited by your father's is shared by you not to buy the the sunlight that ... life and you're listening to you\nAs about strikes in death to me this fourth of July ... is the euro's knocked my new favorite joys are much more do\nDrugs man in factors into the grand Newman native temple of liberty and call upon him to join and Julius anthems where human mockery and suck religious\nI Would do you mean citizens to mock me like asking me to speak today\nAnd in the middle part of the speech he takes them through historical Whitney of the slave trade\nThe holes of a slave ship he makes he appeals to their senses he tells them what it smelled like he tells them what it sounded like and then he makes them listen and hear the sounds of the chains on a slave and the sounds of a whip he\nTells them to see the blood dripping off the back of a of a slave being savagely beat and\nIt's like a hailstorm\nThrough the whole middle of the speech for twelve pages\nAnd that section comes to an end with the passage that is one step better than Jonathan Edwards this speech is a great Jeremiah he ends with the image of a terrible reptile colonial up at the nation's heart and the boat to eat out you're hurt\nUnless you repent you reform you change and then comes as last short part of the speech it's calmer it's as though he's\nOut towels and let everybody dry off ...\nAnd he says but your country is still ...\nStill young and male it ... it is still possible to save yourself by ending slavery destroying the system and recreating the nation and of course the speech ends\nSo richly ironic way of uh the verses of the song a poem written by when lord garrison\nGo sound the jubilee\nAnd the fact that he would do that in Eighteen fifty two right after he's just have this horrible personal breakup with garrison\nIs ritually ironic\nSo it's a speech that is full of the terror of of the great puritan Jeremiah ... with the possibility of redemption at the end of it I suspect it's read today and use today so much partly just because of the power and beauty of the language\nBut also it's used in places where people want\nAudiences they want their neighbors they want their friends to think about the fourth of July as something other than just fireworks and hamburgers and celebration they want to think about its history thing about where Americans have come from I think about what we had to overcome\nTo have a peaceful republic such as it is and no one ever put it better than Douglas did by saying your country will be destroyed by slavery\nUnless you repentance save it now and it might even be destroyed anyway\nNow that comes out of Douglas's deep intellectual moral emotional ties to the Old Testament store right that's where that comes from in fact the language Douglas employs especially in is\nA lot of his writing Israeli right out of the king James language [noise]\nDid it like cutting to the great relationship of Frederick Douglass and\nAbraham Lincoln ... historic pair obviously and the the review of all they had studied one another carefully where are they ... at multiple levels of politics and character and strategy before they met and then you I didn't know that he meant Lincoln\nOh it Eileen miles details at Harvard dot com [noise]\nI'm Christopher\nLightened this is open source David lights life Frederick Douglass profit of freedom reveals a gift from the start but what in twenty Eighteen is called intersection out any in movement politics\nHe was the only black person in Seneca Falls district he had an interesting sometimes tense relation will suffer jets particularly when it came to who should get the vote first women more black people explain all that\nWell first of all Douglas was in every way of women's rights ma'am you and wrote an essay by that title I am a women's rights man\nHe was the only black at the Santa Claus convention and aging forty a he was the only primary males speaker at to Seneca Falls convention he signed a declaration of rights he put a new map started on this paper which set writers of no color nor sex\nAnd he had a very strong relationship with the leaders of the ones suffered movement and his neighbors isn't being ... in Rochester right whether neighbors now for the purpose of tourism\nAnd they weren't really neighbors they live they're uh they're not all neighbors and a statue even know the truth is he was very close to lots of women's rights activists each traveled with him he spoke with them because some of them with the same suffer just an abolitionist\nAnd during the civil war as many people know the women's suffrage movement by and large folded their tense and fought for black freedom Stanton\nIn fact wrote one of the greatest eulogies all started ... years on who said he was quote majestic in his raft which is great phrase\nAnthony was what was the day died\nDugas ten in the women's rights convention in the last day of his life in Washington DC and he sat on the stage and he sat next to Susan answer and then he took Gary Johnson dropped dead of a heart attack and six PM but he had far more women friends among these reform movements than you actually did male friends\nIn some way that most delicious piece in the relationship of Lincoln and Douglas comes ten years later when ... Douglas dedicates Russia Friedman is monument in Washington DC it's a statue and we have one\nDaughter we like it or a flicker right here in Boston the standing Lincoln his left arm raised over\n... man and taking a knee if I'm going to say I mean I'm not quite kneeling but Douglas recoiled at that image if you wanted to call it A People's monument right and he began his speech talking about Lincoln not as the great emancipator but as\nPre eminently the white man's president right and then the speech takes an amazing term pores\nOver I often say that That's Douglas was stuck in the greatest speech I fix an eye open eighth graders are because it just seemed like\nA moment to place the story right there toward the end of reconstruction was everything at stake that had been won in the war that speech is really about reconstruction and and the retreat from reconstruction and know the audience you hear\nThe entire government was their president grant members of the president's cabinet congressmen senators members of the Supreme Court ... it's everybody that would be at at a state event that inauguration\nNo black person had ever address that group of ... and no black person ever did again into Brock Obama was inaugurated ...\nI have said that President Lincoln was a white man and share the prejudices\nCommon to his countrymen tool words the color race here from the genuine abolition ground Mr Lincoln seemed tardy code do and in different but measuring him by the ... of his country sentiment that he was about\nAs a statesman to consult he was with cell is\nRadical and determined to do much to Nick and shared the prejudices of his white\nFellow country men against the negro is hardly necessary to say that in his heart of hearts depot Lowe's and hated slavery the man who could say only do we hope\nFervently do we pray that this might teach school of war\nShould soon passed away yet if God widows\nIt could take you to all the wealth how by two hundred years of bondage so has been wasted in each drop of blood drawn by the last show have been paid for by one drawn by the ... the judge was a ... a true and righteous\nGives all needed proof of his feeling on the subject of ...\nIt's an honor speech he says look\nAnd this is by the way election year Eighteen Seventy six it's the centennial year year of the American centennial is reconstruction going to last or die is right on the table\nAnd it comes in the wake of so much brutal use of violence in terror across the south now for years Dugas says Abraham Lincoln was permanently the white man's president he was your president not our\nYou my white fellow Americans were his children I end my people only his step children when he repeats like a ...\nYou read that first part of the speech and you do a kind of an out ... what is the white man's president going to be a black nationalist diatribe against Lincoln in the country no it's not what he does then he's shifts and he says bucked\nUnder his rule and in due time and he makes that are refrain three or four times under his Lincoln's rule and in due time we\nWere liberated we became free we became\nEqual before the law and the fourteenth amendment we got the right to vote in the fifteenth amendment under his rule in due time which was Douglas's way I Believe\nOf saying the United states freed us the United states gave us our rights and the United states is\nBound to enforce and protect them and who's sitting in front of him but the United states the president's Supreme Court the Congress\nAnd it ends with a sort of ...\nAbout reconstruction and about whether this will be saved or not and of course it's also laced beautifully with all that civil religion he talks about\nThe deadline and yonder Arlington he talks about the majestic dome of the Capitol I mean it's full of the sort of beauty of patriotism I see it as a great reconstruction speech because it comes right as reconstruction is falling apart on the eve of that presidential election which is of course when\nThe bargain is drunk that in effect does bring a kind of political ended least reconstruction is Douglas's attempt at a last arrived to try to rally his own party now\nWhich is still in power to whole reconstruction together the lynching speech was the last of the great ones ... Mm [noise] yeah he's confronted by the issue of lynching from really the late Eighteen eighties on but especially in the early nineties\nEither be well had some influence on that because of her great activism about lynching and they became quite close he became a kind of mentor to her but he first fashion the speech while he was in Chicago representing the nation of Haiti to Chicago world's fair\nAnd he took a version of it on the road called the lessons of the hour also sometimes called why as the negro lynched\nIt's actually a very good analysis of how this came out of the culture out of the society [noise]\nAnd it's no holds barred\nIt's in a better speech it's an ugly speech is a difficult speech even read at times because he uses examples from the press of of actual lynchings\nHe talks about the white audiences celebrate which we've now learned much much more about adult lynching but in essence that speech given in the last years of his life his dog was saying all that we fought for all we won\nThe great triumphs and rebirth of the United states is possibly being destroyed now by this phenomena [noise]\nHe has a very difficult time in that speech doing what he usually did through his life which is to find some kind of way to end on hope ... but he does it [laughter]\nLike it or not he hands on his face that still some how the ... of the constitution will prevail ... ... where I was going to go but to the fourteenth fifteenth amendments where else could he go\nBut to these creeds of natural rights which is worried always gone in way back forty years earlier when arguing for the destruction of slavery\nBut it is remarkable that the end of his life he doesn't in his life an unhappy man by any means ah he had a a very rich domestic situation by the end of his life and he was comfortable but", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radio Open Source", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "21"}
