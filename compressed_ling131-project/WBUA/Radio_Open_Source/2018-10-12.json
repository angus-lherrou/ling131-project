... is now dean of Boston University's school of global studies welcome back\nFor his what's the lesson of your\nLong history in this game and what what the what are the insiders inside line on this report\nI I think it's an important reports which are sort of surprising report in the surprise is how we keep getting surprised about the same thing again and again and again uh I don't think it some more frightening report than previous ones are as you are interested we've been sleeping\nSo we haven't been hitting what the BCC has been saying we haven't been hitting for nature has been telling us all around us not just in front of the\nOwner was ... all over Europe\nAnd uh so so in in some ways you know uh it's\nIt's like you did seem to think it should be to the game and again and again but what's new in these cascading feedback loops for example I I think what's new here\nIs this one point five degree sort of which has become the new ah scare a dog get that off to the world is going to somehow become a is reverse simply different my point is that the world is already Israel should be different\nThat for hundreds of millions of people in the world the Buddhist people what some of the ... the word climate change is not something you talk about the future tests\nHe's famous changes something that does here that is happening that is happening now and my um issue but the report if any is that it's maybe not frightening enough it's it's trying to frighten us about the future\nWithout really fully telling us about the president I can see why they're doing it because they want to spoil or other mostly you would meet people people who are African\nMore temperate saying he'll guard please do something and do it now I think that's the that's a good message but there's another message and the messages that climate change is happening now it's happening in ... it's happening in Pakistan it's happening in Haiti it's happening and malicious it's happening\nIn in in ... too and it's happening and this is the key point it is happening mostly not most it is happening with Greivis consequences in places which had been nice to do with causing the problem\nSo those who had nice to do with making the mess on at the front forefront of having to deal with that that is why I think climate is a justice issue in this report as well as previous IPC reports I don't think I've done justice to climate as a justice of ...\nYou know we can't get ahead or as somebody asks for stick with justice what are the one of the blocks you know understanding or just our humanity don't see burger dash as as the eye of the store and say how many other\nPlace I think it does the humanity um that is at best here I think it just it has not science and I mean I can see that keeps coming up in ... I'm a fan of fight BCC I've been markets but this is no longer a question of science the big thing is the big challenges knocked\nWhether we have enough science or not the big challenges whether we have enough action or not and why is that not happening that just eat a question of odd humanity as you point that I eat of ethics and within ... as a species are fully involved to look at ourselves and I said why will as a species and I'm not sure we are\nAnd the second thing is I think this is David enough technology there's enough science there's enough knowledge for us to make a difference I Am not convinced anymore but there is enough visited him in a species\nTo act in time and to act for\nThe benefit of the entire species or if I can say something rather harsh with your permission I think in some ways all of us who saved the climate change sheet asleep do not actually did get you to St Louis enough\nBecause we've all figured out that we probably will shrimp it's kind of a like a border that was that was about to go down we all taught me to go down with it and now suddenly realize oh maybe not maybe some of us will make it to the outside\nAnd at that point your challenges are you going to lend a hand to those who will go down and the fact of the matter is we have not been doing that\nYou know politicians say goodbye to hit and they should for being unwilling to risk their jobs but I mean every one of us I think is is is afraid to doing something serious would risk their own jobs\nSo yes oh yes I I think that is we we have kind of made made the fact that somehow the guards of technology\nAnd the guards of the free market ... village somehow find a solution and time for us to be saved and maybe we are right but the problem is that not all of us and we'll be saved and as I said it is those who had nice to do with causing the mess that are having to face the consequences\nIf there are limits here on our humanity and shame on us but there's also years and years along like butter conditioning\nWe're told over and over again that it's it's great to be rich anybody can strive for the degrees of mechanism mechanization but of privilege of leisure of fun that we have defined as human would be very hard to get up at this point [laughter]\nYes and frankly I see that you know it's a it's a question of justice here's here's the thing of vitamins nature target deport what does nature to have to ... what does nature have against the Buddhist people in the woods and the fact of the matter is that if you are\nFor if you will end up living in the most vulnerable places\nAnd if you are the Buddhist living in the most ... places you it is most likely that you do not have the ability to deal with those disasters ... so the disaster comes to Florida and the disaster comes to gun Archie or Mumbai\nBut if you are on the edge in Mumbai you're much less likely to have the resources to deal with it and and the point I'm making about you know this is no longer the future of issue with this this report and we still talk about climate as if it's something fought in the distance or maybe not that far in the distance but still something in the future\nBut to cross the was it is not a future to look at the heat waves going around ... ... a look at floods my country Pakistan there is no for the last six seven years\nIt continuous floods every year there's a flood with a number of deaths at the same time that our drugs at the same time the U.S a heat wave sticking more life in Karachi this summer at that time more people died in the heat wave\n... in the ... right right\nAnd this is a violent place anyhow so the point I'm making is that nature of this telling us that the norm of the new normal is a climatic change not move for a lot of places and who's paying the price is the Buddhist that\nThose who are least able to do something about this those who will be released responsible for causing the mess\nAnd we still talk down to the poor and the great minds of the west including that one of them that might raise I can tell the world or how to how to deal with the problem that we in the west created so many\nStudents are we we made ourselves coming and going west produced the industrial revolution that created the pardon divided the world\nAnd still somehow we expect that those geniuses we all know and love are are going to solve this problem I think I Want it I I maybe you can tell us oh what do the light footprint people the world in in Texas the hunted Africa in China um have to offer this conversation that we're not hearing\nI Do do do they do have to offer an idea of an ideal of life that is not as driven by the ideal of growth as a marvelous but here's the thing that we should also be concerned about the light footprint people as you as you put it\nUp seeing the same for you and I and they're saying that these heavy for ... ... ... ... people\nAre taking too many resources away from me and maybe I Need to be in the same place and so we're not Martin Greece was exactly right on as you can not you can not\nWind defended to the British people of the world and say why do you want to drive a car right do

I Would just agree with so much of it\nUm I Would spin it ... it differently though and I emphasize some different things\nWhich is that there's a word that it seems to be missing 'em from these conversations which is capitalism um it's not that humanity in is in fact doing all the things\nI'm humanity doesn't stand in a way of um some of the mitigation and an adaptation efforts that could be done um it's that we have associate economic system that is predicated on the kind of extractive um fuel sources and general extractive regimes right whether we're talking about social systems\nEconomic systems and of course a fossil fuels and planetary boundary that keep it going in the way that we know are\nYou speaking you're out of high carbon economic growth in profits too of course a and I wonder if I'm hearing a definition\nCapitalism in the modern world\n[laughter] I mean it it's funny I'm In that same article I get into this question of of definitions to sort of obliquely at the end um because like the truth is there's a lot of things that you can you and I let a whole host of them the article um and and the there's a lot of things we could\nOf that and I I tend to agree absolutely with Dr and John but he was saying that the problem is not the future I cannot stress that enough um that that we are living through this you know right now um and there's a lot that we can do and whether what what comes\nOut of that well you know what sort of spring sport is capitalism we want to call it something else post capitalism is it real like socialism like God Knows um but it is so dramatically different than the socio economic order we have now um and it's\nAnd it's fundamental to understand and so and that's why it's so hard to hear and and I think for many people\nUm people who who you know do you propose these sort of small bore reforms whether it be you know like having a cap and trade system using market incentives when in fact we knew we need broad a a political transformation um\nAnd the other thing I Would emphasize is a a you know ... ... talking to John was correct in saying that you know this will hit 'em hardest areas that have\nA ... that have contributed to lease but that's not just sort of an iron ... right it's a he said it's not nature targeting people um the truth is the same system that whole that debt I'm Dr such extraordinary inequality in our world and such extraordinary I'm\nIn the balance of power between global north and global south also drive and support and are necessary for the maintenance of capitalism as we know that if we are going to have in mind that change seriously we have to take capitalism seriously\nYou're talking about the world the capitalism created in some sense but come back to\nThe Trump cushion New York times I Believe that he's not responded to this and they think he's stupid and he doesn't get it but you point out this is very phone scores on this\nProblem estimated that by the end of the century the heat rise will be not one point five it will be four degrees centigrade\nAnd there's a way I Want you to explain it in which he has incorporated this into his thinking about the world you call it and he might do right wing climate realism unpack that\nSure happy to um you know I Do think that there's often a way in which we talk about these conversations again as if everyone like the world is going to end right it's the apocalypse like um everyone's\nGoing to die so this is that we're all gonna die right foot quote from the Adams on but the truth is actually on\nThere are a lot of people that blow\nA and leek and sort of very easily or imagined in our minds but then the demographics um the wealth levels on the\nPlacement of the people that are actually going to do pretty well through this period and um and I do sort of think there is an eighth and you know whether a Trump actually believe that are not God Knows I'm not going to speculate about what he actually believe or not um but I Do think there was something in that um\n[noise] in that study that was fascinating 'cause they were basically saying they were leaving that denialism behind oh there's no such thing oh it's a Chinese has a and going instead with yup\nIt's going to happen and it's too late and there's nothing to do about it on\nAnd what's so fascinating to me there is one that isn't on a statement or at least partially right they're saying the things that they were trying to overturn the fuel efficiency standards and the truth is like just a couple of fuel efficiency standards that they are right that's not going to turn\nThat's not going to turn the tide on the air right when they say business as usual and have the natural scientific literature often says I'm Will lead to a degree or more increase like if you do nothing if you change nothing but that's what's gonna happen on\nThose things are true and I think that sets up something that um again is sort of missing from this conversation which is that it's a political conflict um you know\nIt's strange because yeah the rising um crisis is not going to be good for Trump's base it may be good for his ten best friends they have their minds they have their mountaintops they have their\nUm you know Missouri law goes that's going to be pretty soggy for the first five floors I Want to sort of

problem in the sense that it is this belief in the gospel of growth\nAnd of continues to grow up in the plan is a is a really serious liberals not inflict\nA and and and everyone's ... that's that's the thing that everyone has to constantly grew at some point and that's going to meet you want them to one of my time of change but different people who have me do differently by my estimation it's feast a billion people in the wound\nAt least ... billion people in the window to do you live in what I call the age of ...\nThe ... in the mid ... would we have to do something to stop climate the African actually adapt to climate that has changed for them\nAnd and that means that they have to be a doozy sources and use them to adapt to this ... my only issue might when they don't issue but my only question I think from the ... the ... who I I also agree with this\nI Am not ask for doing the climate will force us to change the more you\nKnow unfortunately I think the more stronger and what do you mean\nBy making sure of course of habit or privilege or these because the balance of power\nAnd and and and ... and and the because ah I don't see the video to meet the type of changes that are neat uh\nWhat what is it political change that could work toward your dream\nTo me please uh yes and I mean shoot seriously uh I I there's a lot of ... on\nThe uh I Do you think you can see\n'em a couple of things that could that could be hopeful for the political picture and I will\nSay that that ... ah it's likely neither neither\nI don't even know if I'd go fifty fifty which I think what I'm professor ... that um you know could be even worse than that on\nBut for example I think there's a growing awareness of of the problems I'm In a in the global north um which I think most people I've
