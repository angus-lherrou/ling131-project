Mm\nI'm Christopher like this is open source\n... ex slaves rhetoric Douglas and it's been paired in statesmanship we're in\nA stunning big new biography sets Douglas in Palau also with the literary giant Herman Melville and his novel in questionable quail\nAnd Melville turned out to be almost that contemporaries consumed in their twenties and thirties with a moral crisis slavery or\nThe right to

meets the south sea ... quick\nThe ship they sell the Picard and its crew\nIs metal does idea of this nation of nations very like Douglass is ideal of a\nPositive nation [noise]\nDavid bites of cow to Douglas [noise] use the word man\nStoryteller who keeps rewriting his autobiography re composing here's an ethic\nOf American identity of tragedy\nEagle\nThe character Douglas is creating let's say in the narrative the first autobiography in even more ritually in the second\nIs a self willed Roy individual ... always working and striving against the odds and he had great up he is a courageous\nYoung man who sees is upon words on language and literacy as his weapon\nAs is only weapon\nBut I think he's also creating a character who seizes on the weapon of character of a strong personality and even the young man who would use physical violence to regenerate himself\n[noise] we could do this hour in just personal relationships but the first one that grabs me whereas we would call the yeah the slave breaker you know they were on on the eastern shore of Maryland He had been born into slavery gets farmed out to Thomas old ... who finds them a little\nToo rough and ready and he packs a monster movie\nAnd they end up in a fight which is a little differently in different autobiographies but it's critical\nYeah it is critical critical Douglas the self creation but Douglas tells the story that one day on a Sunday when he had returned from temporarily running away to the woods he stood up to Coby and according to the dog was they fought for two hours now I don't believe that lasted two hours that killed each other\nBut double stands up with his fist and fight them off\nAt the age of Seventeen\nNow in any other circumstances a slave who resisted as master in such a way would be prosecuted or hang a or at least sold south\nAnd poet Eileen miles details at Harvard dot com\n\nI'm Christopher Lyden this is open source Frederick Douglass was a famous days before he formally bought himself out of slavery\nHe was speaking all over New England and the north on his mission to make visible the wounds of this system on my soul and David blight telling the Douglas presence was everywhere including the British Isles\nUh he wasn't even in his mid twenties and he could hold an audience for an hour and a half and have them laughing and crying\nThat was power and the only power he had\nSpeaking about that gays [laughter] I feel that gays\nAnd so many pictures every one of them striking storytelling expressions\nYeah they are everywhere and one dog was on and wanted him to sit for photographs he also cultivated these photographs over and over he liked doing that and ah if you didn't like the profile the photographer took in the morning and go back in the afternoon and get it done right [laughter]\nUm the other hand to visit she had a presence she had an incredible charisma\nAnd one of the things I found many many many accounts of what people in the press\nOr in letters describing the first time they saw the first time they heard Douglas speak or or the second time they heard Douglas and comparing it to the first there are many descriptions of the sounds of his voice his mannerisms style and so forth\nAnd this was we need to remember the golden age of oratory order of photography and the birth of photography and Douglas love mode during the the by the way you love the things that modernity\nAnd it's worth it kind of remembering that he is born Eighteen Eighteen before steamboats\nThe railroad the rotary press which he will use of course to great extent the telegraph\nAll of the these these elements of Nineteen century mode during the day which made possible a massive and you know reform movement like anti slavery that was born before that even happens but he lives all the way to electric light boats\nEighteen fifty two and a speech that is now sort of classic and a lotta young kids know that the fourth of July speech maybe his great masterpiece maybe his popular masterpiece for all the time\nThe fourth of July speech Douglas gives an Eighteen fifty two is in my opinion the rhetorical master piece of American abortion or one of the great speeches in American history it's now canonized in lots of collections of oratory and speeches and even the literature\nAnd read it street corners on ... street corners of the state of Vermont has ...\nHas a statewide policy on the fourth every town is supposed to read it but the speech itself\nThe context is in part everything it's summer of\nEighteen fifty to uncle Tom's cabin it's just been published is taking the world by storm it's a presidential election year it's two years into the attempted enforcement of the fugitive slave act there are rescues going on around the country several of them already Kirk Douglas as participated in two or three of them\nThe crisis over slavery is beginning to break apart the political parties and Douglas gets invited by his friends in Rochester the ladies anti slavery society of Rochester New York to give a speech in Corinthian hall which was this big beautiful new hall in Rochester\nFed about six hundred people [noise] place was packed\nAnd Dr ... there's a letter and was started was tells us he worked harder on that speech than anything else you'd ever written except\nPerhaps the narrative and he said he spent three weeks\nBut this speech is I call it a symphony in three movements is an opening up six pages or so or he sets his audience cities in a calm voice she talks about the founding fathers as geniuses the declaration of independence is the ring ... says of your independence\nIs a celebration for six pages or so and then the pronouns rained down on your you you you you're dresses his audience the audience in that room that day but this beach was addressed the nation he already headed printed up\nReady to take it on the road to sell\nFor probably fifty cents a copy\nThe second movement of speech was the whole middle of the speech the longest part of the speech comes after he says but pardon me why have you invited me here to speak on your fourth of July\nThe fourth of July as yours you may rejoice I'm much more than you you you you you do not meaning white America does not include me and my people in this celebration\nBut have a well those I represent to do with your national independence you're a high independents only reviews measurable distance between us the blessings in which you this day rejoice\nOr not enjoyed in common the rich inheritance of justice\nLiberty prosperity and independents ... ... by your father's is shared by you not to buy me the sunlight that ... life in the evening to you\nAs broad stripes and to me this fourth of July is yours knocked ma you may rejoice I must do\nDrugs man in factors into the grid Newman native temple of liberty and call upon him to join and Julius anthems where human mockery and sec religious\nI Would do you mean citizens to mock me like asking me to speak today\nAnd then that middle part of the speech he takes them through historical Whitney of the slave trade the holes of a slave ship he makes\nHe appeals to their senses he tells them what it smelled like he tells them what it sounded like and then he makes them listen and hear the sounds of the chains on a slave and the sounds of a whip he\nTells them to see the blood dripping off the back of a of a slave being savagely beat and it's like a hailstorm\nThrough the whole middle of the speech for twelve pages\nAnd that section comes to an end with the passage that is one step better than Jonathan Edwards\nThis speech is a great Jeremiah he ends with the image of a terrible reptile colonial up at the nation's heart and the boat to eat out you're hurt\nUnless you repent you reform you change and then comes to slash short part of the speech it's calmer it's as though\nDry off and he says but your country is still Malian bull still young and male it ... it is still possible to save yourself by ending slavery destroying the system and recreating the nation\nAnd of course the speech ends so richly ironic way of uh the verses of a song a poem written by when lord garrison go sound the jubilee\nAnd the fact that he would do that in Eighteen fifty two right after he's just have this horrible personal breakup with garrison\nIs ritually ironic so it's a speech that is full of the terror of of the great puritan Jeremiah ... with the possibility of redemption at the end of it\nI suspect it's read today and used today so much partly just because of the power and beauty of the language but also it's used in places where people want\nAudiences they want their neighbors they want their friends to think about the fourth of July as something other than just fireworks and hamburgers and celebration they want to think about its history thing about where Americans have come from I think about what we had to overcome\nTo have a peaceful republic such as it is and no one ever put it better than Douglas did by saying your country will be destroyed by slavery unless you repentance save it now and it might even be destroyed anyway\nNow that comes out of Douglas's deep intellectual moral emotional ties to the Old Testament store right that's where that comes from in fact the language Douglas employs especially in his oratory\nBut also in a lot of his writing Israeli right out of the king James language\n[noise] David like cutting to the great relationship of perfect drug was and\nHe had and they can ... historic

Douglas profited freedom reveals a gift from the start but within twenty Eighteen is called intersection allergy in movement politics\nHe was the only black person in Seneca Falls district he had an interesting sometimes tense relation will suffer jets particularly when it came to who should get the vote first women were black people explain all that\nWell first of all Douglas was in every way of women's rights ma'am you and wrote an essay by that title I am a women's rights man\nHe was the only black at the Santa Claus convention and aging forty eight he was the only primary males speaker at to Seneca Falls convention he signed the declaration of rights he put a new map started on this paper which set writers of no color\nNor sex and he had a very strong\nRelationship with the leaders of the one and suffered movement and his neighbors isn't being ... in Rochester right\nWhether neighbors now for the purpose of tourism and they weren't really neighbors they live there are there now neighbors and a statue even know the truth is he was very close to lots of women's rights activists he traveled with him he spoke with them because some of them with the same suffer just an abolitionist\nAnd during the civil war as many people know the women's suffrage movement by and large folded their tense and fought for black freedom Stanton in fact wrote one of the greatest eulogies or ... years on who\nSaid he was quote majestic in his raft which is great phrase Anthony was what was the day died Dugas gender to women's rights convention in the last day of his life in Washington DC and he sat on the stage and he sat next to Susan answer and then he took care of German dropped dead of a heart attack and six PM\nBut he had far more women friends among these reform movements than he actually did male friends\nIn some way that most delicious piece in the relationship of Lincoln and Douglas comes ten years later when ... Douglas dedicates Russia Friedman is monument in Washington DC\nIt's a statue and we have one like it or replica right here in Boston the standing Lincoln his left arm raised over\nNew light on hand and taking a knee if I can I say I mean I'm not quite kneeling but Douglas recoiled that image if he wanted to call it A People's monument right and he began his speech talking about Lincoln not as the great emancipator but as\nPre eminently the white man's president right and then the speech takes an amazing term pores over I\nSay that That's Douglas is sucking the greatest speech I think for an eye open eighth graders a because it just seemed like a moment to place the story right\nWith everything at stake that had been won in the war that speech is really about reconstruction yes and the retreat from reconstruction and know the audience to hit\nThe entire government was their president grant members of the president's cabinet congressmen senators members of the Supreme Court ... it's everybody that would be at at a state event that inauguration\nNo black person had ever address that group of lots ... and no black person ever did again into Brock Obama was inaugurated ...\nI have said that President Lincoln was a white man and should the prejudices\nCommon to his countrymen total words the color race here from the genuine abolition ground Mr Lincoln seemed tardy code do and in different but measuring him by the ... of his country\nSentiment that he was about as a statesman to consult he was with\nZealots radical and determine though Mr Lincoln shared the prejudices of his white fellow country men against the negro is hardly necessary to say that in his heart of hearts\nHe knows and hated slavery the man who could say they do we hope fervently do we pray that this might teach school of war\nShould soon pass away yet if God widows\nIt could take you to all the wealth how by two hundred years of bondage she'll have been wasted in each drop of blood drawn by the last\nShow have been paid for by one drawn by the ... the judgments of the lord a true in righteous altogether gives all needed proof of his feeling on the subject of ...\nIt's an honor speech he says look\nAnd this is by the way election year Eighteen Seventy six it's the centennial year year of the American centennial is reconstruction gonna last or die is right on the table and it comes in the wake of so much brutal use of violence and terror across the south now for years\nDugas says\nAbraham Lincoln was preeminent lay the white man's president he was your president nine hours\nYou my white fellow Americans were his children I end my people only his step children when he repeats like a month ... you read that first part of the speech and you do a kind of an ouch what is the white\nMan's president going to be a black nationalist diatribe against Lincoln and the country no it's not what he does then he's shifts and he says but under\nHis rule and in due time and he makes that are refrain three or four times and under his Lincoln's rule and in due time\nWe were liberated we became free we became\nEqual before the law and the fourteenth amendment we got the right to vote in the fifteenth amendment under his rule in due time which was Douglas's way I Believe of saying\nThe United states freed us the United states gave us our rights and the United states is bound to enforce and protect that and who's sitting in front of him but the United states the ... Supreme Court the Congress\nAnd it ends with a sort of ... about\nReconstruction and about whether this will be saved or not and of course it's also laced beautifully with all that civil religion he talks about\nThe deadline and yonder Arlington he talks about the majestic dome of the Capitol I mean it's full of the sort of beauty of patriotism I see it as a great reconstruction speech because it comes right as reconstruction is falling apart on the eve of that presidential election which is of course when\nThe bargain is struck that in effect does bring a kind of political ended least reconstruction\nIs Douglas's attempt at a last hurrah to try to rally his own party now which is still in power\nTo whole reconstruction together\nThe lynching speech was the last of the great ones ... Mm [noise] yeah he's confronted by the issue of lynching from really the late Eighteen eighties on but especially in the early nineties\nEither be well had some influence on that because of her great activism about lynching and they became quite close he became a kind of mentor to her\nBut he first fashion the speech while he was in Chicago representing the nation of Haiti to Chicago world's fair and he took a version of it on the road called the lessons of the hour also sometimes called why is the negro Lynch it's actually a very good analysis of how this\nAnd it's no holds barred it's in in ... speech it's an ugly speech is a difficult speech even read it at times\nBecause he uses examples from the press of actual lynchings he talks about the white audience celebrate which we've now learned much much more about adult lynching but in essence that speech given in the last years of his life is Douglas saying\nAll that we fought for all we won the great triumphs and rebirth\nOf the United states is possibly being destroyed now by this phenomena\nHe has a very difficult time in that speech doing what he usually did through his life which is to find some kind of way to end on hope\n... but he does it [laughter]\nLike it or not he hands on this faith that still some how the ... of the constitution will prevail ... knowing where else can you go but to the fourteenth fifteenth amendments where else can you go\nBut to these creeds of natural rights which is worried always gone in way back forty years earlier when arguing for the destruction of slavery\nBut it is remarkable that the end of his life he doesn't in his life an unhappy man by any means ah he had a a very rich domestic situation by the end of his life", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Radio Open Source", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "19"}
