[noise] working in the nearby town is the intention in the extended family of Trump's\nSon in law Jared Kushner prince Mohammed bin ... some odd and Israel's really Netanyahu to spring a military

reckless around prints contacts and consequences of a control the case of what we're after this hour [noise]\nPerhaps a realignment of Muslim populists like turkey against the princes of the Gulf like Saudi Arabia and the Emirates could even get a reset of American thinking we begin with Stephen Kinzer who covered both\nTurkey and Iran for the New York times and escaped into book journalism with his independent mind intact welcome back to these kinds of you wrote a book that I loved most or ten years ago called reset about rearranging our our friends in the middle east is this the moment\nWell that book ... you're right might have been a little ill timed it seems now it'd be more relevant even though it was when I wrote it my idea in that book was deposit the thesis that actually\nSaudi Arabia doesn't make a good fit as a partner for the United states Iran makes a good fit this is so contrary to ah the tablets wisdom in the United states that I think it's difficult for some people do similar but the fact is first of all\nWhat do you look for when you are looking for a country with what you want a partner you want a country whose society is somewhat like your own\nAnd you'd like a society whose government is pursuing geo strategic goals that are more or less in a ... in coalition with yours there there are similar to Iran so that does not fit\nFor Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabian society of nothing like American society we all know this is a place where\nWomen can't drive or vote a it's a giant prison as my Saudi Arabian interpreter\nTold me one day as we were walking around Riyadh um so the society is totally different from ours Iranian society and the other end is very much similar to the United states highly educated very mobile middle class Internet penetration a very sophisticated culture going back many many centuries\nNumber two when it comes to geo political interests Saudi Arabia has been the principal promoter of all the terrorists forces the United states has been facing for the last quarter century\nFor over twenty five years or more triumvirate dot com\nI'm Christopher light and this is open source former ambassador Chas Freeman is a legend in the U.S career foreign service east and west he was the Nixon translator we've not done in the opening of China relations back in Nineteen Seventy two and then he was George H W Bush's man in Saudi Arabia\nDuring the Desert Storm war in Nineteen Ninety One Ninety two to the old professionals I the Saturday and American Blues today look unfamiliar and very dangerous\n[noise] oh I think a shuffle is definitely going on what is most notable is the central absence of the United states\nFrom any of these equations I'm a turkey and Iran are finding common cause and the Turkish needed for energy as Iran has squeezed by American sanctions\nTurkey and Saudi Arabia or back to their old rivalry within for leadership within the Islamic world turkey aligned more or less with the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia against it in the region fishers between\nNeighbors like Saudi Arabia and cut her have now become deep rift um be hard to repair and of course the Saudi Iranian rivalry has reached a level that it never did before an officer Israel is now for the first time\nAn overt partner with a major Arab country\nOn the foreign policy project namely regime change in Iran if you look for an external actor you will find Russia and now the United states is the dominant diplomatic influence ... in the region Mr Putin has a weak hand but he has played it very very skillfully\nSo the rich off what was going on or basically are without much if any American strategic control are important and that means that the region\nIs quite unpredictable you talked about the possibility earlier of a war with Iran yes that's why we're at war would\nBe spearheaded by Israel which would act in such a way is to drag\nThe Saudis would probably cooperate\nWith a about a man driver would be Mr Netanyahu says there's no other minimum is Bolton dumped on son\nJohn Bolton has never were met a war he didn't like and there's been passionate against Iran use passionately for Israel so there you have the\nConnection to the White House the allows actors in the region whether Israeli or sodium to manipulate American policy\nWhat's gonna happen chose round there is a great answer in Arabic to that God Knows\nChina streaming makes is playing for us as diplomat in retirement now at Brown university Sara Lee which is the human rights watch I on the middle east and North Africa\nFor the last decade and more you know jazz Raymond Sarah Hughes says Mohammed bin Salman is scary departure from the Saudi royalty he used to know what's your view of envious\n[laughter] so I think ... are accurate and describing him as scary everything that I'm ... Mann is doing domestically inside the country are generally a and a extra territorially far away from the country's\nBorders is very very scary um and I think that in um several generations of Saudi leaders uh Mohammed bin Salman is uniquely scary because he has concentrated power in a way that we've never seen before in Saudi Arabia [noise] you\nKnow how did he get the reformer tired I mean so women will be able to drive cars they might even go to the movies on a weekend or when I see is repositioning real labeling Saudi Saudi ... out of the age of oil in the\nNew new industry in high technology or\nDoes that redeem him in their eyes after all this [noise] and somebody else to do that rule\nWell I I I mean there's\nNo doubt the decision to allow women to drive it was very positive on that one I think has extremely broad support in Saudi Arabia where more than fifty percent of the population\nIs under the age of thirty a ...\nAnd so he was right to know that the er aggressive policy the kingdom a from a ... of the kingdom banning women on driving\nFor example a ... a ... an ending that would meet with\nMuch support or however he has very deliberately\nTaken that measure and other uh liberalizing measures let's say like a reopening movie theaters\nOr in the country in a way that makes clear that he decides and nobody else has a say in fact he's very liberally jailed a activists including women's rights activists who campaigned for the women's rights\nTo go I sure am not because he wants them to have a very clear message that only he gets to decide what changes in the country\nAre envious so I made a sort of still visit United States including Harvard and MIT and that their presidents or whatnot miniature\nDoesn't key billionaires in this country as well as on from how did he get that notion and how do they get the assignment in to be part of this alliance the anti Iran alliance with Trump with Israel\n[noise] well when you look at and Samantha such a from deputy crown prince as the favorite son of king ... non\nUh to basically carrying out a coup against Mohammed bin Nayef the man who was crown prince or in Saudi Arabia but also interior minister and Saudi Arabia for many decades and who had extremely close ties with the Pentagon and the\nCIA and the state department for many decades um haven't been ... men was able to come in and elbow\nUh he has been out of office at the gate and acceptance and approval\nOr in the Washington establishment and abolition because he was deliberately marketed as such\nA and and I want to be accepted by the way he in by Israel uh men go after the supporters of Israel and the very very strong support that he received the partnership a he had with leading voices and leading figures particularly from the ...\nBut also from Israel um led to his emergence as a force of power as unacceptable force of power in the United\nStates and and the quid pro quo I think has been very clear\nAh in that he has been very much a all aligned and and for the first time publicly aligned with Israel are talking about having a relationship with Israel that has never before it happened on but also are not coming out against a Jared\nThat of course peace plan a as well as my main silent on the move of the embassy to Jerusalem\nWho who are the only was gonna say who has a say now from the CIA to Israel to the royal family as to whether he stays or goes after this\nAwful to show the murder\nWell it's it's it's I ... you know if I'd known who can make a change um the problem is that even if king says nine I'm wanting\nTo change his son from power he is widely reported to have dementia and they have very limited moments that city\nWhether he is wearing off of the crisis that his son his thoughts of the country into a and\nHas the capacity to move out of office and replace him that the big question mark I'm an ex capacity for change might come from other royal prince is other other power centers in the country who Mohammed bin Salman has alienated in his ... is\nA central location of power and the ruthless\nA attacks jailing defunding of everyone else in the country who might be a threat to him um for all those who might want to change it and if there's some kind of an internal fatty cool or it may well succeed if it has the support of the United states\nCertainly but since and by Steve Simon joins us from Amherst College among Middle East policy wonks you're known Steve is the rare one with a deep back on and the religious cultures of the region\nThe time it was the rock Obama's Middle East men on the national Security Council last I heard see if you were working on a book titled the long goodbye United States in the middle east from it's not going to Lucian to the Arab Spring where are we now\n[noise] [laughter]\nWell [laughter] you know I think is as far as the ... keep going yeah well\nAnd you know to have a perspective a sense of perspective but his chest or was saying before I think quite quite rightly the United States isn't\nMuch of a presence here in this equation uh and uh I think that's part of a boy or a general trend of the United states distancing itself from the region because um you know American presidents see a less of a payoff for American intervention or involvement\nThe annual celebration of all things Halloween October twenty seventh through the thirty first details at Harvard Square dot com [noise]\nI'm Christopher Lyden this is open source or guest Shereen on a daily teachers education at Michigan State university and she tries to teach the\nRest of us on line about the Saudi war on Yemen\nWhere she grew up welcome to open source Shereen\nTell us about Yemen located for us and then describe this war and I have to say we're all embarrassed not to know more about it is an embarrassment to our journalism right there but tell us what you know please I think\nWell thank you for having me on the show and also thank you for recognizing not because it's been a really long struggle for us a bit the last three and a half years to try to shed light on this issue given its um\nYou know incredible tool that it's taken on so many millions of human beings lights and Yemen\nAre about Yemen is um you know Saudi Arabia southern at Saudi Arabia southern border it is down the middle east porous entry and um has seen a lot of people especially after the twenty eleven uprisings that took over in various parts of the Arab world including in and\nUm and unfortunately we are here today because some of the Saudi intervention that began in twenty Fifteen and has now lead to creating the world's worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen\nI'm drawing a picture what kinds of people what livelihoods no oil I'd taken 'em\nNo oil which is why you don't hear about it very much um but the previous president of a thirty three years in Yemen was a strong ally of the U.S and um I you know under the Obama administration the drone wars began in Yemen offensively to to read the country of ...\nUm and after the President Assad to step down I'm following the twenty London protest\nAnd his vice president was placed as interim president for two years his term expired and he was given an extra year and after that expired as well\nIt was a lot of um uh people in the country there was still called for a constitution and rejecting the constitution Yemen unlike its neighbors is not a salt in it it's not a um kingdom it's not\nAn ... and you know they're scared to a democracy in Yemen and yeah unfortunately that was some\nCo-opted from the people and a civil war began um largely you know people trying to vie for power thing or a\nPower shift was taking place in Yemen but you know all of that we we hear about Yemen as a civil war right now and um that can be further from the truth because how is it a civil war and that may be\nAble to ask you is also there's also pictured as a\nAs a ... an Iranian or adventure to and then what has to be confronted is it or isn't it\nThis is what they told the Americans and apparently the Mac and seem to still delete it I just say to your guest steep Simon talking about their interventionist policies Iran and how\nThey were the Obama administration was convinced that this was a a good way of dealing with Iran in Yemen and we know that Iran is not in Yemen\nYemen is that located at a strategic location which is the point I'm the streets of Bob and Mendez wary about four million barrels of oil traveling with every single day of course there is a strategic importance there for the Obama administration to protect and\nFrankly the Saudis told them that this was going to be a very quick war they called it decisive storm they expected it to and within a couple of weeks maybe a month or so at most they didn't expect any kind of resistance in the country they didn't expect the distance that this a conflict with John for so long\nBut you know here we are three and a half years later the Saudis have blockaded that country Lansing area which is why millions of people are literally starving to death yet we're expected were expected to believe that the Iranians are somehow managing to smuggle weapons there's no evidence of that ... um there's no Iranian presence on the ground is is not Syria\nUm and like your first guest Stephen I'm Kim jung mentioned this is a very much a one sided war\nSurvey was written I'm Wondering for you at human rights watch somebody has made the construction suggesting that the least\nAh the crown princes hundred to ... as parents would have to stop that more tomorrow what could stop it actually\nWell absolutely I mean Saudi Arabia could\nStop the war Saudi Arabia is the primary aggressor in this war though it hides behind a coalition and Saudi Arabia started this war in Yemen um agree completely with the commentator a previously that this was a fantasy that would be a war of a couple of weeks\nAnd the only real reason that the war was started was so that young crown prince could justify a his new title is minister of defense or someone who actually had an experience fighting and winning a war in fact he's shown and proven himself to be the opposite of qualified for that was\nA resident of war\n[laughter] and it read that resume were absolutely except if anything this is the resume that prove why not only he should be fired but he should be jailed I mean Saudi Arabia has been carrying out\nThe most atrocious war crimes or in a a yet man a bombarding uh schools universities\nHospitals are using cluster munitions littering the the the the country uh and I must also emphasize it primarily using American and British weapons\nUh and the role of America in this war is not just to sell a weapons or or even to you know generally vaguely support\nA Saudi Arabia in the war the United states of the party to the war the United states is actively providing refueling assistance has actively provided targeting assistance obviously they bad targeting assistance\nAnd so whatever is happening in this war the United states as a party to it a complicit in it and is responsible for\nThe uh of violations little laws of war the war crimes are that are taking place\nAnd again and just to go back to to to your commentator Mr Simon's comments unfortunately uh the the support for the war in Yemen is by far the greatest foreign policy failing\nOf the Obama administration and it's it's really quite tragic or that the price the bill for the Iran deal was signed by the Yemeni people\nSusana stranger tell there are Republicans in Congress who who hate this war against John I'm ... what's the possibility of mobilizing American opinion and government then you come in power against it\nI think that there's this looming possibility that a Janelle ... murder\nWill prompt Congress injured green\nAnd ... and do something to bring us assistance\nTo the show the number of the war effort to an end and at the same time to put diplomatic pressure on the Saudis and the ... to support you were brokered peace process in Yemen there's a slim chance of that I'm\nA I'm skeptical that the Republicans will be able to mobilize a coalition on the hill a really to make that\nWork and it's not something that can be done quickly either or because it would probably require some kind of legislation [noise] so um you know it it wouldn't be a miracle cure even if this happened and I think the chances are slim but there is a chance\nTo censor um ... get out of that war somehow\nThink it's true as you heard earlier that the United states\nHe's in the middle east we don't have a ambassadors there that's a perfect example but let's not take from that phrase the idea that we're somehow disconnected from this war I Want to emphasize what you just heard without the United states this war couldn't be going on we are providing the targeting assistance from the refueling\nSo we are involved in some ways in a worse and more and the deeper way than we have been in the past because we're involved through others over who not only we have no control but we over we desire to exercise control the worst piece of this isn't this war really is not about him and\nNobody cares about Yemen it's just the battleground and having lived through other wars like the one in Nicaragua which had nothing to do with Nicaragua just required Nicaraguan to supply the dead people so outside forces could make their point that's what's happening in Libya in uh in Yemen\nUp and ask for the fact that a Yemen was the worst foreign policy disaster of the Obama administration\nIt certainly looks that way now but if you're from Libya or slow down or Syria you could see that there's a lot of competition see\nSee that and it's not about you know what is it about that\nI think it's about Saudi Arabia's desire to show that it can crush every she uh influenced movement which will then described as being pro Iran Saudi Arabia has tapped into an obsession in America with Iran\nJust like the way so many dictators tapped into our obsession against communism and they use that obsession has a way to get themselves permission to do whatever they want we have convinced ourselves to such a degree about the evil of Iran that were able to look away from even the kinds of horrific crimes that are unfolding in Yemen", "show_name":
