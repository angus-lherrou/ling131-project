Iraq but the problem in these ... going to come from I did it the back of all the lights\nAre calculations elites are actual store that energy really ... walked allies in an age of ...\nAh the title UK capacity for generating electricity last year was just over a hundred and ...\nWhich I Would time roughly ... million ... well last year in the ... people board Fifteen billion lead to the ... so you're talking\nIs that where it wasn't just nice at the flooding points would need Voss nobody needed vows to match\nThe light just exactly and and you know I'm only ... main right it'd be great to have clean ... pass but we were going to need well let me wants than a thousand times as much electricity is we have now\nIt's just it's crazy amounts of more electricity if we're going to challenge alleged vehicles so we're going to yeah look I Need to build a lot of power stations before because can you take\nA very climbing you lived deep in the countryside or some way from London um I don't know if you'd be good for you and that's\nWhat I'm seeing a rise ... out and steaks and people having high costs and they use the electric calling like pointing it out like lay and then to get out they dance recounting we switched to touch on that you'll know\nThat it's not as much the heart of White House what about going ... as an electric very\nI I Would potentially be out for I mean I think yes we write to discuss the ... and look at how quick he calls came and you know we get we did we sat around saying oh God what are we going to get help ... from the patch with patients well clearly\nThey will pay it's ... it's a slight chicken and egg isn't that we need to have enough for that should cause to people who invest in putting in these challenges in building the ... and then to build the ... not until ... says he's going to sort of cracks us I think\n... the the new affordable testimonial phrase about thirty forty thousand dollars which is still pretty chunky still uh it's it's moving in the right direction\nThis Sunday Brazil goes to the polls to decide between the far right candidate ... scenario and the left wing workers' party candidate Fernando had died in the second round of the presidential election it's being attempt pasture his campaign and the key weapon has been the messaging service work fat\nThe b._b._c. investigation uncovered how political campaigners have use software that scrapes Facebook for citizens from numbers and then ultimately ... messages and asked them to offset groups\nJudy underground Yani from BBC News Brazil told me about this investigation and explain to just how important ... has become in Brazil\nOnce it is very important the company says a hundred and twenty million people use what's up in Brazil and the population is two hundred and ten million it\nHas become and Brazil almost like a social media and not only an instant messaging app where people participate in groups with people they don't know from around Brazil and chat with them one hypothesis is that this happens\nBecause of how ... networks offer what's up for free without discounting the Internet data so it's\nIt's a cheap and readily available to an how easy being abused during the present interactions\nSo we found out that there are ... that are buying devices that can scrape people's numbers from Facebook\nAnd then use these numbers to a target them with lots of messages they can put people in in lots of groups and they can just send the message is individually about candidates or when they put people in lots of groups one market here who I spoke to was\nTold me he would put a a a person and a group\nAnd the group would have a name that is not related to candidates specifically like political debate and then people would start talking but there were would be two people infiltrated from the campaign that will try to lead these people on and make them support the candidate and this is\nJust a little fringe activity or is it an awful lot of this happening\nWhile we can't say for sure how many people are using this but in our report we saw that this has has been used by different candidates in Brazil and different parties lots of different parties\nAnd it was up has played a big part in this campaign in Brazil are very big part uh so we have sixty six percent of the voters saying that they have used watts up they use lots up in Brazil\nAnd uh the far right candidate presidential candidates ...\nAh who's come pain is is being played a lot uh in in what is this against Facebook's rooms in any way well it is against Facebook's rules Facebook fed and Facebook told us it is investigating a the claims\nA it is also against a lots of rules and watts of has been a trying to shut down spam accounts what they say they said that they have closed thousands of Spanish towns in Brazil\nAnd the justice system in Brazil or doesn't let a clear if it's a against the law or not\nIt hasn't a written laws thinking about Watson this year until specialist in the electoral justice in Brazil\nOr disagree between what is it legal and what is not we can only say that illegal database is being used to get people's phone numbers that is legal\nThat's Judy on the run your only from BBC News Brazil or Tim ... is our special guest um it's it's two years ago that we began not supposed to worry about the impact of social media on of actions with the U.S presidential elections\nUm and it keeps on going on in its own was Facebook isn't it Facebook's role in this because of course what was that just keeps on ... ringing the alarm bells and they don't seem to be able to do much about\nIt when someone has to be learning about this kind of thing for more than ... it's actually but he got fashionable two years ago for various reasons yes I I think you need you know we tend to do the same problem which is how our politicians today again to get their messages across to people on campaign the way that we all ... completely tied up with social media\n... the politicians are going to get to that and then you get these questions of well why did they get the data Halladay targeting people the messages\nI I think things have ... ... but he's having conversations if he were political candidate he would also try and do that\nNow in this particular case face but it does seem to be the ... Leakey with people's time numbers\nHot but it kind they say the these are all the the question if I were suddenly being added to grapes gang well who is this and why am I being added to this I think I'd be annoyed\nThat I think there's always a danger is confusing the specifics of highland messed isn't paying for the call\nI mean if you if you think that the way that campaign to being conducted in terms of the content is a problem I think that's why you need to focus\nOn we've seen more ovens this week vice was not cutting well for instance in sight news the news is that of a political weapon in the United states more than ... a whole soccer about the caravan of migrants\nBut it's a kind of impossible ... social media because that whole\nModel is everybody ... and everybody else we don't control the content\nAnd so if not you'll sets up whose job is it going to be to say well this is acceptable and this is not acceptable and and I think is a real problem it was an easy answer that you can say that should be government regulation and then you effectively have\nState censorship of what's acceptable and what isn't or if you get the companies themselves to police it well then you've got private companies in Silicon valley deciding what we can read and what we count rate so it is a problem I didn't want the answer is\nWell we're going to leave you with that one also has a story we've covered the many times on checked and then when we come back to thanks to my social guests to measure how this affects muggy technology called ... very climate and you can read all of our stories or BBC adult comb fresh technology lots of videos losses stories\nPlenty plenty of information that does it get during his again in the tent\n[noise]\n... river BBC World service from the U.S has made possible by the American public media\nWith support from viable European made language learning program battled futures practical conversation in Spanish French German and other languages are available in the app store ...
