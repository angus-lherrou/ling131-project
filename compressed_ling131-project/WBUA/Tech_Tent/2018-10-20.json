in the technology business I'm Rory captain giants and this week we find out what I've often dated them from what's that tells us about Russian propaganda on the social network\nIn the week uh ... gave evidence to British lawmakers we off where there was more than they gave me and we meet the man with a low tech approach to helping African farmers share ideas by then my boss fun\nJoining me this week is BBC technology reporter does that mean climbing high very high like a really good to have you to guide us through the stories and my special guest is Mona El ... from the opposite Internet Institute's welcomed mono and they have good to have you have the first time his place that was coming out\nFact they have to be\nKept something in the region of of fifty chickens and has a less was his entire livelihoods will pay for his kids to go to school at dinner and he finally table or other diseases renting face lock it killed so you know roughly half of them in a space with a couple of days [noise]\nOlder that in a moment but first on Wednesday Twitter released of all state to dump ten million tweets a total of three hundred and sixty gigabytes of material relating to Russian and Iranian so cool to troll ...\nThese are attempts to use Twitter to sway public opinion around the world\nMost of the tweets came from Russia's Internet research agency which has been accused of trying to sow discord in the United states and intervene in the twenty sixteen election on the houses don't Trump\nNotes which released this treasure trove of data as a tool for research is and journalists David Wells access to the think tank the Atlantic council whose digital forensic research that took a closer look the technique employed by the ...\nBeen no matter who led the effort the lab told me what they found\nThe assumption that being that the ... the Russian from operation peak in twenty six to ... during the election and then in the Sunday Seventeen but actually the highest moment was late twenty four twenty Fifteen and that's because the majority of the posts are actually in Russian and they were targeting the Russian opposition and late Sunday fourteen was when that was really happening\nBut you then sore I presume the tactics developed\nThat's right you you could really see them learning how to use social media\nOn the stump that complaint was really quite boring it was a lot of shows from websites and it was a lot of studies stilted comment and then you can see the individual accounts started getting more aggressive and more edgy I'm trying to be more funny on them all they did that the more they were getting audience response and they were also watching the real world I I get the feeling\nThat they were obsessively watching the news channels and so when you called big events like um the the shooting in some other you know in California and December twenty Fifteen you could see the Russian trolls jumping in I'm most of them will be pushing the message that this is why Americans need guns and then some of them were pushing the message this is why Americans need gun control\nSo they were watching for breaking news and then looking at how they could\nTurn up the heat on the debate\nDid you get the idea that there was a controlling mouse to mind behind it or they will heading off in different different directions\nThat was definitely some sort of editorial control going on um it didn't seem to be very fast moving and particularly in the early days you'd see a time that something would happen in the U.S let's say on ... on Monday\nAnd Tuesday individual Russians roles and start reaching content at it and then I wouldn't say they all come out with the same ... they do these massive bursts of activity around ... hundreds of times in the day and you couldn't even imagine the editorial meeting which went on Tuesday evenings I write labs tomorrow this is your hashtag and this is what you'll be posting\nYoung women because we have a huge deficit and skills and our country huge deficit and people are studying computer science asked them are all kinds of areas are actually crucial to the future most of the ...\nYou were asking that river any different questions you want to interrupt you get like you might with a witness you weren't doing follow ups you are protecting the right but with a lot smarter than it was well of course it broke\nBoth been programmed in and phone so he knew the ... knew the questions but\nIt wasn't meant to be a ... kind of special most it was trying to do was one demonstrate the ... program of the young students Middlesex University a really great university or the ... that they had done that take an enormous amount of time but also showcase some of the work off we're both ...\nTalks about the ... the uh uh it it did and um it's companion soldiers in terms of a health care which is going to be a hugely important um with the arrival of both of us revolution\nOn you giving a false idea of what a ... a professor at Oxford University who leads the AI or if it's said a on switch that it was a a a gimmick and gave the the wrong impression that I\nWhen I saw that tweets might have to say it was incredibly snooty we were trying to bring the community to millions of people in fact that you're talking about it being on the BBC a or a television um it's being across the media because the public and also with\nAll the ... revolution in the same way that necessarily policymakers might be and it's going to have a huge impact so we were showcasing the work of students\nI'm showing potentially ... can be done to put a little taste for what could happen in the future but also stressing that we need to meet all skills deficit because of all the way our society is going to fundamentally change over the next ten Twenty years\nRobert house on and pay a ... else how are you are listening to that um I don't know if you saw the ... in in the house of commons it was quite amusing did you think it was a useful exercise\nI get sick in time we had like major ... taking over ... last year or Saudi Arabia gave a Robin called sofia citizenship and yeah eight appearances I think that was too isn't it\nWe have this technology and I think it's it's good to to do this too racy but we're ... we're going to another Arab but I don't know how useful politically and how he feels that that's the money was\nVery climbing you and I both Mitt path rising\n... oh yeah well they know that smoke that you'd go completely false impression of how clever those rebels were\nYeah I think I think you and I are around ... we'd probably see see through at that and there's a big marketing campaign behind ... and and my general expenses that said no I ... think that you know you think you're just going to have a chat like we are and it's like I said\nYeah you don't get a good conversation with the right but not enough [noise]\nLet's move on the smartphone has revolutionized all kinds of industries but one business he's trying to show that you can transform farming in developing countries with much simpler phones we from is a social network for farmers in Kenya and Uganda with plans to expand elsewhere in Africa and Asia\nIt depends entirely on text messages which is a form of used to see can share advice and he's just signed up its millions member I spoke to ... founder and chief executive Kenny you and and I asked him what kind of people used it\nAgainst their primary level we're targeting people who don't have those other ways of communicating with each other a so roughly speaking the world about a billion a small scale farmers are mostly in sub Saharan Africans East Asia who have no connection to the Internet and therefore a massive information gap of finding\nA information knowledge and how to improve the farmer or a bottle of disease now so we farm or we need all those farmers to be able to ask a question on anything to do with agriculture in just about any local language for free and get both content back or even off line so using a an SMS message\nSo that technology is very simple technology it's SMS just ... well\nSo it's it's simple in the front and a son that's a mess is obviously a hundred and sixty character it's it's a very simple information format but I think that's inversely related to the complexity of the data science and technology that has to be behind the scenes in order to get get confidence people in such a simple format\nAnd I said when a former U.S as a question for example on on a semester\nWe don't use machine learning and to understand everything that farmers trying to tell us you know what is they're entitled to question where are they order the farming and essentially use that analysis to match them to ... you know three or four people in our entire network that we think can answer that one individual question and get this ... the regional farmer\nNow you'd you'd go to a million members I think you just signed up a million the million member walk what evidence do you have that he's making a difference to people yes all pass a million which\nJust as I was a great milestone for us having one ... um I mean I think the the force than biggest uh indicator of of how much people value it is that they use it and even people who have been with us for two or three years since we launched um so about twenty five percent of all those users actively contribute content every month\nOr which you know it in context as it's probably nearer seven or eight percent on Twitter um you know we know protest more than a million questions and answers every single month\nWhich gives you an indication of the level of content that we find is necessarily a fun systems here that's not a social system its value for their businesses\nAnd people don't come back and keep using things for business unless they're getting some sort of value out of it so I think that's probably the primary indicator would say\nUh we also obviously speak a lot to our farmers on the ground or we need to understand how they're using it and what sort of benefits from it and we've got some you know many great stories of farmers have um you know literally had information it's helped them save their their livelihoods and farms through before\nIt was an example of how it's being used a ... I mean the example\nI I Would give is that there's a a chicken farmer that was using we farm in Kenya called called capital he kept something in the region of of fifty chickens I'm as and this was his entire livelihoods paid for his kids go to school up at dinner and he finally table\nOr on a diseases ... killed so you know roughly half of them in the space of a couple of days or any ask questions about this and we farming get information back\nA which vaccines to you is how do I just thought the disease spreading a and he managed to save the rest of east chickens um which is I mean that's that is the minds entire livelihoods and that's that's the kind of light so you know often seems to us fairly basic information but it incredibly fundamental to these farmers that that we find is able to to to provide\nMuch Kenny you in from ... from a Mona El Salvador from the ... Institute a special guest\nAnd that was one of those red now public or the positive stories about social media or five years is a guy and one of the social media is going to say the word ... which is the positive uses we're all that changed totally\nTo Santa and live in ... the year we celebrate and social media we thought it's getting to the world in April people and a three time regimes to move to towards democracy to mobilize mass as\nIt was the voice of opposition but this was in ... near where government and regime weren't involved in these platforms it was a platform only for activists real people are very very few people didn't practical things like that yeah ... exactly will use\nLater on we start moving to regimes and the bad guys as we can call going there and propagating to to their own benefits so it's now battles between two I can see that the people people who want to have a voice and people who want to make you eat them\nSo this is why we now are talking about the negative effect however we cannot forget that social media still can't connect people together so have many many positive effects but\nOf course the perfect and against the highlight of the time\nUh I mean ... very important um I and eighties eighties connecting people in positive ways as well or is it do you have a kind of overall view of whether we are getting more good than bad from it\nBut we're still getting good but we are getting better now in the last seven maybe seven years ago I Would have failed because we're getting all mean good but now we're getting good and bad on the bad maybe can't take over if we couldn't control it's regulated nature it's it's under control maybe when no\nOne very brief woods and use every climbing are you still positive about social media\n[laughter] I think it gets a big kicking and right and you say that I think is it all the gates that comes out but it's not I for one another\nThat's all we've got five four and they go on a positive ... thanks to my special guest Mona El ... from the opposite ends of the Institute thanks very climbing read all of her stories in mind that BBC don't come flashed technology and they forget to join us again in the tech tent at the same time next week [noise]\n[noise] distribution of the b._b._c.
