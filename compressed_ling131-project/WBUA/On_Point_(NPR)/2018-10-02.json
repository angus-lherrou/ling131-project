Bush she served it FDIC chief for five years until two thousand eleven\nWell a decade after the financial crisis what does she live bears the now the FDIC was created in Nineteen thirty three to restore public confidence in the nation's financial system in two thousand Eighteen is the system deserving of that trust\nThis hour on point Sheila bear bailouts and the future of the American financial system and she lived there joins us now from Washington Welcome to on point thank you thank you for having me\nWell you know I Know a from reading about your career that you first started paying attention to subprime mortgages back in\nTwo thousand one and two thousand two but I see here that it was in two thousand was sick and soon as you you came on board at FDIC that you actually asked uh your colleagues to buy a database of subprime loans from a company called lone performance [laughter] what'd\nYou say yes I'd been in academia for several years and I had not been really a working in the mortgage area and a bit retained an interest in it and when I got back\nThe staff or as the FDIC were were already on top of this they're worried about it\nBut we couldn't really see what was going on because the these mortgages are being secured ties with all of our reporting systems\nWere geared towards assets aid in this case loans that were actually on the banks book and in these for mostly we're not even being originated by banks are the big bang for providing some support to the non bank originator is here we're doing this and helping them package them in the securities and sell them off\nSo this was data that showed those original mortgages that\n... it it shows what the underlying mortgages that we're here to fish and trust and and so\nWhen you took a look and when your colleagues at if you if you took a look I mean what did you see where are you concerned\nYes we were astonished [laughter] I couldn't believe what I saw oh my gosh so as as you noted in your introductory remarks ah my history this goes back to the early to thousands\nWhere we're seeing this kind of abusive lending but it was really ... it was the marginal you know players in the mortgage industry that we're doing it and they were targeting low income neighborhoods minority neighborhoods and uh so I left and came back in ... and this these these lending practices on mainstream everybody was doing um\nSenator Jeff flake is in Boston you know so Massachusetts secret courts radio Boston\nHeaded ten they'll review our supporters include artistry humanities greatest party on earth October thirteenth celebrating creative team if you expanded epicenters grand opening more greatest party on earth dot com\n... ethics museum presenting ... of the Forbidden City fix with the treasures made for the most powerful women of imperial China open now [noise] P.

head of the FDIC from two thousand six to two thousand eleven\nAnd we're talking about the role that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation played in a the financial crisis in getting the nation out of it and what she ... sees now when she looks across the financial system or whether she sees a healthy system or not and she lived there\nJoins us from Washington today a Sheila there's a story that you tell in your two thousand twelve book I think bull by the horns if it's this is a story that the very beginning of the book and it's just\nIt's so telling us how hoping you could read if you could share it once again with us and it's it's a story about um how you in two thousand eight in October two thousand eight you attend is very key meeting at the treasury with Hank Paulson\nAnd I believe what a seven of the top CEOs of the biggest financial institutions in America\nRight yeah well that was um [noise]\nThat was quite a quite a meeting I was thankful and they called it I was there ... there Tim Geithner was there the head of the other banking regulators or were there and um the purpose\nOf the beating was basically for us to tell the banks that uh we were going to take some interventions and that we wanted them all to participate there is this the there was a you know the ... the court center piece of it was the tarp capital investment yet are going to\nPut under the veins of dollars into a new capital into these banks are the FDA she was going to start within limits and for the we're going to start a year and she uh the debt that they needed to issue to roll expiring debt we had because the markets were seized up and they were having hard time refinancing their own debt\nAnd then the fed had trillions of dollars of learning disabilities that they\nThey put into place and so it ... it was basically to explain those new programs and uh\nThey had to take the ... well yeah you know and as I say that I think a lot of\nThat was the was designed to cover up the problems the weaker banks like city I think most of them not all but most of them probably could've bumble through\nBut we didn't want to test that and ah and also there was a lot of fear that if you just singled out certain banks for assistance you are going to make them look bad and you know exacerbate their problems right so uh yeah that was the reason\nWhy I got to just read a paragraph from from from the book because it's so telling about\nI think that the the state of the financial system that maybe ... many Americans just weren't aware of before two thousand eight you say you know this is the meeting a Monday October thirteenth ... doesn't it you say nine men did milling around in the room men I should know right nine men [laughter]\n... not really [laughter] ... their buy treasury secretary Henry Paulson collectively they headed financial institutions representing about nine trillion dollars an asset or Seventy percent of the U.S financial system and then you write I Would be damned if I Would let them see me shaking\n[laughter] yeah that's right [laughter] well I Do think you know there was this um [noise] there was even balance of power and and I still think we suffer from it that\nUh you know who works for he does does it ever worked for the future you know or or did just that the banks banks and the safety net the get FDIC Deposit Insurance and fed access and all that\nDo they have public obligations and do you know or are they a a whole a beholden to government to fulfill those obligations and and abide by the regulatory process we have in place for them because we know that all of these so government supports like Deposit Insurance can can offended by a risk taking and too big to fail\nJust really doubles down on that so yeah I I did not I didn't want there to many question about the balance of power I think it was in charge and it wasn't you know and I certainly didn't look like it looked like I was the weak link so uh you know I think that some of them told me they're afraid of me I don't know if there that's a joke [laughter]\nI can I can\nBe a little directed at times I Will be the first to admit that but I I just think that it was important for the government to be the person in charge and well I mean I just\nI I'm a I'm sue the numbers just looking at them the sentence written on the piece of paper in front of me it's still shocks me\nNine trillion dollars and edit Seventy percent of the U.S financial system represented by the decisions made by these nine men I mean isn't that that is the perfect summation of the problem of too big to fail and to ensure connected to feel that we had well\nIt it it is and whether we fixed that I don't know and uh I certainly the system is more resilient now but you know I I'm very concerned about all this recent rhetoric\nAnd Tim Geithner obviously you know I've had our disagreements and and their policy disagreements but here's another one 'cause his emphasis right now is all about expanding the government's bailout tools you know based on the assumption that we're going to have another cycle we're going to have another financial system that's going to need government help and so we need\nMore bailout tools and I think that's ...\nThe system we still have that we don't want to say that system\nThat you would let things go down now\nOh well we we have something called title to and which we did not have a ... in two thousand eight and yes\nThat allows regulators the FDIC working with the treasury and the fed\nTo you know put it back into a resolution process to break it up you know keep it bad assets out impose the losses on the shareholders and the and secured creditors which is where the losses should be and where the losses are also if you go through a traditional bankruptcy\nTo fire managers to fire board members to recapitalize the bank you know and and you're bringing new investors new management\nTo and and in return they healthy parts of the bag back to the private sector so yes that is all that is basically what you do it a bankruptcy this is a government run bankruptcy process there are some you unique things about large financial institutions that make traditional bankruptcy a difficult to you is\nThat is a tool we didn't have and to them we have now the regulators need to be willing to use it and importantly signal now remind them mark as it is it this is going to be the new paradigm this new process not bailouts would accountability Wilson and you can ask you know of so many questions you live there because I I I\nI'm just wondering outlook I I I don't want to come across as some like crazy anti capitalist has not ... not I'm not that at all but some people might be wondering why wait why even wait for the next financial crisis I mean as long as the banks are too big already won a boy yeah\nWell uh there are people who have that view and I can understand that view and ah I don't think there's a political will ah in Washington to do that I mean and this is bipartisan and unfortunately you see\nLegislation going through now the reduced uh three the largest banks we have a reduced their capital by twenty percent this uh this build that just passed\nAnd in that kind of signal the fed to weaken some of the capital rules and the stress stretching requirements and now you've got Republicans I'm ashamed to say 'cause I'm a Republican and I thought ... you know Republicans are market oriented\nA lot of Republicans trying to pressure the federal reduce capital even more so that's a political environment you know big banks are back in charge [laughter] that's a political environment in DC right now I don't see that there's any political will to break them up or do anything else and and my fear is is that we're going to have to have another disaster before\nThey finally happens but yeah I mean if they needed a bailout again I I think ... our democracy cannot survive that and if they think\nSedated and again she lived her\nI said I don't our democracy could not survive another round of bailouts it just you can't look look at what happened you know people who discount the role of the two deaths and the crisis\nIn an even you know the eight million homes lost nine million jobs lost you know the terrible hits the public purse still people struggling and lower middle income families um\nThat started with the crisis and that some of that is still remnants of the crisis in ... and ... and I think that's a lot of what if he's in the discontent we have right now so that suggests we're going to bail out together that's going to be the new paradigm\nThat we don't really need a bout of regulation trying to prevent crises we just need repaired with more taxpayer bailout tools I don't think democracy is going to tolerate that well you\nKnow so okay that's quite a briefing thing that you said and yet I have been seeking with you and other people who were very key to the uh in the two thousand two thousand nine period any financial observer most people say we probably will have another crisis no so how ... square with our democracy yeah well\nIt's a if it well like I said you're hearing different ... and different people [laughter] I'm not I don't know that we're going to have another crisis I I I think we but what I think we should be doing now that we are towards the end of the cycle\nWe should be preparing for the next downturn in economic cycle if banks have enough capital and stable funding to continue functioning when\nThe economy turns you know and their credit losses go out that's what happens in a downturn if they have their resenting continue functioning and continue lending we will have a downturn we will not have a crisis we will not have a deep recession it's all about how we see in the financial system is which is why now\nAnd crack a wiccan gallery featuring Julian obese knew his paintings prints that animated work to do very strict Boston or crack how we can go ... [noise]\nAnd here today not the the\nAnd terrified Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ... in a historic hearing on Capitol Hill what impact could their testimony have on public opinion and how the Senate handled his nomination\nCountry is watching how we handle these allegations on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nTomorrow morning at five or Ninety point nine W. B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station\nIt on point I'm making a taco birdie okay here's a pop quiz for you how many American Soldiers are in Syria today\nThe answer around two thousand and why are they they're well to fight ISIS of course but that mission could be changing last week national security adviser John Bolton said us troops will not leave Syria quote as long as Iranian troops are outside\nProxies and militias end quote\nWell that's a sharp departure from the military's current mission and for the first time it ties us goals in Syria directly to countering Iran\nSo listeners what do you think if you applauded when President Trump vowed to bring American troops home do you think we need to stay in Syria to take on Iran now we're one eight hundred for two three to five five is eight hundred for two three talk\nWell joining me now from Beirut, Lebanon is Liz Sly Beirut bureau chief for the Washington Post lose it's good to have you\nThank you for having me also with us from Tyson's corner Virginia is ... rent for he is a reporter for the military times Kyle welcome to you hey thanks for having me\nAll right so let me start with you I mean you wrote about uh about what John Bolton said in this article for military times by that we've got a link to it at one point radio dot org how big of a shift in rhetoric is this regarding the U.S mission in Syria\n[noise] it seems to be kind of a more over\nUm way to say that the\nPrior to U.S policy goals which were to uh mainly just put us troops in Syria eastern theory in order to fight ISIS is being being expanded\nSo the Pentagon has a readily acknowledged a Pentagon officials up to and including secretary of defense Mattis that us troops are only fighting ISIS however they do play a\nSecondary benefit of balancing against Iranian influence in the country are both in kind of came out and was way more overt in saying that that is the primary goal countering Iran a hence the condition for us withdraw is ah the withdrawal of Iranian forces so that's a changing mission\nOr and expanding of like the mission parameters at least\nRight so I'm seeing here the James Jeffrey ... uh the state department special representative for Syria a following John Bolton is comments said that the United states would maintain a presence in Syria possibly including an extended military mission\nAgain until Iran withdraws us soldiers in military forces it commands and Jeffrey told reporters on Thursday that the president wants us in Syria until that and the other conditions are met\nA but but Kyle I mean the authorization for use of military force that the U.S is operating on in Syria right now those date back to Afghanistan and Iraq right there there are counterterrorism authorizations\nYeah well there's one from two thousand and one which covers all ... and um it's affiliates and those who hire harbored al ... in response to the nine eleven terror attacks and then there's one from two thousand two against Iraq and so neither of those really cover the Iranian mission um and so I think that\nThe way the if they were to continue having a U.S presence in eastern Syria they would try to quote it by saying that us troops are conducting counter ISIS missions primarily and\nUm they would just continue to say\nWell you know it also balances against Iran such as the secondary benefit\nWell Liz Sly you're joining us here from Beirut I mean let me ask you how is uh this new language or or I may be to use ... raise ... description of it more overt language from the Trump Administration how's that going over in the region\n\n[noise] well\nI think people in the Phoenix surprised by the second coming out you can you learn that we've seen that yet because as you remember a few months ago um some said that we're going to be going home very very soon and was actually an expectation that they would eat ... owned by the end of the year\nAnd most of the regional palate I'm invoking Sherry I checked she Russia Jackie\nI'm no everyone else in the neighborhood of being expecting he likes to go and they tried to get you punish the ... the idea that that actually going to be staying ... definitely puts them back like\nIn ... when it comes to negotiate seeing an end to this area and more and I think it's unclear whether that she'll go and eat at the moment\nOkay well let's hear a little bit more ah from what a national security adviser John Bolton said in his ramping up of the anti Iran rhetoric on ... on Monday again he said we're not going to leave Syria as long as Iranian troops are outside of Iranian borders and then on Tuesday he went even further\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed be held up\nTo well the very next day on Wednesday of less meat week some lawmakers did question of the U.S is military role in Syria and this expansion of the military objective they questioned Robert camera andme assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs\nAnd here you're going to hear Massachusetts democratic congressman Seth Moulton pressing came to get more specific about uh Iran and Syria and how that correlates with the mission in fighting ISIS the problem is that national security adviser John Bolton\nIndefinite military presence in Syria until Iran withdraw its for its forces that to me sounds like we're sending our military to Syria to counter Iran\nEspecially because their withdrawal is apparently dependent on actions of wrong not actions of ice or the defeat of ISIS\n... let me ask you about this because it seems as if what ... saying is that if indeed this is why the U.S will be sending troops to Syria and the future that it may be illegal because he they do not have congressional authorization for that\n[laughter] yeah so he's basically making the argument that even if I'm us troops are conducting active operations against Iranian forces or Iranian proxy forces the fact that they're\nIn the region with the mission to balance against those forces or restrict those forces freedom maneuver through eastern Syria means that they are I'm conducting a military operation and therefore the Pentagon the White House needs to come to Congress and ask for a new authorization\nHas the has the White House or the Pentagon shown a willingness to do that\nI mean I don't think that they don't think any real administration has a show in a willingness to ah get a new authorization to use military force ah I mean that's a question of the Aspen brought up\nAh during the past airstrikes that have occurred against the Assad regime in response the chemical weapons attacks some people think that those aren't covered by a either a you enough from two dollars in wanting to I've been to\n... know Liz Sly I mean the secretary of defense James Mattis has repeatedly said\nWe'll talk we'll talk specifically about what he he has said about this new language from the White House but over the many years he has repeatedly said that he sees Iran is the single most quote enduring threat to stability to stability and peace in the middle east in the region\nAnd to that effect you today you just went on a tour of an of an alleged a missile site in Lebanon that the Lebanese wanted to show the Israelis that it wasn't a missiles like can you can you tell us a little bit more about that\nWell yet I'm\nAt the United nations I'm not the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu held up a picture\nOf punk off that he took it as a shock like Jim age and with three things like ours on it who thinks you cut courtship Mikhail sites that\nWhen his while I was at the store and while manufacturing Mikhail to be which could be used to like ... and file such gate the Lebanese fine ministry invited them passages with all the countries that them that you can walk up and then\nUm did you go and visit she's arts people to try to see that they don't contain any child\nSo what we did was we went to sexual we went to the Gulf Coast but that was part on state we shouldn't laugh so then they put you back on the buses and we went to a sports club where we were ... ... and ... type stuff\nAnd then we went to a warehouse with kind of an ... and it was designed to show us the tennis ball it's not in fact storing it in his house in the site to do it was very hot child\nFrom the very simple picture which Netanyahu flash chocolate United Nations exactly why these sites where anyway and um it's where it was hard to tell if we were in the ... and ... and he didn't see any Michelle's\nHuh OK so a bunch so regarding for example um Israel's response to the United states starting to talk about a more permanent or at least in definite presence in Syria

I'm going to get to some colors 'cause we've got folks have been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Schmidt I just want to ask you a quick question here because uh I mean it isn't there an evidence enough or perhaps ample evidence in um the justices own voting records in the decisions that they make\nThat perhaps I don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we\nHad justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be perceived a preferred vote of the president that ... that nominated them and put them on the court to begin with\nYeah this is absolutely true but it's also nothing new we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene\nAs a nominee for the Supreme Court politics play a role as always played a role in some sense and also say if you look at the American people's attitude toward the court most people are if you don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics that politics wasn't placements or on the court\nAnd people often times do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so it's not the idea that\nOnce people see it as in some way to political institution automatically is legitimacy is lost and no longer people are going to follow is dictates\nWell let's go to college here finally and thank you everyone for were free waiting patiently on the line let's go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin\nHi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic don't want to get this is from almost be through it first of all the the point of course is the legitimacy of integrity or public trust but a lot of\nThe perception and if you think about what happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a a justice to repeal replace ... because of Republican saying we will not let him do it\nThat politicized it in the public's eye now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propaganda as a easily manipulated a populist in modern history\nAnd so through the media and through a lot of other things they are uh giving a perception of what is and what is not but to the last several months Donald Trump in his\nA blatant disregard for for for the constitution and Republicans with this don't down we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans or we're gonna go against whatever Democrats saying that a lot of law I think the public trust has been\nShaken and I believe the integrity or it is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put some kind of limits on terms now because it is simply a political position\nWell Erin thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor um at least one you know one side they're about from them from a member of the public about maybe it's time for term limits with justice says\nWell I think term limits as a wonderful idea that's not that for twenty or Thirty years\nOr maybe eleven years maybe Fifteen Years in and out the problem is it'll never happen\nBecause it would require is maybe a constitutional amendment to even getting it through Congress\nOr the the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have term limits are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be hurt who's ... who whose people are older\nYou know who's terms or later and is it going to help the red team of the blue team and they're always be a calculation where if one side thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's going to be a bad thing\nAnd neither side is gonna care much about than herring merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years um\nBut that's what's been I think that's what we're going to be seen for ... for a long time well\nLet's go to Troy who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air Troy\n... thank you very much uh I Will remind people Lindsey Graham supported taken\nW.

grills he's got a new book out at how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation and there before the break we heard from college Steve who was former navy special forces out here in the U.S and he'd he'd gone through the ... the Navy's really rigorous SERE training\nAnd he was talking about how\nUm as one of the toughest things for him was them mental challenge of the forty eight hour period that he had to spend in complete isolation and whether or not you've\nEver experienced a similar challenge or has gone out on one of these survival expeditions without a a a a camera crew and I couldn't let you respond before the break but I wanted to give you a shot at that now\nYeah no fuss was the respect feel service and a lot ... to the\nGuy who ran in the food is your by so right there the bathroom for survival is won or lost in the mind um the sea of training is something I went through like rise with part of the British special forces or it is long it is oh you should it's tough\nAnd the time on the right and I would second what you said Steve ... it's it's hard but you need to kind of get into that mind focus okay we're in today you know however long it's gonna be just break it down into the daily tasks\nAnd I she found ... you get so busy surviving you know use his job off the job and people kind of\nYou know often underestimate how busy this is a loving survived it to look up to yourself and\nAgain you know when we're now as a crew you know women filming stuff everything is so much easier when you have an extra set of hands if you need it you know putting up shelters are getting a fog and someone else to be needed just to put a system that will you do you know the ...\n... everything on the right to send my child that but it's all so busy you know I just remember that see a training I went through to the days on All right it was just doing to a doctor and the sea collecting firewood repairing the setting snags doing that\nAnd by the end is how yeah yeah\nIt's all on your shoulders and then it's not meant to Saudi you got to keep yourself up beef you gotta keep thinking like you know I always say to people and it's survival situation is never letting your mind going to neutral there's always something they are doing to think about the planning\nAnd um and that's why it becomes very draining the times on the road I I think it's three times harder than when you go one other buddy with you\nThere just one of the thing that Steven said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response from you because then I actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he ... he was man and he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training in as thinking he's really highly trained navy special forces a guy\nA and and so he managed to snare rabbit or two but I was wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on television or at least survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is\nYeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on Sallie Mae spending three hours trying to like to five but lives often the reality set in the old days when the Memphis wild shows\nYou know I spent hours and hours doing this or you know hours and hours studying ... obviously that's just going to make a really boring program you know I guess edited down to ... you know it's a bit of music and ... got a guy but\nYou got to the reality of it it is it is hard work for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not being scared to fail and and it's just this is why I said ... the show survivor of summed up three was never give up is all about that too nasty that spirit\nAnd you might have to go through multiple failures hours and days of of getting something wrong before you get success and that's why the rules who we've got to the don't get that determine you know next Saturday the\nThe ... the brave the strongest well so let's do a lightning round the quick quick way here for by the way to rabbits for a few people\nThat's got to be no one do you love food team found in the you know what I ... yeah and I've seen is Seventy says we we run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave with nothing no camera crews running and they have to\nFilm everything themselves that you know we come back a month later and it's like ... like stream weight loss it\nAnd that is the reality of survival is yet you're starving UD hydrated your frighten you wet your cold and ... and you know and that's why it is is is very on glamorous it's right on romantic Ohio reality of survival is great\nSo speaking of the the glamorous part of survival I Do we just got so many questions here a lot of them\nLightning round so I asked a question in just a quick answers that we can get through\nA as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans in survival situation it's violations how miserable is bears intestinal track I mean at least sit there and say why could not be somewhere with some nice soft grubs to eat\nYour mind tests attract needs needs some attention yeah [laughter] you're like I mean they actually took you about the failures number of things have eaten the end of a bad die rare and stuff you know so\nUm but on the whole is you're not getting the land ... by the failures that and your next time I got ... to ... that want to get\nIt right so I get Matt wanted to know how often is buried guessed wrong and ingest poisonous plant or animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said\nBut not but also you got to be super caffeine and what do you I Need make big mistakes once and when it comes to\nYou know poison things I've funky mushrooms and ... you got to really know you stuff and be careful and if the doubt there's no doubt don't need to write you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms you know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas that look like so many things okay and then\nYou know I mean look at that story from Alaska was at one such a great film you know the end of the wiring the Alaskan ... you had a baby coming on your I go around and ran to get it wrong ones out there\nYeah by the way if you have from folks haven't rented Jon Krakauer as original book it's amazing uh Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women\n[noise] well hey listen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild as they make incredible survive as enough taken so many running wild guess\nThat you know you think that the man the the the big Bush ... got the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the little tweak of an actress of the good things you can snap in the wild and she's also dislike made of steel so survive and is all about that in the spirit the alpha muscles\nAnd I'll see an incredible her ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on our team who ... you know such an inspirational survival is so they are living examples to survive is is all about spirit and ... the impulsivity\nUm and actually some of them have the guns the guy with the you know [laughter] or that who was impressive to

with the voice of a Supreme Court justice or because last friday\nOn September twenty seventh just the day after a Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testify before the Senate Judiciary committee it just so happened that justice Elena Kagan was speaking at a University of California Los Angeles law school for them\nNow or I should know I watched the whole forum it was an about an hour and a half long and Brett Kavanaugh name was not mentioned once uh neither by Justice Kagan or by the UCLA moderator of the law school dean Jennifer Munn new kitten\nBut I Want to play for you both here anyway because I think it's as close as we are going to get to knowing what's inside the minds of justice is right now and there was this really interesting moment where ... you can ask Justice Kagan about the lessons that the justices had learned when they only had eight members on the bench after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia\nAnd Alina Kagan said the court has a real interest in preserving its institutional legitimacy and then she said this\nThe courts strength as an institution of American governance depends on it having a certain kind of legitimacy on people believing that\nIt is I'm not simply an extension of politics that it it's it's decision making has a kind of integrity to what that is something different from what you find in the political

national journal Dahlia Lithwick is also with us She's court and law courts in a reporter for slate and host of the economic as pod cast as well and I want to\nThrough a through history here in in terms of moments for different nominees where\nPolitics definitely came into play a first of all let's go back to Nineteen eighty seven here then Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in a press conference in October two days after the Senate Judiciary committee voted to have his nomination put before the full Senate with a recommendation not to consent to the appointment\nAnd obviously a rubber ... ended up not being a elevated to the high court and here he talks about the lasting effect\nOf the politics involved in his nomination\nMost serious and one's been injury and all of this is not for me\nNor is it to all of those were the best leap supported my nomination tomorrow I'm deeply grateful rather the damage to the dignity and the integrity of law in a public service in this country\nRobert Bork in October Nineteen eighty seven fast forward than to October Nineteen Ninety One and here is then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas addressing the Senate Judiciary committee about his confirmation hearings\nThis sort of the national news stories from my standpoint as a black American as far as I'm concerned it was a high tech lunch for up all the black who in any way Jane to think so [noise]\nDo for themselves have different ideas and it is a message that unless you count town to an old order this is what will happen to\nClarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One now move forward still to Merrick Garland who President Obama nominated and um we can't plenty tape there because he never even got a hearing so that takes us then to where we are now in two thousand Eighteen and just last week\nPresent a Brett Kavanaugh defended himself before the Senate Judiciary committee\nAre claiming that Democrats had politicize this process and developed quote a long series of false last minute smears to block his nomination\nThis whole week effort has been a calculated an orchestrated political hair\nFuel to the parents turn up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election here that has been unfairly stoked about more judicial record\nRevenge on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars for the money from outside left wing opposition groups\nDo it this week hoping ... you with us now yeah I'm here great\n... thank you so much so so let me just ask you hearing sort of those voices through history is what we heard last week with Brett Kavanaugh categorically different than the politics that came before in previous nominations\nI you know I think it was a I think that it it's a funny it's there's some perfect symmetry we started with Robert Bork what Robert Bork did at his hearing that was\nProbably tactically a mistake when he talked really in Folsom clear and very very certain\nWays about his own views there's a reason that people stopped doing that after Bork a and learn to say I'm just a robot in a neutral umpire so in a sense what Robert Bork was being\nA barked over was in fact how he thought about judging how he thought about the constitution then when you fast forward to last week and judge Kavanaugh you have a very very strange almost the mirror image where since then there's this long tradition of judges including judges by the way with\nVery very very extensive legal records um records of writings records of speeches and communications and records of\nTheir actual ... views standing up and saying but I'm also just a robot a I have no views balls and strikes and in a weird way I think that Robert Bork was the last time we had anything close to a truthful scrutiny of someone's record now what we have is this funny\nPantomime where the nominee pretends that they actually have no use it all and nothing they wrote\nIn the past has any bearing and I think that sets up\nA what we saw this week which is you have a nominee who has a very very clear very coherent doctrinal record and he spent most of the hearing trying to get away from it now\nThat doesn't answer the question of whether Brett Kavanaugh did something really dramatically different when he started talking about dark money in the Clintons because I think that's a given I've never seen anything like that\nBut I think at least Bork was honest and he was when the Senate exercise to advise and consent it did so knowing yeah that's gone\nStuart Taylor I mean I guess the the question that the naturally raises itself here is is the court being undermined by what is fundamentally seen by many as a broken nomination and confirmation process\nAnd it's not ethical yes and I've been watching it happen and get worse and worse and worse since before\nA judge Bork a year before judge Bork Justice Scalia who was then a very controversial figure was confirmed like Ninety eight to zero I think it was Ninety eight to two\nOh I think it was zero I'm ... I don't understand why the Democrats didn't want him to get confirmed because his record shows that he was going to be bad for them and almost every issue and even then when I said earlier was true\nAh everything you know they're they're deciding many of the most important political issues in the country you can argue it's almost impossible not to be a neutral arbiter when that's what you're doing\nThe what the Democrats did was a Bork and and what made worker verb\nWas the smears him in every conceivable way accept a sex life\nThey smeared him as a liar as a monster they portrayed him as a horrible person they took out advertising it was a disgusting display you know that this was how they thought they could win now with Thomas was more complicated\nWith a cabin on who you know for all of all the comments lately and understandable comments about his odd performance in front of the committee\nOr he's been on the bench for twelve years at the second highest court in a land arguably sitting along with Fifteen admirable judges including my law school friend Merrick Garland and we know what happened to him\nI have it on good authority and it's pretty public that every one of those judges\nOr or at least almost every one of them including George Carlin I Believe a then mired him in terms of judicial temperament as a level headed smart wonderful colleague\nWho uh you know who was much more conservative than most in some of them in some ways but he was an excellent totally yeah you know now that's not what he looks like the person we saw on TV the other day was totally out of character\nFor Kavanaugh in this process I think drove in that direction\nAnd and and uh done this week I mean we're we're creeping towards looking at Congress has role in all of this I mean there's the politics that play out between Democrats and Republicans in those hearings themselves\nBut also I mean after Harry Reid first you know wants the nuclear option or push the nuclear option button in two thousand Thirteen and then Mitch McConnell did it after that for Supreme Court nominees in two thousand Seventeen\nThat removed you know what was the most effective break in terms of bringing more controversial justices to uh you know to the nomination process right so I mean we have to be looking at the Senate and and its role here in creating this highly politicized environment for the court\nI don't think there's any question I think that the fact that we're talking about what one two votes were talking about Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and the totality of this seat rests on one or two people's votes it it really I mean I couldn't agree more with Stewart that\nYou know justices Ginsburg and Justice Scalia\nOften uh say are set in ... case look this is to be Ninety eight nothing seems to be a Ninety four nothing enterprise because of the rule that everybody adhere to in the Senate was\nElections matter and if the president chooses someone who is that we don't go after them because of proceeds outcomes and that's clearly\nJust gone I Would probably say that\nThe the holding of Merrick Garland seat open and in fact\n\n[noise] today trying to power in the walls and China would win with a more article\nChina have plans to build a brand new city from scratch on my walk of life for just sticks and how much stand in a way it's not a done deal if you actually see from coal fired fast for me to report on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise] Morrow morning at five or ...\nStudents NPR News station\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about the legitimacy the integrity\nAnd the public trust in the United States Supreme court and I'm joined today by ... Stuart Taylor and Christopher Schmidt and I want to play just a couple of clips here uh this is against this is for the last week\nA and first of all you're going to hear Republican Senator Lindsey Graham I'm being asked by a reporter is uh the hearings that were held on Thursday could have an impact on Republicans vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nIf you can ignore everything and disrupt [noise]\nLooking at allegation is thirty five years old this uncertain time place\nDate and no cooperation if that's enough for you God help us all as Republicans golf this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends if this is the new norm [noise]\nYou better watch out for you or nominates\nSenator Lindsey Graham last week at last week's confirmation hearing Senator Ben Sasse Republican from Nebraska said that all the ...\nIs because the Supreme Court nominations have become so politicized\nWe have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court in American Life now\nOur political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like there are people wearing red and blue jerseys and that's a really dangerous thing and by the way if they have red and blue jerseys I Would welcome my colleagues to introduce the legislation that hands lifetime tenure for the judiciary\nBecause if they're just politicians than the people should have power and they shouldn't have lifetime appointments\nThat's Republican Ben Sasse last week this week before the break I had to interrupt you there so that we could take that break but you were talking about the fact that uh people are seeing politics in the nomination process but they don't actually get a chance to see in great detail the court doing its actual work and the consequences of that\nAnd that's right and in some sense I think senator Sasse put it better than I did um you know if you all you see is people in red and blue jerseys and the Senate turning it into a blood sport about getting a red or blue justice on it's a little bit hard to say the public isn't going to take that away with them\nUm and I think you know the only other thing I Would add is we've been talking about the public perception of the justices but I think it's probably worth just threading into the conversation the justices view of these things we know for\nInstance that Clarence Thomas never fully recovered from what he thinks we've done to him and his hearings we know that\nSam Alito has said that he never quite forgiving forgotten how his hearings went down it's really hard to imagine that if Brett Kavanaugh's elevated to the court he will look at some of the groups that are attacked him\nIn anything resembling a an objective open minded way so there are real consequences not just for public perception of the justice is but the justice is\nA perception of the public and that's something that I think we really do have to factor\nInto the conversation ... I'm going to get to some colors 'cause we've got folks who've been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Schmidt I just want to ask you a quick question here because uh I mean ... isn't there an evidence enough or perhaps ample evidence in um the justices own voting are just records in the decisions that they make\nThat perhaps I don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we\nHave justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be perceived a preferred vote of the president that in that nominated them and put them on the court to begin with\nYeah this is absolutely true there's also nothing new we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene\nAs nominees and the Supreme Court politics play a role as always played a role in some sense and also say if you look at the American people's attitude toward the court most people are if you don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics that politics wasn't placements or on the court\nAnd people oftentimes do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so it's not the idea that once people see it as in some ways a political institution automatically its legitimacy is lost and no longer people are going to follow dictates\nWell let's go to college here finally and thank you for were for waiting patiently on the line let's go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin\nHi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic don't want to get to hear from almost be through it first of all um the the point of course is the legitimacy of integrity or public trust for the last\nTwo perception and if you think about what happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a or justice to repeal replace Scalia because of Republican saying we will not let him do it\nThat politicized it in the public's eye now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propaganda as a easily manipulated a populist in modern history\nAnd so through the media and through a lot of other things they are a given a perception of what is what is not but to the last several months Donald Trump and his\nA blatant disregard for for for the constitution and Republicans with the ... don't down we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans or we're gonna go against whatever Democrats and got a lot of law I think the public trust has been\nShaken and I believe the integrity of the word is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put some kind of limited on terms now because this is simply a political position\nWell Aaron thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor um at least one you know one thought there about from the from a member of the public about maybe it's time for term limits with justice is\nWell I think term limits is a wonderful idea that's not that for twenty or Thirty years or maybe eleven years maybe Fifteen Years and an out the problem is ...\nWould require if maybe a constitutional amendment to even getting it through Congress\nOr the the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have term limits are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be hurt who's ... who whose people are older\nYou know who's terms or later things are going to help the red team of the blue team and there will always be a calculation where if one side thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's gonna be a bad thing\nAnd neither side is gonna care much about the herring merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years um but that's what's been I think that's what we're going to be singing for ... for a long time\nWell let's go to Troy who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air dry\nOh thank you very much uh I Will remind people Lindsey Graham supported Kagan\nFor Obama and the ah keep in mind that the ... the Supreme Court's role is to make the wrongs of the government against its people\nFixed so I think uh this is an injustice for uh the the nominee that what he's going through [noise] thank you very much\nTroy thank you for your call let's go to Joe who's calling from Tampa, Florida you're on the air Joe\nI'm I guess what I figured that\nLaw called the ... the of the Supreme Court and the question like going up or go out when I realized that it was only up to a couple of justices weather and I got the right to marry I or go\nOn and now I'm kind of thing that play out of the gang where a lot of decisions I could come up and it's not even that it's a light let's ideology it seems like it's more of the plane down to\nUm that was the right it's actually just a code word for religious\nSo it's a bunch of religious people on the right if you want to overturn roe even though that may be impossible by some standard\nThey still want to do it and they're willing to sacrifice anything to be able to give me get that chance when in reality there is no scientific reason to do it there was a scientific reason you are prohibited gay people are married it's just about what religious doctrine is actually going to sway that massive\n... yeah well Jill thank you for your call a deli it looks like you have a response to that [noise]\nYeah I mean I think Joe just gave us the answer to Stuart subjects Gina Stewart\nCorrectly makes the point that the Supreme Court has inserted itself into all the big ticket issues of the day\n[noise] excuse me and I think you know what you just heard was the Supreme Court was by design supposed to be a counter majority Italian check it was supposed to fight for the rights of minorities or when the other branches of government", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)",
