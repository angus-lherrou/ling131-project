Cold War era treaty\nThat limited or ended the use of me medium range or middle range land based nuclear missiles and we're speaking today with just ... he's president of Ploughshares Fund a foundation focused on nuclear weapons policy and conflict resolution unless you're a little bit more uh from the president himself about why he wants to do this\nHere's President Trump after a rally in Elkhart County Nevada on Saturday telling reporters that he's ready to pull out of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty or as we've been taught calling it the IMF treaty\nDevelopers Russia China was and they all got to do is they say let's really get smart let's none of us develop those less Russia's doing it doing it where it hearing today agreement acceptable\nSo president Donald Trump's they're saying that maybe we can and proliferation of Russia China in the U.S all come together and desire to stop it\nHere's national security adviser John Bolton during a press conference in Moscow yesterday where he met\nRussian President letter Letterman ... and both said there's just one point on which Russia and the U.S agreed that other countries with nuclear arsenal in the world aren't restricted by the IMF it's a bilateral agreement between the United states and Russia and that's a problem\nSo there's a new strategic reality out there this was a Cold War bilateral ballistic missile related treaty in a multi polar world I think on this latter point of the for\nHalf of global a strategic environment for something that concerns the Russians a very substantial and we talked about\n... how do you react to what you just heard John Bolton say\nJohn Bolton is on a mission to kill all arms control agreements he believes in a world of power and might\nOr a world of us dominance he believes that these kinds of treaties restrict military the military power the United states he wants a world where there are no restraints whatsoever on US military for freedom of action he seems to have convinced\nA Donald Trump to have to follow the course of action the fear of our allies the fear of many national security experts around the world and just you you take down this treaty which is working but just in place which is restricted the arms race in Europe than the next on his target list is the start treaty that had reduced\nOr the U.S and Soviet arsons not rushing arsenals\nBy over fifty percent and if you take and that will then toppled that seems to be his goal and then you for the rest of the entire non proliferation\nTreaty regime in other words all the rules of the road that Republicans and Democrats liberals and conservatives have built up over the last forty fifty years would come tumbling down and it's a a dog eat dog nuclear world that is a road instability and war\nSo I mean we have seen though uh for at least a year now that America's nuclear arsenal\nOr the Trump Administration seeks for it to play a bigger role in the in the defense of the nation I mean I was looking at the the most recent nuclear posture review and it's ... and it talks about these exact risks that that uh\nYou know of Russia or China of a ... a a non bilateral world here and that in order to counter\nOr these other countries that are that are at hand singing modernizing their nuclear arsenals that the Pentagon and the national Security Council say well the United states must do the same thing so I'm just wondering I mean earlier you you were saying that stepping out are pulling out of the INS though\nYou say America loses some leverage them to over Russia I didn't quite understand that how\nAbsolutely look the first thing you do when you want to build new weapons inflate the threat is provide some justification for why you need even more\nThan the thousands of nuclear weapons are already have\nAnd in this case it did Bolton is pulling out an old trek he's using a technical violation to kill the whole treaty that he disagrees with for ideological grounds what are we talking about here\nWe're talking about the Russians who are modified an existing weapon to give you a greater range larger fuel tank and they put a few of them and one of their test sites in European Russia and apparently in one of the site\nWe're talking about a handful of weapons that are technically in violation and we'd been detecting this is about twenty fourteen\nThere are mechanisms for dealing with these kinds of violations they happen frequently and arms control treaty their resolution measures but instead of fixing it\nInstead of enforcing it instead of going and insisting that they take those weapons down he's killing the whole mechanism if somebody breaks into your house that's a violation of the laws against burglary you don't like repealed the burglary laws you enforce them by repealing this treaty you're allowing putting to do whatever you want now there'll be no\nRecall I Do want in Europe and here's the really bad part\nIt's unlikely that we can matched course for us to put these ground based systems in Europe we'd have to ever country don't watch them ... European ally wants them us what you're seeing how of complaint from France from\nFrom Germany from the European Union who warned that you're taking down and these are the words a pillar of European security no one needs a new arms race was foreign minister of the European Union\nAmong among others that's what they're afraid of that Trump is fighting an arms race that was already brewing as both the U.S and Russia are building other nuclear arms and now they're afraid that Europe uh once again be the battle ground for these two nuclear giants as they battle\nRight I mean Europe is signaling as loudly as it can it's discomfort with the possibility of an end to the IMF treaty I mean I'm seeing here the stigma Gabriel who just stepped down in March as German foreign minister this week said that the demise of the IMF\nThreatens to quote again turn us in central Europe and here in Germany into a venue of nuclear\nMadness I mean we should recall that have like a one time a million Germans marched against nuclear war a weaponry and Europe which is one of the things that led to a\nThe the INS to begin with not just wants you and I know you have a lot more to say but I Want to welcome in one more uh ... voice into this conversation Evelyn focus joins us now she joined us today from Washington She's a fellow at the Atlantic council future Europe initiative Eurasia center and the ... Center for strategy and security\nShe also served from two thousand twelve to twenty Fifteen and the Obama administration\nAs deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia Ukraine and Eurasia and when first is welcome to you thank you magnify great to be here so I'm very eager to hear your take on this given your experience here do you think the Trump Administration is a is doing is on the right track here in terms of its desire to pull out of the INS\nWell ... unfortunately I don't really see\nA better option right now because\nThe Russians essentially put our back to the wall this is really like going back to Nineteen eighty seven where actually our European allies the Germans asked us to step in and counter the Russian short short range or medium range missiles that were deployed and threatening Europe at the time\nWith our own missiles so in that case the Europeans wanted us to help them out and President Reagan did so but did so\nI think largely in a way that he was able to use it to negotiate the Russians\nOut of their own missiles and that's how we got the intermediate nuclear forces treaty\nAnd I having been in the administration [laughter]\nI Know that we tried very hard to confront the Russians to convince the Russians um to do what we could using words to deter them from continuing to violate the agreement but they did not stop\n'em as you noted in the beginning this has been public since two thousand fourteen I'm the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff testified openly that the Russians have deployed this capability these missiles and\nSo what are we going to do I think that for the U.S government the best option unfortunately at this point is to do what we did in eighty seven which is to threaten to counter though the burglars burglar at us\nWe then send another burglar outside of their house have that burglar stand there and say if you don't stop we're going to send our burger and\n... the problem is the way I think the Trump Administration went about it that doesn't sound like they consulted it doesn't sound like they had a plan that included our NATO allies\nUm or or the issue of how to deal with the Asian theater\nSo that's that's the issue I think today well\nI wouldn't focus a couple of quick questions here um you first of all you heard Joe surgeons you and he just a few minutes ago saying that he sees the way to counter the Russians is through the very instrument of the IMF treaty itself and that by by you know deep sixteen the treaty you've lost what is perhaps the most effective\nMechanism to push back those intermediate range missiles or the that Russia you know as you said we've been talking about this twenty fourteen but we were\nAnd JBC fashion door in Chelsea dedicated to bringing you peace of mind at home with Marvin windows and doors offering design installation in service J.

Virginia Margaret you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call I find the whole idea of pulling out of yet another nuclear a treaty buying and a logical to think that once we get out of it and we increase our production of nuclear weapons oh this is going to make the world safer we already have more than seven thousand new believe\nAnd I don't see how the idea of increasing the number is going to make the world and they said well we have enough to destroy the world many times over already it's only a bone in my opinion to the war industry\nMargaret thank you so much for your call at ... park is how would you like to respond to Margaret um well first to\nI'm Calvin if I could just quickly um I Do agree that we need to be from with our adversaries and\nI guess my thinking with regard to this move is that it's a deterrent move and hopefully move that will ultimately strength and arms control because\nI'm going to right now give the administration that chance I'm not going to assume that John Bolton has the lead and we're going to tear up the treaty entirely and we're going to drop all nuclear talks oh I'm maybe a little bit giving them too much benefit of the doubt that that's where I Am\nI Do however disagree with President Trump's approach to the allies and again as I said before we have to be more collaborative with our friends and from these heavier enemies ... through gotcha Margaret's point I agree I mean I Do not think we should be wasting money on developing nuclear weapons that we don't need\nAnd that's the whole point of being from and standing up to the Russians and getting them to\nStep back and think about what they're doing 'cause this is also part of the bigger picture which has to do with Russia's military doctrine there over reliance on nuclear weapons as part of their war strategy which I think is highly alarming and you could have a whole nother show on that it's\nJust certain CEO new turn back to you here because of course uh we we could also continue to spend the rest of the hour talking about Russia and we will return to it but China has been lurking here uh a as a major part of why President Trump says he wants to pull out of the IMF here I mean I'm I'm seeing that part of the thinking is that\nFor ... were that the U.S has constrained by the ins and not able to\nDeploy strategic weaponry in in the Asia theater as Evelyn pointed out earlier because of this and that that is putting us to counter the term behind the eight ball in Asia\nYou always have to be very careful when you hear people who are who want new nuclear weapons and the language they use so John Bolton says you know what I'll outmoded treaty violation ignored were constrained\nAnd so you know it feeds into that feeling that we're be where the suckers and the other countries are stealing a march on us as one of your callers pointed out we have a six thousand five hundred and fifty nuclear weapons\nThat is to about ... several hundred times more weapons and you need to destroy every\nHuman being on the face of the earth we have plenty of nuclear weapons and you don't want to fall into the trap\nOf nuclear war planters planners who who see this is some kind of board game where you have to match piece for peace so on China what they're talking about is the China or a land power doesn't have much of an navy doesn't have much of a an air force that can reach beyond us borders\n... okay for now they they they have a nuclear weapons or about about two hundred three hundred so nuclear weapons compared to our seven thousand and their land based and they can reach targets like Japan like real like warm or in like the United states have about forty that could reach us\nAnd we don't necessarily have those we don't have those ground based missiles that match their capability exactly and that's what they mean by were constrained you know where the treaty stops us from building those but we have see based missile from reaching them just\nAre based weapons that can reach them fought just fine we have strategic submarines the proud the ocean second which just fine in other words we have dozens of nuclear weapons\n... that can hit them for everyone to have the can hit us we don't need to match 'em and here's the other off underline reality there's ... there's nobody you know one of our allies want these weapons Japan just yesterday said\nThat they do not want us to pull out of the IMF treaty they don't they're not looking for us to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan which is one of the places you would do to deploy them if you want to match your weapon\nWell everyone versus a ... I think the the deeper one of the deepest points that Joe is making here uh it's worthy of of some of this discussion here for the discussion because\n... and I think he's right that that there is\nA sense when you hear I'm certain members of the administration talk now that the United states is weaker than it actually is I mean what's your response to to Joe's point that what there is no need for land based I'm intermediate range missiles when we have such a a overpowering sea bass nuclear arsenal that we could use\nNo one wants us to use them but that that are there for a for U.S Strategic purposes in the Asia theater\n[noise] well I mean I I have to confess here I'm not a military planners so I it's a little bit out of my\nWeek to say definitively that we don't need those weapons um I Will say however that it is true that\nOur president and I I wouldn't say members of the ... the president does speak of America is that for a declining powers if we're not the the strongest military power on the globe right now the strongest diplomatic power at least potentially were squandering that every day\nUm and of course still the strongest economic power so I Do think it's worth bearing in mind that we do have the upper hand and the reason the Russians are developing the capabilities that they're developing has to do with the fact that they can't go head to head with us or the Chinese they have to develop asymmetric means\nAnd I think the real issue here has to do with Russia's\nFeeling of vulnerability the lack of what they call strategic stability in our defense relationship\nAnd their desire to do something to correct that and I think this administration needs to sit down and have some real\nBlonde conversations with the Russians about the state of our defense relationship about the various dangerous asymmetric asymmetric things the Russians are doing to try to get an edge on us like developing missiles not just these missiles that other missiles\nUm like their cyber\nCapabilities the fact that they have inserted a box or other um cyber weapons into\nOur energy grid that they could activate in time of war if necessary things like that are actually of greater concern to me personally and I think should be the subject of serious discussion and then hopefully negotiation if the Russians are open to it\nW.

hundred million for seven off [noise]\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate bar ... we're talking with former Florida Senator Bob Graham he was the co chair of the joint congressional investigation into the nine eleven attacks he's been watching Saudi Arabia for almost Twenty years now and he's saying that it's time for Washington to really stop coddling\nThe Saudi kingdom where at one eight hundred and four to three eight to five by the eight hundred forty three talk\nA Senator Graham I Hope you can forgive me that I had to cut you off there before the break because um you're telling us it's very interesting story about a Saudi couple a young Saudi couple in\nSarasota, Florida who you first heard about in in two thousand eleven now if\nI if I'm reading the reporting around this correctly that they lived in a gated community right and in fact the name of a Mohammed Ali ... the leader of the nine eleven hijackers a ... and his license plate information was were on file 'em in the office of this gated community indicated maybe he'd been coming in and out\nAnd that leader on the FBI Tampa office had actually compiled a lengthy report or the uh with connections between the hijackers and his\nFamily but with the FBI give you that report you\nKnow uh and after attempting to get access to the report a wee\nWee which was a journalist and myself a ... ... ... filed a freedom of Information Act\nOr to get access initially the FBI said they didn't have any information on the three of flight students and the Saudi family or the judge rejected that as being a on believable\nUh they even said that uh they\nUh had a a few documents a and the judge and that was all there was the judge rejected that\nThen a ... without further action the FBI voluntarily ... um directed eighty thousand eighty thousand pages\nOf information that was that had been taken a in a post nine eleven survey of the situation in Sarasota\nOf with the judge then to determine what which of those eighty thousand pages could be made public a it is now almost a November of two thousand Eighteen or an after six years\nThe judge has yet to rule on what if any of those eighty thousand pages of can be made available to the American public okay\nSenator name I Want us take a step back here though because the ... year right to those ... eighty thousand pages are currently in the possession of a Florida federal judge eighty thousand pages about this one family or at least investigations in Sarasota\nNot yet made available to the public in any way shape or form but even before\nOr the judge made that decision to start taking a look at the those pages I mean you had contacted the FBI right to ask for some of the reports at least um and did you you had to even go to the FBI is central record keeping office to even see\nSome of some of these reports and that uh and the FBI wasn't being cooperative in giving you any information is that right\nI Would say the FBI was being quite a on a cooperative in fact at one point a shortly after\nIn Sarasota was discovered uh my wife and I were a in the Washington area to have Thanksgiving with our second daughter third daughter\nAh and ah we were intercepted at a Logan Airport and taken to the FBI office which is located there\nAre an essentially told by the number two person the deputy director of the FBI or that we're wasting our time and that I\nShould uh shut up and go oh you were the\nHair of the nine eleven commission and the and the number two person at the FBI was telling you you were wasting your time trying to follow elite about what the FBI investigated regarding possible connections between the Saudi family in the hijackers I mean it it almost ... belief that are\nWell and that gets gets worse uh so I uh I said I told the deputy director that the information that I wanted and he said will come to our office and we will talk about this so\nI did uh and uh the\nWhen I got there the deputy director told me that to the meeting that we were going to have a had been cancelled and they would not be rescheduled a and that again I was wasting my time uh that's the last of\nQuasar official contact that I've had with the FBI on the Sarasota a situation\nCenter [noise] nine eleven [noise]\nYou know we were Seventeen years out and\nAnybody who was alive and remembers that they will never forget it I mean thousands of people were killed and\nAnd I'm hearing you tell me that the FBI as late as two thousand eleven was actively trying to dissuade you from a you know as the United states senator from trying to find out what federal investigators may have known or uncovered and in any of these fed before with utter conviction\nThat you you you you believe that the United states already have within its possession information it ought to be making it ought to make available to the public about Saudi complicity in this massive act of terrorism why is that not happening who is stopping that from happening\nWell uh the mystery is\nA over three administrations why has there been this uh uh reticence to release information I think for the Bush administration the reason was that they\nWanted to put the blame for nine eleven on Iraq and anything that\nAre raised the possibility that another nation state uh was responsible ran counter to that narrative uh the\nEnigma to me is the Obama administration of President Obama had\nRun in two thousand and eight in large part on his opposition to the war in Iraq and had raised questions about the ... that Saudi Arabia and why it wasn't more a focus of attention\nBut uh in light of that and nothing was done in his administration or to expedite the release of information on nine eleven and now\nA President Trump\nHas made a Saudi Arabia one of the darling of U.S foreign policy was the first country that he visited a as a president or has been very Folsom in his\nAh statements of approval of a Saudi Arabia and so we've gone for a three presidents sees a and no of\nAssertive effort or from the White House or to let the American people a share the information that the government has and form opinions as to responsibility for nine eleven\nYeah and I'm going to take a couple of quick call here senator but but just one more thing to reiterate there has been no official reports so far that I Know of\nThat even willing to entertain this not um that no one no official report saying that there's any evidence of Saudi complicity in any of these acts that we've been we've been talking about but I mean would you go so far as to say that you have seen\nAgain in your time is co chair of nine eleven a commissioner that you've seen evidence or documentation or something anything that ties the Saudi royal family itself to something like nine eleven\nYes I mean I think the twenty eight pages you've already sided one situation where French band or who is the ants\nInvolved in financing a persons who played a critical role in uh nine eleven [noise]\n[noise] well let's go to a caller here Charlie is calling from New Orleans Louisiana Charlie you're on the air\nI like all levels because of the

Texas Southwestern medical center\nIs also an expert in treating rare autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system and he's already treated eight patients with acute flashed had my ... my latest this year Dr green Burt welcome to implant\nThank you happy to be here so first of all just give us the uh the the the non sensational facts about this disease I'm\nThis is a virus that it's not unknown to science we've seen it before\nYou're correct and the the facts are also we are part of the issue relative to some confusion so\nWhen we talk about acute flats of my light as it is a clinical diagnosis it refers to a certain set of symptoms in a certain type of damage that can occur in the spinal cord usually in children but it can affect adults are there are multiple ways\nTo damage this part of the spinal cord but since two thousand fourteen every other year in the late summer early fall the United states has seen a spike in number of children who have become paralyzed with\nThis type of a condition of coupons among the light is in the suspicion has been that during the seasons every other year there has been a circulating virus or viruses that has been responsible for the majority of those cases\nOkay and that's an intro virus\nIt is that's the suspicion or the entering viruses are a group of viruses that are very common uh usually cause either respiratory or gastrointestinal a illnesses that are usually quite mild\nUh most people don't even know it when they've been infected with an honor of ours and if it does cause symptoms it's it's a common cold and then in very rare situations certain enter a viruses have been associated with damage to the central nervous as\nI see so help me understand something though because you know recently we've been seeing these I'm quite worrying headlines right about polio like symptoms or in some children who are being infected with this and you say that um we start started seeing a spike beginning in in two thousand fourteen so\nUh but to enter the virus wasn't wasn't leading to the same symptoms before that\n[noise] so it turns out that it probably was so if we go back to two thousand twelve there were a few cases reported out of California and the California Department of public health recognize that there were some enter a virus associated\nAre cute ... patients and when we look back even in Dallas uh as far back as two thousand nine it's quite clear that there were some cases the difference\nBetween two thousand ten thousand twelve and then what happened in fourteen sixteen and Eighteen was the magnitude of number of cases being recognize\nSo you end but the symptoms of syndrome a looks a centrally like polio ... which was described well over a hundred years ago before we knew about\nAs the predominant cause of this syndrome during the early Nineteen hundreds through the Nineteen forties before we had a vaccine mhm once\nWe essentially got rid of the polio virus within the United states\nThe syndrome of polio ... my light as which look almost identical a with a few unique features between them\nThe polio violate us that we were used to essentially disappeared but we think uh there have been a background of rare\nParalytic events mainland kids happening for several decades but something has changed whether in the host's us as a population or within the viruses circulating to start causing these much more significant and prevalent outbreaks since two thousand two thousand fourteen\nAnd so that some things is what researchers are trying right now to figure out\nHow we are there there are groups all across the United states and indeed around the world because we have seen outbreaks or in Europe as well on the on the a similar pattern\nWhere we are trying to determine if there is one or multiple causes for these outbreaks in the late summer early fall and\nWhat's notable is that the virus that has received the most attention\nUm which is within the family of inner of viruses all of these viruses are cousins of the polio virus and so while we have not detected the polio virus\nIn any of these cases when testing has been done in a large number of cases we have found a different enter a virus that seems to cause damage to the spinal cord\nOkay this is where medicine and epidemiology get a little bit of had I think a common understanding because I heard you say earlier that these enter the viruses are also very common and ... and maybe some of them are cousins to polio virus but\nIt but if they're still kind of I don't know that there's no vaccine for the virus which may be causing these these current spikes of polio syndrome is there a\nCorrect there is no available vaccine for these viruses\nOkay I'm a research is wondering if perhaps we need to go down the path of developing one\nIt is a very active conversation that's happening now and where our focus is first in is in trying to prove causation so that if we and when we invest the significant resources it takes to make a vaccine\nWe're picking the right virus to develop a vaccine for in show where our focus has been for several years is trying to get a consensus among researchers in public health officials\nThat we think we have the right culprit and\nIt turns out that ah the virus or a family of viruses that we're most interested in\nAre actually somewhat difficult to capture from these patients they're difficult to isolate and difficult to confirm that the testing for them is not easy and so often will have children who have the syndrome ... negative\nBased on our current technology for the specific enter a virus we're looking for\nBut it doesn't mean they didn't have it or if we look back to the lessons of the polio virus um\nWhen we would test the spinal fluid of a child who is being actively paralyzed by this virus and this virus was replicating in their spinal cord and causing damage and affecting the nerves that control the muscles\nWe can't isolate the virus out of the spinal fluid it's a very difficult virus to find and so when we diagnose the polio virus even today uh we do so by checking a stool specimens because the virus replicates within the gastrointestinal tract so\nIf you have a child with paralysis and you're worried that it could be due to the polio virus we don't look to the spinal cord to the spinal fluid because we can't find that we have to look elsewhere in the body\nAnd so we're trying to sort out the same process a use for the center of ours is now the the reassuring part of this relative to the history of polio virus\nIs in the world of polio virus back in the Nineteen thirties and Nineteen forties when we had tens of thousands of children being paralyzed by this virus\nWas that for every hundred to every thousand people who would get infected with this virus somebody will become paralyzed and so it's it's virulence sits ability to invade and damage the spinal cord was quite high\nThe best estimates for the enter a virus that we're most concerned about is that it's maybe one in a hundred thousand infections\nSo very very low rates very low rate and so we are be we're trying to be very reassuring to\nMajor funding for on green is provided by Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and ranchers insurance through the Geico insurance agency

the ... the thing about your book that I think is the deepest point that you make it how Silicon Valley views it's actual employees an actual workers tell tell me more about that because part of what you wrote seems I'm very familiar to me in terms of how industrialists of\nOld also sell their workers right only I think it's actually even worse so the the view\nToday and Silicon Valley is that workers are essentially disposable\nWould you see you their fuel like the coal you throw in a steam engine to keep it going so you you hire them you you burn them out turn them out and just hire again and you just high turnover and high burn out I'm\nOddly enough it's counter to what Silicon Valley was even as recently as when I started writing about Silicon Valley in the late eighties\nAt that time the gold standard was something called the H.

I went back in ... I'm going to read books by industrial ... of of a previous generation and see what they what they thought so I read Henry Ford's memoirs and read Thomas watching junior who was\nUh Lee Iacocca was not the rubber bands but\nAnd and Henry Ford obviously was not a nice guy yeah have you get to the very end of his memoirs him as a last shop and you're like oh my God whoa whoa whoa what ... before that part of it it's amazing he's saying I Am doing this to try to create as many jobs for his many human beings as I can\nAnd to treat them really well um he at one point had to stop go round and try to find jobs that disabled people could do because those people were pushed out of the workforce by me all the jobs you could do if you only had one on\nBy me all the jobs you could do if you were blind make a list and then we're going to go higher those people so they can work and they can ah they can make make a living yeah\nBut it just so this is the key difference though right that there was a time I'm not for every company but for many companies the point was to grow the company\nAnd doing so involved in trying to be the best employer they could be but ... you know sometime in the seventies and eighties we American Capitalism turned over to shareholder value creation that that was the ultimate goal of the company to serve the interests of shareholders who wouldn't that be\nAnd and I guess what I'm saying when I'm Wondering is in your book are you writing that you think that that Silicon Valley because it's full\nOf some of these billion dollar valued companies that may or may not be turning a profit that essentially they put they put all the shareholder value creation like on hyper speed that it it is by far the most important thing I'm a of anything that these companies can do and and that's the pernicious thing is is that what you're saying\nIs hyper capital and it it's you have Nineteen Seventy the turning point is Milton Friedman publishes famous essay about shareholder capitals I mean every CEO goes this is great all have to do is\nReturn a money to investors time my own compensation to the stock price and anything I can do to make that happen is great got the pension fund\nYou know usually all in involves hurting employees and so you had four stakeholders you had a customer's employees the community and investors and Milton Friedman just will investors come first and now\nIts investors are the only ones who matter so you have companies in Silicon valley that have run for years have never made a profit don't treat their employees well deliver what they call MVP minimum viable product\nUm dodged taxes will get apple and Google hiding all this money offshore and not paying taxes 'em all to benefit investors companies were BCS have become fabulously rich a founders had become fabulously rich but\nThe company itself is not profitable yes or help you to to employees very well um so it's it's a really inside I kinda version of capitalism\nOkay well let's just get another call here we're speaking with dandelions he's author of lab rats how Silicon Valley may work miserable for the rest of us Marge is calling from Lebanon, Connecticut merger on the air\nHello thank you I Want to say that I worked for a large insurance company in Hartford, Connecticut for thirty six years my father also retired from this company\nHe worked there for years all the time I was growing up I Do not remember him working overtime he was home at five o'clock for supper every day we had weekends to go away and so forth now they'll they'll\nTwelve years I worked in a wonderful unit I was able to accomplish every project they gave me on time or before target date then they re arrange things that five years before I retired I retired it four years ago but five years before I retired they reorganized and I became so\nThe new prime pod cast trauma WVU are in the Boston Globe's investigating the largest unsolved art heist in history the theft of works from Boston bombers who were Gardner Museum listened on I've had cats [noise] [noise]\nDoes your car had a nickname does it hold wonderful memories of good times with family and friends\nWill make your cars last memory the best one yet donated to W.

I mean see everything that came out and we were in the last couple of years is not like that right now Amazon warehouses are not like that\nUm ... when he mentioned I'm\nWorking in Israel one of the best stories I came across in the last couple years was an Israeli start a guy who was so desperate to raise money that he\nOffered to give up one of his kidneys if anyone would give him a half million dollars to buy a stake in this company and I'm just wondering and I thought it like what do we come and even the BCS I call to that is the most dystopian thing I've ever heard right and I mean it was maybe kind of a publicity stunt and um [noise]\nAnyway but yeah there are there is a lot of just hoping stuff out\nThere [laughter] yeah well any of them let me just ask you briefly a are we\n... because we've talked a lot about Amazon Google Facebook I mean are we are we ... are we over waiting the influence of these like the old for big Silicon Valley companies or does you know it's because he was saying that he not obviously not every company is going this way it is are there actually maybe medium or smaller size\nOr come the tech companies that are doing a better job that we should actually be focusing on and said\nAbsolutely there definitely are I think it's really hard to shift that narrative from the biggest tech companies because they have so much influence over our economy as a whole yeah um I think the really interesting thing too that I Want to touch on on that gentleman's comment is that you know we're really ushering in this age of knowledge work\nUm and we're approaching it and that very industrial mindset that was that turn of the century kind of way that we thought about working and\nYou know we have a lot I again it's just it's always a little bit of the better with the sweet like we're all excited to have the devices that are at our fingertips all the time they let us do so much but at the same time productivity is like through the roof in some ways and now expectations from workers are completely unrealistic and out of\nThis I Want to do because I mean because with knowledge work the asset is the worker right ... if not workers are not the liability whereas sort of sort of the standard way of looking at labor is that's that's the lover that as a manager or as a CEO that you can pull up and down was quickly in order to\nA massage or profits were that quarter right just ... workforce and do you make money but but in this case we're we're talking about like the ... assets of a company or the workers themselves so\nMy question you new to you and yet is that ... in trying to shift perspective a little here um for for these tech companies for any business in America right now like how do you make that pitch that\nYou focus more on workers you make life better for workers or empower them or a ... that that will actually produce longer term profits but it's slow it's slower work I mean how do you make that pitch in an environment where those quarterly returns are so pressing\nYeah I think it has to have to come probably a bit from some from the top down but some from the ground up so\nI mentioned earlier you know awareness and attention ... kind of a two things that keep coming up for me so a couple of examples of of some some tech startups that people have been talking a lot about and interestingly enough these are companies that\nMay or may not be venture funded a so like actually male champ as an example of one that has been in the in the news recently they're completely bootstraps and they never raise any venture capital\nThey're valued at I think four billion dollars as a company now um and they have to owners they're based in Atlanta they're not even based in Silicon valley\nThat they have very generous benefits they have very like\nUh they're very generous with their policies with people they have a profit sharing policy so I think um when we think about like some of the the ways in which we can look at you know structurally or how a start up or how a tech company has formed and how we want to think differently about it to me it comes down to like alternative ways of thinking about financing those\nStart ups um I think it's about alternative ways of thinking of corporate structures um and I think it's alternative ways of thinking about the culture around it so some examples of that would be\nYou know how radical transparency I'm within your company and sometimes even with the the outside you know external forces and as much as you can be transparent with them so buffer is another an example of a tech company that\nIs radically transparent and if I'm not mistaken I think they share is a private company um but they share a olive their numbers are with the public and they've told an entire story of actually how they just recently bought back\nUh their ownership of the company from their investors are because they want it to be able to build it more sustainably and they weren't happy with the way that they're the way they were beholden to their investors was driving them to do things that they felt like we're unhealthy for their company an unhealthy for the people working there\nUm and then I'd also say like a again companies that are doing profit sharing models are building them and kind of more co op style of model where people really want the employees to be able to participate in the success of that company as well so everyone has invested in this excessive and everyone gets to reap the rewards instead of just\nA few people at the top um I think there's a lot to be said about having those more flexible schedules and\nUm you know enabling remote work I Know from my team ah or I should say multiple teams because I run a few different things uh you know we tend to be really focused on the delivery bulls and we plan those together for oh it's a route okay here's the timeline we've all set together here the things that we need to deliver by this time\nI don't care if you want to work like at two in the morning I don't care if you want to work at two in the afternoon I don't care if you want to go to the movies for the entire day and maybe you only work three days out of the week like\nSays his long hit the world yeah hit the gold on how you have your life now now are\nThere are a lot more callers who want to get to hear but then you could not from you and what you're hearing from India\nOh you've we we we totally agree and and um\nThere's a a another company called Base Camp that are just in Chicago I offered company and I I I'm I'm sort of detecting a few common threads with with the other companies that you're talking about any and and that is one of these have never took any PC\nTo they're not really obsessed with hyper growth are growing at an incredible rate they believe in slow growth\nThey are profitable they charge money for their software and they make a profit they have no interest in going

uh the Saudi prosecutor is saying that the killing of ... a was a premeditated act the finally saying that I mean what's your response to to that being said now\nWithout appears to be a movement towards the truth which has been long incoming and multiple in specific events oh I Hope that uh the United states will\nTake this matter a with a great seriousness and will\nFacilitate an expedited

he's been watching Saudi Arabia for almost Twenty years now and he's saying that it's time for Washington to really stop coddling\nThe Saudi kingdom where at one eight hundred for two three eight to find the eight hundred forty three talk\nOff there before the break because um you're telling us it's very interesting story about a Saudi couple a young Saudi couple in Sarasota, Florida who you first heard about in in two thousand eleven now\nIf I if I'm reading the recording around this correctly that they lived in a gated community right and in fact the name of a Mohammed Ali ... the leader of the nine eleven hijackers uh and his license plate information was were on file 'em in the office of this gated community indicated it maybe he'd been coming in and out\nAnd that leader on the FBI Tampa office had actually compiled of lay the reporter the with connections between the hijackers and his\nFamily but with the FBI give you that report\nNo uh and after attempting to get access to the report we uh we which was from journalists and myself a ...\n... ... filed a freedom of Information Act\nOr to get access initially the FBI said they didn't have any information on the three of flight students are and the Saudi family or the judge rejected that as being a on believable\nUh they even said that uh they\nUh had a a few documents a and the judge and that was all there was the judge rejected that\nThen a ... without further action the FBI voluntarily uh directed eighty thousand eighty thousand pages\nOf information that was that had been taken a in a post nine eleven survey of the situation in Sarasota\nOf with the judge then to determine what which of those ... eighty thousand pages could be made public a it is now almost a November of two thousand Eighteen\nOr and after six years the judge has yet to rule on what if any of those eighty thousand\nPages are can be made available to the American public okay\nSenator name I Want to stay to step back here though because ... you're right to those ... eighty thousand pages are currently in the possession of a Florida federal judge eighty thousand pages about this one family or at least investigations in Sarasota not yet made available to the public in any way shape or form but even before\nOr the judge made that decision to start taking a look at the those pages I mean you had contacted the FBI right to ask for some of the reports at least um and did you you had to even go to the FBI is central record keeping all of this even see\nSome of some of these reports and that a ... and the FBI wasn't being cooperative in giving you any information is that right\nOr I Would say the FBI was being quite a on a cooperative in fact at one point a shortly after the situation in Sarasota was discovered\nUh my wife and I were a in the Washington area to have Thanksgiving with our second daughter third daughter ah and ah we were intercepted at a Logan Airport and taken to the FBI office which is located there\nAre an essentially told by the number two person the deputy director of the FBI\nOr that we're wasting our time and that I\nShould uh shut up and go oh you were the ...\nThe hair of the nine eleven commission and the and the number two person at the FBI was telling you you were wasting your time trying to follow elite about what the FBI investigated regarding possible connections between the Saudi family in the hijackers I mean it it almost ... belief that are\nWell and that gets gets worse uh so I uh\nI said I told the deputy director that the information that I wanted and he said will come to our office and we will talk about this so I did\nUh and uh the when I got there the deputy director told me that to the meeting that we were going to have a had been cancelled and they would not be rescheduled a and that again I'm I was wasting my time\nUh that's the last of\nQuasar official contact that I've had with the FBI\nOn the Sarasota a situation\nCenter [noise] nine eleven [noise]\nYou know we were Seventeen years out and anybody who was alive and remembers that they will never forget it I mean thousands of people were killed and\nVi as late as two thousand eleven was actively trying to dissuade you from a you know as the United states senator from trying to find out what federal investigators may have known or uncovered and and and you said before with utter conviction\nThat you you you you believe that the United states already have within its possession information it ought to be making it ought to make available to the public about Saudi complicity in this massive act of terrorism why is that not happening who is stopping that from happening\nWell uh the mystery is a over three administrations why has there been this uh\nUh reticence to release information I think for the Bush administration the reason was that they wanted to put the blame for nine eleven on Iraq and anything that\nAre raised the possibility that another nation state uh was responsible ran counter to that narrative uh the\nEnigma to me is the Obama administration of President Obama had\nRun in two thousand and eight in large part on his opposition to the war in Iraq and had raised questions about the ... that Saudi Arabia and why it wasn't more a focus of attention\nBut uh in ... by to that and nothing was done in his administration uh to expedite the release of information on nine eleven and now\nA President Trump\nHas made a Saudi Arabia one of the darn wings of U.S foreign policy was the first country that he visited a as a president or has been very Folsom in his ah statements of\nApproval of a Saudi Arabia and so we've gone for a three presidents sees a and no uh\nAssertive effort or from the White House or to let the American people a share the information that the government has and form opinions as to responsibility for nine eleven\nYeah and I'm going to take a couple of quick call your senator but but just one more thing to reiterate there has been no official reports so far that I Know of\nThat even willing to entertain this not um that no one no official reports saying that there's any evidence of Saudi complicity in any of these acts that we've been we've been talking about but I mean would you go so far as to say that you have seen\nAgain in your time is coach as nine eleven a commissioner that you've seen evidence or documentation or something anything that ties the Saudi royal family itself to something like nine eleven\nYes I mean I think the the twenty eight pages you've already cited the one situation where French band or who is the ambassador Saudi Arabia to the United states or was involved in financing a\nPersons who played a critical role in uh nine

B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station\nThis is on point I'm making her body weakness in the arms and legs possible paralysis\nSix children it sounds like polio but medical professionals are keeping an eye on a growing number of cases of acute flash said my light is a condition that the Centers for Disease Control says is affecting at least one hundred and fifty five patients in twenty two states\nIt's rare but serious and the disease affects the nervous system and it causes aren't entirely no\nWell you can join us because we're speaking with us we'll be speaking with a doctor or who's been treating patients with acute flashed that my lettuce and we want to know what your questions are about this disease have you seen it ... children in your community where one eight hundred for two three eighty five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nYou can also join us anytime it on the radio dot org or Twitter and Facebook\nAnd on point radio and joining us now from Dallas texas is Dr Benjamin Greenberg he's a professor in the department of neurology and euro therapeutics at the universe\nHe's also an expert in treating rare on immune disorders of the central nervous system and he's already treated eight patients with acute slash said my ... my latest this year ... welcome to implant thank you might not happy to be here\nFirst of all just give us a at the than the non sensational facts about this disease I'm this is a virus that it's not unknown to science we've seen it before\nYou're correct and the the facts are also lead to our part of the issue relative to some confusion so\nWhen we talk about acute flats said my light as it is a clinical diagnosis it refers to a certain set of symptoms in a certain type of damage that can occur in the spinal cord usually in children but it can affect adults are there are multiple ways\nTo damage this part of the spinal cord but since two thousand fourteen\nEvery other year in the late summer early fall the United states has seen a spike in number of children who have become paralyzed with\nThis type of a condition of ... and the suspicion has been that during the seasons every other year there has been a circulating virus or viruses that has been responsible for the majority of those cases\nOkay and that that's an intro virus\nIt is that's the suspicion or the enter a viruses are a group of viruses that are very common uh usually cause either respiratory or gastrointestinal a illnesses that are usually quite mild\nUh most people don't even know it when they've been infected with an enter a virus and if it does cause symptoms it's it's a common cold and then in very rare situations certain enter a viruses have been associated with damage to the central nervous as\nI see so help me understand something though because you know recently we've been seeing these I'm quite worrying headlines about polio like symptoms or in some children who are being infected with this and you say that um we started started seeing a spike beginning in two thousand four teams so\nUh but the ... virus wasn't wasn't leading to the same symptoms before that\n[noise] so it turns out that it probably was so if we go back to two thousand twelve there were a few cases reported out of California and the California Department of public health recognize that there were some enter a virus associated\nAcute ... patients and when we look back even in Dallas uh as far back as two thousand nine it's quite clear that there were some cases the difference\nBetween two thousand ten thousand twelve and then what happened in fourteen sixteen and Eighteen was the magnitude of number of cases being recognized\nAnd that the symptoms of syndrome\nA looks essentially like polio ... which was described well over a hundred years ago before we knew about the polio virus\nAs the predominant cause of this syndrome during the early Nineteen hundreds through the Nineteen forties before we had a vaccine mhm once\nWe essentially got rid of the polio virus within the United states\nThe syndrome of polio ... which look almost identical a with a few unique features between them\nThe polio violate us that we were used to essentially disappeared but we think uh there have been a background of rare\nParalytic events mainly in kids happening for several decades but something has changed whether in the host's us as a population or within the viruses circulating to start causing these much more significant and prevalent outbreaks since two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen\nAnd so that something is what researchers are trying right now to figure out\nNow we are there there are groups all across the United states and indeed around the world because we have seen outbreaks or in Europe as well on the on the a similar pattern where we are trying to determine if there is one or multiple causes for these outbreaks in the late summer early\nFall and what's notable is that the virus that has received the most attention\nUm which was within the family of viruses all of these viruses are cousins of the polio virus and so while we have not detected the polio virus\nIn any of these cases when testing has been done in a large number of cases we have found a different enter a virus that seems to cause damage to the spinal cord\nOkay so this is where medicine and epidemiology get a little bit of had I think a common understanding because I heard you say earlier that these viruses are also very\n... maybe some of them are cousins to polio virus but if but if they're still kind of I don't know of uh there's no current vaccine for the virus which may be causing these these current spikes of polio syndrome is there\nA correct there is no are available vaccine for these viruses\nOkay I'm a research just wondering if perhaps we need to go down the path of developing one\nIt is a very active conversation that's happening now and where our focus is first in is in trying to prove causation so that if we and when we invest the significant resources it takes to make a vaccine\nWe're picking the right virus to develop a vaccine for in show where our focus has been for several years is trying to get a consensus among researchers in public health officials\nThat we think we have the right culprit and\nIt turns out that ah the virus or family or viruses that we're most interested in\nAre actually somewhat difficult to capture from these patients they're difficult to isolate and difficult to confirm that the testing for them is not easy and so often will have children who have the syndrome ... negative\nBased on our current technology for the specific enter a virus we're looking for but\nIt doesn't mean they didn't have it or if we look back to the lessons of the polio virus um when we would test the spinal fluid of a child who is being actively paralyzed by this virus and this virus was replicating their spinal cord and causing damage and affecting the nerves that control the muscles\nWe can't isolate the virus out of the spinal fluid it's a very difficult virus to find and so when we diagnose the polio virus even today uh we do so by checking a stool specimens because the virus replicates within the gastrointestinal tract so\nIf you have a child with paralysis in your word that it could be due to the polio virus\nWe don't look to the final quarter of his final food because we can't find that we have to look elsewhere in the body and so we're trying to sort out the same process to use for the center of ours is now the the reassuring part of this relative to the history of polio virus\nIs in the world of polio virus back in the Nineteen thirties and Nineteen forties when we had tens of thousands of children being paralyzed by this virus\nWas that for every hundred to every thousand people who would get infected with this virus somebody will become paralyzed and so it's it's virulent sits ability to invade and damage the spinal cord was quite high\nThe best estimates for the enter a virus that we're most concerned about is that it's maybe one in a hundred thousand infection\nSo very very low rates very low rate and so we are be we're trying to be very reassuring to", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "25"}
