illicit welcome back to a point thanks for having me\nYou know I think this movie because it's a depicting such a momentous momentous period in in American and human history people are reading all sorts of things into it uh so I mean what's your take on it it is it a good movie\nYeah I mean I really really liked this movie I think one of the challenges for filmmakers who are making movies about really famous events that people watched on\nTV is to find a new angle into this story something that can resonate and surprise um the view whereas we're watching these very familiar events unfold\nAnd first manned manages to do it by going through\nBasically Neil Armstrong's experience being part of the space mission and um how that links in with his personal life so bringing those two pieces together means that it's maybe a different take them people were expecting to see but it's also more personal and\nYou know maybe you didn't expect to cry during a movie about the moon landing

human being on the moon he\nMade that famously lock on July twenty eighth Nineteen sixty nine and now there's a new movie out of that largely focused on Neil Armstrong and it's based on the book first man the life of Neil Armstrong which has been written by James Hansen he's a former NASA historian and professor emeritus of history at Auburn\nUniversity a professor hands and I just want to hear a little bit from Neil Armstrong himself here because back in two thousand five\nHe gave an interview to sixty minutes I spoke with reporter at Bradley and Bradley had asked Armstrong in one point of this interview about the confidence that Armstrong portrayed when he gave a big thumbs up to assigned to the media shortly before um the Saturn five and the Apollo eleven mission took off\nYeah but it's a little bit of a sham I've a mess that you know the reality is a lot of times you get up in getting the costs if something goes wrong somewhere to go back down so actually we asked you to lift off is really a big surprise [laughter]\nNeil Armstrong in two thousand and five and a Jim Hansen you eat and you write in your book in the movie explores again who Neil Armstrong was as a man his character his demeanor and\nThere's a lot in the book where you write about why Armstrong was picked to be the first man to step on them and and not ... and and if I got to have to ask if I had this right Chris craft to is the chief of flight operations in Houston said\nUh that Neal was Neal calm quiet an absolute confidence we all knew he was the Lindbergh type he had no ego meaning why\nWill they knew that that the ... the person who are not just commanded the Apollo and mission but more importantly in the sense of who is going to become this global like on the one who stepped out and represents humanity is the first step onto another heavenly body\nThat this was going to be a big deal to him they imagined that correctly and uh there was a private meeting between Chris craft ... late ... corps in George Low who was a big officials in the manned space program ... who was the director down in Houston\nIt was a very private conversation in fact it's this is you know by missing any records only an oral history coming from graft um and and that was that they were having a discussion they they knew that this was going to be\nA big deal and uh you know to the public what they said was that the person going out for the aspirin going out first would be based on really the interior really out of the limb to weigh the hatch opened the way the two astronauts were position inside the ... and\nThat always was what NASA told the public and even told the astronauts as to the reason why they had ... and you'll go out first 'cause the way that had to open it would be difficult for bus to beat the first one out\nBut in truth this you know this meeting was really what the decision was based on and that was\nA they knew that Neal was the type of personality that they felt would actually um ... could serve as this icon I mean there was a lot of public public relations in a sense too what are you know NASA was doing with the Apollo program and they wanted the right kind of representative for\nFor this and so it was not just the statement about Armstrong a but it was also kind of a comment on buses I mean they knew Buzz Aldrin quite well when they knew he was a very very professional astronaut\nBut they also knew that personality wise you know bus was quite a bit different than the all he was very extroverted he was you know as he was there was an element of narcissism and buzz honestly\nUh and they were some commanders in fact when I interviewed Frank Borman who was commander of Apollo eight warming made it very clear to me that he had told 'em leaks lightened that he would not accept buzz on his crew\nAnd it wasn't because he wasn't again I'm a professional astronaut ... there were just elements of buzz personality which were a little difficult in Neal could handle them a man and buzz and he worked together quite well but they just felt that if you know between these two men there was no question in their mind that Armstrong ... would be the perfect next ... a loon bird\nAnd bugs would be much more problematic well not\nInteresting but let's step back in time considerably if we could I mean tell us about a new Armstrong's younger years they see here that did he first start flying at the age of six\nOr he took us at first airplane ride and laid right okay I was sick of it and got his pilot's license on the sixteenth birthday before he even\nTried to drive an automobile yet little interest in automobiles which is kind of surprising for a boy back in that era but he had become very passionate about airplanes as a small boy he but he had his mommy saved every penny from everything you did\nTo buy a model airplanes that he built in in flight magazines\nWas really the passion for airplanes and flying you know in later after he becomes first man in becomes this iconic figure um some biographers or you can read this and a lot of the children's books that have been written about him suggested Neal was\nYou know looked at the stars and big into telescopes and read science fiction and all that really none of that's true I mean you didn't get interested in that until much later he was really all about airplanes and what happened was his career you know ... as a pilot going to Purdue University just to become an aircraft designer\nUm you know becoming a naval aviator the flu in Korea and becoming a test pilot he really led him to space was really not any you know Germany passion on his part as a as a boy that really just sort of the\nThe wave of technology in flight as was progressing from jets to rockets and right out of the atmosphere and he just went with it\nWell in your book you write about how um he loved flying so much I think he told you that when he was a young boy he would dream about it at night that he had this recurring dream of holding his breath and hovering over the ground that he was either and they're flying a or didn't fall but he was just hovering in his\n... he he did have that story and what was I think really a interesting about it was he was very reluctant to tell it to me because he didn't you know he was not the sort of person who\nReally you know um I mean there was a spiritual side to him but he wasn't the sort of person who who would emphasize you know the element of dreams for example in who he was or what he became\nAnd so he had this recurring dream and so he admitted to it but it was it was almost embarrassed to do it because you know I think he ended the story to me by saying well I I don't think you want to make too much of that you know\nUh so he was a very practical minded guy and and and even as a boy was type of those type of proto engineer looked at things\nThat he was saying like profoundly girl goal oriented had very ambitious because\nYou write about how you were saying this in a minute ago but it wasn't necessarily some sort of a passion for space in space exploration necessarily drove him but that all the great aviation accomplishments had already been done any kind of resented that and it was safe that was the next step\nYeah that was a you know he he had growing up in the thirties and they were still lots of first that were happening in terms of violating an aviation\nAnd of course reading all those um flight magazines as a boy and and building all those models he was aware of the great pioneering flights of that ... of the post of the pre World War two era any kind of thought as a boy well everybody's got those done and and now what's next [laughter] of course he didn't realize that there are all sorts of things yet to come\nYeah well so give me and said I Want to talk with you in some detail about an area of Neil Armstrong's life that the movie focuses on quite a bit and that's the death of his two year old\nA daughter Karen I'm so first of all let's let's just pray scene here from the movie first man you'll hear Ryan Gosling plays Neil Armstrong in in this little he's asked about ... death\nYou know sorry about your daughter [noise] sorry for your question [noise]\nWhy is a think it will have an effect [noise] I think it would be\nHungry and all that it wouldn't have some effect\nThe scene from the ... the first man didn't have to first of all tell us a little bit about uh Armstrong's daughter what happened to her\nWell may I say that in terms of that scene what what's really strikes me um two things struck me the most and that is one that Dr singer the screenwriter used verbatim a quote that I mean what Neal says in that scene\nA about being unreasonable to assume that would have no effect\nThat comes directly from my interview with him back in early to thousands I because I asked in that specific question about did he think it had in fact one of his flying on his crew choices afterwards and that exactly as what he's already answered so of course I Love that scene which is exactly what Neal said\nI'm Jeremy hops and I'm Amy McGrath and I have nine combat missions as a U.S marine Kentucky Democrat is giving Republican Andy bar a tough challenge he's touting the economy to grow our economy and create more opportunities I voted for middle class tax cuts looks\nThe rape Kentucky sick you know just for profile next time on your smart nine Ninety nine Wu a trucking NPR station [noise]\nIs on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking today with James Hansen he's a former NASA historian and author of the ... first manned the life of Neil Armstrong\nIt's the book upon which the new movie starring Ryan Gosling is based in that movie is also called first man and just before the break Jim Hansen was reminding us of of course those immortal words one small step for man one giant leap for mankind it that Neil Armstrong said when he first step foot on\nFew minutes Armstrong explained what was going through his mind at the moment he said those words\nI thought well when I step off I'm just going to be a little steps as we step they're down to a fair but then I thought about almost four hundred thousand people that are given me the opportunity to make that staff and so [noise]\nIt's gonna be a big something for all those folks and indeed a lot of others that even warning involved projects so there was a friend of a simple correlation sauce\nNeil Armstrong in two thousand five and how remarkably understated is he James hands and saying yeah I kinda thought it was going to be something big for people who weren't even involved in that kind of a simple correlation I say it's humility eggs are edible\nDon't you love at first simple correlation I mean that that that comes from an engineer I think it is\nBut uh yeah I mean as I said and one thing that I I get this question what and you know did he come up with that phrase long before they landed meals answer always was that he you know there was some dance and work on the land I mean there were lots of things that had to go right before they actually could\nLand in why think about what you're going to say when you step out and if you're not even going to do it\nSo he you know he told me and told everyone told everyone is whenever he was asked that he didn't really come up with the phrase until after they have landed and we had a few you know there were a few hours before they to get ready ensued up and then if that he composed it in his head while you know after the ... yeah\nIt was very close to say I mean it was he supposed to say one small step for man\nWill that's what he thought he did say into you know to his dying day that's what he thought and there's actually been a lot of the ... been done by different experts to see and I I was actually at a Smithsonian demonstration\nWere NASA officials are in ... Neal back in two thousand four I think it was\nIn and there was an Australian acoustics a guy who played uh and and he had evidence he thought that in the electronic register of the the sound waves that you could you saw something there that\nWas apparently an attempt to make the aid but it was an audible so I don't know I mean there's no way really I don't think to resolve this completely Neal Neal in the middle way told me said well just put you in parentheses\nWell Jim Hansen hold on here for just a second because I have to say this is this moment\nAh for those people who witnessed the launching of the Saturn five rocket who saw those grainy TV images of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin a walking on the moon and also by the way we should note Michael collins a as well\nUh orbiting around the moon alone has Armstrong and older and we're on the lunar surface it really left a as just a lasting impact on the millions of people who remember it because\nSomething totally delightful happened to us this morning we uh got an email out of the blue from Maria lanes she's in Watertown, Massachusetts because she had heard one of our our little promos that we were going to talk to you today about Neil Armstrong said Maria send us email out of the blue\nAnd along with some pictures that she took in Hawaii when um when the Apollo eleven crew returned to earth and it's just such a wonderful story and that we've invited Maria to be on the show with us as she joins us now real welcome to on point\nI'm making a thank you so much it's it's my great pleasure it'd be with you\nIt is wonderful to have you and I want everyone to go to on point radio dot org and check out these photographs that Maria sent us because there are these beautiful black and white pictures of the ... the air stream of a light a vehicle that\nUh Armstrong an older than college were in after they came back to earth what were you doing in Hawaii first of all what happened on that day\nWell I was visiting my uncle Frank uh who and his family and we were very close and um I was Thirteen and he was on heck I'm Airforce base is commander of a large see one twenty four cargo plane and that was during Vietnam of course\nThe Vietnam War yeah uh so um we were we got word that the NASA mogul quarantine facility a streamlined trailer a would be traveling behind my uncle's house with the astronauts after they touched down in the ocean and were picked up by a ship\nUh-huh I see the pictures that you sent us a if there's one in particular we we see you and your uncle standing there with with the uh the streamlined trailer going by and there's another photograph were Buzz Aldrin isn't the kind of waving a yes\nYes and the feeling\nWas you know that he was just overjoyed to be home I mean yeah it was a giant step for mankind and they actually returned from the mood\nWell so all these years later a Maria why is it that you still feel such like a ...\nWell uh you know I'm Still astonished at the courage of the astronaut their families the ingenuity of the enormous team that made it all happened\nA and there was some discussion about the movie and uh the book um and that they went off into space capsule that looks like you know maybe a little bit rickety\nCompared to do that today's sophisticated spaceships it looked like a ten tend to be perfectly honest [laughter]\nExactly exactly yeah so it's still so so moving and I'm so astonishing\nWell Maria lean from Watertown, Massachusetts a thank you so much for getting on the phone with us and thank you for sending us those remarkable photographs were going to share them with everyone who wants to see them on point radio dot org\nAgain it's images that Maria took a in Hawaii of the mass NASA mobile quarantine unit the streamlined trailer with Buzz Aldrin we from the window after he returned from the moon Maria thank you so much\nOh thank you I'm so thrilled well let's go now to Margot who's calling from Portland Maine Margot you're on the air\nI ...

I really appreciate markets all do you draw the connection between ah the president's remarks in Montana and what we've all been talking about the past ten days or so\nWell um it feels gross to talk about politics in the middle of this but since the midterms are a couple weeks away let's be honest that's the lens through which uh\nEveryone is going to be thinking in discussing every major issue between now and then and I think what Jake and John ah are talking about the last two callers is you know actually can give\n'em a really good reflection of some of the divide in this country right now about why they should care about this issue how much they care about this issue and and and and what is it are really mean a ... you know I mean the reasons why what happens to somebody who is\nA Saudi man living in the United states or with a contractual relationship from an American newspaper why should anybody care about that it's from a U.S perspective for two reasons number one is the U.S getting played President Trump\nJared Kushner have put all of really almost all of their eggs into the Saudi bask in terms of reinvention they had to deal with Iran\nOr who to do business with who to share power and intelligence with\nUh and uh it is this the right gambit and number two does the U.S still have I'm Still view itself as having a role in I'm\nTrying to send ... trying to send the right signals about human rights around the world why should the u._s. do this why should the U.S get involved in other people's business well ah because to promote democratic ideals and to um\nTo try to make 'em the rest of the world I'm the kind of place where it's also save to live and be a dissident express your views on to try to have word around the world and and maybe morality is too big a word but but some sense of appropriate global behavior okay so\nUh why should every American care about that more than the economy or\nA more than health care or more than the tax cut debate well they probably don't which is what President Trump is betting on when he\nTries to energize a crowd in in Montana or about a domestic issue and he doesn't believe that it will will impact them negatively\nI mean ... how important we think this is geopolitical spaces journalistic basis moral basis very few people are going to vote on a hundred percent but at the same time for briefly I Want to get at the question of do you think there is a direct line in the rhetoric from what the president says about the congressmen who just before his election assaulted American reporter for the guardian\nAnd pleaded guilty to that I Believe a misdemeanor assault\nA convicted on that are and what he's counting singer seemingly kind of hoping to tolerate happened from the hands of a a an allied from Saudi Arabia\nI'm not going to uh [noise]\nI'm just not in the position to make predictions about what the president's rent or the president's rhetoric in the United states uh it has caused this in any way or fuel is in any way but I Will say that um when when the president does make remarks suggesting that violence towards journalist is okay\nAmerican journalists are concerned uniformly not just about the implications that has in the United states but about the implications that has another country's\nI wanted to play you know we should turn to the midterms is coming up quick I Want to play a clip of what the president had to say uh recently here that the the tenor of what he has said in trying to rally Republican faithful and the base out at rallies in in sequence from Missouri West Virginia

I'm Sorry left the island and settled in Florida\nI'm temporarily all over the country as well but mainly in Florida particularly on the Orlando area there's a story that I saw this week that nearly Seventy eight thousand Puerto Ricans have registered in Florida\nUh the question is and we and as I said before I mistakenly we tend to think of these Puerto Ricans I'm moving to Florida just as a consequence of Hurricane Maria but no that's not the case there's been a a population train and Puerto Rico for the last three years or more since the fiscal crisis in the ...\nHave been leaving and many of them have been settling\nIn in in Florida so we'll see what the difference is going to be particularly in the ... and the race for governor\nI'm In South Florida it's there's a different dynamic you know the Latino bases well entrenched there there are been some changes of course demographic changes in some of those ... districts that are turning more democratic than\nThan the than the Cuban Americans who would tend to vote more Republican\nHave wanted but there's I think still they have some safe seats in there but but it's the key vote for the Puerto Ricans would make may make a difference in other parts of the state\nDuring an interview with CBS this morning on Wednesday former Obama administration official in San Antonio mayor who ...

organization led by use of color\nOr that organizes young people around issues related to political power and social racial and economic justice Kagan will not appoint\nHi David thank you for having\nCare first start or would you uh uh George so minutes from Milwaukee himself but what struck you about ah our conversation today\nUm I think one of the biggest thing that struck me was talking about star code switching and I find that often for me because I Do I Do live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin I go to a like a school have out here in Franklin Wisconsin\nSo can we just take a moment and I'd like to unpack that a bit for those folks who might not know about code switching is basically as a as I as I understand it you know basically switching how yet talking how you handle yourself if you're in different communities different neighborhoods how does it play out for you\nWell um so I always went to NPs or not MPs are just pulling Milwaukee because that's where I live but when I started a as a freshman in high school I came over to Franklin high school and it was a whole new ballgame for me going from being around people all day who look and talk just like me now coming here to people who look\nCompletely different than me and had different lingo and different things than I have so\nI remember my freshman year I Would still talk like normal or I was still you started playing and people would not understand what I\nMeant by saying certain words or I Would just feel different for talking less property and they did so I kind of get started teaching myself that when I met or I've talked property values proper English and when I go home I'm able to talk\nHow I feel comfortable talking and you dislike that my family and friends I used to\nYou know there's a scene in the movie a that goes that speaks directly to that a stark Carter is played by the actor a man's western bird uh she lives to live she shuttling between garden heights are poor and mostly black neighborhood and Williamson which is an affluent mostly white a private prep school did she attends\nA in this scene as I start enters Williamson she explains that she also shuttles between two ... two different persona is\nGuiding heights in one world Williamson is another and I got to keep it separate so when I'm here I'm Sorry version to that means slipping a switch in my brain Williamson salary doesn't use like if a rapper would say she doesn't even for my friends have\nSlang makes them cool thing makes me put you know those kids and they can say is that what you're talking about\nYesterday to get back to what I'm referring to\nI Wonder ... you know ... you read uh uh uh the book as well if I'm not mistaken are these things that kind of play out in your own life where you have to think about how you handle yourself because of the fact you're African American\nYeah I'm specifically to like my own past experiences I used to live in a suburb but I was younger and so the transition from when I moved away to the city and how everybody speaks them now you have to act as a completely different and\nSo because of the areas of where I work at I definitely have to experience the idea of code switching because\nUm it's like you because you are black\nSaying these words and acting like this makes you appear as it makes you appear as less educated than somebody else on your rallies people even though we don't like intentionally mean to do it it just kind of happened subconsciously because you never want to be like labeled as something like that\nAnd so I resonate with star a lot because when I had to switch back and forth between both rely mostly white communities and mostly populated with black communities the way I spoke to the way I talked we address the way I act it was completely different I definitely can relate to the idea of Code Switch team\nWhich at how much like how much of an extra burden is that walking around having to sink consciously about how you present yourself or is that kind of similar to you know how teenagers have to figure out who they are going to be anyway\nUm I think it's definitely an extra burden that we have because\nIdea of a double identity that we always have to face\nThis now is\nDimitrius you want to go in there for ... you know what I'm Sorry okay go ahead for you know you're trying to write a sorry um library\nAnd I [laughter] I um I definitely think that it's\nWay more harder for black person to find themselves because we're always faced with having to fight so many negative stereotypes it's already approaching this is the first place so I think if you're somebody who doesn't grow up\nBeing educated on history of our people and learn about how to really truly love yourself for being black and you're kind of just growing up in a world where if you're not hearing these things but you're hearing\nBy people aren't educated they missed their that their head they will everywhere and blah blah blah blah blah it's kind of like so what do I have to conform I substitute it seemed like I can make it so I think\nCode switching is definitely a burden for a lot of black people because it's especially a lot of young black people because we're not fully aware of ourselves yet and some of her face on trying to be ourselves but then also face on trying to please others it does become an extra burden because most other people won't have to go through that because they're already\nThe idea of perfection other people's eyes uh we are\nTo be trusted you have a different take on that

with your white classmates that spark any any new thoughts\nUm actually I had to up to one of my freshman year and then one maybe last week the first one that I had with my freshman class actually did strike a conversation about what happened but it wasn't a I'm\nA growing conversation it was more so like my teacher talking and then people just kind of like one of the conversation to be over\nAnd then the one that I recently had um last week was kind of the same thing so none of them really sparked the major conversations um\nBased on what my teacher said to my classmates responding it just kind of made it awkward for me on my end because I noticed that she was reading the book and talking about the situation everybody was kind of looking at me because I'm the only black student in the class\nAnd I'm In my school I'm known for talking about activism and police brutality so it just kind of both times kind of gave everyone kind of gave me the fight I um it didn't really bring up any

the air\n[noise] Hi thanks for taking my call thank you sir I just I\nI have a statement then I got a question my statement is are really just kind of\nRidiculous that we're still talking about this about the guy that's not so that was murdered not in the United states and we think that the credits possibly could have had something to do with the ... actually talking about credit\nBillions of dollars of you know that that that possibly could be you know creating jobs in the U.S over this one guy like this one guy nobody like it\nIt's all designed to make a negative you know look on Trump like we don't even know if the Saudis critic ... will do and that's just what were speculating and I'd just unlike my question is what should President Trump do\nLike to sit this one guy got killed there's not a U.S citizen again and it didn't have enough should we just cut all ties\nWith Jay Jay with Saudi Jake thank you for that that's actually really good question Fernando what do you say\nI think uh the administration obviously is not going to cut ties with Saudi Arabia is just so do I would jak was discussing we're all discussing earlier um\nBut I think that uh you know the the ties are both a strategic and commercial are are huge a Saudi Arabia from what I've read some analysis on from the energy sector is no longer\nThe as big a provider of oil as to you or to the U.S as he used to be still important but not the biggest anymore um but um I think\nThat uh what what the Trump Administration needs to do is try to get to the bottom of this and maybe show\n'em or you know a stricter stance or you know in front of what seems to be this um this murder because this murder has been condemned by everybody by so many places I Can't say everybody may sound like Trump saying that everybody's talking about it\nBut um yeah but so many leaders around the world uh that that that maybe the the United States has to take a stricter stance at least what what is not one that's been\nShowing right now or on a not the attitude that's been public are too many\nUh okay uh we also have a call from a uh Richmond in Vermont a John you're on the air go ahead\n[noise] hello David thanks for taking my call or just as a counterpoint to your previous caller I'm President Trump appears to be completely transactional with all his decision making\nAnd uh you know we should have a policy at a stance on human rights and independent journalism and but also have the idea of what we're\nWhat the players here have at stake um in terms of a wire the Turks are providing this information [laughter] if they have access to video and and recording and the Saudi conflict or we checking or conflict\nAnd just as a again a counterpoint\nHe talks about the apparent death of a uh mister show gay and then goes to Montana and law it's a congressman who assaulted a journalist and\nYeah and that was pretty stark right John\n[noise] it it it takes to bring into question his judgment and that's my concern or you know just to suppose that this is somehow a an event and you know designed to trapped someone frankly I don't think the world\nIs worrying about what the president is doing when they're having their own\nCrises All right well thank you thank you so much for that John ... I really appreciate market talk do you draw the connection between ah the president's remarks in Montana and what we've all been talking about the past ten days or so\nUm it feels grows to talk about politics in the middle ... since the midterms are a couple weeks away let's be honest that's the lens through which uh\nEveryone is going to be thinking and discussing every major ratio between now and then and I think what Jake and John ah are talking about the last two callers is you know actually can give\n'em a really good reflection of some of the divide in this country right now about why they should care about this issue and how much they care about this issue in and and and what is it really mean a ... you know I mean the reasons why what happens to somebody who is\nA Saudi man living in the United states or with a contractual relationship from an American newspaper why should anybody care about that it's from a U.S perspective for two reasons number one is the U.S getting played President Trump\nJared Kushner have put all of us really almost all of their eggs into the Saturday basking in terms of reinvention they had to deal with Iran\nOr who to do business with who to share power\nAnd uh it is the right gambit and number two does the U.S still have I'm Still view itself as having a role in I'm trying to send ... trying to send the right signals about human rights around the world why should the u._s. do this why should the U.S get involved in other people's business well\nAh because to promote democratic ideals and to uh to try to make 'em the rest of the world I'm the kind of place where it's also safe to live and be a dissident express your views on to try to have\nWord around the world and and maybe morality is too big a word but but some sense of appropriate global behavior okay so\nUh why should every American care about that more than the economy or\nA more than health care or more than the tax cut debate well they probably don't which is what President Trump is betting on when he\nTries to energize a crowd in in Montana or about a domestic issue and he doesn't believe that uh it will will impact them negatively\nI mean we're Carlos how important we think this is a geopolitical spaces journalistic basis moral basis very few people are going to vote on a hundred percent ... but at the same time for briefly I Want to get at the question of do you think there is a direct line in the rhetoric from what the president says about the congressmen who just before his election assaulted American reporter for the guardian\nAnd pleaded guilty to that I Believe misdemeanor assault\nA convicted on that are and what he's countenance singer seemingly kind of hoping to tolerate happened from the hands of a a an allied from Saudi Arabia I'm not going to uh\n[noise] I'm just not in the position to make predictions about what the president's rhetoric the president's rhetoric in the United states uh it had caused this in any way or fuel this in any way but I Will say that um when when the president does make remarks suggesting that violence towards journalist is okay\nAmerican journalists are concerned uniformly not just about the implications that has in the United states but about the implications that has another country's\nI'm One who played you know we should turn to the midterms is coming up quick I Want to play a clip of what the president had to say uh recently here that the the tenor of what he has said in trying to rally the Republican faithful and the base out at rallies in in sequence from Missouri West Virginia and Mississippi just in the past few weeks\nI'm not on the [noise] but I Am I\nMe I Want them under the balance that out in twenty Eighteen because you are voting for me in twenty eight [noise]\nYou're voting for me but then again President Trump told the Associated Press an extensive interview this week he went ah be to blame if the Republicans were to lose the house in November Jack Beatty is Donald Trump on the ballot even if his name isn't there or is he not\nYou certainly is and he was right the first time I'm you know when you look at the election step back they're really two elections going on one is in red states the senators and one swing districts the house members in the Senate it looks like the ... the Republican chances according to\nA five thirty eight are four and five of holding the Senate and maybe even gaining some seats\nAre the Democrats only one in five on the other hand you're look at the house five and six chance that the Democrats will take the house one in six\nFor the for for the uh the Republicans holding off so that's quite remarkable for a sort of you know spread of two separate electric two ... two kinds of elections going on and the elections are happening around the issue crucially of health care\nWe didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a ...

B. U. R. Boston NPR News station\nThis is on point I'm NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik I'm Talking about this past weekend the news with Fernando bizarro use of Washington correspondent for Univision Margaret ... senior White House correspondent for Bloomberg and on point use analyst Jack Beatty\nYou can join the conversation what stories caught your eye this week where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five ... hundred forty three talk\nYou can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook and on point radio a couple of listeners weighing in on line a Roger hunter at least a but listen posting on the name Roger Hunt posed a\nA that civility and the Democrats and the GOP is long gone the opposition is now the enemy hard to see during these a midterm election season what could bring us together uh another one speaking about the question of what we are expecting President Trump to do the notes\nSince it's worth noting the President Carter's disastrous legacy including a strong emphasis on human rights which in part led to the overthrow the shot in Iran and its Deb allusion to the fifteenth century theocracy a as described there are couple lists\nAnother element of the midterm elections which is the question of turnout and particularly turnout of Latino voters Democrats talk about this a lot I think ah in Texas they'd been staking that the idea that bait or a work would somehow benefit from that his\nHe is flew into a in Spanish appealing to Latino voters are are are said to be even though\nHis opponent Texas Senator Ted Cruz is of Cuban descent\nAh Fernando ... how important is a Latino turnout to Democrats and how well are they doing it in trying to accomplish that\nTeen Latino turnout was very very low is twenty seven percent and twenty sixteen went up twenty five percentage points um [noise]\nA few um has a few research Hispanic trends came out this week with their with numbers on to the you know a vote this year they they are saying that there's a record uh they they estimate twenty nine million eligible Latino voters but the key word here is eligible not registered\nUm it's it's been low in talking about Texas there's a five point four million\nEligible voters and Latino voters in Texas are ... probably needs that but you know it's sometimes it's really hard to to define a if crew says uh appeal\nTo two Latino Republicans in Texas is is is strong enough I'm\nInterested in glee for instance the Univision just a interviewed a last week both candidates and and and ... did it as as though he always does with Spanish language media didn't and Spanish or Ted Cruz didn't um he he never liked talking Spanish in public\nUh but I think it's very important to see what the what the\nTurnout was going to be that traditionally it tends to be disappointing the national association of Latino elected officials which is an authority on on on the Latino vote as well will come out next week would there\nA year I'm not yearly every two years um their their projection on the Latino vote we might get a clearer picture than but that this again and we'll we'll dependable hands on on the turnout\nAh Fernando are there a couple of other races that you point to is that in which you think that's going to be politically important\nWhile we have Florida a and I think Florida it's very interesting that much has been talked about um the influx of Puerto Ricans in Florida and we tend to think about it I think that conventional wisdom tends to think about Hurricane Maria\nAnd all the people who who left Florida may be temporarily and who have ... I'm Sorry I left the island and settled in Florida\nI'm temporarily all over the country as well but mainly in Florida particularly and the Orlando area there's a story that I saw this week that nearly Seventy eight thousand Puerto Ricans have registered in Florida\nOr the question is and we and as I said before I mistakenly we tend to think that these\nPuerto Ricans are moving to Florida just as a consequence of Hurricane Maria but no that's not the case [laughter] there's been a a population train and Puerto Rico for the last three years or more since the fiscal crisis in the island hit really hard and people have been leaving and many of them have been settling\nIn in in Florida so we'll see what the difference is going to be particularly in the ... and the race for governor\nI'm In South Florida it's there's a different dynamic you know the Latino bases well entrenched there there are been some changes of course demographic changes in some of those ... districts that are turning more democratic than than the than the Cuban Americans who would tend to vote more Republican\nHave wanted but there's I think still they have some safe seats in there but but it's the key vote for the Puerto Ricans would make may make a difference in other parts of the state\nDuring an interview with CBS this morning on Wednesday former Obama administration official in San Antonio mayor who Leon Castro says he's concerned about Latino turnout in the midterms because numbers have shown that the rate is ... at what he said is not what it should be\nI think what it's going to take the change that is that he campaigned on the six months before an election or by any one or two candidates it's going to take folks investing in a massive and sustained effort to get all the animals registered and then the turnout to evolve a\nAnd until that happens I don't think that the numbers are going to move a lot it\nMargaret ... seems to be that almost every cycle we hear the importance of Latino voters and the idea there's gonna be a surge but that there's a even if there's greater registration there's not a huge edition of of Latino voters what's your sense of all this I was really struck\nBy one of your callers earlier actually laughed in the middle of the question not to be disrespectful them but because it resonated with me so much he said he was so frustrated by the ... of different narratives about what's really going on in the midterms and I think you know not everybody is asking\nThe right questions which is it's a midterm year are the Republicans who voted for Trump still as enthusiastic are they going to go out and vote for their congressmen or will they turn you know what's the Latino vote\nWe in the past is very low for young voters are they energized they say they're energized is actually going to turn out what about the non college women what about the college educated women and I you know I the the polling attempts to measure a snapshot in time but you could say something three weeks before an election and then just\nWake up that Tuesday Morning and say you know and that's what the midterm question has always been so these questions are really important the president and many Republicans\nHave a I have at least been probably talking again about believing that things are swinging in their favor that Republicans could hold the house and\nAnd I think some Republicans see this caravan of Hondurans are who have been moving up through Guatemala and Mexico as something that could actually help them a ... having a counterintuitive thought so we have a lot in play here but\nUh the question really does when it's all said and done come down to what individual people do um either it's for absentee voting or in terms of going to the polls that day I\nWant to actually play a clip of a couple of a Honduran migrants who spoke to CNN this week there's ... mayor and I'm Andrea I layman they spoke to CNN this week about why they're making that track from Honduras towards the United states\nThere's much corruption here in Honduras we want to work there is no we want land to plant bananas plan themes being there isn't any brother we need to migrate to another country brother and the hospitals there is no security there's nothing or patients die brother\nWere heading to the United states we're going to arrive with Donald Trump he has to receive us\nUh you've heard their the voices of those migrants speaking through an interpreter is on on on CNN or for none of these are owed a there's a caravan it's obviously intended to create a tension or what are the repercussions of it well the repercussions\nCan be many obviously we could have a second family separation policy as it was a suggested by the administration or and reported last week that they are considering a new policy in which in a way that they would give somewhat of a\nVoluntary separation option to these families ones who are detained but this is mostly right now in the works we we still do not know the details of this but if I may give some some context to this care of and I think there are some politics involved I mean you interview I've seen many of the interviews that people that are coming up and there is a true need\nTheir people to gaping their people looking for better jobs are people looking for safety people have been threatened\nUm there's violence in the in the countries of the northern triangle which are on the doors of Guatemala and El Salvador [laughter]\nBut I Want to give some context of this this this caravan left some little Sula Honduras it day after last Saturday it day after a two day conference here in Washington at the state department\nHosted by the U.S and Mexico are led by vice
