concerned a to a certain degree um if you're if you're breaking it down by influence operations versus the infrastructure they've seen less of the attacks on the infrastructure than the foreign

influencing the vote via social media\nLike that as far as what the actual threat is to the election infrastructure I'm Chris crabs who's the top person at the H.

Senate intelligence committee in March Tim stark let me just turn to you quickly because you've reported on um lots of specific examples\nOf challenges that we have nationwide with our current voting system for example can you tell me the story briefly of the election systems and software machine a model six fifty tabulate machine and I should note that election systems in software\nIs one of the country's largest vendors voting equipment um what's the problem with the model six fifty tabulate him machine\nI've actually brought that went up a little bit already but all all operate because there are some other details about yeah aren't trusting wants to ... it's a bow tie doing machine that could be used at the county level to or if it were ... were hacked and somebody could it could alter hundreds and hundreds of votes perhaps thousands\nThat's part one another part is that it was beautiful it was the one that will be broken up with a with a with a writing pen\nAnd third um ... it had a vulnerability that that these researchers found that was actually a decade old\nWhich goes to show how far behind some of these companies are on cyber security or the voting centers of taken a lot of criticism you have some asked is one of them for kind of sticking their head in the hands on this I'm not realizing that this is a problem and wanting it\nOther machines have had other problems um you know strange things like researchers finding a Chinese a playlist music playlist on one of these machines for no apparent reason um it makes you wonder about the supply chain which is the ... who's\nWho is getting into these machines and where who was fixing them who's working on them and and and suggest that that these things are perhaps more ... than we even realize a Chinese music playlist yes\nIt was it was like MP threes if you remember it was it was an older machine that they that they found this on it also found some examples of people um I I it's sending out or or being ... are receiving messages in a way that suggested that um it it also could have been tempered within that wherever they had no conclusive evidence and so we have never what\nHave we ever found any malware known malware on or any other kind of a virus that that shows evidence of hacking on any of the machines are no because we haven't done those forensic audits that you're talking about\nI I think it's the latter I've not personally heard of a of any now we're being from on us but but keep in mind of course the malware spent on basically everything these days yeah there's a strong chance that it's that have happened and I'm just not aware of it but few people are well\nEric Rosen buck Tim ... points out that some states use these this particular machine the models six fifty to process ballots for entire counties and you can imagine and closely fought states in this country it only takes one county\nTo flip the electoral college but he he he he quotes Jake Braun a University of Chicago professor who served as a White House liaison or to de ... the biggest flaw in the process that he's found\nEven when they identify flaws is that they don't get fixed so is that a problem with the vendors or with the state and county level officials who are using these machines\nUm [noise] there's a really important point sort of you if this was not a hypothetical type of attack in Ukraine and twenty four team the Russian intelligence services attacked the boat tabulation machine in Ukraine decided to sort of tries to process that election you could see them easily using that same playbook in the U.S [noise]\nI'm a question of whether it's on the states or the vendors my personal belief is it's much more on the vendors they keep their software clues and proprietary based on their bottom line interest of trying to make money\nAnd were they more transparent and open it would be much easier for researchers just like they do in other areas of cyber security to find vulnerabilities um someone big ideas as a nation we could move and should move to an open source type system for all of our voting software\nSomebody here because of the the level to which some of these uh these vendors to push back against allowing researchers access to to their proprietary software or as Tim stark says is reported after DEF CON the or the hacker conference\nThat a ES and asked election systems in software actually I Believe sent a letter to its own customers warning them against helping researchers are by providing them with voting machine software a centrally saying that um you know it's proprietary we have copyright rules on it don't even help researchers are trying to make our ... our election system more secure\nYeah it's it's really disturbing for example anytime I say something negative about the vendors I'll get calls from their lobbying organizations asking if I really understand what I'm Talking about or whether\nOr don't want to talk to them so they're not going to give a more balanced explanation it reminds me a little bit of back in the older days when the the music industry was so adamantly protecting things in a way that didn't allow\nNew technology to emerge um so I think there's a problem there now the states or in a position where they unfortunately are under resourced and so don't always have a lot of money to update the systems or keep their security up to date into patching\nSo there is an issue there that we need to address uh but I Do think this is more on the vendors not being as transparent as they should\nAll right well Tim and Eric hang on here for just a second 'cause there's one more person I Want to welcome into this conversation Mary Schneider joined us She's president of verified voting a national election integrity advocacy group she's former Pennsylvania deputy deputy secretary for elections and administration posts she served in\nFrom two thousand Fifteen to two thousand Seventeen Mary Schneider welcome to on point I think you\nOwe first of all let's just let's get your take on this um E. S. S. example again election an election systems of software this major vendor of voting machines and in this country because they have issued a statement saying that this report about the hack ability of their machines\nUm ... their statement says that the vote the report can validate that any type of technology can be exploited under conditions where it is made accessible with zero controls which is not the case in an election regarding the M six fifty ESN as first manufactured it\nUm in Nineteen Ninety nine and discontinued manufactured those units in early two thousand eight so major vendor they're saying there isn't a problem ... what's your response to that\nWell first of all of that I just want to point out the and six fifty is is a high speed central count scanner\nIs but I I I think that I Will agree with their premise that all the computers are vulnerable and that Ninety nine percent of our votes in the United states are counted by computers and so those computers need special handling\nAnd ... in order to manage the risk that counting votes by computers present\nCom and exact science is offering colon guard for average risk to over a non invasive colon cancer screening tests that can be used at home my prescription only information at home is half dot com\nAs your car has a nickname doesn't hold wonderful memories of good times with family and friends\nWill make your cars last memory the bank one yes donated to W.

R. dot org slash cars and thanks [noise]\nDoes on point I'm making ... we're talking about election integrity at the state and local level about how to be sure the vote you actually cast a ballot you cast is as secure\nAs possible and in speaking this hour has Tim's Stark's he covers cyber security for political ... Rosen Bach also joined us he's co director of Harvard spell for center and director of the defending digital democracy project Mary Schneider is with us as well she's president of verified voting national in Texas a election integrity\nAdvocacy group and let's go to the phone lines here and it looks like a we've got a call from Jim Condos from Burlington, Vermont and Jim Congress that sounds like the name of the Vermont secretary of state is that'd be who you are\nThat is indeed who I Am\nWell Secretary condos welcome to the program thank you so much for calling in a law how is that the state of election security in Vermont\nSo we said\nWe feel that we're pretty good shape we uh we actually started uh working on cyber security in our electrical systems back in two thousand thirty a ... at that time we did a full blown risking vulnerability assessment um we had any recommendations or\nUh who are put into I eat in a low priority or in a little we've consistently work to get all those recommendations are ... are being said that we also do\nA penetration passed and we continue to do a a regular ... other patients house as well uh and I think that that the important thing to remember for most\nOf for most of your listeners is that uh and it's been mentioned already what are we are a very this decentralized\nSystem down from aren't on like Boston New England we do not have county government level to the state level\nOr and and you know we've got a lot of things going on and I you know I sat on a panel with Eric Wilson bomb a it back in the march before the Senate intelligence committee or you know we announce at that time that we are implementing in fact there are some of the Haitian yeah we've got Web\nWeb applications fire walls to eat\nWhat will secretary since you're constantly just jump in here your cell phone dogs also the shaky here but at this to this a key question when I ask you before hopefully your lungs hopefully like whoa fall apart but\nI've seen here that even given the steps that you you said you've just taken in Vermont to ensure the security of the voting system there as much as possible I mean NBC News is reports that in August in late August there were three different methods\nUsed to uh get access or attempts to get access to Vermont online voter registration database someone tried three times or three different people groups tried to get access to your your voter database did that happen\nYes it did in Libya but let me explain that there isn't a computer in the world that has a website or anything that isn't getting ... and every day what we experienced was scans are a lot\nA lot a lot of the systems showed us\nWhere they were coming originating from although the ... you can always count on that but the one that raised our attention if you want to call it um was the one that said Russian Federation forwarded that onto\nA department of homeland security through the communication ... for the call that we have a developed over the last year\nAnd a I think that that you know our systems are getting paid thousands of times per day thousands of times per hour the question is how to cook the systems in place to defend against it back in two thousand six that were forty one states that were targeted yep one state was breached\nAnd uncles the conversation was always about the one state that was released would never adopt a twenty states that are actually a defended again\nWe stayed was reached you know I haven't I haven't heard of that which state which was breached take on does\nA ... I Believe it was I Believe it was a um Illinois\nWell one last question for you briefly because I Want to turn back to I guess with the with what you have to say but but I mean you're the secretary of state for Vermont what would be the most helpful thing to you from the federal level to take even more strides forward in elections security\nWell now let me look we speak so and I love it when you visit there are some practices that we need to do all these\nLittle in mark ... was the only way that you actually audit oh we do ... ... ... ...\n... pounds after thirty days election [noise] doing them some struggles rubber discrepancy\nYeah [noise] well Jim Condos secretary of state for Vermont calling us from Burlington, Vermont thank you so much for your call\nYour walk\nA Mary Schneider let me turn back to your president or verified voting there are what are you hearing what to the secretary of state of Vermont had to say\nWell I think that all of the things that he mentioned are really important especially the voter my paper ballots which we were talking about and and I wanted to turn back to something that I said earlier in the show the kind of audits that we're talking about are not a forensic analysis of machines or\nAnything like that theory a statistical sample of these ballots of the voter my paper ballots that you can check and make sure the software I'm ... was a recorded the results accurately but what he said about um doing a risk of vulnerability assessment\nUm when I was in Pennsylvania we we actually engage with the age has to do a risk and vulnerability assessment of the Internet you know Internet facing applications networks that touched on elections within Pennsylvania\nAnd we actually also contracted with a third party vendor to do the same thing\nAnd I think that that those are steps that every state should take what the other complexity is that sometimes\nThe elections are run under the governor's jurisdiction sometimes are running a very small secretary of State Department so the level of resources is going to vary widely ... I think we keep coming back to this resource question\nWell let's take another call here Kathleen is calling from Syracuse New York Kathleen you're on the air\nHigh make now I Am an election inspector in Onondaga County which is in upstate New York in ... I live in Syracuse ... and I've been doing that since two thousand\nSeveral years ago we switch to a new voting system instead of using the ... machines we switch to voter mark ballot\nCombined with optical scanners so when we get to the polling place in the morning we had locked suitcases for each district we have a [noise]\nStickers that keep the voting machine from a messed with unless\nSomebody uses a pair of scissors and takes them off and we we are told by\nA board of elections on those uh audits sheets how many ballots they have centralized become shrink wrapped in a package is the fifth day we usually get two hundred and fifty yeah for each district we have to it's a kind of convoluted\nVery mathematical system where you have to account for every single ballot we also have affidavit ballots to people that aren't showing up in our um our in our election bucks so that if somebody comes in and we can't find their name they had the opportunity to fill the at the gave a valid\nAnd have a chance to vote when the voter gets done marking the ballot they have little circles in them for each candidate and amend that yeah they take the paper ballot you get in line and then they go to the optical scanning machine and they scan it through\nAt the end of the night we have people who break down the voting machine they a scanner and we have to memory card inside of the scanner\nOne of the memory cards were able to pop out and we physically hand to a runner who physically takes it down to the board of elections too so that they can do a quick audits not official unofficial southern get it on cheap and get upset\nAnd then um [noise] there's also a second memory chip in the same machine\nYeah will come out with a ... I'm going to take the call back from you on that point and thank you so much because you said a lot of interesting things that I Want to hear from our guests reflect on so Kathleen election inspector from Syracuse New York Thank you for your call\nAn era grows and book um I think there were probably several other steps that you know the more to talk to us about about how New York tries to make their elections are secure as possible does it sound like they're doing living the rising\nNinety two point seven WB you ate his very eighty nine point one WB UH Brewster and streaming at W.

I mean how does this is a pretty easy what how about this one then church wants to know that he'd be interested to know the change in the audience for a drag race with more teens and young people watching has influenced how you conceive and produced the show\nNo it hasn't you know our goal is always been to a to celebrate the art of drag and the art of the people behind drag and and tell their stories because it's it's it's a very unique person\nAnd personality who's able to\nAh ah change themselves and and to\nDie voluntarily die and become reborn into\nAnother incredible image of their own imagination there's something very very important there so uh know what happens is we produce the show and then we add the queens who are different every year every season\nAnd it takes on a a life of its own\nSo we've got a couple of questions here from folks who want to know how the mainstreaming of drag a in part driven by the success of the show\nMay may have changed the community itself that's because under son she wants to know that and someone calling themselves Django James uh wants to know what's the best way to tackle the racial bias issues that have become more apparent in drag race fandom as the show become mainstream\nWell those are two big questions that the first one is drag will never be mainstream drag will never be mainstream because\nUh in our ego driven culture the idea of shape shifting which is what drag is I'm a ... will never take cold because the ego will not accept\nThe idea of someone changing their identity\nWe're our whole culture is based on a density a consumer culture is there to sell beer and shampoo and they want to pinpoint who you are what you're buying habits are and what your belief system is\nAnd drag is the opposite of that ... who now I'm this didn't oh now and that\nSo drag will never be mainstream uh now I'm you know racial issues it's it's um with within the drag it what ... what happens is um we get a lot of young people who have ideas of\nOf of their own right and they walk into our show as a viewer with different ideas um I I Believe the racial divide with our viewers has to do with\nUm the fact that a lot of young people they gravitate to what they know so a lot of the girls who are blonde and white on our show will have way more\nA social media followers\nThan someone who is not blonde\nTo us as a culture as Americans as as a people on this Earth I'm a ... it has very little to do with our show because our show I Believe we ... our show is the most diverse a\nA cast in television when we cast everybody in fact I think uh uh this past season without giving anything away well\nYeah because I was going to I was going to be a good little T we can say who we have on\nThe show um uh it's not a lot of white people [laughter]\nI'll just say that much you have your token white folks with ah we've had some of them but listen you\nKnow we we cast the show based on the criteria is what it's charisma uniqueness nerve and talent that's how we cast show if you got it Iran\nAnd they do okay so I just haven't been resisting asking you this question but I just have\nTo know a [laughter] I'm a ... fan and and and ... and all her fans are still wounded\nFrom the fact that that that you you drop her from the showing that in that great lip sync between her and trixie Mattel and I just think she was ... what happened there\nWell we we uh first of all you need and so Rob because share Angela is almost steals the ... the movie stars for and she's in that movie and she does a great job in that but the truth is none of the girls are losers if you're on the show you're a winner\nOr even as you played the the the clip of MySpace Angie she did one episode and became an in tune to Asheville stuff [laughter] so you know um nobody loses if if you're on the show you're a winner\nOkay so that actually leads me to something else that I wanted to ask you about because\nThere's been a lot of media coverage of reporters drag race because it hasn't become so popular has really uh elevated the careers of the drag queen to appear on the show to super stardom level as you said but I think it was in a big New York times article a while ago\nThat talked you know is there a risk in the dry and community a little bit between um\nThe queens who get to be on on your show versus the many many many who don't because you know I've been reading that\nUh you know be when booking shows now folks are looking for a recall girls essentially who've been on the show and perhaps not booking very hardworking drag queens who who just haven't been on TV [noise]\nYeah well that's that is the nature of show business and you know I I've been doing this for a long time um I've been in fashion I've been out fashion\nNinety two boys seven WVU ages break eighty nine boy one WB UH Brewster and streaming W.

Senate intelligence committee in March Tim's Stark's let me just turn to you quickly because you've reported on um lots of specific examples\nOf challenges that we have nationwide with our current voting system for example can you tell me the story briefly of the election systems and software machine a model six fifty tabulate machine and I should note that election systems in software\nIs one of the country's largest vendors of voting equipment\nUm what's the problem with the model six fifty tabulate machine\nI've actually brought that went up a little bit already but I'll I'll elaborate because there are some other details about yeah are interesting one is ... it's a bow tie billing machine that could be used at the ... or the county level to uh if it were ... if we're having somebody could it could alter hundreds and hundreds of votes perhaps thousands\nThat support one another part is that it was ... was the one that was able to be broken and with a with a with a writing from\nAnd third um ... it had a vulnerability that that these researchers found that was actually a decade old\nWhich goes to show how far behind some of these companies are on cyber security or the voting centers of taken a lot of criticism yes and that's just one of them for kind of sticking their head in the hands on this I'm not realizing that this is a problem and wanting to kind of go way\nUm other other machines have had other problems um you know strange things like researchers finding a Chinese a playlist music playlist on one of these machines for no apparent reason um it makes you wonder about the supply chain which is the ... who's\nWho is getting into these machines and where who was fixing them who's working on them and and and suggest that that these things are perhaps more ... than we even ...\nA Chinese music playlist\nYes it was it was like MP threes if you remember it was a it was a it was an older machine that they that they found this on it also found some examples of people um I I it's sending out or or being ... are receiving messages in a way that suggested that um it it also could have been tempered within that way although they had no conclusive evidence\nSo we have never what have we ever found any malware known malware on or any other kind of a virus that that shows evidence of hacking on these machines are no because we haven't done those forensic artist that you're talking about\nI I think it's the latter I've not personally heard of a of any now we're being put on us but but keep in mind of course the malware spent on basically everything you're saying yeah there's a strong chance that it's that it's happened and I'm just not aware of it and I but few people are well\nAh Eric Rosen buck Tim points out that some states use these this particular machine the model six fifty to process the ballots for entire counties and you can imagine and closely fought states in this country it only takes one county\nTo flip the electoral college but he he he he quotes Jake Bronner University of Chicago professor who served as a White House liaison or to de ... the biggest flaw in the process that he's found\nEven when they identify flaws is that they don't get fixed so is that a problem with the vendors or with the state and county level officials who are using these machines\nUm [noise] there's a really important point sort of Europe this was not a hypothetical type of attack in Ukraine and twenty four team the Russian intelligence services attacked the boat tabulation machines in Ukraine\nThat election you could see them easily using that same point will come to us\nOn the question of whether it's on the states or the vendors my personal belief is it's much more on the vendors they keep their software clothes and proprietary based on their bottom line interest of trying to make money\nAnd were they more transparent and open it would be much easier for researchers just like they do in other areas of cyber security to find vulnerabilities um some one big ideas as a nation we could move and should move to an open source type system for all of our voting software\nSomeone here because of the the level to which some of these ah these vendors to push back against allowing researchers access to to their proprietary software or as temp starches is reported after DEF CON the uh the hacker conference\nThat er ES and asked election systems in soft or actually I Believe sense of a letter to its own customers warning them against helping researchers are by providing them with voting machine software a centrally saying that um you know it's proprietary we have copyright rules on it don't even help researchers are trying to make our ... our election system more secure\nYou know it's it's really disturbing for example anytime I say something negative about the vendors I'll get calls from their lobbying organizations asking if I really understand what I'm Talking about or whether or don't want to talk to them so that I can give a more balanced explanation\nIt reminds me a little bit of back in the older days where the the music industry was so adamantly protecting things in a way that didn't allow\nNew technology to emerge um so I think there's a problem there now states or in a position where they're unfortunately are under resourced and so don't always have a lot of money to update the systems or keep their security up to date and do pattern\nSo there is an issue there that we need to address uh but I Do think this is more on the vendors not being as transparent as they should\nAll right well Tim and Eric hang on here for just a second 'cause there's one more person I Want to welcome into this conversation Mary Schneider joined us She's president of verified voting a national election integrity advocacy group she's former Pennsylvania jeopardy deputy secretary for elections and administration posts she served in\nFrom two thousand Fifteen to two thousand Seventeen Mary Schneider welcome to on point Oh thank you\nUh first of all let's just let's get your take on this um E. S. S. example again election an election systems of software this major vendor of voting machines and in this country because they have issued a statement saying that this report about the hack ability of their machines\nUm ... their statement says that the vote the report can validate that any type of technology can be exploited under conditions where it is made accessible with zero controls which is not the case in an election regarding the M six fifty ES and as first manufactured it\nUm in Nineteen Ninety nine and discontinued manufacture those units in early two thousand eight so\nMajor vendor they're saying there isn't a problem ... what's your response to that\nWell first of all that I just want to point out the ... six fifty is is a high speed central count scanner\nAnd that is not used at polling places but I I I think that I Will agree with their premise that all the computers are vulnerable and that Ninety nine percent of our votes in the United states are kind of by computers and so those computers need special handling\nAnd in order to manage the risk that counting votes by computers present\nMB usa dot com in it's in a global biotech company hiring in their headquarters in global hub in Cambridge Mass you can join it's in and making an impact on patients lives it's been dot com [noise]\nI'm Peter O'Dowd even among Republican candidates who want to repeal Obamacare they're using appetite to protect coverage for those with preexisting condition [noise] what's the truth about what repeal means for those people now is the issue plain and the run up to the twenty Eighteen mentor that's next on hearing now\nTomorrow at noon on Ninety point nine W. B. U. R. Boston's NPR News\n\nThis is on point I'm making ... we're talking about election integrity at the state and local level about how to be sure the vote you actually cast the ballot you cast is as secure\nAs possible and I'm speaking this hour has Tim's Stark's he covers cyber security for political ... Rosenberg also joined us he's co director of Harvard spell for center and director of the defending digital democracy project Mary Schneider is with us as well she's president of verified voting national ... the election integrity\nAdvocacy group and let's go to the phone lines here and it looks like a we've got a call from Jim Condos the from Burlington, Vermont and Jim Condos that sounds like the name of the Vermont secretary of state is that ... who you are\nThat is indeed Well Secretary condos welcome to the program thank you so much for calling in a how was the state of election security in Vermont\nSo we we feel that will who do we we actually started working on cyber security alert system but you see a ... that we did it\nThe assessment um we had any recommendations or a or put it into a medium that low priority or in a ... we've consistently work to get all those recommendations are ... are being said that we also do\nA penetration passed and we continue to do a regular tracing tests as well uh and I think that that the important thing to remember or most\nOf for most of your listeners is that uh and it's been mentioned already what are we are a very this essential\nLicense the monitor on like most New England we do not have county government level to the state level\nOr and and you know we've got a lot of things going on and I sat on a panel with Eric Wilson bomb a it back in a a march before the Senate intelligence committee a you know we announce at that time that we are implementing soccer a foundation yeah we've got Web\nWeb applications are walls another eat\nWell we'll secretary sensory conscious of me just jump in here your cell phones on ... also the shaky here but at this to the key question to ask you before hopefully your love for you I Will fall apart but\nI've seen here that even given the steps that you you said you've just taken in Vermont to ensure the security of the voting system there as much as possible I mean NBC News is ... reports that in August in late August there were three different methods\nUsed to uh get access or attempt to get access to Vermont online voter registration database someone tried three times or three different people groups tried to get access to your your voter database did that happen\nYes it did in Libya but let me explain that there isn't a computer in the oil that has a website or anything that isn't getting ... and every day what we experienced was scans are a lot a lot a lot of the system showed us\nWhere they were coming originating from although you can always count on that but when they raised our attention if you want to call it um was the one that said Russian Federation voted on onto\nA department of homeland security through the communication ... for the call that we have a developed over the last uh a year\nAnd a I think that that you know our systems are getting paid thousands of times per day thousands of times per hour the question is how to cook the systems in place to defend against it back in two thousand six that were Twenty one state that were targeted yep one state was breached\nAnd uncles the conversation was always about the one state that was we would never adopt a twenty states that are actually a defended again\nWe stayed was reached you know I I haven't I haven't heard of that which state which was breached Jane Fonda is\nA ... I Believe it was I Believe it was a um Illinois\nOkay interesting well one last question for you briefly because they want to turn back to I guess with uh with what you have to say but but I mean you're the secretary of state for Vermont what would be the most helpful thing to you from the federal level to take even more strides forward in elections security\nWell now let me let me speak for myself and I must say it up\nWhen he was that there are some practices that we need to put in place one of them being older marked paper ballots 'cause that was really the only way that you can actually audit or we do what we call it usually hired just confidence level audits are randomly selected\n... pounds after within thirty days election um we've been doing um ... thousands they never found a discrepancy yeah\nWell Jim Condos secretary of state for Vermont calling us from Burlington, Vermont thank you so much for your call\nYour walk\nA Mary Schneider let me turn back to your president or verified voting there are what are you hearing what the secretary of state of Vermont had to say\nWell I think that all of the things that he mentioned are really important especially the voter my paper ballots which we were talking about ... and I wanted to turn back to something that is that early on the show the kind of audits that we're talking about are not a forensic analysis of machines or\nAnything like that they're in a statistical sample of these ballots and the motor my paper ballots so that you can check and make sure the software um was a recorded the results accurately but what he said about um doing risking vulnerability assessment\nUm when I was in Pennsylvania we we actually engage with the age has to do risk invulnerability assessment of the Internet you know Internet facing applications networks that touched on elections within Pennsylvania\nAnd we actually also contracted with a third party vendor to do the same thing and I think that that\nWhat the other complexity is that sometimes the elections are run under the governor's jurisdiction sometimes around in a very small secretary of State Department so the level of resources is going to vary widely ... I think we keep coming back to this resource question\nWell let's take another call here Kathleen is calling from Syracuse New York Kathleen you're on the air\nHigh make now I Am an election inspector in Onondaga County which is in upstate New York in ... I live in Syracuse ... and I've been doing that since two thousand\nSeveral years ago we switch to a new voting system instead of using the ... machine we switch to voter my ballot\nCombined with optical scanners so when we get to the polling place in the morning we had locked suitcases for each district we have a\nStickers that keep the voting machine from a messed with unless\nSomebody uses a pair of scissors and takes them off and we we are told by\nA board of elections on those uh audits sheets how many ballots they have centralized become shrink wrapped in a package is fifty we usually get two hundred and fifty yeah for each district we have to it's a kind of convoluted\nVery mathematical system where you have to account for every single ballot we also have affidavit ballots to people that aren't showing up in our um our in our election bucks so that if somebody comes in and we can't find their name they had the opportunity to fill the at the gave a valid\nAnd have a chance to vote when the voter gets done marking the ballot they have little circles in them for each candidate and um and that yeah they take the paper ballot you get in line and then they go to the optical scanning machine and they scan it through\nAt the end of the night we have people who break down the voting machine they a scanner and we have to memory cards inside of the scanner\nOne of the memory cards were able to pop out and we physically hand to a runner who physically takes it down to the board of elections too so that they can do a quick audits not official unofficial southern get it I think of that\nAnd then um there's also a second memory chip in the same machine\nYeah we'll have that I'm going to take him going to take the call back from you on that point and thank you so much because you said a lot of interesting things that I Want to hear from our guests reflect on so Kathleen election inspector from Syracuse New York Thank you for your call\nAn era grows and book um I think they're probably several other steps that tells me more to talk to us about about how New York tries to make their elections are secure as possible does it sound like they're doing living the rising", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "22"}
