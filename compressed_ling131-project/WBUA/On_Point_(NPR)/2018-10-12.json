O. P. N. Y. that\nThat was that moment occurred the day after the last presidential election you know I was somebody who was viscerally instantly opposed to Donald Trump from the moment that he came down that escalator at Trump Tower\nAttacking Mexicans are rapists and murderers I couldn't believe that you had a mainstream candidate who was talking like that and I never imagined that he would win the Republican nomination much less the presidents and so I was very dismayed to see Trump's progress\nFirst in the Republican primaries and then in the general election it was the shock of my life and I think many people's lives to see Donald Trump actually win the presidency and the next day I knew what I had to do which was after a lifetime as a Republican is a movement conservative\nI re registered as an independent because I knew I just knew at that point I could not be part of this Trump provide Republican Party\n... well so I mean seeing movement conservative do what do you mean by that\nI was part of what was known as the conservative movement from a fairly early age I was a conservative columnist at the University of California at Berkeley\nI was an op ed editor at the wall Street Journal editorial page I was a regular writer for commentary in the Weekly Standard I was a\nForeign policy advisor to three presidential candidates so I was fairly deep within the conservative bubble\nAre working for what I thought was was the good of America and I was shocked and ... and perhaps I shouldn't have been shocked I should have seen this all along but I was just so dismayed to see the kind of message that don't that Donald Trump won on which was completely antithetical to the brand of conservatism that are champion which I associate more with people like\nFlash flood

about why his new book is called the corrosion of conservatism why I left the right and we have an excerpt of it at one point radio dot org\nAnd you can call in ... one eight hundred and forty three eight to fly aside that eight hundred for two three talk or if you're a Republican and you happen to agree with Max Boot about you concerned about where the GOP is headed what do you think we ought to do to address those concerns\nBut if you're a Republican who thinks the party is exactly where it needs to be right now representing your interest in doing so with a full throated passion call us as well what's your thought for ... were one eight hundred forty three eighty five to eight hundred for two three talk\nUh now I'm actually in the last statement you mentioned um what what you call a GOP quote unquote ... who are have been surrounding and supporting President Trump exactly what do you mean by that\nAll the people who who basically flat or his ego including people like Lindsey Graham who once called him a coup can now\nOh talks about how Donald Trump as a superb Gulf or I mean I I I have to our chapter and verse in my ... of of of the circumstance of Donald Trump who literally refer to him as if you were the second coming who think that he's the savior of humanity I mean it's unbelievable this was a president or you know who was\nOnly has the support or about forty percent of Americans and and that's too high in my book but most people recognize\nThat he is not an honorable figure but what's really shocking to me is the extent to which the Republican Party has transformed himself into a Donald Trump cult I mean so many people have jumped the Kool Aid including people but I once had respect for it's it's really been a gut wrenching in soul crushing experience for me to see what's going\nOn well uh we have some tape here from June to thousands Seventeen when the president convened his cabinet and called on every member of the cabinet to speak one by one now\nI I think some folks might remember this because some of the cabinet members looked quite uncomfortable and we're careful to avoid flattering the president directly but for many of the others um they did heap praise or upon a President Trump now the\nWhole sort of a person by person moment took about eleven minutes and we're not going to play all of that obviously we've got significantly cut it down but here's some of the the flattery that members of the cabinet where heaping upon the president in June two thousand Seventeen\nI think he was president of the\nOr whatever the credit lotteries to leave that fire health services at this pivotal time under your leadership I Can't thank you enough for the religious shift is your show\nI Want to thank you [noise]\nThe entire staff\nHim Mr President we face for the boy I may have given us or very surprised that I write are traveling around the country for the last year an even greater on her to be here serving in your ...\nSo you heard their vice president Mike Pence then secretary of health and Human Services Tom Price transportation secretary Elaine Chao and then chief of staff writes previous and treasury secretary Steve minutiae and a no Max Boot you know many of these people can you explain\nA they're they're ... seemingly unquestioning unquestioning feel the to the president\nIt's it's really a cult and what the un I think that they feel it's necessary because they understand\nUh that that Donald Trump doesn't egomaniac who is also very insecure and has an insatiable need for praise and basically he likes to anybody who praises him whether it's\nHis cabinet members or dictators like ... or Kim Jong on\nBut you know that that tape that you played some ... who's to my mind is one of the most revolting an on American spectacles I've ever heard I mean this is something you might expect going on in the quarter Bluey the fourteenth or in Pyongyang this was not what should be happening\nIn the White House the people's houses in our constitutional republic where we do not elect Donald Trump educating you're supposed to be the president\nCharged with enforcing the laws and yet he was being treated\nBy those around him and it was a few of the leader of a religious cult profoundly dangerous\nTo be totally cynical about this oh Max Boot is it realistic at all to expect politicians to act anything other than politically and right now they are recognizing that the center of gravity in this party is around the president of the United states\nWell forgive me maybe I'm naive but I Do think that politicians have a higher duty to their country and to the constitution and they do to their own reelection prospects this has been so dismaying to me to see Republicans that I once respected\nLindsey Graham an on and on and on who have sold out their beliefs who will not say in in\n... in public when I Know they they understand in private which is that Donald Trump is utterly unfit to be president and why won't they do that\nBecause they're all terrified of what happened to Mark Sanford the the Republican congressman in South Carolina who spoke out against Trump Trump treated against him he lost his reelection okay this is not the end of the world okay it's not like Trump is sending out death squads to kill people the worst thing that will happen to these folks is that they will lose reelection\nBut better to lose reelection than to lose their principles and they have lost their principals they have lost their way very very dismaying to see\n... but let me see I'm trying to figure out the right way to ask but ... but can't the argument would be made and perhaps this is the argument that you're making in the book that those very principles though are what got the GOP to where it is right now I mean for example\nA you know I'm looking at your own support your vociferous support in in the early to thousands for for the Iraq War and there are many people today\nWho ... who cast their vote for President Trump because they look at things like the Iraq War as the epitome of ... of international elitism gone or wry that that was that was money and effort that should've been spent right here in the United states he seems like there were many conservative\nOr a principled conservatives who supported the Iraq War in two thousand three they those same people surrounding themselves or or the surrounding the president right now so what is it not inevitable in a way that we arrived here\nI don't think it was inevitable but it's certainly understandable because I think the establishment made a lot of big mistakes including the Iraq War including the mistakes that led to the great recession of two thousand two thousand an item that\nDiscredited mainstream Republican orthodoxy and I I ride in the book and in in what I think is try to do in a very honest and soul searching way about my own responsibility for getting here\nI was certainly a proponent of the Iraq War along with Seventy two percent of the population but I was certainly more prominent than than most of that Seventy two percent and for years I was very defensive about the disaster that ensued and refused to completely renounced my decision to now with\nThe clarity of hindsight I'm looking back and trying to figure out in my way forward I've\nI I mean I make a clean breast of it in the book and I say you know this was a mistake and I was\nIn I was wrong to have advocated the war this is a terrible\nDisaster for which I have to take ownership and I and I think that other you know supporters and architects of the war should take ownership of it as well and and there's\nOf course the irony is that Donald Trump himself was a supporter of the war even though you won't end but it now but but there's no question that these kinds of miscalculations lead the way a an open the way to Trump ism which you know I think is is a catastrophe for America in the world\nFar worse than what we've seen in the past because he is\n... you know undermining our democracy with those attacks on the rule of law he's undermining American leadership abroad undermining American allies he's opening the way for dictators so you know this is the terrible situation but you know we have to be honest and and and admit that the Republican establishment was not blameless in getting us here\nYeah well we're speaking with max ... is our his new book is the corrosion of conservatism why I left the right and we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk a max it's got a couple of callers here if we can let's first go to Mike who's calling from winter ville North Carolina Mike you're on the air\nMax yes\nI agree with your analysis completely I think Trump and absolutely horrible president I was telling all my friends I could vote against them in the primaries\nBut leaving a party is a terrible mistake we need to fight for our party and hope that someone like I have a mental block on flakes name for math class or some decent Republican comes in and challenges him if he still president and Tony Tony\nTo fight against him leaving the party is is just wrong\nHe might before it and turn it back to Mexico let me ask you mean you mentioned Jeff Flake or I'd say get Jeff Flake Bob Corker all these are Republicans who who are choosing to retire rather than to continue their political career and I don't hear any of them seem to going to run for president so it seems like they're saying there's no room for them at all in the party\n[noise]\nUm if you're like many public radio listeners you probably take great care of your mood in your car you probably visited the car washes services that are

B. U. R. dot org slash cars and thanks [noise]\n\nDead\nOn point I'm making a check her body we're talking this hour with Max Boot his new book is the corrosion of conservatism why I left\nThe rights he's a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations a columnist for the Washington Post and an analyst on CNN as well and we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred and four to three talk and and max I'm going to go to a couple of callers here because they've got a lot to say so let's turn to Steven who's calling from Norfolk, Virginia\n[noise] Hi mega ... thanks for taking my call so I'm a I'm a moderate Democrat probably closer to independents and my biggest concern is that\nI recognize that there's value in bowl conservatism of protecting individual rights while at the same time trying to come together society to grow society and my biggest concern is that you see the fringes that are just pushing further further right and left\nTo ... protect the greedy and protect the lazy or respectively so you know it seems like hush I'm getting pulled in these two directions and\nUh you know here's Donald Trump or you know polling pulling pulling towards the greedy and his minions and it just it is incredibly frustrating for people like me in the middle of that uh\nYou know can't find a way so I'm just wondering if you could comment on that\nSteven thanks for your call ... go ahead\nWell I feel Stevens ... [laughter] I mean I feel exactly the same way I I'm politically homeless I I Can't be part of this Trump provide Republican Party but I don't feel comfortable being part of the Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren party either and so on you know I'm\nI'm stranded in the middle I think you know look I think Democrats have an opportunity here because I think there are a lot of disaffected voters who could not be part of what Donald Trump is selling but they don't know about the Democrats either because a lot of Democrats seem pretty extreme for them like I I'm In that category if Democrats and I think\nGo to the center there can be a historic realignment of American politics of the kind that you saw in the Nineteen thirties I Would make the Democrats the majority party for fifty years to come I think the way they do that he was by nominating somebody who was pretty centrist in twenty twenty and not going to to the progressive extreme\nWell the all the forces that we've seen in terms of the primary process in terms of campaign finance the things that are the league or the Republican Party some of the things that legally Republican Party also believe that the Democrats as well I mean do you do you think they are in the in the twenty twenty cycle that the Democrats might actually\nNominate a centrist versus someone who's on the more progressive wing\nWell I think anything is possible I mean who would've imagined that the Republicans would nominate Donald Trump for twenty sixteen so we don't know who the Republican not who the Democratic nominee is going to be twenty twenty but there is no question that almost all of the major contenders that people that are being talked about his nominees potential nominees\nAre certainly from the progressive wing of the party ... and that concerns me as somebody who's who's more of a of a centrist center ripe a person\nYeah let's go to Joe who's calling from St Petersburg Florida Joe you're on the air\nAll right thank you um I guess my my question has to do with the fact that a Christian I talked to a lot of my friends on it will be the starting to call it takes most of my Christian friends are consider themselves conservative Christians are and they don't even have to say that the Republican\nUh whereas um most of my other friends who might be other nominations are some type of liberal Democrat I when I find that people that aren't religious\nAre Republican but they are gay or minority whatnot it usually has to do with the money that they and wanting to be able to preserve their money or their future so the question is it as a liberal Democrat Chris\nI thought is that for the good of the world where it's supposed to take care of each other and all part of our government is to make sure that everybody get by and everybody has the ability to either on my question what was the original point of having a conservative wing of the party\nWhen you join and get it a lot of the religious right in any way sway your decision to at the end of the\nJokes yeah just thanks for your call go ahead max\nWell the religious right has always been a big part of the Republican Party going back\nTo the Nineteen sixties and it's dismaying to me to see what happened with ... with with that one of the party that you have until it goes I mean I agree with a lot of them in in the late Nineteen nineties when they were castigated Bill Clinton for misconduct for embarrassing the country for lowering our our moral tone I I thought that was correct\nBut now these very same people these arch Moore listens colds\nWho are criticizing Bill Clinton have nothing to say about Donald Trump's transgressions then you know this is a president who was violated federal law in order to pay off a playboy playmate on a porn star that he had allegedly had affairs with us as a\nPresident who has been credibly accused of massive tax fraud this was a president who lies eight times a day you know I'm reminded of of of a bill Bennett block from Nineteen Ninety eight or Nineteen Ninety nine called\nThe death of outrage where he was lamenting the fact that more people were not outraged about Bill Clinton's misbehavior well the death of outrage is actually pretty good description of the of the of the Christian right or today including people like Bill Bennett where they have nothing to say\nAbout the shocking immorality was the president that they support\n[noise] next to return to something that we talked about a little bit earlier for a second that we should spend more time on and that's just a question with this issue of race\nOh that is shaped direction the Republican Party is going in because I'm\nI I'm thinking of um\nYou know the number of times you pointed out several uh where the president has said things even before he was elected and after that many people looked upon and said that that was racist but\nDid you pay for a moment around him you know thinking of house Speaker Paul Ryan ... going so far as to release a statement saying yes that was a textbook racist remarks but ... but nevertheless I'm going to still support\nThe part of the United states because he's ... he's helping deliver on tax cuts which are important to a lot of people and conservative judges which are also important to a lot of people so far as long as that you know your this is your term ... bargain exists what hope do you have\nA for change if the if the change has to come within the party structure as well\nI have little hope for the Republican Party unless they suffer repeated and devastating defeats they have to know there'll be a political price to pay for trafficking and bigotry and prejudice for political game there is nothing\nI've seen in American political life in my lifetime that does more despicable the nose and they know what they're doing and they don't care they are\nThey are claiming that they can support Donald Trump because he's for tax cuts and then they ignore everything else including all of his races baggage when he refers to Latino immigrants as snakes and animals who breathing in fast\nHe calls African countries [noise]\nYou know he says neo Nazis or find people he locks up children of undocumented immigrants this is a disgrace and the Republican Party is displacing itself by\nGoing along with those well\nLet's go to another call here Ira is calling from Myrtle Beach South Carolina Ira you're on the air\nThat food food I Would like to take my hat off to you\nI Am in total application of the courage yet your show and the intelligence analysis you will absolutely correct about the current situation it can be no doubt and I won't be integrity would face down from the late ... what he is a true get\nTotal dictator and another Hitler however I'd like to go you know need just to be honored spare we our great nation we ran through the ... the fact\nOf the civil war and we find it still took a hundred and sixty is to fully do it we pretty much on it now but the one who will never recover\nAs a democracy we will recover but evangelists people who supported Trump eighty one percent and now when Ninety One percent they shall never recover their there can be a religious or moral\nIra let me just jump in here for a second before I let you go I I hear what you're saying and I hear your passion a lot and I'm going to have Max Boot respond to it ah in just a moment\nBut when you when\nYou said that you see the president as another Hitler\nIsn't the very fact that that is the the tenor of political conversation in America right now isn't that part of the problem because what you yourself said with all due respect to Iran is also incredibly extreme in and it it makes it hard to have any kind of a a you know civil coming together in this country\nNo future generation realize that he was in fact that no eight of it there's no there's not yes John ... and not in any way exaggeration not at all\nI mean I don't I don't want I don't want

NPR\nDot org I Do want to turn to uh to the climate report done by the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental planted a panel on climate change as commissioned by the United nations\nUh which had very stark\nAh conclusions about uh the world's climate where it was headed and what kinds of actions were needed to even just mitigate damage\nDuring an interview with on point on Tuesday ... at Duke University climate scientist and one of the co authors of the report explain that past climate change models had been if anything much too conservative and that we're seeing the results of not changing our habits quickly enough\nWe'd seen hurricanes hold more water we've seen coastal areas get flooded we've seen the occurrence of heat extremes go up so we're not just relying on these models we're actually seeing that the models or have if anything been kind of too conservative and we are now reaching areas of\nDangerous and damaging impacts more quickly than we realize we went back in the eighties\n[noise] total ... how is the government responding to this ... this this report\nAh without much action actually if you're looking specifically at the White House which drives that much for the policy and the federal government\nThere's not a lot of actions being taken to a combat this fast moving problem of of climate change or we've seen the president you know try to talk about how climate change a hoax he said that in the past and\nHis administration has rolled back a lot of the regulations that were put in place by the previous administration to try to get ahead of this issue we did see the president pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year a saying that it was not fair to the United states in agreement that basically all of the countries in the world agreed to in order to try to slow\nThe uh the impact in the onset of of climate change\nUh this is the president that really wants to focus more on um you know reducing regulations are investing in a traditional forms of energy and ah as he says putting coal miners back to work\nAnd he hasn't spent as much time focusing on these very dire warnings that we're getting from scientists about what will happen if action isn't isn't taken to a to slow the impact of climate change on on the planet\n[noise] uh I'd like to take a call now from west Brookfield, Massachusetts I Believe it's Bob Bob you're on the\nAir I thanks for taking my call you sir I think that I think the biggest driver of climate change is not all people in their everyday lives to turn away from it\nThere's no bigger issue in this report anything it tells me that people who claimed to say that they will do anything to protect their family\nAre not telling the truth unless they get engaged and are willing to start seeing those changes in pushing and force in those changes from the bottom up because it ain't gonna happen from the top down\nThanks so much for that call a bomb or a Lexus I'm asked to ... uh action has been taken a a ... at the White House what kind of just reaction has there been from a from leaders on health particularly Republican leaders\nWell I you know one element of the un report was born out immediately in the reaction as as you're questioning and he at the held a news organization I work with our environmental reporter went to the hell went around on Wednesday was trying to talk to lawmakers who are on the right committee or would normally be interested\nAnd came away writing a story that he couldn't find anybody who would read it now why would that be that's because we're just a couple of weeks before mid term elections and ah the un report said that there were very limited options because time is now very very short to try to have some\nFunctional impact on this trend but that the political will is not there and that was the reaction that we are\nDiscovered right away and as Tony said the president has said you know oh there's lots of reports as if this report is just among hundreds that he is willing to reject or ignore and so whether it was the White House or Capitol Hill it was just a big you know cricket\nMakes it sound like sort of yet another parking ticket whereas of\nThe issues at stake are quite dire need this is an issue obviously we hear it on point will continue to coverage I Do want to move on to the swearing in of a new justice on the Supreme Court one of nine a Brett Kavanaugh appeared at the White House there was sort of it I'm a ceremonial swearing and that is he'd already been formally sworn in but he appeared at the White House\nUh and at that time the newly minted justice Brett Kavanaugh assured Americans would be an independent an impartial justice devoted to equal justice under law and part of\nThe Supreme Court's team of nine\nI was not appointed to serve one party or one interest but to serve one nation\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person every belief in every backgrounds every lit again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and open minds\nJack Beatty you've heard the new justice or can you uh feel assured that he'll listen to the Libyans arguments with respect or an open mind\nWell he had to say that didn't he based on his a little ... in front of the Senate timidity attacking the Democrats as part of the big conspiracy and we heard everything except bin ... come out of his mouth he was so deeply into Republican paranoia [noise]\nUh so yeah he had to reassure us on that score but will you know there's no check on him who lifetime appointment he can say what he will if I might let me just quickly return to that climate change report because\nYou know it's clear enough the challenge this poses to the GOP or some people call it the ground oil party which has deep into purchased denialism but what about the Democrats\nJames Hansen the climate scientist in a recent paper\nSaid either we will go to negative admissions now basically or we will have to invest\nEighty nine trillion to five hundred trillion dollars over the next century\nJust pull the carbon it's in the atmosphere out partly through developing as yet unheard of technologies where does that say to the Democrats when they went to Bernie Sanders when he says free college for everybody when he says we need the universal healthcare\nWhen they talk about guaranteed jobs where is this money going to come from their costs at a party the cause of keeping true to their rhetoric\nYes yes and and and yet they want to pose as the part while we're in we're concerned about uh the climate if they're concerned about the climate their agenda has to change to reflect this civil civilization all crisis\nElects assimilating or is there any sense going back to the new justice or that are thinking about the elections that uh that that the Republicans will pay a price for a for a cabin are what they did it now look as though there'll be a little bit just by the the enthusiasm of conservatives returning to the fold\nWhile listening to Republican leaders in Washington as well as some pollsters who are watching these races very carefully they're suggesting I'm taking a Mitch McConnell has been doing some victory lap sort of interviews recently a bunch of them\nAnd they're pointing to the polls in which there a Senate candidates are are pulling a hat or doing better than they thought they might in a state that they would normally be thought of to be winning and a Mitch McConnell the majority leader in the Senate is eager to say that that little ...\nKavanaugh in fact as you know in the NPR interview he said it it happened just at the right time he thought the timing was just perfect even though he said it wasn't planned that way to be so contentious right before the election\nAnd ... and a Democrat said not disputed that they're they believe that Democrats are very motivated and might themselves be very motivated about what they saw particularly women\nGoing over the line and of course Democrats are furious because they argue that the president himself as very incendiary and his rhetoric and\nAre often insights a mob reaction himself but I Would also point out that the Republican efforts to drop sharp contrast started the for Brett Kavanaugh and you can see when Alexander or Ocasio Cortez won her race at in New York and defeated\nA Joe Crowley long term incumbent and it is running as a socialist that there were a lot of eyebrows raised and hands or being robbed together in the Republican Party about wow we can really use this because the effort there is to say that the entire Democratic Party is being\nPulled to the left to the left to the left and you know you can see that there are a variety of candidates are interested in perhaps running for president or in these house races that fit into a mall that the president and Republicans are using to showcase a kind of activism that they want to paint as going too far\nIt's interesting 'cause there's this tension and it's almost as though they're seen as in parallel but it sounds kind of different to me about tension about whether it be pulled the left\nA among Democrats and you've seen that play on some congressional primaries and races\nAnd also tension about how strongly teach you fight for a you know political success or earlier this week a former attorney general Eric Holder of course served in the Obama administration spoken a campaign event for Georgia democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Adams\nA reference Michelle Obama's often repeated comment when they go low we go high\nEric Holder said no when they go low we kick them that's what this new Democratic Party is about he followed up a few minutes later\nWhen I say you know we see them I don't mean anything inappropriate you don't do anything illegal but without any tough and we got to fight for the very things that John Lewis Martin Luther king when the young you know all those folks gave to us that can be taken away\nThat's the thing to do they want to maintain a house\nThat was a former attorney general Eric Holder speaking at a campaign stop for Stacey Abrams in Georgia\nA lot of Republicans and conservatives took great offense to ... uh they said you know this is a wildly inappropriate he for the clarified his remarks on Twitter saying OK stop the fake outrage I'm just saying Democrats need to be tough proud and stand up for the values we believe in the end but the president took this is a bit of a rallying cry\nYeah the president did the RMC did the the the ... the leaders of the Republican campaigns for twenty Eighteen are all sort of seizing on this comment and other comments that are somewhat similar by Democrats trying to paint this broader picture that you\nKnow Democrats are party that condones and the un incite violence uh and it it is it's a talking point that they're really driving home on in these final weeks of the election because as electric said these both both parties see this as a base election where they're trying to motivate their base\nThere has been evidence that Democrats are incredibly motivated in part by their animus towards the president to turn out in in high numbers and Republicans are trying to match that\nIn part by saying you know these Democrats or socialists they are violent they're part of antifa and you know as the president said they're going to allow crime to come into the country if they take over so it's part of a political strategy will have to wait and see for the next three or four weeks if it works if it does\nSucceed in driving turnout um we did hear from Michelle Obama who sort of push back and said you know the politics of fear is not the politics it's going to win over the long term but there is this debate in the Democratic party about\nHow hard to push and they've seen some of the success that President Trump is hat and and that Republicans have had with hard line tack tactics like holding opening the Supreme Court seat for a year they're saying we want some of that on our side we want people to really go to the mat\nFor our policies and there's a debate between that and and the idea that we need more civility in our politics we're going to beat them by going high when they go low and that internal debate is still playing out and it's been happening in different ways in different parts of the country seem more moderate Democrats win and some places we've seen\nDemocratic socialism progressive went in other places and uh what's gonna happen in November is going to have a big impact on in determining how the Democrats move forward in twenty twenty and what kind of party they want to be for the next parts of the presidential race\nI'd like to take a call now from Detroit Michigan Steve we've got ya uh what's on your mind\nHi I Am calling that with the question what a counter general observation and that is I've heard a\nTwo different NPR talk shows this warning this batting back and forth about a Democrats or historical because we said that Trump was administrator fascists like and also a terrier\nB.

Y. U.\nUh you know the Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia Stacey Abrams has spent her her years as late as an activist registering residents to vote proponent rank campus Georgia's secretary of state and I think there's a really unusual consequence of careers focused on the issue of voting right at the ballot box right\nStacey Adams appear aprons excuse me appeared on MSNBC yesterday discuss the tens of thousands of registration applications currently on hold it in the state of Georgia she's accused her home and Brian Kemp of repressing citizens right to vote\nThat challenge is this process called exact match and we've been fighting hand on this sense twenty fourteen what happens is if you have a hyphen in your last name if you have a difficult spelling anyone misspelled or lose leaves out anything they can use that as a pet basically has a reason\nTo not process your registration and that means and about fifty three thousand Georgians currently have their registration intending status\nTechnically they can cast provisional ballots the provisional ballots are often not processed and so we're deeply worried that sixty three thousand people Seventy percent of them are African American will be disenfranchised in this election\n[noise] uh Dale hotel me uh what would Brian Kemp say if he were here and how do you assess that argument it's pretty difficult for me to challenge now I'd like to hear it\nHandles someone like I'm Brian Kemp but I guess when he would say is we need to make sure that the people who are registering are actually the people who they claimed to be and therefore we need to impose strict standards on whether or not we process an application but I think what's really critical here is that\nA minor typo like a missing hyphen or the transportation of two letters when a someone's entering a voter registration form into a database that shouldn't be a basis for disenfranchising people\nAnd one thing to underscore I think there's um the fact that people who are on this list I don't want there to be any confusion all of those people can still vote in November they might not show up on regular voter registration rolls but they all still have the right to show up at the polls and cast a provisional ballot that's not\nA perfect solution because provisional ballots are counted under different rules um been regular ballots but no one should be deterred from voting because they're scared that they might have been purged\nA I'd like to take a call now from awake cross Georgia a John go ahead you're on the air\nYes I was calling about the uh the um now when you file your tax returns in most states you have to put in your driver's license information in to get your tax return process\nIncluding earned income credit and other credits that the people that you're saying are being disenfranchised um have that because they want to get those refunds so so I don't see how people are being disenfranchised by using and not be when you\nThank you so much John we'd also like to take a call from Appleton, Wisconsin I Believe it's Mark Mark you're on the air\nAccurate taking my call just turned\n... what bothers me is and it's rarely discussed is the fact that every one of these voter ID laws is always tied\nTo serious restrictions to access to the polls either reducing the polling places pulling time um when the clerks offices are open to file absentee ballots which was the case here in Wisconsin so there's it's not just about ... if you're somebody that undermines his argument it's about voter fraud\nIt's about reducing people's rights to vote\nOkay well thank you so much for that mark joining me now from Tuscaloosa, Alabama someone who may help address some of these questions are from a different perspective I John Merrill is the secretary of state for the state of Alabama since taking office in twenty Fifteen more than one million new voters\nHad been registered in that state the Alabama process requires voters as I understand it to show a photo ID when voting John Merrill welcome Don point\nDavid great to be with you thanks for having me as your guest\nYou search for somebody just from the ... what's your approach to uh to to having voters on the rolls\nDavid we each and every eligible US citizen this resident of Alabama to be registered to vote and have a photo ID and we have gone to\nExtra links to make sure that people are accommodating whenever that occurs and we visited our six seven counties at least one time every year with our mobile units\nAs well as having a bowl of registrars office opened each and every day to court houses open in all six to seven county\nAnd we visit festivals events and activities in our counties throughout the state at different times to make sure that we're giving people ample opportunity to register and to obtain IDs if they don't have one now our also tell you that in the rare instances where people say\nHey I Can't get to the board registrars office because my work schedule or I Can't get to one of the mobile unit location because it's not convenient or I don't go to the events are festivals in those rare occasions where that has happened David we're going to people's homes and we have given\nAnd we're very excited about what we've achieved during the last three years and then much and twenty three days that I've had the privilege to be Alabama secretary of state\nWe've read one million Ninety five thousand eight hundred and sixty one new voters and we now have three million four hundred and thirty four thousand eight hundred and sixty three registered voters in Alabama those numbers are unprecedented and unparalleled in the history of the state\nWhat's the need for the for the voter id\nWell the reason that I voted for David Was because I Want to make it easier to vote and hard to ... if you needed that day when you open a bank account if you're needing that day when you go to the movie if you need an ad they when you buy six pack of beer\nOr if you buy a pack of cigarettes then you ought to be able to present and not be when you exercise the most precious rat that we have a mess to participate in our Democrat Republican is a vote\nI Want to take a briefly a general I Want to take a call from a nearby states from Louisiana New Orleans I've Sharon on the line ... ... a share your thoughts on this\nHi thank you for taking my call this man in Louisiana you've had to show and I have an id with your voter registration\nUm for all the years we've been here which is over twenty however the the ID now it's changed you have to have a real id to vote and the ... it requires you to show a birth certificate Social Security card and to um\n... and uh to document\nUm but they don't tell you you need that you don't find out about the real ID until you go and get your driver's license renewed so if you're not in the schedule to get your driver's license renewed but for\nThe next time your vote then you realize you need a ... and\nAh you want to know so I think Sharon next\nElectioneering thank you so much for that it pre sheet that John Merrill your secular state in Alabama I realize some of the specifics interest 'cause he's maybe a little different than Louisiana nonetheless ... David and his you serve it\nTo remember that they vary from state to state I mean we have ten different elements that can be a change to use when you go to vote including your driver's license or a non driver or the or the free Alabama voter id that we give\nAny other valid state issue that the federal I'd be a student ID A passport a military ID A travel Addy or we just want to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat period that's it and we ...

Wendy wiser you actually had some questions for secretary of State John Merrill he'd sicker state of of Alabama's been good enough to join us this hour as well so\nI I Want it to build up with the last caller talked about the the difficulty of at least many Americans to register to vote and um the secretary marrow was very rights to point out that what we need to do is ensure that each and every eligible citizen in the country has registered to vote I'm I'm\nGlad to hear that um he he thinks that Alabama has very high voter registration rates and I know that there have been disputes about those numbers but we can all agree that it should be a goal to get every I'm eligible voter on the voter rolls\nAnd with that there's been a real advances across the country and and how to do that better how to sort of ... a modernized the system so it's not just relying on ads in papers and visits to libraries and driver's license offices but we're seeing in many states we're moving towards a more automatic voter registration\nSystem I'm Thirteen states and D.C have already adopted that in the last three years alone and there's been really bipartisan support in momentum and it really works to expand voter registration and to do so in a much more accurate and seamless way and I wanted to hear a little bit from secretary Merrill\nAbout um whether he is I'm interested in taking steps to advance that in the state of\nAlabama like in some of his neighboring states like Georgia\nWill know windy and I think you know without me but I Will see any way that we have led the nation in the last three years now much and twenty three days\nIn voter registration per capita nobody in more than we've done nobody did better than we we don't just went in football\nWhen I get up and get it but it needs to know I also think it's important to note when it comes to automatic voter registration what you're what you're talking about there's a different definition for what automatic voter registration means to certain people\nNow one of the questions that are raised whenever somebody in your concept to me is it\nDo you believe that if you have automatic registration in your state but there should be an opt out provision\nIn opt out provision would mean that if somebody says no I don't want to be registered and they should be given the opportunity to keep from being registered when they engage in that activity would be getting a driver's license getting social services or whatever happens to be\nYou know if they agree that there should be an opt out provision than what I mean we tell them is that what we have the day you just have to opt in which is why we've had Ninety three percent of the people in Alabama that are now registered to vote and I'm very excited about this\nDeal oh sure I think anyone who's\nEver been in a system where you have to opt in versus a system where you have to opt out knows that those two kinds of systems are quite different and that the yield very very different levels\nOf participation in the abstract you might think that those things aren't very different but the empirical data shows otherwise most states have some kind of options system through the DMV right now\nOther states have an opt out system Oregon was the first state to adopt that in Oregon saw its registration rates sky rocket so I think I'm Glad that the secretary says that he's committed to trying to make sure that every\nI'm a registered to vote and the easiest way to do that used to create an opt out says to weed getting a colors are suggesting their own thoughts on this let's first go to Abington Virginia Perry uh what would you suggest to make things a little more rational from your standpoint\nDavid thanks you take one call mhm windy day of tickets or you know what you said ugly um what would you go ... and creating a\nHoliday whether it be a state holiday even to propose that perhaps the national level to um have an official day off for voting\nWhether or not they'd be in conjunction with a friday and Saturday to have a weekend day so that it changed the more people would have the opportunity to actually votes\nOh I'll take the responsibility here think thanks very secretary\nBarry I think it's important to know that it's\nBeen my observation in my experience people vote when it's important to and if you say well\nIf we had voting on Saturday or if we had voting on a day that were specified as a holiday that it would potentially increase the turnout\nWell we've broken every record the history of the state and the last three major elections we've had the empirical data and they'll say it speaks for itself which is that people come when they want a vote\nWe took it took three ... let me just play devil's advocate for a moment obviously the sniffing at turnout is actually Yes sir I'm Sorry sir state Folkenflik\nOr ... you know there's obviously really interest when Roy Moore and Doug Jones we're going off in that in that a special Alabama raise rates\nOf violence and people really turned out but what would make you think that people are ... wouldn't it turned out more if they didn't have the day off from work I mean there are a lot of folks for whom that uh that takes place there\nBecause this is what I Know I Know that when we had the presidential election November the eight two thousand six thing to point one million Alabamians go oh Seventy two percent of the people that were registered voter\nSound like a guy you sound like a guide me who's very much in quest of a hundred percent participation of people who can do it right where a lot like something like that to your desire\nTo that that's what I said earlier we won't each and every eligible US citizen as a resident of Alabama to be registered to vote and to be able to participate and have a voter ID card and to be able to participate at the level they want to participate\nBut I don't know why some people vote and some people don't if I knew that I'd write a book and I wouldn't be sectors date anymore I'd be a multimillionaire\nAnd I promise you that when you write that book while working on on point we'll have you on the second hour and friday will enjoy yourself very much I'd like a ... to to to weigh in here\nI just want to take secretary Merrill's observation about when people want to vote 'em they they vote and just\nTake that to be a a would logically implies right if we think the only reason that people don't vote is because they're not interested in voting than what we're saying is that in the United states where we have turned out that's not even at the top thirty amongst democracies around the world\nMajor funding from point it's provided by Geico offering auto insurance coverage for cars

that NPR\nDot org I Do want to turn to uh to the climate report done by the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental planted a panel on climate change as commissioned by the United nations\nUh which had very stark\nAh conclusions about uh the world's climate where it was headed and what kinds of actions were needed to even just mitigate damage\nDuring an interview with on point on Tuesday drew ... at Duke University climate scientist and one of the co authors of the report explained the past climate change models have been if anything much too conservative and that we're seeing the results of not changing our habits quickly enough we've\nSeen hurricanes hold more water we've seen coastal areas get flooded we've seen the occurrence of heat exchange go up so we're not just relying on these models we're actually seeing that the models or if you have if anything been kind of too conservative and we are now reaching areas of\nDangerous and damaging impacts more quickly than we realize we would back in the eighties\n[noise] total ... uh how is the government responding to this ... this this report\nI without much action actually if you're looking specifically at the White House which drives them much for the policy and the federal government\nThere's not a lot of actions being taken to a combat this fast moving problem of of climate change or we've seen the president you know try to talk about how climate change a hoax he said that in the past and\nUh his initiation has rolled back a lot of the regulations that were put in place by the previous administration to try to get ahead of this issue we did see the president pull out of the Paris climate agreement last year a saying that it was not fair to the United states with an agreement that basically all of the countries in the world a agreed to in order to try to slow\nThe uh the impact and the onset of of climate change uh this is the president that really wants to focus more on um you know reducing regulations are investing in a traditional forms of energy and ah as you said putting coal miners back to work\nAnd he hasn't spent as much time focusing on these very dire warnings that we're getting from scientists about what will happen if action isn't isn't taken to a to slow the impact of climate change on on the planet\n[noise] uh I'd like to take a call now from west Brookfield, Massachusetts I Believe it's Bob Bob you're on the air\nI thanks for taking my call Yes sir I think the I think the biggest driver of climate change is not held by people in their everyday lives to turn away from it\nThere's no bigger issue and if this report anything\nIt tells me that people who claimed to\nSay that they will do anything to protect their families protect their children they really are not telling the truth unless they get engaged and are willing to start seeing those changes and pushing and force in those changes from the bottom up because it ain't going to happen from the top down\nThanks so much for that call a Bob uh Alexis I'm asked to what a action has been taken a it at the White House what kind of just reaction has there been from a from leaders on health particularly Republican leaders\nWell I you know one element of the un report was born out immediately in the reaction as as you're questioning and he at the held a news organization I work with our environmental reporter went to the hell went around on Wednesday was trying to talk to lawmakers who are on the right committee or would normally be interested\nAnd came away writing a story that he couldn't find anybody who would read it now why would that be that's because we're just a couple of weeks before mid term elections and ah the un report said that there were very limited options because time is now very very short to try to have some\nFunctional impact on this trend\nBut that the political will is not there and that was the reaction that we are discovered right away and as Tony said the president has said you know oh there's lots of reports as if\nThis report is just among hundreds that he is willing to reject or ignore and so whether it was the White House or Capitol Hill it was just a big you know cricket\nMakes it sound like sort of yet another parking ticket whereas of\nThe issues at stake are quite dire indeed this is an issue obviously we hear it on point will continue to coverage I Do want to move on to the swearing in of the new justice on the Supreme Court one of nine\nA Brett Kavanaugh appeared at the White House there was sort of it I'm a ceremonial swearing in that his he'd already been formally sworn in but he appeared at the White House uh and at that time the news\nWould be an independent an impartial justice devoted to equal justice under law and part of the Supreme Court's team of nine\nI was not appointed to serve one party or one interest but\nTo serve one nation America's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief in every backgrounds every lead again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and open minds\nJack Beatty you've heard the new justice or can you are a few short that he'll listen to the Libyans arguments with respect and open mind well\nHe had to say that didn't he based on who is a\nLittle ... in front of the Senate committee attacking the Democrats as part of the big conspiracy and we heard everything except bin ... come out of his mouth he was so deeply into Republican paranoia [noise]\nAh so yeah he had to reassure us on that score but will you know there's no check on him he lifetime appointment he can say what he will if I might let me just quickly return to that climate change report because\nYou know it's clear enough to challenge this poses to the GOP or some people call it the grand oil party which has deep into purchased denialism ... what about the Democrats James Hansen the climate scientist and a recent paper so here we will go to negative admissions now basically or\nWe will have to invest eighty nine trillion to five hundred trillion dollars over the next century just pulled the carbon it's in the atmosphere out partly through developing as yet unheard of technologies\nWhere does that say to the Democrats when they went to Bernie Sanders when he says free college for everybody when he says we need the universal health care\nWhen they talk about guaranteed jobs where is this money going to come from your costs at a party that caused by keeping true to their rhetoric\nYes yes and and and yet they want to pose as the part while we're in we're concerned about uh the climate if they're concerned about the climate their agenda has to change to reflect this civil civilization or crisis\nElected some ending or is there any sense going back to the the new justice or that are thinking about the elections that uh that that the Republicans will pay a price for a for a cabin are what they does it now look as though there'll be a little bit just by the the enthusiasm of conservatives returning to the fold\nWhile listening to Republican leaders in Washington as well as some pollsters who are watching these races very carefully they're suggesting I'm thinking of Mitch McConnell has been doing some victory lap sort of the interviews recently a bunch of them\nAnd they're pointing to the polls in which there a Senate candidates are are pulling a hat or doing better than they thought they might in\nA state that they would normally be thought out to be winning and a Mitch McConnell the majority leader in the Senate is ear to say that that little bumpy thinks it's coming from what happened with cabin on fact\nAs you know in the NPR interview he said it it happened just at the right time he thought the timing was just perfect even though he said it wasn't planned that way to be so contentious right before the election\nI'm at and a Democrat not disputed that they're they believe that Democrats are very motivated and might

three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at one point radio uh one of our callers are called to admonished us for spending time on Kanye West visits the White House at all but I think it's part of a piece of understanding where\nAre the president is coming from what's on his mental landscape what does he sharing with us\nHe also had some a sharp words at a rally a in Council Bluffs Iowa on Tuesday the president had harsh words for those who oppose him\nHand match during our son is and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats\nWhat does this rhetoric coming from [noise]\nWell yeah and you know let's just get a job for the test was called the Democrats evil the party of crime they want to destroy our country liberals are quote very very bad people\nYou know in the ah October nineteenth two thousand sixteen debate the president was ... then candidate Trump was asked you abide by the results of the election\nAnd he said I Will look at it at the time I Will keep you in suspense it could be rigged\nNow we have to be in suspense about two thousand and twenty is it likely that the president will turn over power should the Democrats win to a party that is what destroying our country very very evil\nYou know you you we've reached the point where this sort of ultimate alarm is almost common sense about Trump is ed lose\nMy head was writing in the Financial Times it's no leap to imagine Trump refusing to accept election defeat that that's a along step\nFrom where we are but certainly the rhetoric is charged he's talking about mob rule elect to some degree or you've been hearing that from a congressional figure some of them on Capitol Hill as well what are you hearing that's driving that rhetoric what did they point to and and ... you know what is it really grounded on\nWell first of all when we first started to hear this discussion about an angry mob it was a talking point it was very clear because Republicans including the president were all speaking with the same voice so it had been focus grouped it was a talking point and pollsters where suggesting that Republicans would profit by doing this\nAnd part of this is because an election season no matter what party here and you're trying to draw very sharp contrast and mobilize your own base to turn out and we know that Republicans\nHad been very concerned that their base is not as mobilized her as excited about turning out in the mid term election\nAnd Democrats may be so\nLike I don't look yeah let me just stop you there to help underscore your point er during on points a trip to Pennsylvania last weekend uh we ... valley resident Dorothy new clothes told our co host magnet chocolate party that people are getting tired of constant protest from Democrats\nThe Democratic party so far to the left\nI don't know if you will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots versus the socialists and the ... and ... until he could sit down and discuss things and not have one faction running around was the only thing that's on their heads\nAnd science and everything that goes I mean they're just they're everywhere\nAnd that's from one point said field reporting from Pennsylvania a in that case about how congressional redistricting the redistricting is affecting states\nHotly contested midterm races you can find more about that on our website on point radio dot org but electric to allow you to continue a little bit you know if there's something more than what they're saying about sort of mobs than simply that people were protesting I mean you know freedom of assembly as a constitutional right that's hardly seems like ... to me\nWell it is but it sparked a debate about what is our our ... in our in our body politic what is free speech and what is going over the line at of course Democrats are furious because they argue that the president himself is very incendiary and his rhetoric and\nAre often insights a mob reaction himself but I Would also point out that the Republican efforts to drop sharp contrast started before Brett Kavanaugh and you can see when Alexandra or Ocasio Cortez won her race at in New York and defeated\nA Joe Crowley long term incumbent and it is running as a socialist that there were lots of eyebrows raised a and hands or being rub together in the Republican Party about while we can really use this because\nThe effort there is to say that the entire Democratic Party is being pulled to the left to the left to the left\nAnd you know you can see that there are a variety of candidates are interested in perhaps running for president or in these house races that fit into a mall that the president and Republicans are using to showcase a kind of activism that they want to paint as going too far\nIt's interesting 'cause there's a tension and it's almost as though they're seen as in parliament sense of kind of different to me about tension about whether to be pulled the left\nA among Democrats and you've seen that play on some congressional primaries and races and also tension about how strongly to fight for a you know political success or earlier this week a former attorney general Eric Holder of course served in the Obama administration\nSpoken a campaign event for Georgia democratic gubernatorial candidates these the Adams\nA reference Michelle Obama's often repeated comment when they go low we go high\nEric Holder said no when they go low we kick them that's what this new Democratic Party is about he followed up a few minutes later they\nYou know we don't do anything if you don't do anything illegal but we're going to be tough and we don't fight for the very\n... when the young you know almost all seem to be taken away\nThat's the thing to do they want to maintain now\nThat was a former attorney general Eric Holder speaking at a campaign stop for Stacey Abrams say in Georgia\nA a lot of Republicans and conservatives to great offense to lose he uh they said you know this is a wildly inappropriate he for the clarified his remarks on Twitter saying OK stop the fake outrage I'm just saying Democrats need to be tough proud and stand up for the values we believe in the end but the president I took this is a bit of a rallying cry\nYeah the president did the RMC did the the the ... the leaders of the Republican campaigns for twenty Eighteen\nAre all sort of seizing on this comment and other comments that are somewhat similar by Democrats trying to paint this broader picture that you know Democrats are party that condones and the un incite violence uh and it just it's a talking point that they're really driving home on in the final weeks of the election because as electric said\nThese both both parties see this as a base election where they're trying to motivate their base\nThere has been evidence that Democrats are incredibly motivated in part by their animus towards the president to turn out in in high numbers and Republicans are trying to match that\nIn part by saying you know these Democrats are socialist they are violent they're part of antifa and you know as

going to have a big impact on in determining how the Democrats move forward in twenty twenty and what kind of party they want to be for the next parts of the presidential race\nI'd like to take a call now from Detroit Michigan steeply gotcha what's on your mind\nHi I Am calling that with the ... general observation and that is I've heard a\nLot to different NPR talk shows this war\nIs batting back and forth about a Democrats historical because we said that Trump was administrator fascists like and also a terrier I however", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury",
