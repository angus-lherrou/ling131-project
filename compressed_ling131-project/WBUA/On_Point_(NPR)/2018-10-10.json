undertaking I mean a okay up with something that I've been thinking about since two thousand nine and then I finally did in a last year so that's eight years of sort of dreaming about you know this big potential crime but it just took a long time to get there\nOkay so so tell me why though I mean for people who don't know A L cap or sort of what it means to climbers what what is it about this

little climb seventies el ... and that's him going through a step by step all the moves he would make in order to conquer\nThe one of the world's most famous a rock climbing walls and he did it with no ropes that effort is captured in the documentary free so low which was directed by Elizabeth ... and Jimmy Chin and Alex ...\nIs with us this hour to talk about how he free so loaded el cap\nA Alex tell us a little bit more about about this particular thing that you do the notes that you've taken how you mentally prepare for the climbed do you really memorize almost every move that you're going to make\nWell I mean you can hear in those notes that that is not every single move 'em I mean I have to memorize every single move for the hardest actions like what we were just talking about what the Boulder problem I knew every single hand and foot placement of exactly how I moved my body but\nThen you know from my no for pitch one was very rough just like step left or to keep place you know the rest of the pitch I could just count on myself to climate appropriately without having to memorize everything movement but then I also climbed the whole the whole face so many times that I kind of just remembered most of it\nOr you know but I didn't have to specifically memorize every single move right is a lot of them\nOkay so this is part of what did the documentary really sort of underscores that you have this thing that you call them in a sense of ... when you first of all you you were very deeply prepared but you also have this thing that you called mental are or what is\nThat why I actually um I actually don't call mental earners in the film Tommy says that a few times and he's actually sort of quoting something I'm like I've had some other climbing films from for many years ago where I talked about mental armor\nBut um but actually a big part of the process for me to be able to free solo cap was to sort of get past that I think that you like the idea of mental farmers to to sort of\nYou know shield yourself from like it's it's something it's too scary you sort of get psyched up and Mike shields your mind from it and then do it despite the fact that it's quite scary and I felt like that wasn't really a sustainable way to climb oh crap I get is just too big of a wall and it's too difficult and I was basically worried that that at some point you know it's sort of\nCome to my senses and things like oh wow this is really scary like what am I doing up here so I kind of felt like I had to prepare to the point where I didn't need any kind of armor where I just felt comfortable walking up to the wall and being like I Need the wall is the wall and I'm and I am capable of climate is you know not having to get all psyched up or anything\nBut how do you get to that point though I mean that there's got to be a lot of focus in work that it takes to get to that point\nWell yeah I mean that's that's that's basically the the film are now two years of training physically and mentally and practicing and and just refining my techniques and eventually you know I mean it took a long time to feel comfortable yeah and and that doesn't even include the six years before that I've been dreaming about it and thinking about it in climbing tons of other routes that were similar but slightly different\nYou know take a step back here for a second because I could talk to you for the whole hour about the technical have preparation and I'm feet of climbing el ... but ... ... is also\nTo be realistic I mean people do die of the world's best free so many of them have died and then that is soon in this documentary ... you're going to hear a climber Tommy Caldwell in this clip a plus news report describing some of the death of the world's best free solar climbers\nI think everybody who is made for ... a big part of their life and death now\nJohn backer was a pioneer of so called free solar climbing Keith down to win this past week at the age of fifty two we're\nSorry to report on the death of us climate showing Larry showing was killed in\nUtah was found a couple of days ago I was flying a new some of the valley his body was found Saturday morning versus climate as usual alone without ...\nMost people that are pushing the limits where they have this mentality of screw it whatever happens happens [noise]\nDown there from the documentary free so low I mean that just all begs the question Alex how did you get into this what is it about climbing was no ropes that has really that really drew you in\nA yeah well\nYou're a good a good question um I mean basically you know I mean to not all free sowing as extreme you know it's not all the face of okay sometimes ... scrambling a beautiful ridge and the mountains you know I mean sometimes it feels more like an extension of hiking and so\nThere is definitely a place for for rope climbing in the mountains of sort of a more efficient and faster way to climb and so when I was younger and I was\nYou're a um I mean you could I was sort of an anti social youngsters of mind the fact that I didn't really know many farmers and how many partners and then combined with just the feeling the freedom to speed the the fish and see I mean there there's a certain joy in bin climbing by herself\nAnd so I just sort of you know got into it do to be clear ... small fraction of of my normal climbing or you know our our crime old style you know [noise] you know every sort of climbing with ropes with partners on expeditions Bruce Bruce types of crime and free zone has always sort of represented this\nThis extra little side\n[laughter] but but you can understand why it's the it's the part of your career that draws the most attention because it just defies most people's a tolerance for risk right I mean\nThe ... yeah it's a totally understand that and I mean it certainly always been a very inspiring part of crime and to me as well you know it's only a small part of what I Do okay you're always been sort of the most significant and a lot of was\nTalked to me about that I mean what is it how is what what is it that you're feeling when you're on those big faces with no roads are I mean is it is it is zone that you just cannot enter or experience in any other way\n... I don't know I mean I'm sure that humans can experience that feeling and many other ways I think that for me it's sort of the easiest way to tap into that feeling of of doing something challenging but doing very well you know the feeling a flow whatever you want to call it but\nBut um you know feeling like you're you're close to tap into your potential or whatever yeah um\nWell here's why I ask because I mean a long time ago when I was in college I did a little climbing to I mean just sport climbing no more than a hundred feet up but you know I'm On in in some beautiful places in the western United States and it was really I mean it was thrilling there's something about [noise]\nYou know every climb that I did that I got a little better and this is like super amateur stuff I'm not saying it's anywhere near a even a million miles of what you do Alex but but even my like low level climbing every every new pitch that I was able to do there was something about um mastering mind in the audience\nViewing of constant improvement yeah constantly challenging yourself a little bit I mean that's exactly what what I enjoy about free zone and you see you know slightly bigger challenges things that are slightly harder than what you've done before it's would you feel like you're constantly learning or growing you know so that you feel like you're always a little bit better what you do\nBut of course was re sowing though the costs of the mistake of absolute\nSo you know you're the you're going to push yourself to what is an inevitable perhaps I Hope not but never to blend\nWell I mean we ... the number one and I mean we're all gonna die\nUm I'm trying my best not to die Carmen ... are very much want to move to old age and her family and all that but um no I mean I I don't think that if I just keep pushing middle for sure dark climbing ... tunnel into\nWell let me just reiterate nobody wants to [laughter] but um let me get some calls in here because we've got a lot of people who have questions for you Alex or we're speaking with Alex ... he is a professional rock climber a best known\nFor free so loving and in fact he did a free so low Yosemite is el Capitan it's a three thousand foot wall in Yosemite one of the most famous rock climbing walls anywhere in the world he did it without ropes and that story is captured in the documentary free so low which is directed by Elizabeth ... and Jimmy ... so\nLet's go to Kay who's calling from the new Ohio okay you're on the air\nHigh make that and you do that several of the questions I was gonna ask Alex about what drives him and that that that edge of a risk and you know that\nThat drive to conquer but I go back and forth from Boulder, Colorado to Ohio and have so for the last forty five years so there's huge rock climbing community there and about four years ago go at the Boulder film festival they showed about four different documentaries\nOn climbing and so I was around that climbing community there and they did show want documentary on Yosemite and Alex it was so fascinating that\nFull service solar system design and installations learn what the sun can do for you at some of the solar dot com\nMy advice to people looking at you or a marketing tool in ... is what the brand stands for frost is worse off balance fought for information\nJon Carson CEO of college fine uh WVU are underwriter\nIn a typical months we'll get a hundred and fifty to two hundred in Korean litter correctly ties to our sponsorship of WB or\nTo reach the WVU our audience through underwriting call sticks one seven three five three eighty four or five one\nIs on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking this hour with Alex huddled he is a rock climbing superstar and he is the first person in the world to free so low that means without robes Yosemite is three thousand foot wall el ... and that feed is documented in the new movie free solo which has directed by Elizabeth Chivers Sally and\nJimmy Chin I'm going to get to some college here in a second but Alex we just heard a professor Jane Joseph there who did that an MRI ...\nOf the unique things that she saw a in her analysis ... wondering now that you know that about um you know the the shape and response of your ... has that changed at all sort of how you see a you're climbing or what you might be capable of doing\nNot particularly um ... I mean in in general I I was a strong sense of I mean and I am who I Am and you know in some ways no matter how much you look look inside\nI mean I'm Still the same person you know I find it all kind of interesting but um I mean we we had a much longer discussion when we first at the scan yeah and um and the take away to me was basically just that you know practice the that over time you can do some of the things and that's that's pretty much been my experience\nThat um that you can learn over time it was ... I heard that she was at one of the pioneers for for free so I Would have been good to see her rather than the other one inch out with her more actually\nOkay well we can put we can definitely get you guys back in touch you know I was really excited to have to because I think a again as she said and you just said there's this you are living proof about the effectiveness of very focused concentration and training and perseverance as well about what can be accomplished but\nThat's that's how I see it but it's interesting because a lot of I feel like people take what they want out of the film you know a lot of people have been seen this and uh and they just said it was like oh well your brain's effective so obviously this is easy for you or you know I mean people sort of take whatever they they hear from it\nI mean I've always heard it as as you know with practice you can prepare for for many things\nUm but you know it's I suppose it's a little bit open ended\nYeah but one of the things that the movie does explores how the people around you deal with the stress of of what you're trying to accomplish so let's get a call uh who wants to a call he wants to talk to you about exactly that's what's going to get his calling from Deerfield New Hampshire guarantee you're on the air\nIt's\nUm you know it's one thing to watch your preparing to go through this rig or on the wall where you are in there for every movement but\nThere's also the aspect of family and loved ones and I was just wondering how do you prepare them and how do you remember we prepare um before going out of one of these big feet wide Cal cap do photo walk on drinking like that ever come into your mind while you're you know and the Mets so nervous\nMulti thousand foot down\nYeah I mean that those and that's probably the biggest challenge in um I'm not sure if you've seen the film yet or not but um but I mean a big part of the film was chronically my relationship with my girlfriend saw it and how we sort of navigate it out because\nIn order words reselling is easier if you're if you're single or relatively unattached\nUm but you know Saudis or sort of argued that uh that I could I could have both you know I could have a a good relationship and still climbing a high level or just needed to to balance it properly and I mean that's I mean that's that's the big challenge but um but I think we never get it All right I mean she kind of\nGave me the space I needed to climb at the right times but in general you know we had a totally normal normal healthy relationship\nWell let me ask you was asking though in the middle of a big time I mean well let's talk about your el ... ascent yes on August ... did you think of her or is would you bring that I mean how how focused\nOn the on the hardest sections which represents maybe half the route um I wasn't thinking about anything I was just sort of physically executing moves interest performing\nBut then on the easier train 'em I was able to think about other things and thinking about friends and partners huh I mean I remember specifically on on the free souls or cap I spent you know maybe a five hundred foot section in the middle of this kind of easy or thinking about some of the partners I've been up there earlier in the year with\nJust a couple of other professional climbers and friends of mine and you know feeling really grateful for the people who sort of helped me on my on my journey then then\nYeah I mean certainly I was thinking about Saudi as soon as I stopped talking about my girlfriend uh [laughter] you know when I finished\nYeah well I mean as you're right in a free solo does the movie does explore um your relationship with Saudi McCandless your girlfriend and I want to play a little clip from it because here in this exchange a sunny is asking you\nHow are you factor her into your decisions about free solar climbing\nI Want to like I Want to have my lifting a precedent you having I've already been guy like mine's one knew\nWhat we want to do while we're hearing a time when people die but I feel like I Want and a half way\nWhen you sound like detaining indirectly [noise] and\nRussia than going to be on with cutting in and actually ... change when you actually make decisions to me [noise]\nI had some kind of obligation to maximize my lifespan than like you obviously have to give up so I got on\nWith me asking you do you see that as an obligation now\n[noise]\nBut I appreciate your your concerns I have you know I respect that but but and I had no way the obligation now\nIs that true Alex you still not feel obligated to maximize your life span\nThere's no like oh I mean I have a that struggled through the whole film there there's so many section of the whole cringe that's that's pretty that's that was on top or you know I should have been kinder um but I mean I think that that a big part of what I was getting out there is that\nYou know whether I'm thinking about her or my family or anybody else um I you know I don't want to die climbing like I'm already doing my best to not fall off the wall and so you know if I'm\nIf I'm thinking about others not I'm Still sort of going through the same motion I'm Still doing the same things to to make sure that I'm prepared but\nBut also I mean that conversation I think we've been dating for about a year at that point and I've been dreaming about recently oh crap for maybe the seven proceeding years\nAnd so I felt like the ratio was was was different you know I mean now we've been in a great relationship for three years and as you know finish this big climb and so you know moving forward and I'm sure the the calculations would be different\nHuh okay so there are potentially the ten you know so she went out and potentially\nA well I'm I'm sure it would be different and yeah sure it would be different All right I don't know which way\nTo go to another caller Michael's calling from Kiev, Ukraine Michael you're on the air\nYeah greetings or how you're doing a ... apparently Alex you have the uh the mutations climber brain so congratulations [noise] I'm a I'm a climber I've\nI did a various things from the early seventies and\nClimbed my greatest accomplishment was a devil's tower in Wyoming um which you know but the easiest thing on it is the hardest thing I can do [laughter] um so you know you you are Superman and totally insane\nBut when I was there a there was this this kid who is tree sewing it\nAnd you know I did I did some of that in the beginning and and it's actually easier in a lot of ways because it's so much faster and you don't have to stop importing protection which was really hard and really dangerous I really have been done too much leading and uh\nYou know and I I was I was ... I you know the TV reporter I'd gotten documentaries and ah I really want to do the documentary on this guy 'cause I saw it on I was talking to a ghost I just didn't think he'd be around and firefighters and but what he did was\nHe actually held off the top of this thing that's twelve hundred feet a vertical crystal on a vertical columns\nReally really difficult thing in close to ... to the third kind and repelled off the top like foot by foot and a quarter of a mile and clean the whole route with metal toothbrushes and broke off boulders\nThat were exploding like like ... you know blow\nOh and then and then it's an event that they need that event later free climbed\nYeah actually I was\nWondering if you ever done something that you know incredibly intensive and ah you know I Know you can't give a it's a very smooth and closing that hundreds of thousands of people do yeah ... um\nYeah but no I I I very much went through that exact same process I mean are\nYou know the film free so is is very much about the two years I spent are pulling the wall cleaning memorizing holds a you know\nI don't know if it's actually in the film but I definitely did spend some time removing some loose rocks from from one key section of a crack and\nUm and then I can just throw 'em down and let them is because I was there too many people and you somebody but so I put them in a backpack and repelled back down to them um but yeah definitely spent a lot of time you're physically preparing the route because it just yeah I mean you just have to there are scenes\nW.

announcement yesterday that she'll step down at the end of the year\nShe ends or time at the un is one of the few women in President Trump's cabinet and one of the few of any gender who's come through both unscathed and even more popular than when she when she went in\nQuite a feat for the former South Carolina Governor who was once a leading never Trump voice so how did she balance being America's chief global ambassador while serving in administration that disdain global alliances this hour on point assessing Nikki Haley's time at the un\nAnd what's next for American foreign policy and you can join us how do you think ambassador Haley\nRepresented the U.S at the un on the Iran deal on North Korea what about the U.S withdrawal from the human rights council or her criticism of Russia\nDo you

the ... that is at on point radio dot org that link column welcome back to you as well\nHi thanks for having me make no okay so let me just start with you I'm I'm actually going to play a little bit of tape here from what the president said uh at the press conference when Nikki Haley made her resignation public\nAnd he was extraordinary laughter tore she said he said\nThe position of UN ambassador she's helped make it a much better position if you want to become [noise]\nMaybe more glamorous position that it was years ago maybe I Wonder why but it is I mean she did a very glamorous position she's ready to a more important ... more important positions so we have a [noise] I can almost say many people don't want to do it at a very good people\n[noise] so I Want to help us read this I mean the the president's reaction to this resignation is quite different than virtually all the other members of his cabinet who've left in the past couple of years uh how do we read of the president's we'd right now [noise]\nWell the president's reaction was so interesting because he's let previous cabinet secretaries dangle by a threat and and speculation that swirled about when he was a fire them that happened with Rex Tillerson and happened with a national security adviser H R McMaster\nHappened with these Veterans Affairs secretary David Shulkin and it's happening with John Kelly who was his chief of staff right now all this speculation about when they'll leave and Nikki Haley and in the headline I might be says she flip the script on him by a colluding with him\nMuggy with

[noise]\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker party we're talking about UN ambassador Nikki Haley and about her decision to step down at the end of this year we're assessing her time\nAt the un and we're going to talk about very specific issues that she let on and spoke out on here in just a minute but I'm joined today by Eli on a Johnson White House reporter for Politico and by Colum Lynch un base to cure a senior diplomatic reporter\nAt foreign policy and I just want to play a little bit of sound here of that to get a sense about what Nikki Haley feels or her success at the un this is actually at a press conference in late September where she said that under President Donald Trump the U.S engages in multilateral ism only on us terms\nSince the secretary general meeting last year we have found out of the Paris accord we've pulled out of the global contact we have\nPulled out of the Iran deal all of that is to say that the United states is determined to obviously be involved in multi lateral organizations where we see it but not in a way that they are mandated on what the United States does or that infringes on the American people\nSo ambassador Nikki Haley they're talking about an expression of us power in terms of its retraction from a several multilateral agreements the United nations president Antonio ... has a his spokesperson delivered this message about ambassador Haley's work at the un on ... behalf\nUh this is in response to her decision to step down\nThey had a very productive and strong working relationship during her tenure as the United states permanent representative\nThey work hard to promote constructive ties between the United nations the United states joined the value of the United nations secretary general's forward to continuing to work with invested or Haley until the end of her tenure and of course with her replacement\nAll right well joining us now is Admiral James to read it he's former Supreme allied commander of NATO he served in that position from two thousand nine to two thousand Thirteen dean emeritus at the Fletcher School of law and diplomacy at Tufts University and he's an operating executive note the Carlisle group and author of the leaders bookshelf teams to read his welcome back to that point\nGreat to be back with you Mary and how's it going\nIt's going very well lots to talk about here and I want to I Want to just get your your your sense about the two different cuts we just heard ambassador Haley saying she defines her success is at the un impart by\nA expressing American power by withdrawing from certain agreements but of course in the diplomatic language of the United nations itself saying that there was a very strong in productive relationship there what's your take\nI I find those statements at variance um I Do want to start by just giving her credit as a person I think as many have said\nShe maintained her independence she struck out a on a number of issues and very positive ways and I think she was a very capable in Basque or for the United states however um I think that again and again this administration has demonstrated\nA I don't think contempt is too strong a word for the United nations and the organs of diplomacy that surround it in the international constellation\nSo she will have to answer for that as part of her legacy and I think it's a little disingenuous to say that we're very engaged while we're withdrawing from treaties and denigrating international organizations\nWell so tell me more about that I mean if you have to answer for that there were specific moments where she was you know extremely forthright in terms of uh of apple find the language of the Trump Administration at the un what are some of those moments\nAttention to 'em I start with the\nUh on the negative side the withdrawal from the climate agreement I think that will go down in history as a significant misstep by the administration kind of a peace with pulling out of the Trans Pacific partnership although of course that's not part of her particular ... on the positive side I think she was extremely forceful on\nA Syrian violations of international law after use of chemical weapons\nOn calling out Russia on its\nAssassination of an ex KGB agent\nSo more forcefully than the president has ever done\nAbsolutely and I think that you know in every sense her departure a is a win for Russia unfortunately because we lose a voice who has been consistently unafraid to call out the Russians in general and ... and in particular\nSo Colum Lynch up respond to that I mean this is one question that I I've had in in the past twenty four hours is that is the job of US ambassador to the un within this administration itself specifically within the Trump Administration one of the most challenging jobs are there isn't the administration because of exactly what\nI Am most readers has said there that uh you know you're working for a president who just basically doesn't believe in the ... of some functions of the un and how do you how do you come through that\nI [noise] I think the president's kind of view on it shifts all the time and I think that\nHaley did a very good job of trying to sort of um\nYou know tamped down his most sort of anti you and you know destructive kind of tendencies and was able to kind of bring him along explained to him what the un un was doing trying to bring Jared and ... on board to sort of recognize the benefits of working [noise]\nUm you know through the multilateral system but you know she is very much in her remarks that you just played a very much embracing the White House America First I'm sort of doctrine she has been you know ... she has been a kind of lead agent and the administration to push for\nA and then to foreign aid for countries that are not you know close friends of the United states I'm\nAnd she has been you know very very tough on a number of other issues I mean I think at the un she does have a lot of um achievements that she can point to um she did an evil and job and leading the negotiations on I'm sort of expanding sanctions against North Korea\nOr she has been quite active on some African issues that are others in the administration has shown very little interest in Central African republic the\nUm South Sudan um other sort of humanitarian issues but it's been sort of it's sometimes hard to see you know in one sense she has sort of um embrace this kind of brand of being kind of a\nA humanitarian actor and I are promoter of human rights within the administration but then that sort of conflicts with her positions on um you know dealing for instance with the Palestinians where she's been quite um quite harsh and and the way that she's dealt with that issue\nYeah Eliana joins in a new uh we've got to let you go if you're in a minute but I just wanted to get your take on something that seems to read it said that\nUm that there are some things that Nikki Haley the bathrooms Hayley said and actions that she she took or positions that she championed at the un that may come back to haunt or if you know in her future political career because she was a line so closely with the president\nYou know whether that's two years or four years from now I Know that's forever in American politics but but that's a reality to this that she's gonna she's going to be wondering about\nListening both to add ... walk into a column taught\nAt I think Nikki Haley I did this job with an eye to a future presidential campaign and she will be touting her accomplishments and everything she did at the un\nRunning on the conservative things such as at moving the U.S Capitol championing and move of the other day at us embassy to Jerusalem things that the Trump Administration was excoriated for pulling out of that climate deal those or thinks she can run on in a Republican primary\nAnd things that she will have to defend in a general election and absolutely\nWell Elliana Johnson White House reporter for Politico joining us from Washington Thank you so much you know it was great to have you thank you All right let's get some calls in here let's go to Frida who's calling from Tucson, Arizona feeder you're on the air\nHi thank you [noise] so I'm an independent voter have them for decades and I'm an ... I Do vote vote in both parties and I don't\nThink that Nikki Haley came out of this case I think ... position on Harris a Jerusalem and pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal are all major uh finals on her part I realized that those were the dishes or the president Xi\nIs representing but those are not successes I\nDefinitely see us as a country has fallen greatly does\nAround the world I think supporting an apartheid state in Israel is getting they go down in history as a major\nThe major flaw what she thinks are her successes I Would love to have seen her really stand up to the president but I don't think she would have maintained your position I think she just pandering to whatever her next political goal is\nJeanette Colo guard test dot com and posters myth printing posters on

Haley's decision to step down from that post at the end of the year what her legacy and her track record is at the her two years representing the United states in the UN and what could be next\nFor the next UN ambassador and for American foreign policy as a whole and we are joined today by Admiral James Stavridis he is a former Supreme allied commander at NATO and he's now an operating executive at the Carlyle group\nAnd author of the leaders bookshelf Colum Lynch is also with us he's un based senior diplomatic reporter at foreign policy magazine and gentle moved a lot of callers who want to join us so let me just get some of them in here where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred\nFor two three talks let's go to Vivian who's calling from east vessel borough main you're on the air Vivian\nOkay thank you for taking my call I I Am an independent voter and I don't want to either party but I Would like to say that I was so pleasantly surprised but Nikki Haley's\nAttitudes that she took as\nAs a representative to the un she stood up to a lot of the the that was shown by the human rights organizations and she stood up to a lot of them are we see that characterize\nIt as a right wing country and ah and\nYou know I think it's interesting that Colum Lynch mentioned that she went to the Palestinian camp she went she went to visit the Palestinian areas and maybe what happened was that she thought that they really weren't so bad luck and that\nMay be why she decided to support Israel and moved to just goes on\nWell Vivian Vivian let me go let cold respond to your your questionnaire and thank you so much for your call call them what do you say\nUm I think you think about the characters isn't true because I mean she went to the to this you know refugee camp and she came back very moved by the experience\nAnd came to testify before Congress and made and and passionate personal sort of appeal for them that this these programs really did make life better for them but\nThe alternative was not necessarily be good for U.S interests that you would might the withdrawal of aid might sort of contribute to a promoting the most the sort of extremist tendencies in the region so I think she was very much I'm\nA mood by that um by a visit 'em what really I think change your view on this was really um the the dispute over the U.S moving\nUm the embassy the U.S embassy to Jerusalem there was a Security Council vote in which um she was a she was you know cast the veto against fourteen other ... members she was totally isolated [noise] um the u._s. was isolated in the U.N General assembly afterwards and I think it was after that this sort of notion that the Palestinians were\nDefying the United states that they were rallying international opinion against the United states would really kind of um ths\nShifted her kind of orientation Rashid became very tough on that issue so I don't I don't think it was about that experience well\nI'm Jim ... to someone to come to you and your thoughts about this but just let me I Want to please a little bit of tape here to offer some context of\nThis first because I Do the best really has spoken very forcefully about us support in the Trump administration's support for Israel so first of all this is from march two thousand Eighteen so just a little earlier this year and um Bassett or Haley was speaking at the annual American Israel public affairs committee conference in Washington\nReceived a multiple standing ovations a throughout the evening and here's one such moment [laughter]\nBe the case in in an organization with a hundred and Ninety three countries the United nations spend half\nTime attacking only one country we will not anyhow [noise] that was in March\nOf this year and then to Colum Lynch is point about the UN's response to the United states deciding to move a it's a it's it it it's a a embassy to Jerusalem last December the UN\nMove and ambassador Haley at that time tweeted quote that the U.S will be taking names of those who vote against the United states that got some pretty extreme reaction here's former U.S ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns on CNN really criticizing Haley for that\nThis is extremely ill advised by the Trump Administration by the president and and and bathroom Haley I'm kind of surprised that investor hairless during this I don't know she's been ordered to do this but it's not going to be effective you know our our ... were a great country were the leading strongest country in the world and our best presidents are most effective presidents\nThey lead with self confidence and lead was supporting our allies there are thousands of votes in the United Nations General assembly and Security Council you win some you lose you can't you can't vote your best friends in the world\nThat's Nicholas Burns us some former U.S ambassador to NATO last December gyms to read us how do you respond to that\nI agree with Nick burns hum and I've worked with Nick on multiple occasions including er during the NATO years he's got a a a ... view of all this now having said that\nI think that um the youth and has over the years are gone way over the top in beating up on Israel I'm In Israel is our strongest ally partner in friend in the middle east but um friends neat to occasionally\nSpeak truth that may be unpleasant we need to at times talked or Israeli friends and\nConvince them to take positions that can\nHelp close that gap between Israel and the United nations is frankly not in U.S interests to have that kind of division between our strongest ally partner and friend in the region and that is Israel and the rest of the world so what we ought to be thinking about is\nHow do we close that gap tactically saying things like we're going to take names\nAre is probably not the way to do that in a body like the United nations\nLet's go to a call Colleen is calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air\nHigh as well make a U.S up on ha ha ha ha ha ha\nHa ha ha ha ha ha maturation his cabinet huh hum I'm from ... you have comments on ... I think the cost of food and ... yeah uh she said her a\nCall and I'm gonna have to jump in on you because your cell phone is a it's breaking up on us it's it's a bit challenging to understand but but James did we just I Know we've got to let you go here so I think we're calling was getting too is that he looks\nAt the president himself as making it a making it more challenging for members of the cabinet to do their job because of the president's position and language on multiple issues on foreign policy and this is something certainly that uh the next UN ambassador may face\nAbsolutely and you know exhibit a would be the president's speech in front of the entire world the U.N General assembly where\nHe says I have accomplished more in my two years in any American administration in history and his roundly roundly laughed at um that is not helpful when we go forth and that to me is not a sign of respect um I think that our allies partners and friends\nAre concerned because of our uh the radical behavior in our policy in a good example would be NATO\nDuring the campaign President Trump said it was obsolete we're going to get rid of it uh then he went over and I was in a series of conversations that we're not\nA particularly productive but at the end of it he did say yes I support NATO I support article five the an attack on one is an attack on all uh but then subsequently he went back to really excoriated\nThe allies for for spending and we ought to put pressure on them they ought to increase their defense spending\nBut I'm at the same time he he praises people like Vladimir ... and that is confusing and erratic um when coupled with bombastic statements like he deployed in front of the general assembly that does not do us well in our position in the world\nAnd that he's going to name the next UN ambassador so I just wonder I mean the last question to you James to read his ... you know has Nikki Haley\nActually sort of provided a model of we were talking about this earlier in the show how to both serve the president a and this particular administration but but operate in the un in a way that doesn't let 'em you know him or herself be defined by it by the president\nCorrect and uh the problem is going to be that there will be countervailing forces who will take a look at Nikki Haley's performance and say uh you know that's really not what we want we want someone who's more under control who reads the talking points from the White House more closely\nW.

eight to five five that's eight hundred for\nNicole ... in a minute I Do want to hear the story about how and when you decided to sort of find the answers to the questions that were bubbling up in your life [noise]\nUm but but there's just things for you know the right trying to figure out the right way to say this but I'm just trying to uh [noise]\nI Want to get a sense of ... you're not saying that you never felt on loved by your parents right oh no I never felt among okay patterns yeah 'cause 'cause I think part of me is responding to your story as a I'm a parent myself not of the of adopted children mind you but\nAnd I just feel like parents always try their best right they always do what what they tried to do the best with what they have in their tool kit\nAnd it sounds to me like is what you're saying that the your adoptive parents didn't quite have the tool kit that you needed them to have a as as a as a child of a different race\nI mean thinking about this from their perspective which I've tried to do a lot um partly because I'm a parent myself and I I really sympathize and I know how difficult it is\nUm I have no illusions about like mistakes that I've made or just things I Wish I had in my toolkit but I think in a way you know they weren't especially well served by the advice they were given at the time either I think and they've expressed this to me that they wish they had\nBeen offered more in the way of information not like warning that don't think they would have decided not to adopt the trans racially if they'd gotten more information but at the time that wasn't a conversation anybody what's happening with them\nUm and I think they have you know real regrets about not just from their own perspective as well because\nI think it was difficult for them later hearing and I had gone through some things that I didn't know how to talk with them about that we didn't know how to talk about as a family\nUm that maybe we we all should have been like collectively better equipped to handle you know\nI'm so it's not like a matter of like blame or like definitely not wishing that I hadn't been adopted are adopted by them it's just more\nWe all wish that we'd gotten different information and they really did try to their credit to seek it out at the time you know they ask many questions just nobody really was telling them these are some things maybe you should be aware of these are some things you can expect you should think about how you answer this question or\nYou know talk to your child about racism nobody was saying that to them and it was really the job of the people they were talking to ...\nTo have those conversations I think okay\nNow so I can hear it and fully understand how the the pain of the experiences that you were having those races experiences that you talked about uh was was something of difficult enough to handle 'em or know know what to do with how to come through that\nBut in addition to the ... was there was there all along and that you had um it just sort of internally\nWith racism aside to sort of was there a longing or an empty nester something that you felt that needed to be filled because of you know the fact that when you looked in the mirror you didn't see the same features we're complex and as you saw with your parents yeah I think it was it wasn't so much\nAn empty nester and I felt like something was missing I there are two parts of it one was that I really did keenly feel once I was old enough to notice and once\nI was old enough to have it pointed out to me it did really feel those differences strongly I'm In a way I got used to be like one of the few or one of the only ones in the room or the school or the space I was in but it was never really fully comfortable\nUm I don't know the closest I can comment like thinking about it it was sort of like when I left my home town I had a lot of great friendships in great relationships and I love my family and and all of that but it it really felt like sort of coming out of a cramped little space that wasn't quite big enough\nLike it it just felt I never really felt fully comfortable and I don't think that was just the adoption you know I think a lot of that was just a function of where I grew up and it was a a predominantly white area I went to like Barry White schools especially my grade school\nUm you know so that that was definitely some discomfort and then the other part is I I really did feel this curiosity this longing to know more about my birth family there was so little that we really knew for sure\nEspecially as I got older and realized you know maybe maybe some of this is guesswork maybe they're just things that I'm thinking are assuming are true that that might not be an can I live with never really knowing the actual answers what mattered finally decided to reach out to them or try to find them\nA lot of things it's interesting because I write and above my pregnancy with my first child was a really strong push\n'em sometimes I think like I wouldn't have searched maybe um if I hadn't become a parent but other times I'm convinced that I Would have eventually search no matter what you know it's nothing that I have a firm answer to I'd certainly been curious I wondered\nUm I had gotten a little bit of information on that was available to me without making contact um the state of Washington where I was adopted\nYou could petition basically for non identifying like basic social history no names addresses but like general very general information I got that and it was very very little but I had done that I had done some research and I knew what sort of what a search would involve\nIt was the final punished I remember sitting at um my first ... natal appointment talking with a midwife and she was asking me all these questions about my medical history and my family Henry and my mother's pregnancies and her birth [noise]\nUm and why I was born so prematurely ah because I was I was born about ten weeks early and you and I don't know I had no answer that was actually really scary to be seen my first pregnancy I knew nothing and like as an adoptee I'm not saying all adoptees feel this way but I felt so unprepared for pregnancy and labor and child birth it just\nI don't know something about my ... my mother and my adopted mother had not gone through that with me it was like my my whole life began when I was adopted I couldn't imagine stuff that came before and I wanted I was excited to have a family that I was really scared and also\nYeah I I don't know I felt like the story it wasn't just about the health history the medical information I didn't have that could be important I felt all of a sudden like\nI don't have enough to offer this child you know one day they'll grow up and they'll have questions about our family and our history and like what am I going to stay as what I have a good enough for them is a good enough for me anymore and so that was really when I decided okay I'm going to go ahead\nI'm and I so I really began that process yeah and I first trimester you know I think every parent\nGoes through those ... that set of questions about is what I have good enough for my child and they can only those questions only become far more acute when there's so many on answered a issues in in the the parents live so I hear you on that I'm Nicole we've got a lot of callers who want to join us and ah and I just want to get at least a couple of them here\nTo be able to share their stories but can you hang on for a second one I Will they will ... absolutely let's go to Jim who's calling from El ... Pennsylvania Jim you're on the air\nYes hello thanks for taking my call um I just have a story of my ah I'm white I'm my first wife and I we adopted a two children of color um one when he was six weeks old and the other or when he was two years old um and there was a year a difference between them so\nUm my my story starts when they're like a four years old and three years old [noise] and um they're all grown up now other twenty and Twenty one\nBut a a one day we're walking through the uh Walmart parking lot and just me and them and I've got one by chance and a kind of how to do where the younger one jak he says\nNo I'm Sorry I'm a little nervous I'm On the radio\nThat's all right on her one Isaac your wise accused about four years old he says he says that he says\nWhy are you white and were black and you know write them it's like oh goodness I didn't think I'd have to have this conversation in the Walmart parking well you know mhm I'm so I'm well what'd you do\nI don't well he story does now that I go to answer him\nAnd my younger son jak who is lighter skin um he stops he stopped right away three years old he stops key rips his hand out of my hand and he says I'm not black on white huh and so now I turn to him because\nOh my goodness I I hadn't thought about how they view themselves you know yeah and uh you know the younger one he was a a a mixture of a you know African American and Hispanic\nAnd he was just lighter skin and an Isaac was African American and an Caucasian I was a little bit darker skin right\nAnd college fine where consulting work with high school

her new memoir is all you can never know what's her story of her transracial adoption and joining us as well as Joyce McGuire ... she is the founder of the center for family connections and nonprofit that serves children and blended families\nFor more than Thirty years a now Nicole just I Wonder if you could just\nBriefly tell us what happened when you finally we're reconnected with your with your biological family because I imagined that\nGrowing up there's a there's a very understandable tendency to idealize the people that you don't know but that that uh but that I deal wasn't wasn't fully ... flies\nI mean it's always danger ideal I think people you've never met Frank I'm you know and a lot of ways it it really was sort of a confirmation of that story I'd gotten as a child but much deeper and richer and more complicated um\nAnd it was interesting you know I I hadn't thought enough honestly about my birth parents perspective and what it must have been like\nThat was something I guess I wondered about in a way as a kid but I it didn't have them maybe emotional maturity or knowledge of the world to really consider what they might have gone through I was not expecting to find\nYou know a story that had so much like trauma really um and lost that had nothing to do with my adoption you know things that were just difficult if they were dealing with um that you know might have been factors in the adoption certainly but weren't like directly caused by it for example\nUm so when I first reached out to them and I did Sylvia a confidential intermediary a under Washington state law\nAt the time I was placed in at the time I searched had to go through a third party so that person forwarded a letter from me and before we could exchange any identifying information like things like last names and addresses and really specifics about our lives you know we had to get various forms completed and it had to be by mutual consent\nUm so that also made the process take a little bit longer um but I reached out through the intermediary um and my birth parents at the time I found them had been divorced for many years so I wrote to them separately\nAnd um so this is like two different reunions really with two different branches of the family instead of the one ... and like not usually I had always pictured like talking within meeting them or reconnecting with them at least like together\nSo that was I was interested I was my first sort of surprise um and what I found initially or was that they had never told um my sisters my biological sisters I have a half sister and a full sister and uh they were living at home at the time I was placed and they'd never been told about the adoption they'd behold I died at birth\nAnd All right when I wrote to my birth parents um you know do too I think the language barrier or just some difficulty translating the letter um that was sort of how my sister's got involved and how they found out\nAnd it was definitely a shot for them you know as as little as I knew they knew even less than I did and uh so it was really it was like a ... it was a whole family is sort of reconnection ... as I mentioned segmented into like different different branch of ... that was it was unexpected\n[laughter] well I mean so Joyce\nAdoptions are so complicated right because you're dealing with the lives of the the lives of so many people at ... at the ... the most vulnerable point probably in their lives so we've been hearing Nicole say that\nThat her biological parents hadn't even told there are other children I mean how how do you would ... I don't know how is that unusual\nNot really isn't I mean there's a lot of shame and guilt and you know really deep emotions and although no one in adoption gets enough support and help and training and and treatment\nBirth parents get the least and they just leave and have to figure it out themselves and often there is a history of more Lawson trauma in their lives and as Nicole said sometimes it's not related directly to the adoption it was something that was going on anyway\nUm so this isn't a surprise and how do you tell your other children\nUm that one of them is gone and why so there's you know and also there's the cultural\nIssues I mean this this family was a immigrant family and so it it's not something they usually do place children for adoption and they in their situation so I think there are so many pieces to this that are familiar\nAnd difficult and again every stories that case study of one this is not every story about every birth parents but it's not a whole family story\nAnd Nicole so then as you began to form relationships I mean especially with one of her sister's ... were you in the book the ... the question that you that keeps coming up in my mind is did that process than help\nUh you know fill those gaps that you said you were you had been feeling growing up with your adopted family do to get you to the place that you would hope you were hoping to to to go to I think\nPrimary gaps I was aware of at the time I searched were just simply kind of gaps and knowledge which is not to minimize maybe emotional or\nOther other factors I certainly cared about 'em I cared about ... about my adoption I was curious about my birth family there was a lot I wanted to know and questions I Would have loved to have the opportunity to opportunity to ask which is one of the reasons I searched but\nI think it was really from my sister's especially my full sister Cindy from whom I got a lot of information\nI'm In a she was she was very shocked and she had a lot of questions um\nAnd so I think that she was even more determined than I was in a way to get the truth I didn't always feel I I I wasn't really part of this family I didn't feel I it was my place to come in and demand all these answers all of a sudden\nI'm I kept my asks pretty simple at first it was like please feel at a medical history and if I could ask you some questions I Would like to but if you don't want to be in contact I understand and I were in fact that so but Cindy Cindy was this was her family\nI think she was very surprised and wanted to know more and so she was really pushing for answers and that was how I I began to learn more and fill in those gaps in knowledge now\nWell this is obviously an issue that has had an impact on many people's lives 'cause we've got a stack of callers I just want to let them have their say a little bit more here so let's go to John who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma John you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call um I was raised in the south or in the sixties and seventies adopted Fifteen Years ago a beautiful young man from a lot of ... and my question is is I don't have any experience how do I prepare my son for living in a racial world\nOh because you yourself have never faced or experience racism John\nYeah I had lived in upper middle class lives uh went in the military where there's very little racism than you know I'm just all face those issue yeah how do I prepare my son to go out in the world he knows he's very dark he's you know going to say we think I don't know what to tell him\nJoyce you have an answer for John well I you know there that's a huge question by one of the answers is to make sure you surround yourself with people of color especially you know if he's African American\nUm you know make sure that if you're choosing pediatricians or dentists that you look for on models for him and that you look for help for you ah you know the best people to help you to understand how to deal with racism or people who have experienced it\nAnd so ... and it's also good for him to see you claiming these people who are like him and not just him yeah let's go to Dana who's calling from Glen falls New York then a year on the air\nHi um I'm a white parent of two Asian um daughters Asian American now uh we began our adoption process about Twenty years ago and\nI feel really grateful that we had the agency we did I had I had no knowledge of how to do this when I when we started but one of the requirements of her agency was that we attend numerous workshop throughout the process\nAnd a few of them involved adult adoptees who\nUm [noise] um where people of color are adopted by white parents who shared their stories which in many cases were not so good mhm and made clear to us how important it was for one thing I'm\nNot you know to the extent we could don't live in a segregated white community I live in a place where our kids were grow up I'm\nIn a more multi racial a environment\nAnd streaming or W.

decision to step down at the end of this year we're assessing her time\nAt the un and we're going to talk about very specific issues that she let on and spoke out on here in just a minute but I'm joined today by Eliana Johnson White House reporter for Politico and by Colum Lynch un base to cure a senior diplomatic reporter\nA little bit of sound here of the to get a sense about what Nikki Haley feels or her success at the un this is actually at a press conference in late September where she said that under President Donald Trump the U.S engages in multilateral ism only on us terms\nSince the secretary general's meeting last year we have found out of the Paris accord we've pulled out of the global contact we have\nPulled out of the Iran deal all of that has to say that the United states is determined to obviously be involved in multi lateral organizations where we see it but not in a way that they are mandated on what the United States does or that infringes on the American people\nSo ambassador Nikki Haley they're talking about an expression of us power in terms of its retraction from a several multilateral agreements the United nations president Antonio ... has a his spokesperson delivering this message\nAbout ambassador Haley's work at the un on ... behalf uh this is in response to her decision to step down\nThey had a very productive and strong working relationship during her tenure as the United states permanent representative\nThey work hard to promote constructive ties between the United nations the United states showing the value of the United nations secretary general sports are continuing to work with invested or Haley until the end of her tenure and of course with her replacement\nAll right well joining us now is Admiral James Stavridis he's former Supreme allied commander of NATO he served in that position from two thousand nine to two thousand Thirteen dean emeritus at the Fletcher School of law and diplomacy at Tufts University and he's an operating executive now the Carlisle group and author of the leaders bookshelf teams to read is welcome back to them point\nGreat to be back with you ... how's it going\nIt's going very well lots to talk about here and I want to I Want to just get your your your sense about the two different cuts we just heard ambassador Haley saying she defines her success is at the un in part by\nA expressing American power by withdrawing from certain agreements but of course in the diplomatic language of the United nations itself saying but there was a very strong and productive relationship there what's your take\nI I find those statements at variance um I Do want to start by just giving her credit as a person I think as many have said she maintained her independence\nShe struck out a on a number of issues and very positive ways and I think she was a very capable or ambassador for the United states however um I think that\nAgain and again this administration has demonstrated a I don't think contempt is\nToo strong a word for the United nations and the organs of diplomacy that surround it in the international constellation so she will have to answer for that as part of her legacy and I think it's a little disingenuous to say that we're very engaged while we're withdrawing from treaties and denigrating international organizations\nOkay well so tell me more about that I mean if you have to answer for that and there were specific moments where she was you know extremely forthright in terms of uh of amplifying the language of the Trump Administration after you and what are some of those moments that that you think are particularly were worth paying attention to\nStart with the\nUh on the negative side the withdrawal from the climate agreement I think that will go down in history as a significant misstep by the administration kind of a peace with pulling out of the Trans Pacific partnership although of course that's not part of her\nParticular ... on the positive side I think she was extremely forceful on a Syrian violations of international law after use of chemical weapons\nOn calling out Russia on its\nAssassination of an ex KGB agent\nSo more forcefully than the president has ever done absolutely\nAnd I think that in every sense her departure a is a win for Russia unfortunately because we lose a voice who has been consistently unafraid to call out the Russians in general and ... and in particular\nSo Colum Lynch respond to that I mean this is one question that I I've had in in the past twenty four hours is that is the job of US ambassador to the un within this administration itself specifically within the Trump Administration is one of the most challenging jobs are there is an administration because of exactly what\nI Am most readers has said there that uh you know you're working for a president who just basically doesn't believe in based at some functions of the un and how do you how do you come through that\nI think the president's kind of view on it shifts all the time and I think that\nHaley did a very good job of trying to sort of um\nYou know tamped down his most sort of anti un destructive kind of tendencies and was able to kind of bring him along explained to him what the un un was doing trying to bring Jared and ... on board to sort of recognized the benefits of working\nUm you know through the multilateral system but you know she is very much in her remarks that you just played a very ...\nI'm sort of doctrine she has been you know ... and he has been a kind of lead agent and the administration to push for\nA an end to foreign aid for countries that are not you know close friends of the United states I'm and she has been you know very very tough on a number of other issues I mean I think at the un\nShe does have a lot of um achievements that she can point to um she didn't even job and leading the negotiations on I'm sort of expanding sanctions against North Korea or she has been quite active when some African issues that to others and the administration has shown very little interest in Central African republic ...\nUm South Sudan um other sort of humanitarian issues but it's been sort of it's sometimes hard to see you know in in one sense she has sort of um embrace this kind of brand of being kind of a\nA humanitarian actor and that is a promoter of human rights within the administration but then that sort of conflicts with her kind of positions on um you know dealing for instance with the Palestinians where she's been quite um quite harsh and in the way the shoes dealt with that issue\nYeah Eliana joins in a new uh we've got to let you go here in a minute but I just wanted to get your take on something that seems to read it said that um\nThat there are some things that Nikki Haley than ... Hayley said and actions that she she took or positions that she championed at the un that may come back to haunt or if you know in her future political career because she was a line so closely with the president\nYou know whether that's two years or four years from now I Know that forever in American politics but but that's a reality to this that she's gonna she's going to be wondering about\nListening both to add ... ... to ... to ...\nI I think Nikki Haley I get this job with an eye to a future presidential campaign and she will be carrying her accomplishments and everything she did at the un\nRunning on the conservative things such as at moving the U.S Capitol champion and move of of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem things that the Trump Administration was excoriated for pulling out of that climate deal those are things she can run on in a Republican primary\nAnd things that she will have to defend in a general election and absolutely\nWell Elliana Johnson White House reporter for Politico joining us from Washington Thank you so much and I was great to have you thank you All right let's get some calls in here let's go to Frida who's calling from Tucson, Arizona feeder you're on the air\nHi thank you so I'm an independent voter had them for decades eminent jak didn't I Do the vote in both parties and I don't think that Nikki Haley came out of this on the case I think her position on Harris\nA Jerusalem and pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal are all major a\n... on her part I realized that those were positions or the president Xi is representing but those are not successes I definitely see us as the country have fallen greatly down on the scale of risk that around the world\nI think supporting and apartheid stayed in Israel is getting they go down in history as a major\nThe major flaw to what she thinks are her successes I Would love to have seen her really stand up to the president but I don't think she would have maintained your position I Do think she just pandering to whatever her next political goal is\n\nKeep Republican keep control of the house in November Democrats worst nightmares could come through in vitro will continue with control over all the political branches of government but at the house\nChanges hands ...

Boston's NPR News station\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking about UN ambassador Nikki Haley's decision to step down from that post at the end of the year what her legacy enter track record is that the her two years representing the United states in the UN and what could be next\nFor the next UN ambassador and for American foreign policy as a whole and we are joined today by Admiral James Stavridis he is a former Supreme allied commander at NATO and he's now an operating executive at the Carlyle group\nAnd author of the leaders bookshelf Colum Lynch is also with us he's un based senior diplomatic reporter at foreign policy magazine and gentle moved a lot of callers who want to join us so let me just get some of them in here where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talks let's go to Vivian who's calling from east vessel borough main you're on the air Vivian\nOkay thank you for taking my call I I Am an independent voter and I don't want to either party but I Would like to say that I was so pleasantly surprised\nAttitudes that she took as\nAs a representative to the un she stood up to a lot of the hypocrisy that was shown by the human rights organizations and she stood up to let me see that characterize\nIt as a right wing country and ah\nYou know I think it's interesting that Colum Lynch mentioned that she went to the Palestinian camp she went she went to visit the Palestinian areas and\nMaybe what happened was that she said that they really weren't so bad luck and that\nMay be why she decided to support Israel and moved to just go on\nWell Vivian Vivian let me go let column respond to your uh your questionnaire and thank you so much for your call call them what do you say\nUm I think I think that the characters isn't true because I mean she went to the to this you know refugee camp and she came back very moved by the experience\nAnd came to testify before Congress and made and and passionate personal sort of appeal for them that this these programs really did make life better for them that\nThe alternative was not necessarily be good for U.S interests that you would might the withdrawal of aid might sort of contribute to a promoting the most the sort of extremist tendencies in the region so I think she was very much I'm\nA mood by that um my dad visit 'em what really I think change your view on this was really um the the dispute over the U.S moving\nThe embassy the U.S embassy to Jerusalem there was a Security Council votes in which um she was a she was you know cast the veto against fourteen ... member she was totally isolated [noise]\nUm the u._s. was isolated in the U.N General assembly afterwards and I think it was after that this sort of notion that the Palestinians were\nDefying the United states that they were rallying international opinion against the United states and really kind of um ...\nShifted her kind of orientation actually became very tough on that issue so I don't I don't think it was about that experience well\nI'm James ... to someone to come to you and your thoughts about this but just let me I Want to play a little bit of tape here to offer some context this first because the the ambassador Haley has spoken very forcefully about\nUs support in the Trump Administration support for Israel so first of all this is from march two thousand Eighteen so just a little earlier this year and um Bassett or Haley was speaking at the annual American Israel public affairs committee conference in Washington\nReceived a multiple standing ovations a throughout the evening and here's one such moment [laughter]\nThe the case in in an organization with a hundred and Ninety three countries the United nations spend half\nKind of hacking only one country we will not anyhow [noise] that was in March\nOf this year and then to Colum Lynch is point about the UN's response to the United states deciding to move\nA it's a it's it it it's a embassy to Jerusalem last December the un scheduled a vote on a resolution denouncing that move and ambassador Haley at that time tweeted quote that the U.S will be taking names of those who vote against the United states\nThat got some pretty extreme reaction here's former U.S ambassador to NATO Nicholas Burns on CNN really criticizing Haley for that\nThis was extremely ill advised by the Trump Administration by the president in ... I'm kind of surprised that in ... during this I don't know she's been ordered to do this but it's not going to be effective you know our our ... were a great country were the leading strongest country in the world and our best presidents are most effective presidents\nThey lead with self confidence and lead was supporting our allies there are thousands of votes in the United Nations General assembly and Security Council you win some you lose 'em you can't you can't bully your best friends in the world\nThat's Nicholas Burns us some former U.S ambassador to NATO last December James to read is how do you respond to that\nAgree with Nick burns um and I've worked with Nick are on multiple occasions including er during the NATO years um he's got a a a pretty keen view of all this now having said that\nI think that um the youth and has over the years uh gone way over the top in beating up on Israel I'm In Israel is our strongest ally partner in friend in the middle east but um friends need to occasionally\nSpeak truth that may be unpleasant we need to at times talked or Israeli friends and\nConvince them to take positions that can help close that gap between Israel and the United nations is frankly not in U.S interests to have that kind of division between our strongest ally partner and friend in the region and that is Israel and the rest of the world so what we ought to\nGap tactically saying things like we're going to take names are is probably not the way to do that in a body like the United nations\nLet's go to a call Colleen is calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air\nHigh as big a U.S up on a on\nA on a ... his cabinet ... I'm from ... ... you have comments on our streets be as proposed yeah uh she sent her a\nCall and I'm gonna have to jump in on you because your cell phone is a it's breaking up on us it's it's a bit challenging to understand but but James did we just I Know we've got to let you go here so I think we're calling was getting too is that he looks\nAt the president himself as making it a making it more challenging for members of the cabinet to do their job because of the president's position and language on multiple issues on foreign policy and this is something certainly that to the next UN ambassador may face\nAbsolutely and you know exhibit a would be the president's speech in front of the entire world the U.N General assembly where\nHe says I have accomplished more in my two years in any American administration in history in his roundly roundly laughed at um that is not helpful when we go forth and that to me is not a sign of respect um I think that our allies partners and friends\nAre concerned because of our uh the radical behavior in our policy and a a good example would be NATO during\nThe campaign President Trump said it was obsolete we're going to get rid of it\nUh then he went over and I was in a series of conversations that we're not a particularly productive but at the end of it he did say yes I support NATO I support article fired the an attack on one is an attack on all uh but then subsequently he went back to really excoriated\nThe allies for for spending and we ought to put pressure on them they ought to increase their defense spending\nBut I'm at the same time he he praises people like Vladimir ... and that is confusing and erratic um when coupled with bombastic statements like he deployed in front of the general assembly that does not do us well in our position in the world\nAnd that he's going to name the next UN ambassador so I just wonder I mean the last question to you James to read his ... you know has Nikki Haley actually sort of provided a model of we were talking about this earlier in the show of\nHow to both serve the president a and this particular administration but but operate in the un in a way that doesn't let 'em you know him or herself be defined by it by the president\nAbsolutely correct and the problem is going to be that there will be countervailing forces who will take a look at Nikki Haley's performance and say uh you know that's really not what we want we want someone who's more under control who reads the talking points from the White House more closely", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "10"}
