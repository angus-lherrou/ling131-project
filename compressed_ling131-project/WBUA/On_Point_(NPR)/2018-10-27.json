itself you\nKnow it honestly didn't even occur to me not to talk about that\nLike I said it was part of what to find her adult life it didn't define her but it did find a lot of how she lived her life

hour by talking to people most affected by it you can join the conversation what do you find works\nMedication assisted treatment abstinence only and twelve step programs where white hundred for two three eight to five five hundred and forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook and on point radio\nI'm Talking with Kate O'Neill who wrote a string of victory for her sister who passed away after spending more than a decade struggling with addiction and Brandon don't pose the chief of police in Burlington, Vermont a jeep composer you've uh called this one of the priorities of your time they're directed that way by the mayor of Burlington what steps have you taken their\nSo one of the things we realized right away the mayor and eyes that we couldn't just take a policing approach and if you're wondering why chief of police got this job of addressing the opioid crisis because most\nAmerican cities um don't have a department of health right we're either relying on county government which we don't have much of an Vermont or state government to\nProvide a solution but at the end of the day it's local governments and their collaborations with hospitals and addiction services providers that have to uh come up with an answer to turn the tide it's the number one source of accidental death in our society today period no matter how you cut it um [noise]\nWhat we did was learn about opioid addiction and one of the things we came away with this little though it's an imperfect solution that unlike crystal meth or on my crack cocaine other drugs there are medicines that interrupt the cravings and withdrawal and the urges in human body for heroin and fentanyl\nAre that don't exist for these other drugs and they're like a cage said you've been orphaned methadone there's a lot of stigma around um\nYou know just the the idea of medication assisted treatment but period it saves lives uh the evidence is irrefutable and otherwise I won't get us out of the spiritual Malaysia that some people say leads to drug addiction it will lower the mortality rate we can take a deep breath and we could move forward so [noise]\nAh with the mayor directed is that we do everything we can to get every opportunity to put people into medication assisted therapy or as of late at\nOur needle exchange if you were to walk in to get some clean syringes and say I'm not ready for treatment but you wanted to try some of the medication or you'll get a prescription for it and that prescriptions written by a doctor or a doctor who lost his son to a opioid overdose um if you go to our emergency department with an overdose of sort of just being made conscious again and being\nKicked out the door hey we saved her life but you still have the problem which is what happens in nearly every emergency department in America\nYou can get a prescription for people who are ... in uh Seventy two hour appointment with an addiction psychiatrist that's a new pilot and we worked very hard in Vermont a familiar Merle Weinberger up to Governor Scott to get legislation in place that mandates medication assisted therapy for every prisoner or in our prison system who needs it\nAnd I'll say briefly that if you look at that a model in Rhode Island which made a commitment to get him getting every prisoner in his prison system who needed a the right medication the right time they reduced post incarcerate of\nOverdose deaths by sixty two percent by two thirds in fact there down in Rhode Island twelve percent as of last year an overdose deaths two thirds of that reduction two thirds of that ... percent ... percent of it is just due to what they've done in their prisons and in Vermont where we're trying all these things ah and hopefully they'll turn the tide\nUm kitten O'Neill with this have helped a Matty and people like her\nI mean\nI Believe that would ... than incarcerated multiple times and never received medication assisted treatment while in prison [noise]\nUm you know I think for a Lincoln is an incredibly special place really progressive I think it could lead\nThe country in responding to this um but you know the fact that it is a law enforcement issue is a problem that it's being treated that way this is a public health issues so if if it's if it's being ... you know our jails are the biggest opportunities for rehabilitation in this country right now\nAnd we need to act on that but it needs to it we need to step back this is a public health issue and from our again is doing a great job and I think a lot of these measures would have been helpful\nTreatment is still a huge issue in a lot of rural states you know where this this epidemic is occurring you know you have to drive hours to get there but if you don't have a car you know on and then the programs are Twenty one day twenty eight day off an abstinence based programs you know so there's a lot of issues than I Do think that\nBurlington and you know I'm ... will be leading that's and I appreciate that but I'm more needs to be done\nI just want to be clear when you talk about ... space which is another way of describing some things like twelve step you're saying that's not actually always helpful folks right I mean because the popular culture for people who don't struggled addiction they mean\nIt's easily enough done\nYeah I think you know I'm brand and just referred to this is a lot of stigma around medication assisted treatment and my family but not he was first starting to get clean had the idea well if you're taking that sit down or if you're taking the pronouncing laying out really clean clean or not so far right\nWhich is just you know there's so much evidence that show that these treatments are the most effective way to treat this disease and sell denying people access are making it difficult for them to have access to it\nYou know I'm I think you know if you\nIf you have an issue where you have diabetes we don't say people you know like you can't have this drought that would help you get better and we make it difficult for people to get this drug on that would make them get better and there's stigma around that within the recovery community which I think it's hard to\nGet it out like if you please please go ahead please no I I I think it's important to even be more categorical about what Kate is saying if we stick to an abstinence based plan to help our way out of the opioid crisis we are headed\nFor or mitigate a disaster um if somebody is is hell bent on being obstinate were behind them every step of the way clinically if you look at the public health research in the medical research abstinence fails well over Ninety percent of the time as an intervention\nIt's the medicines that we have available to us that reduce or the these bad outcomes I have a friend of my old town in the Hudson Valley who I did not know for years was a a recovering heroin addict\nI used to play with his kids we used to go to social events together and when I started doing this line of work you said Brandon\nI've been on people who are in for a decade now\nAnd it's the only reason why I'm healthy and alive and that's not I know that's an anecdote but um\nIf you just look at the success rates if anybody's spent a few minutes looking at the success rates for abstinence versus the success rates for medicine when it comes to addiction there's no question an abstinence as a population level interventions reduced mortality is a losing proposition and we need to make these medicines available\nAnd we need to overcome the stigma that surrounds taking medicine to\nWrite yourself because we don't have that stigma when we recovered from HIV we give someone the AIDS cocktail we don't have that stigma as Kate said when somebody has to take diabetes medicine for the rest of their life\nYou know we've been getting fascinating and stronger response from listeners or as as the show's been going on one poll Norton says addictions like a cancer when does not choose to have either he posted on our website excuse me on her Facebook page\nAnd and wrote addiction is a lifelong bite of a disease that fewer specter relies can't be cured by jail or combination only love respect understanding and radical forgiveness and patients can cure it or another comments on our website or under the name near as nine wrote I've had a cute chronic pain for over ten years opioids have kept me alive\nThey're the only reason I haven't killed myself do the endless horrible pain these drugs keep it at least at the level where I can read watch TV et cetera and get some website I've tried so many non drug treatments and non opioid drugs but uh nothing or have helped I I Will point out that we do have a information on sites for dealing with addiction and also questions of dealing with a\nCell farmers suicidal thoughts on our website it on point\nA radio you can Google for that I Want to take a call now from Norwich, Connecticut are now dear uh go ahead please\nOr how you doing today okay let me thank you for having me on on\nThe other guy the other gentleman just said this kind of threw me off because you cannot put the money would have diabetes\nLike my grandmother's outputs forty five years in the same category as someone who you know who will have the ... I mean there's ... there's ... or ... of course is more than one way with people end up getting hooked on these things a lot of times that happens I'm your accident\nAcross it and they're given the prescription that that if that ended up becoming addicted to their medication so people which either they don't need to take the medication and what we're paying some who do 'cause you need to take the medicated for pay my for my personal experience alone and use a bit of knowledge I lost about nine people\n... do the kids right All right out of high school some of the middle of the movie to see

titled ... dealers doctors and the drug company that addicted America I Want to start with a couple of calls are kind of flooding in I'd like to take a call first from Gita are calling in from hartsville South Carolina thanks for joining us\nHi thank you for taking my call\nUh-huh I wanted to hear a little bit I I'm Sorry\nI just want to hear what your thoughts were about all this\nWell I'm I'm a recovering addict and I think an addict ever is here because I think for men were hard wired differently than normal people you know our one Tylenol may be good for somebody\nI five would be great for me um I went from I hated pain medicine until I had um oral surgery and they gave me ... and all of a sudden I was in love I thought this was happening I get nice and then they gave me I think drugs um and\nThat was even better I was like God heaven and are you know and then they and they turn English back out into the prescription and then that's it you know and then you're you're out there on your own with your body seeming for more of what you can't yet and you'll do just about anything you can to get what you need\nMhm thank you for that jaded we've also call from Boston, Massachusetts Tom you're on the air go ahead\nYou're doing okay I think the police chief from\nVermont is right on but I I got to tell you if the drug companies that were providing the medicated assisted medication we're pushing that drug as hot as\nPurdue chemicals push the uh actually caught and we wouldn't have a problem right now and because the medication does affect of I I'm a recovering addict and I'm also a treatment provider and I've been doing it for twenty eight years\nAnd I've never seen anything like what a few over the last\nYou know the the uh pharmaceuticals were bad enough but now that they're pulling back from the pharmaceutical ... is a flooded throughout the addiction to heroin developed in Massachusetts anyway\nAnd so what I'm seeing I'm seeing people that are stabilized on a on a medication and then what happens is the third for off and then they relapse die because there's no just plain relapses anymore it's just a\nGreat day to get a shot up front and all of the they get the uh the uh her thirties that are that are really a crushed ... you know and they got a couple of them and they guy now my history I was incarcerated because of my opiates or the books\nAnd ah I relapsed that day I got out had been read today I'd be dead\nBecause of twenty percent of the population that are regularly proven that have a addictive um heroin or histories died within the first ah two weeks because of an overdose so\nWe thought it was on let me let me what the folks here here weigh in on this but thank you for sharing boost your personal experience and also your expertise on this but maybe I won't let you weigh in on a couple of things first you've heard the statement a few minutes ago that I read a from Purdue Pharma talking about how they are a\nAn active part of the solution constructively engaging to find ways to remedy this and not currently part of the problems or how does that a seat in with your reporting on this\n[noise] well um\nIt sits in in that um you know they've just uh have plans to create a new buprenorphine product which is great but if they really wanted to make\nA difference in America they could do as chief don't pose a and others in some of the states that are finally starting to push back their overdose death rates by a very little bit\nAnd make it widely available one of the things I wanted to point out by what about the cheap and what's happening in Vermont is that's really unusual I mean my ... is just off to him\nBut in states where are we were very slow to pass Medicaid we just passed it in Virginia became the thirty third recently\nI mean we have we have reached talking forgive you're talking about Medicaid expansion right yeah ... I'm Sorry yeah Medicaid expansion I mean we have waiting lists that range from three weeks to two years to get into MIT program we have no funneling some are ERs into MIT programs\nI'm In my city in Roanoke, Virginia we have a police chief that's come out against syringe exchange so nowhere for somebody to go we don't have any treatment in our jails\nAnd um you know it it shouldn't be geographic it shouldn't be the luck of where you live\nUh whether you get this lifesaving treatment or not\nBut we we have a a a listener who wrote on line she wrote I Believe the opioid crisis reflection of American culture to seize of despair our culture is money driven their lack of opportunities for the majority of Americans in your book it seems to me that one of the themes that comes out is sort of the constriction of opportunities\nIn an apple each uh uh you know stretching from the you know the American south east up to the northeast a ... in industries where they once could rely on study jobs\nExactly and that's where you know the crisis first erupted in these distress rural communities where the jobs were closing at the same time this pain is a vital signs was being pushed to ... what we really need our policies to address the root causes which are mental health issues and\nSo ... socio economic despair I mean there's a kid in my book who's interviewed a or one of his teachers asked him in middle school when you want to be when he grows when you grow up\nAnd he says I Want to be a draw or she goes oh you want to be an artist\nAnd he goes no I Want to be a draw I Want to draw Social Security disability because that was the only thing he can imagine 'cause that's what he saw around him in Lee county which I write about in the book uh it's hard it's hard to central at ... opioids were prescribe three hundred six hundred percent that the\n... of the national average and there are fifty seven percent of men who are working age there who are unemployed\nRecently the president has talked about the mobilization of the federal government to address the crisis on Tuesday health and Human Services secretary Alex aides are said the U.S is starting to turn the corner on this epidemic or he cited figure showing a to point eight percent dip in over deaths from September twenty Seventeen to march twenty Eighteen\nAccording to provisional data from the CDC the seemingly relentless trend of rising overdose deaths seems to finally be benefiting in the right direction\nPlus telling it's such a high level is hardly an opportunity to declare victory but the concerted efforts of communities across America are beginning to turn\nThe tide Britain don't pose a you know the number of Americans dying from a ... a related deaths appears to be a just under the number of Americans in total who died in the Vietnam War but it's the secretary right are we turning the corner of it on this\nWell first of all there that's every year rights of the Vietnam War was the ten year war and to you know this is every year we're losing the entire Vietnam War a and so I think it's it's such an unmitigated disaster at this point that um he's right to point at a at a plateau but um if we're waiting for\nAmerica to fix it spiritual ... before we can see a change in the opioid crisis than we are being derelict in our duties and I do hope that there are politicians and community leaders they want to wrestle with\nUnemployment and people's sense of value in their lives and communities but if you're a a a mayor like marijuana burger here in Burlington or a chief of police um you know get down to brass tacks there were things we can do today right now besides lowering the unemployment rate that will save lives and\nUh I'd like to think bad for being so candid about them as well I mean it's getting the right treatment out there it's getting medication to the people who need\nThe medication the Twenty one day apps and in space detox is called the spin dry by a lot of the people addicted to opioids in Vermont because you just go for your Twenty one day ... and what it does as you get to the judge off your back and get your mom off your back\nAnd then you just go quietly back to your home and you start using opioids again that is not about hope and despair in America that's about sound public health policies\nThat can you just take one moment and describe for us what opioids just briefly what opioids due to the brain why are they so dangerous\nYeah so um once you get addicted to these drugs it's it's\nMajor funding for on green is provided by Geico

addiction they stopped seeing her and what a loss for them because Matty was hilarious and warm and fearless and resilient\nWhat made you decide you in your tribute to to talk so expressly and and uh directly about her to her addiction itself\nYou know it honestly didn't even occur to me not to talk about that like I said it was\nFind her but it defined a lot of how she lived her life she was you know in the times that she was in sobriety she was struggling to stay there and when she wasn't in sobriety she was living in a lot of darkness so I wanted her\nObituary reflect both the love and the light that she brought into the world and also the darkness that she and so many people experience as a result of this disease\nMadeleine length mirrors family are always said she loved music that she was born former ... singing voice so beautiful would stop people on the street or as as as he wrote in her obituary uh when she shared her voice she shared her light I'd like to play a little clip of

radio\nI'm Talking with Kate O'Neill who wrote a string of Detroit for her sister who passed away after spending more than a decade struggling with addiction and Brandon don't pose the chief of police in Burlington, Vermont a jeep composer you've called this when the priorities of your time they're directed that way by the mayor of Burlington what steps have you taken their\nSo one of the things we realized right away the mayor and eyes that we couldn't just take a policing approach and if you're wondering why chief of police got this job of addressing the opioid crisis because most\nAmerican cities um don't have the department of health right where either relying on county government which we don't have much of an Vermont or state government to\nProvide a solution but at the end of the day it's local governments and their collaborations with hospitals and addiction services providers that have to uh come up with an answer to turn the tide it's the number one source of accidental death in our society today period no matter how you cut it um [noise]\nWhat we did was learn about opioid addiction and one of the things we came away with is that although it's an imperfect solution that unlike crystal meth or on my crack cocaine other drugs there are medicines that interrupt the cravings and withdrawal and the urges the human body for heroin and fentanyl\nAre that don't exist for these other drugs and they're like a cage said you've been orphaned methadone there's a lot of stigma around um\nYou know just the the idea of medication assisted treatment but period it saves lives uh the evidence is irrefutable and otherwise I won't get us out of the spiritual Malaysia that some people see leads to drug addiction it will lower the mortality rate we can take a deep breath and we could move forward so [noise]\nUh with the mayor directed is that we do everything we can to get every opportunity to put people into medication assisted therapy or as of late at our needle exchange if you were to walk in to get some clean syringes and say I'm not ready for treatment but you want to try some of the medication\nOr you'll get a prescription for it and their prescriptions written by a doctor or a doctor who lost his son to a opioid overdose um if you go to our emergency department with an overdose instead of just being made conscious again and being\nKicked out the door hey we saved your life but you still have the problem which is what happens in nearly every emergency department in America\nYou can get a prescription for buprenorphine and Seventy two hour appointment with an addiction psychiatrist that's a new pilot\nAnd we worked very hard in Vermont a familiar Merle Weinberger up to Governor Scott to get legislation in place\nThat mandates medication assisted therapy for every prisoner a and our prison system who needs it and I'll say briefly that if you look at that a model in Rhode Island which made a commitment to get him getting every prisoner in his prison system who needs it the right medication the right time they reduced post incarcerate of\nOverdose deaths by sixty two percent by two thirds in fact there down in Rhode Island twelve percent as of last year an overdose deaths two thirds of that reduction two thirds of the twelve percent eight percent of it is just due to what they've done in their prisons and in Vermont where we're trying all these things ah and hopefully they'll turn the tide\nUm kitten O'Neill with this of helped a Matty and people like her\nI mean\nI Believe that would not stand incarcerated multiple times and never received medication assisted treatment while in prison [noise] um you know I think Burlington it's an incredibly\nThink it could lead the country in responding to this um but you know the fact\nThat it is a law enforcement issue is a problem that it's being treated that way this is a public health issues so if if it's if it's being ... you know our jails are the biggest opportunities for rehabilitation in this country right now\nAnd we need to act on that but it needs to we need to step back this is a public health issue and from our again is doing a great job and I think a lot of these measures would have been helpful\nTreatment is still a huge issue in a lot of rural states you know where this this epidemic is occurring you know you have to drive hours to get there but if you don't have a car you know um and then the programs are Twenty one day twenty eight day off an abstinence based programs you know so there's a lot of issues than I Do think that\nBurlington and you know I'm cheap to apologize ... will be leading this and I appreciate that but I'm more needs to be done\nI just want to be clear when you talk about absent space which is another way of describing some of the things like twelve step you're saying that's not actually always helpful folks right I mean because in popular culture for people who don't struggled addiction they may think well that that's going to get them on a good path or it's it's it's easily enough done\nYeah I think you know\nI'm brand and just referred to this is a lot of stigma around medication assisted treatment and my family were not he was first starting to get clean had the idea well if you're taking that the donor if you're taking the pronouncing lay you're not really create clean or not so far right\nWhich is just you know there's so much evidence that show that these treatments are the most effective way to treat this disease and sell denying people access or making it difficult for them to have access to it\nYou know I'm I think you know if you\nIf you have an issue where you have diabetes we don't say to people you know like you can't have this drought that would help you get better and we make it difficult for people to get this drug on that would make them get better and there's stigma around that within the recovery community which I think is hard to\nGet it out like if you please please go ahead please no I I I think it's important to even be more categorical about what could a saying if we stick to an abstinence based plan to help our way out of the opioid crisis we are headed\nFor or mitigate a disaster um if somebody is is hell bent on being obstinate were behind them every step of the way clinically if you look at the public health research in the medical research abstinence fails well over Ninety percent of the time as an intervention\nIt's the medicines that we have available to us that reduce or the these bad outcomes I have a friend of my old town in the Hudson Valley who I did not know for years was a a recovering heroin addict\nI used to play with his kids we used to go to social events together and when I started doing this line of work you said Brandon\nI've been on buprenorphine for a decade now\nAnd it's the only reason why I'm healthy and alive and that's not I know that's an anecdote but um\nIf you just look at the success rates if anybody spent a few minutes looking at the success rates for abstinence versus the success rates for medicine when it comes to addiction there's no question an abstinence as a population level interventions reduced mortality\nIs a losing proposition and we need to make these medicines available and we need to overcome the stigma that surrounds taking medicine to\nWrite yourself because we don't have that stigma when we recovered from HIV we give someone the AIDS cocktail we don't have that stigma as Kate said when somebody has to take diabetes medicine for the rest of their life\nYou know we've been getting fascinating and stronger response from listeners or as as the show's been going on one poll Norton says addictions like a cancer when does not choose to have either he posted on our website argues me on her Facebook page\nAnd an wrote addiction is a lifelong bite of a disease that few respect or relies can't be cured by jailer combination only love respect understanding and radical forgiveness and patients can cure it or another comments on our website a under the name near as nine wrote I've had a cute chronic pain for over ten years opioids have kept me alive\nThey're the only reason I haven't killed myself do the endless horrible pain these drugs keep it at least at the level where I can read watch TV et cetera and get some website\nI've tried so many non drug treatments and non opioid drugs but uh nothing or have helped I I Will point out that we do have a information on sites for dealing with addiction and also questions of dealing with a so farmers suicidal thoughts on our website it on point\nA radio you can Google for that I Want to take a call now from Norwich, Connecticut\nNow dear uh go ahead please\nOr how you doing okay let me

three eight to five five ... hundred forty three talk\nYou can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio\nI'm Talking with Burlington, Vermont police chief Brandon don't pose a ... she's the author and journalist whose latest book is titled ... dealers doctors and the drug company that addicted America I Want to start with a couple of calls they're kind of flooding in and like to take a call first from Gita a calling in from hartsville South Carolina thanks for joining us\nHi thank you for taking my call\nUh-huh I wanted to hear a little bit I'm Sorry I just want to hear\nWhat your thoughts were about all this well I'm I'm a recovering addict and I think an addict ever is here\nBecause I think for mental work hard wired differently than normal people you know our one Tylenol and they'd be good for somebody I five would be great for me um I went from\nI hated pain medicine until I had um oral surgery and they gave me opiates and all of a sudden I wasn't allowed I thought this was happening I kidneys and then they gave me I think drugs um and and that was even better I was like God heaven and are\nYou know and then they turn English back out into the prescription and then I said you know and then you're you're out there on your own with your body meaning for more of what you can't yet and you'll do just about anything you can to get what you need\nMhm thank you for that jaded we've also had a call from Boston, Massachusetts Tom you're on the air go ahead\nBarry how you're doing okay I think the police chief from\nVermont is right on but I I got to tell you if the drug companies that were providing the medicated assisted medication we're pushing that drug as hot as\nPer do chemicals push the uh actually caught and we wouldn't have a problem right now and because the medication has effect of I I'm a recovering addict and I'm also a treatment provider and I've been doing it for twenty eight years\nAnd I've never seen anything like what are you know the last ... you\nKnow the the uh pharmaceuticals were bad enough but now that they're pulling back from the pharmaceutical ... is a flooded throughout the addiction to heroin belt in Massachusetts anyway and so what I'm seeing I'm seeing people that are stabilized on\nA on a medication\nAnd then what happens is the third for off and then they relapse died because there's no just plain relapses anymore it's just a\nGreat day to get a shot up front and all of the they get the uh the uh her thirties that are that are really a ... you know and they got a couple of them and they guy now my history I was incarcerated because of my opiates or to conduct\nAnd uh I relapsed that day I got out had been read today I'd be dead because to twenty percent of the population that are regularly proven that have a addictive um heroin histories died within the first ah two weeks because of an overdose so\nWe're talking with Tom let me let me let the folks here here weigh in on this but thank you for sharing boost your personal experience and also your expertise on this but maybe I won't let you weigh in on a couple of things first you've heard the statement a few minutes ago that I read a from Purdue Pharma talking about how they are a an active part of the solution\nConstructively engaging to find ways to remedy this and not currently part of the problem or how does that fit in with your reporting on this\n[noise] well um\nSits in in that um you know they've just uh have plans to create a new buprenorphine product which is great but if they really wanted to make\nA difference in America they could do as chief don't pose a and others in some of the states that are finally starting to push back their overdose deaths rates by a little bit and make it why\nWe now by what about the cheap and what's happening in Vermont is that's really unusual I mean my ... is just off to him but in state where are we were very slow to pass Medicaid we just passed it in Virginia became the thirty third recently I mean we have we have already\nTalking forget that you're talking about Medicaid expansion right\nYeah I'm Sorry yeah Medicaid expansion I mean we have waiting lists that range from three weeks to two years to get into MIT program we have no funneling from our ERs into MIT programs\nI'm In my city in Roanoke, Virginia we have a police chief that's come out against syringe exchange so nowhere for somebody to go we don't have any treatment in our jails\nAnd um you know it it shouldn't be geographic it shouldn't be the luck of where you live\nUh whether you get this lifesaving treatment or not\nBut we we have a a a listener who wrote on line she wrote I Believe the opioid crisis is a reflection of American culture to seize of despair our culture is money driven their lack of opportunities for the majority of Americans in your book it seems to me that one of the themes that comes out is sort of the\nConstriction of opportunities for Americans particularly in the rust belt in an apple each uh\nUh you know stretching from the you know the American\nSouth east up to the northeast a ... in industries where they once could rely on study jobs\nExactly and that's where you know the crisis first erupted in these distress rural communities where the jobs were closing at the same time this pain is a vital signs was being pushed to ... what we really need our policies to address the root causes which are mental health issues and\nSo ... socio economic despair I mean there's a kid in my book who's interviewed a or one of his teachers asked him in middle school when you want to be when he grows when you grow up\nAnd he says I Want to be a draw or she goes oh you want to be an artist\nAnd he goes no I Want to be a draw I Want to draw Social Security disability because that was the only thing he can imagine 'cause that's what he saw around\nHim in Lee county which I write about in the book uh it's hard it's hard to central at ... opioids were prescribe three hundred six hundred percent that the ... of the national average and there are fifty seven percent of men who are working age there who are unemployed\nRecently the president has talked about the mobilization of the federal government to address the crisis on Tuesday health and Human Services secretary Alex aides are said to us it's starting to turn the corner on this epidemic as you cited figure showing a to point eight percent dip in over deaths from September twenty Seventeen to march twenty Eighteen according\nTo provisional data from the CDC the seemingly relentless trend of rising overdose deaths seems to finally be benefiting in the right direction\nPlus telling it such a high level is hardly an opportunity to declare victory but the concerted efforts of communities across America are beginning to turn the tide\nBritain don't pose a you know the number of Americans dying from opioids are related deaths appears to be a just under the number of Americans in total who died and the Vietnam War but it's the secretary right are we turning the corner of it on this\nWell first of all there that's every year rights of the Vietnam War was a ten year war into you know this is every year we're losing the entire Vietnam War a and so I think it's it's such an unmitigated disaster at this point that um he's right to point at a at a potato but um if we're waiting for\nAmerica to fix it spiritual Malaysia's before we can see a change in the opioid crisis than we are being derelict in our duty is and I do hope that there are politicians and community leaders they want to wrestle with\nUnemployment and people's sense of value in their lives and communities but if you're a a a mayor like mayor Weinberger here in Burlington or a chief of police um you know get down to brass tacks there are things we can do today right now besides lowering the unemployment rate that will save lives and\nI'd like to think that for being so candid about them as well I mean it's getting the right treatment out there it's getting medication to the people who need\nThe medication the Twenty one day apps and in space detox is called the spin dry by a lot of the people addicted to opioids in Vermont because you just go for your Twenty one day span dry what it does is it gets to the judge off your back and get your mom off your back\nAnd then you just go quietly back to your home and you start using opioids again that is not about hope and despair and America that's about sound public health policies Beth\nCan you just take one moment and describe for us what opioids just briefly what opioids due to the brain why are they so dangerous\nYeah so um once you get addicted to these drugs it's it's", "year": "2018",
