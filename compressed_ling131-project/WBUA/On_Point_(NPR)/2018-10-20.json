[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThat talk in the movie felt incredibly intimate and personal to me on viewing how close was that just a to a talk that you either received or given yeah\nYou know that's something that I experienced very young they came from the various ah family members my father had a very young age I remember around\nA leash about eleven ten years old um Milwaukee, Wisconsin that's where I grew up as a young kid um um it was the ideal of really trying to make me aware of the issues that they came through you know living in Milwaukee to an M. L. K. riots in Detroit as well\nUm is should the ideal of how to use survive how do you know how to act and how to conduct yourself around a police officer\nFor me it was always about ideal of beating cars you know having to music down especially when I turned sixteen ... that that talk came back up for me because I was learning how to drive you know music always down always looking at cop straight in the face always being very calm keeping your hands where they can be able to see it\nBut this is an everyday occurrence in and the humidity especially in the you know African American community where most people are dealing with the birds and the bees\nWere having a talk and learning how to conduct yourself around a police officer\nYou've made this movie based on the bestselling book the

we're talking to young activists about the new film the heat you give out for a wide released today and also what it means to be a young African American in America today we want you to join in what aspects of the quarter family story resonate in your own life your own community\nWhere one hundred forty three to five five ... hundred for two three talk\nYou can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook and on point radio\nWe just heard from Georgetown junior he's the director of the movie he told us about the importance of listening and he also said to us it starts with young people\nWhile we get to hear from a panel of three young activists from across the country right now first uh joining me from Chicago is ... and a Seventeen year old senior at ten would academy she's a member an organizer with good kids mad city\nAn advocacy organization that includes young people from Baltimore Chicago we're working to end violence in their cities or we should welcome don't point Hi David thank you for having me and joining us from New York is dimitrius downward use\nA Seventeen year old senior at Washington Heights expeditionary learning school a member of million ... movement for justice that's an organization that trains leaders to fight against end end anti black racism and systemic violence dimitrius walking on point\nHow do you think you're from and also joining us from Franklin Wisconsin is Taylor Hi and uh she's a sixteen year old junior Franklin high school or just outside Milwaukee she's a program coordinator at leaders igniting transformation Milwaukee a nonprofit organization led by use of color\nOr that organizes young people around issues related to political power and social racial and economic justice ... working on point\nHi David thank you for having\nCare first start or would you uh uh George ... from Milwaukee himself but what struck you about ah our conversation today\nUm I think one of the biggest things that struck me was talking about star code switching and I find that often for me because I Do I Do live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin by go to a like school out here in Franklin Wisconsin\nSo can we just take a moment and I'd like to unpack that a bit for those folks who might not know about code switching is basically as a as I as I understand it you know basically switching how yet talking how you handle yourself if you're in different communities different neighborhoods how does it play out for you\nWell um so I I'll be going to NPs or not in the ... school in Milwaukee because that's where I live in but when I started as a freshman in high school I came over to Franklin high school and it was a whole new ballgame for me going from\nBeing around people all day who look and talk just like me now coming here to people who look completely different than me and had different lingo and different things and I have so\nI remembered my freshman year I Would still talk like normal or I Would still\nUse starting playing and people would not understand what I meant by things written word or I Would just feel different for talking less property than they did so I kinda get started teaching myself that when I'm at school I talk property values proper English and when I go home I'm able to talk\nHow I feel comfortable talking in youth slang that my family and friends I used to you\nKnow there's a scene in the movie a that goes that speaks directly to that a start Carter is a ... played by the actor Amanda Stern bird uh she lives to live she shuttling between garden heights are poor and mostly black neighborhood and Williamson which is an affluent mostly white a private prep school did she attends\nA in this scene at the start enters Williamson she explains that she also shuttles between two ... two different persona is\nGuiding heights in one world Williamson is another and I got to keep it separate so when I'm here I'm diversion too that means slipping a switch in my brain Williamson doesn't use like if a rapper was saying she doesn't even if my friends have\nPlaying makes them cool thing makes me but you know those two states can\nSay is that what you're talking about\nYes that is exactly what I'm referring to\nI Wonder ... you know you read uh uh uh the book as well if I'm not mistaken\nUm or these themes that kind of play out in your own life where you you you have to think about how you handle yourself because of the fact you're African American\nYeah I'm specifically to like my own past experiences I used to live in a suburban I was younger and so the transition from when I moved away to the city and how\nEverybody speaks them now you have to act as a completely different and so because of the areas of where I work at I definitely have to experience the idea of code switching because um\nIt's like you because you are black saying these words an acting like this makes you appear as it makes you appear as less educated than somebody else on your rallies people even though we don't\nKind of happened subconsciously because you never want to be like labeled as something like that and so I resonate with star a lot because when I had to switch back and forth between both rely mostly white communities and mostly populated was lacking me do these the way I spoke to the way I talk to address the way I act it was completely different I definitely can relate to the idea of code switching\nWhich are how much like how much of an extra burden is that walking around having to think consciously about how you present yourself or is that kind of similar to you know how teenagers have to figure out who they are going to be anyway\nUm I think it's definitely an extra burden that we have because for black people it's this idea of a double identity that we always have to face\nThis now\nDimitrius you want to go in there for ... you know what I'm Sorry okay go ahead ... ready to start a lead\nRate hikes [laughter] I um\nI definitely think that it's\nWay more harder for black person to find themselves because we're always faced with having to\nFight so many negative stereotypes it's already approaching this is the first place I think if you're somebody who doesn't grow up\nBeing educated on history of our people and learn about how to really truly love yourself for being black and you're kind of just growing up in a world where if you're not hearing these things but you're hearing by people aren't educated they missed their that their head they will never learned blah blah blah blah blah it's kind of like\nSo what do I have to conform I substitute it seemed like I can make it so I think\nCode switching is definitely a burden for a lot of black people because it's especially a lot of young black people because we're not fully aware of ourselves yet and so when we're faced out trying to be ourselves but then also face on trying to please others it does become an extra burden because most other people won't have to go through that because they're already\nThe idea of perfection other people's eyes uh we are to be trusted you have a different\nTake on that um\nI agree on that a woman sort of situations like when I have like a job interview or something I'll put it on a voice\nLike not to be like a pill like a white voice ... but um you get back on ... back to me don't\nYou sure of course I actually ... what I did want to ask you about a little bit was you know we heard from a maverick who's the father\nOf a stark harder in the opening scene about how important was to be proud of being black in the same time he offered that in the context of the talk the talk about how a young black kids are boys and girls needed to handle themselves when they were dealing with law enforcement officials retreats did you ever receive a version of the talk like that\nUm yes ah recently to talk like that when I was younger\nSo how does lay out what was that like um it was this one night we me and my father\nWas like in the kitchen token they were just talking about driving and stuff and we got to the topic we're both police when we get pulled over and a reasonable I wanted to cause pull over like you always put his hands on the steering wheel Antonio I get older and like get a license to do that\nAnd like a few months back that happen like the cuts for those over and\nMy father to his hands on their way of so I've had my hands on dash or two it was kind of nervous 'cause like the videos administering seeing lately on social media about like the police brutality and like how graphic it can get\nA ... you know uh in Chicago obviously a there's a trial of the um the police officer who shot ... McDonald or he was found guilty that doesn't always happen or a police officer goes on trial for the shooting of want to start Carter's friends in in the movie the hatred given I'm not going to give away a plot point by saying how that plays out\nAh but at the same time you know that was a big deal for what happened in Chicago how was received a you know I mean among your family and friends\nUm it was received very positively um ever since the entire thing happened with the ... and so many Chicago activists organizations had been doing so much work for the cause family for those who are affected by police brutality and\nWhen we found out that Jason Van Dyke was going on trial and everything that's happening we were just so scared that it was going to happen again\nHarvard pilgrim

hearing from these students have their accounts affect the way you think about race in the U.S what are your experiences\nWere winning hundred for two three to five five ... hundred for two three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find them\nUs from Chicago is a ... a member an organizer with good kids mad city chaos Heinz she's program coordinator at leaders igniting transformation Milwaukee and dimitrius downward a member of a million ... movement for justice I first want to do to take a call from Tampa, Florida I'm Michael you're on the air\nYes sir um first of all hello and thanks for taking my call Yes sir\nI'm I'll get I'll give credit and and praised too that you for doing what they're doing but I'm uh fifty eight year old black man and this is nothing on America and I don't think it a ... matter of fact it seemed like it got worse the Seventy to be honest with you\nWhat's gotten worse and Michael\n... the the the racial profiling and the tension between races I mean\nLook we got we got Donald Trump elected that's the the the attitude and the mentality of where the state of mine is you know the police force was created to keep the Jim Crow laws in check and everything and that mentality and psychological profile is still on the fourth day\nThank you so much for your prospect Michael I appreciate it very much dimitrius downward you focus a lot in your group as I understand it on thinking about how to de escalate tensions with police there's there's a line in in the movie where\nStar Carter's a uncle who's on the police force basically\n... he's in her corner but at certain point he says to you know police face a lot of dangerous circumstances situations you've got to understand that how do you approach thinking about uh how how you deal with police are in this day and age and and the challenges they face as well as the the challenges that that you might face\nUm I think is worse but we need to respect for both both sides um when I was Thirteen I had to experience would stop and frisk and ... they have a lot of fear and the next two years I always had like fear for police can you tell me a bit about\nTo reach us can you tell me a little bit about what that incident with like\nOh it was like what happened it was scary I was walking around my block and I'll go and build into building trying to find a friend and then do it like these two policemen and following me so I started like kind of walking fast because that was kind of scary\nAnd um they called me around the corner and they start to check my ankle to see if I had drugs or anything and\nI had twenty dollars because at my parents and having to pockets and that was just shaking the whole time and they say well you scared I was like\nThis never happened to me before so the next two years every time a ... like Cruz by me I always like shake up though do\nYeah I mean it you know look I live in New York and have for a while and and it's been part of the the background of New York is that this this debate on a policy level of ... you know among people who make policies in laws about stop and frisk\nYou know is about this issue but it kinda takes away from the human element right like this is your acted not only your night but but how you thought about yourself out in public\nYes and um I think I have a solution for that uh-huh I think there should be like police officers\nIn the same neighborhood for years so it could start growing relationships with them and just not have a new police or say every month or week like we should start growing relationships because I noticed one police officer and he has the same idea and we're like\nWe have a conversation sometimes and think that that should happen they ship please please offices and the same neighborhood\nAnd there had been efforts to do that but it sounds as though it has an a you know taken root in a way that's been meaningful for you and your neighborhood nutrients yes yeah\nYou know there was an exclusive interview today that good morning America had with a Jeremiah Harvey he's a nine year old\nWho is a falsely accused of sexual assault a I Believe in Brooklyn New York uh when his backpack brushed up against a woman in the corner store or the woman Theresa Klein is white she called the police and has since apologized but Jeremiah and his mother told good morning America that lake lake dimitrius they can't shake the incident\nSo high because of how to break a long long long time [noise]\n[noise] [noise] not up for us how horrible\nAre you concerned that this has permanently scarred Jeremiah yes I certainly and\nIt was devastated by hand because even after walking away he was pointing to [noise] you know patrol cars on Flatbush Avenue and save money or they had to take you away from us [noise]\nCan't Heinz how much or is this idea of living while black uh uh uh we've heard instances where a man was stopped from entering his own home or apartment building in St Louis because a white resident there didn't trust him although he lived there as well how much does this affect kind of your your daily rhythms of your life\nI think it affects me heavily because it creates this constant fear that you walk around and you carry it creates when you when you drive you live out of you when you see a police officer ... and even though you're doing everything right you immediately think what am I doing wrong and I'm just to add I'm listening to the video\nBoy it very much reminding me of the situation with immaterial\nAnd how that affected him he immaterial had no idea what he had done wrong and nodded did a little boy that it just happened to and\nThey now he feels as if he did something wrong he feels as if he made a mistake or that you know something bad is going to happen to him as such a young age and now he's going to grow up and have that carrying around him so just\nGrowing up black and living up living in this type of situation create a constant um\nAmount of fear on you in a constant amount of worry anxiety as you've got to carry around because you just never know what it's going to happen or what a small move is gonna um how ... what was going to affect you it affect your life in the long run so\nYou're in the movie the heat you give start as I said earlier played by among Lester stern bird is a ... attends a mostly white school called Williamson prep a\nAfter her friend ... was killed in a traffic stop by a police officer some students take the opportunity to school to go to a protest in this clip that we'll hear star reviews for friends he always played by spring according to her\nI just don't know who he is such a ... class how start class it's a good cause them to be a really good shoes to come home\nReally don't want to hear messenger space that I knew\nTo your school how would you guys called book talk on the heat you give up what kinds of conversations are problems with your white classmates that sparked any any new thoughts\nUm actually I had two of them one my freshman year and then one maybe last week the first one that I had with my freshman class actually did sparked a conversation about what happened but it wasn't a I'm\nA growing conversation it was more so like my teacher talking and then people just kind of like one of the conversation to be over\nAnd then the one that I recently had um last week was kind of the same thing so none of them really sparked the major conversations um\nBased on what my teacher said to my classmates responding it just kind of made it awkward for me on my end because I noticed that as she was reading the book and talking about the situation everybody was kind of looking at me because I'm the only black student in the class\nAnd I'm In my school I'm known for talking about activism and police brutality so it just kind of both times kind of gave everyone kind of gave me the side I um it didn't really bring up any heavy conversation so\nSo what would hope so you have for the movie theaters\nI really hope that after watching the movie people understand the frustration that we have because there's a lot of people in my school and a lot of people that I Know in general who um I have a best friend and she is really big on activism as well\nUm and people look at us and they tell us that we are over\nBeing over dramatic that\nPolice officers are good that the person who was shot and killed shouldn't have done whatever they did um\nThat people now justifies a reason to die people tell us that we're being over dramatic were that were over thinking it or we need to let it go but I really hope that after seeing this movie and actually seeing this happens and seemed to have happen and\nLargest radio news from

I really appreciate markets all do you draw the connection between ah the president's remarks in Montana and what we've all been talking about the past ten days or so\nWell um it feels gross to talk about politics in the middle of this but since the midterms are a couple weeks away let's be honest that's the lens through which uh\nEveryone is going to be thinking and discussing every major issue between now and then and I think what Jake and John ah are talking about the last two callers is you know actually can give\n'em a really good reflection of some of the divide in this country right now about why they should care about this issue how much they care about this issue and and and and what is it are really mean a ... you know I mean the reasons why what happens to somebody who is\nA Saudi man living in the United states or with a contractual relationship from an American newspaper why should anybody care about that it's from a U.S perspective for two reasons number one is the U.S getting played President Trump\nJared Kushner have put all of really almost all of their eggs into the Saudi bask in terms of reinvention they had to deal with Iran\nOr who to do business with who to share power and intelligence with\nUh and uh it is this the right gambit and number two does the U.S still have I'm Still view itself as having a role in I'm\nTrying to send ... trying to send the right signals about human rights around the world why should the u._s. do this why should the U.S get involved in other people's business well\nAh because to promote democratic ideals and to uh to try to make 'em the rest of the world I'm the kind of place where it's also save to live and be a dissident express your views on to try to have\nWord around the world and and maybe morality is too big a word but but some sense of appropriate global behavior okay so\nUh why should every American care about that more than the economy or\nA more than health care or more than the tax cut debate well they probably don't which is what President Trump is betting on when he\nTries to energize a crowd in in Montana or about a domestic issue and he doesn't believe that uh it will will impact them negatively\nI mean ... how important we think this is geopolitical spaces journalistic bases the moral basis very few people are going to vote on a hundred percent but at the same time for briefly I Want to get at the question of do you think there is a direct line in the rhetoric from what the president says about the congressmen who just before his election assaulted American reporter for the guardian\nAnd pleaded guilty to that I Believe misdemeanor assault\nA convicted on that are and what he's counting singer was seemingly kind of hoping to tolerate happened from the hands of a a an allied from Saudi Arabia\nI'm not going to uh [noise]\nI'm just not in the position to make predictions about what the president's rent or the president's rhetoric in the United states uh it has caused this in any way or fuel this in any way but I Will say that um\nWhen when the president does make remarks suggesting that violence towards journalist is okay American journalists are concerned uniformly not just about the implications that has in the United states but about the implications that has another\nCountry's I'm One who played you know we should turn to the midterms is coming up quick I Want to play a clip of what the president had to say uh recently here that the the tenor of what he is set in trying to rally the Republican faithful\nAnd the base out at rallies in in sequence from Missouri West Virginia in Mississippi just in the past few weeks\nI'm not on the [noise] but I Am I\nVote for me I Want to send them on the balance it out in twenty eight gene because you are voting for me in twenty eight [noise]\nYou're voting for me but then again President Trump told the Associated Press and extensive interview this week he will uh be to blame if the Republicans were to lose the house in November Jack Beatty is Donald Trump on the ballot even if his name isn't there or is he not\nYou certainly is and he was right the first time I'm you know when you look at the election step back there really to elections going on one is in red states the senators and one swing districts house members in the Senate it looks like the ... the Republican chances according to a five thirty\nAnd maybe even gaining some seats\nAre the Democrats only one in five on the other hand you look at the house five and six chance that the Democrats will take the house one in six\nFor the for for the ... the Republicans holding on so that's quite remarkable for a sort of you know spread of two separate electorate two ... two kinds of elections going on and the elections are happening around the issue crucially of health care\nAnd marching an online platform used by fortune one hundred and five hundred companies to plan managed and execute work across teams in organizations marching work different [noise]\nThey are less than three weeks until the matrix but already some Democrats I thinking about another election twenty twenty\nSome people question my heritage and my family history one one thousand or a lot of the country of policy\nThey have no vote for president is November ... presidential politics are shaping your ... on the politics shelf and NPR that's tomorrow night at eight or nine point nine WB you are\nThis is on point I'm NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik I'm Talking about this past week in the news with Fernando ... he's a Washington correspondent for Univision Margaret ... senior White House correspondent for Bloomberg and on point news analyst Jack Beatty\nYou can join the conversation what stories caught your eye this week where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five ... hundred and forty three talk\nYou can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio a couple of listeners weighing in on line\nA Roger hunter at least a but listen posting on the name Roger Hunt posed a\nA that civility and the Democrats and the GOP is long gone the opposition is now the enemy hard to see during these a midterm election season what could bring us together or another one speaking about the question of what we are expecting President Trump to do a notes\nSays it's worth noting that President Carter's disastrous legacy including a strong emphasis on human rights which in part led to the overthrow the shot in Iran and its evolution to\nThe fifteenth century theocracy a as described there a couple of listeners weighing in I wanted to turn to another element of the midterm elections which is the question of turnout and particularly turnout Latino voters\nDemocrats talk about this a lot I think that in Texas they'd been speaking at the idea that bait or work would somehow benefit from that his\nHe is flew into a in Spanish appealing to Latino voters are are are said to be even though\nHis opponent Texas Senator Ted Cruz is of Cuban descent\nOr for nine to ... how important is a Latino turnout to\nDemocrats and how well are they doing it in trying to accomplish that\nTeen Latino turnout was very very low is twenty seven percent and twenty sixteen went up twenty percentage points um [noise]\nFew um has a pure research Hispanic trends came out this week with their with numbers on that too you know a vote this year they they are saying that there's a record uh they they estimate twenty nine million eligible Latino voters but the key word here is eligible not registered\nUm it's it's been low in talking about Texas there's a five point four million\nEligible voters and Latino voters in Texas are ... probably needs that but you know it's sometimes it's really hard to to define a if produces a\nAppeal to two Latino Republicans in Texas is is is strong enough um interestingly for instance the Univision just a interviewed a last week both candidates and\nAnd and ... did it as as oh she always does with Spanish language media didn't in Spanish or Ted Cruz didn't um he he never likes to talk in Spanish in public\nUh but I think it's very important to see what the what the turnout was going to be that traditionally it tends to be disappointing the national association of Latino elected officials which is an authority on on on the Latino vote as well\nWill come out next week would there a year I'm not yearly every two years um their their projection on the Latino vote we might get a clearer picture than but but this again and we'll we'll dependable hands on on the\nTurnout ah Fernando are there a couple of other races that you would point to is that in which you think that's going to be politically important\nWhile we have Florida a and I think Florida it's very interesting that much has been talked about um the influx of Puerto Ricans in Florida and we tend to think about it I I think that conventional wisdom tends to think about Hurricane Maria\nAnd all the people who who left Florida may be temporarily and who have I'm Sorry I left the island and settled in Florida\nI'm temporarily all over the country as well but mainly in Florida particularly in the Orlando area there's a story that I saw this week that nearly Seventy eight thousand Puerto Ricans have registered in Florida\nOr the question is and we and as I said before I mistakenly we tend to think of these\nPuerto Ricans I'm moving to Florida just as a consequence of Hurricane Maria but no that's not the case there's been a as a population train and Puerto Rico for the last three years or more since the fiscal crisis in the island had really\nLeaving and many of them have been settling\nIn in in Florida so we'll see what the difference is going to be particularly in the ... and the race for governor\nI'm In South Florida it's there's a different dynamic you know the the Latino bases well entrenched there there are been some changes of course demographic changes in some of those ... districts that are turning more democratic than than the than the Cuban Americans who would tend to vote more Republican\nHave wanted but there's I think still they have some safe seats in there but but it's the key vote for the Puerto Ricans would make may make a difference in other parts of the state\nDuring an interview with CBS this morning on Wednesday former Obama administration official in San Antonio mayor Julian Castro says he's concerned about Latino turnout in the midterms because numbers have shown that the rate is ... ... what he said is not what it should be\nI think what it's going to take the change that is that the caffeine to on a six months before an election or by any water to Canada it's it's gonna take folks investing in a massive and sustained effort to get all the angles registered and then the turnout servo a\nUntil that happens I don't think that the numbers are going to move a lot\nMargaret ... seems to be that almost every cycle we hear the importance of Latino voters in the idea there's going to be a surge but that there is a even if there's greater registration there's not a huge edition of of Latino voters what's your sense of all this\nI was really struck by one of your callers earlier actually left in the middle of this question not to be disrespectful them but because it resonated with me so much he said he was so frustrated by the company of\nDifferent narratives about what's really going on in the midterms and I think you know\nNot everybody is asking the right questions which is it's a midterm year are the Republicans who voted for Trump still as enthusiastic are they going to go out and vote for their\nCongressmen or will they turn you know what's the Latino vote going to be one about young voters typically\nIn the past is very low for young voters are they energized they say they're energized is actually going to turn out what about the non college women what about the college educated women and I you know I the the polling attempts to measure a snapshot in time but you could say something three weeks before an election and then just\nWake up that Tuesday Morning and say you know and that's what the term question has always been so these questions are really important the president and many Republicans\nHave a ... have at least been probably talking again about believing that things are swinging in their favor that Republicans could hold the house and\nAnd I think some Republicans see this caravan of Hondurans are who have been moving up through Guatemala and Mexico as something that could actually help them a ... having a counterintuitive thought so we have a lot in play here but\nUh the question really does when it's all said and done come down to what individual people do um either for absentee voting or in terms of going to the polls that day\nI Want to actually play a clip of a couple of a Honduran migrants who spoke to CNN this week there's ... mayor and I'm Andrea I layman they spoke to CNN this week about why they're making that track from Honduras towards the United states\nThere's much corruption here in Honduras we want to work there was no we want land to plant bananas plenty of being there isn't any brother we need to migrate to another country brother and the hospitals there is no security there's nothing or patients die brother\nWere heading to the United states we're going to arrive with Donald Trump he has to receive us\nUh you've heard their the voices of those migrants speaking through an interpreter is on on on CNN or Fernando ... wrote a vis a caravan it's obviously intended to create a tension or what are the repercussions of it\nThe repercussions can be many obviously we could have a second family separation policy as it was a suggested by the administration and reported last week that they are considering a new policy in which in a way that they would give somewhat of a\nVoluntary separation option to these families once they were detained but this is mostly right now in the works we we still do not know the details of this but if I may give some some context to this care of and I think there are some politics involved I mean you interview I've seen many of the interviews with people that are coming up and there is a true need\nTheir people to gaping their people looking for better jobs are people looking for safety people have been threatened\nUm there's violence in the in the countries of the northern triangle which are an Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador\nBut I Want to give some context of this this this caravan left some little Sula Honduras it day after last Saturday it day after a two day conference here in Washington at the state department\nHosted by the U.S and
