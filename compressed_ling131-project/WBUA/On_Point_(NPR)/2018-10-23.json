do you think he wanted to write this new book it's got a lot of life advice and crafted by Senate too\nWell especially now I think young people really do need a touchstone that could help navigate their journey or show really serves as that also with the stories of the queen to apply for this competition reality show they come from\nVaried backgrounds but they all have the struggle in common you know they were ostracized by their family or society and had to make a way ... had to\nSort of find the light a due to shine like lotus in the mud and in doing so they are teaching young people

repulsed drag race which recently finished its ... season on VH one\nRipples also author of the new book it's called ... and that's what we've been talking about here so far and recall I ... he took us really interesting place in just before the break here but I also am a little concerned that maybe like this interview is getting a little to NPR eighth I Want to own a Lebanon it a little bit with a moment\nFrom repulsed drag race here it is\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nThat is miss ... making her exit from season ten or in one of the ten thousand amenable moments that come out of ... drag race or how much fun as it to make that show\nOh my goodness that is so fun you know we produce the heck out of this show we put everything together then we add drag queens to them and then\nAbout how I already and soon but not only the the hilarity but the heart and the the courage it's so amazing and the stories that they tell uh it it turns it it turns what we've produced into something of legend and of mythology and magic\nYou can do about those stories I mean over the course of the ten seasons of drag racing for for folks who don't know actually I should let you explain for folks who don't know what the show is I mean how would you describe a drag races\nWell it's a competition reality show where we are looking for America's next drug superstar and we put the\nCompetitors through a series of challenges that are not unlike what my career has been I've done everything you could you name it in show business so the challenges are geared towards you know being a radio host or a TV producer a model or\nActing all those things and at the end the two competitors who are\nAt the bottom who get the least points have to lip sync for their lives and uh\nThey lip sync and or whoever does the best gets to stay and the one who doesn't have to leave the competition\nAnd he always remind them too don't bleep it up okay that's as close as I'm going to get to it on NPR here so I mean it is the ... the show's combines\nObviously just the the visual spectacular ness spectacularly already making up words now a of the drag queens the the the challenges that you just talked about the ... fund and the incredible ... I'm surprised that more of the the queens just don't have a nervous breakdown on our own every episode\nBut with each passing season we've also seen a lot more of their personal stories as well and I just wanted to play a little bit of a montage of three moments where we learned some very\nIncredible things are about some of these drag queens so sheer are those moments\nThey got me exercise because they thought I was ...\nI was so confused after the whole thing went down because [noise] was straight now [noise]\nI just wanted to say and I've been always so friends but [noise]\nI've been living with ... with a lot of my life of what's\nGoing to read from your going to find a group of friends are going to love you or you're not going to be lonely or more and more sort of where all the ... word comes from ... who are more jobs more\n[noise] lovely [noise] she didn't just getting better\nNew got\nThe well the three drag queens you heard there were ... bottom talking about ... having to undergo gay conversion therapy on China and the very first season of drag race revealing she was HIV positive and the last one there Kim chi talking to her younger self\nUh about the challenges that she faced in and a rip off I remember correctly ... parents didn't even know that she was on the show that she was a drag queen or even that she's gay right\nRight yeah you know that the the show challenges the contestants to\nFiguratively die and become reborn into their high yourself\nAnd when I look back on my own life I realized that the worst things that happen to me ended up being the best things that happen to me because I got to understand what real strength\nIs and what my own strength is and I think the people watching our show uh they get that and they they understand that at the core of our show it's about\nAnd how you are an extension of the power that created the whole universe you couldn't access that power at any time but what ... ... you know when you're pressed\nIn those horrible situations that these kids named when your press that's when that power comes out to anybody out there listening to us right now understand that what you're going through is part of a\nYour metamorphosis and and sometimes you don't want to and I see this even on our country right now which seems so divided in so ugly but I have to believe that out of this metamorphosis just like a butterfly this violent metamorphosis\nBeauty will emerge and that's what we watch it on our show every season after season we see these kids who have gone through a lot and they they emerge as great beauties and heroes\nYou know and and the thing about the show is that there's that intimacy and the challenges but ... as you said earlier there's also fun at the drag queen drama and just straight up laughing\nI really think we should give everyone a sense about how entertaining the show is so I Want to play a clip this is from season six and a regular feature where the queen's dressed as their favorite characters for ... spoof version of the comedy game show match game\nAre you ready to meet our SARS\nI see it\nEarth did you ever get him having a car today dress like that like a ... say

that's\nA scene from ... drag race a you heard drag queen Bianca Del Rio doing her judge Judy impression\nThe door Delano as Anna Nicole Smith in the show's version of the match game\nOkay look we've been talking a lot about drag race to show recall which is just one of the most recent things that you've been doing in your really long career and we've got a question that's come over Facebook for you\nPeople really want to know more about your early years in drag so Rob ... says please ask grew about his start in public access television in Atlanta\n[noise] [noise] well um I had been working for my brother in law for many years in his car business he used to flip\nA European cars and also American cars but expensive cars\nAnd uh I had I done you know I'm drama school and I'm performing arts school and all that but I was sort of hovering in it and when I was about twenty I saw a TV show in Atlanta\nOn public access so I wrote into the show\nAnd asked if I could be on and I what what attracted me to the show was a they felt like it was my tribe it was the tribe I had been looking for in fact it was the tried to I had knew existed because of watching public access ... from watching public television watching the Monty python's flying circus\nWhen I was about ten years old I knew\nThat's my tried so I'm ... years later I I saw public access in in Atlanta and a man named Dick Richards\nWho um answered my letter and said come on come on the on the show and\nIt was off to the races for men because they indeed were ... they were my tribe and Dick Richards are put out my first records on his label and uh he was a mentor to me that a a really kicked off my career and I I wouldn't be here without without him\nSpecifically when you first started doing dragging me what was it that drag gave to you that you didn't have before\nWell first of all I always said you know you're born naked in the right to drive everyone in on this planet is doing drag so and then as a kid I

Charles Republican host and producer of the Emmy Award winning repulsed drag race of course\nWhich completed its tenth season just recently on VH one recall has a new book out as well it's called ... and if that weren't enough already in March of two thousand Eighteen a ripple became the first drag queen\nWalk of fame and Jane Fonda presented him with the honor\nI'm really honored to be here I looked down and I see the star that's going to go into this walk of fame but I think it should be at least three sides is bigger\nAny other star on the walk of fame because I don't think anyone else on the walk of fame has ever launched an industry group hall has a high and the glamour behind the drag queen is a man of great jabs incredible\nIntelligence compassion one member of our crew said that ... than that he sells his blood pressure drop when he was around them\nLet's Jane Fonda presenting ... Paul with his star and the Hollywood walk of fame in March of two thousand Eighteen now recalled Jane Fonda also writes the uh the introduction for your new book ... so so what's the connection to her\nWell you know I'm actually I'm I'm actually choked up hearing that a her say those things so lovely you know I I've always admired her in fact when\nWhen she showed up on the cover of life magazine in March of of Nineteen sixty eight at our house\nI remember a stimulating the post on the cover of that life magazine she's uh she's on the cover as as Barbara ... and it was a pivotal point for me because I thought so much beauty so much strength uh\nAnd then I ... fifty years\nTo probably to the day she gave me the star she presented me with the star in the Hollywood walk of fame but I've always admired her just because of how many lives that woman has been able to fit into one lifetime and not coming to this planet I always felt like the boy who fell to earth\nAh that was always my goal and that's why drag or shape shifting or wearing all these different hats in show business has always been my goal and I've always looked up to her for that but um before that I guess did on her show grace and Frankie a\nAnd a with a Lily Tomlin and it was absolutely beautiful and that's coming up on the next season ... yeah\nWell you know we told folks over social media that we were going to be talking to you are today and we've got so many questions from them that I I don't want to give them short shrift you mind if I ask you some of the questions that we got sent to us here\nI don't mind if you don't mind me saying I don't want to answer that [laughter] 'cause you don't lose it you know people have a lot of ideas and that's that's cute but uh you know\nWe'll see okay see we got okay how about this how about a ... okay how does that this is a pretty easy one how about this what Dan church wants to know that he'd be interested to know what the change in the audience for a drag race with more teens and young people watching has influence how you conceive and produce the show\nNo it hasn't you know our goal has always been to a to celebrate the art of drag and the art of the people behind drag and and tell their stories because it's it's it's a very unique person\nAnd personality who's able to ah ah change themselves and and to die voluntarily die and become reborn into another\nIncredible image of their own imagination there's something very very important there so uh know what happens is we produce the show and then we add the queens who were different every year every season and it takes on a a life of its own\nSo we've got a couple of questions here from folks who want to know how the mainstreaming of drag or in part driven by the success of the show\nMay may have a change of the community itself that's because under son she wants to know that and someone calling themselves Django James uh wants to know what's the best way to tackle the racial bias issues that have become more apparent and drag race fandom as the show becomes mainstream\nWell those are two big questions that the first one is drag will never be mainstream drag will never be mainstream because\nUh in our ego driven culture the idea of shape shifting which is what drag is I'm a ... will never take hold because the ego will not accept the idea of someone changing their identity\nWe're our whole culture is based on a density a consumer culture is there to sell beer and shampoo and they want to pinpoint who you are what you're buying habits are and what your belief system is\nAnd drag is the opposite of that drag says who now I'm this didn't oh now and not so drag will never be mainstream uh now um\nI'm with within the drag it what ... what happens is um we get a lot of young people who have ideas of of of their own right and they walk into our show as a viewer with different ideas um I I Believe the racial divide with our viewers has to do with\nUm the fact that a lot of young people they gravitate to what they know so a lot of the girls who are blonde and white on our show will have way more\nA social media followers than someone who is not blonde and wind\nSo that speaks to us as a culture as Americans as as a people on this Earth I'm a ... it has very little to do with\nOur show because our show I Believe we ... our show is the most diverse uh\nUh cashed in television we have we cast everybody in fact I think uh uh this past season without giving anything away\nWell yeah because I was going to I was going to be a good little team who gives a who we have on\nThe show um [noise] uh it's not a lot of white people [laughter]\n\nI'll just say that much [laughter] you have your token white folks with uh we've had some of them but listen\nYou know we we cast a show based on the criteria is one is charisma uniqueness nerve and talent that's how we cast the show if you got it Iran\nAnd they do okay so I just haven't been resisting asking you this question but I just have to know a [laughter] I'm a huge ... fan and and ... and all her fans are still wounded from the fact that\nThat that you drop her from the showing that in that great lip sync between her and ... and I just don't think she was just what happened there\nWell we we um first of all you need ... Angela is almost steals the ... the movie stars foreign she's in that movie and she does a great job in that but the truth is none of the girls are losers if you're on the show you're a winner\nOr even as you played the the the clip of misfit Angie she did one episode and became an international stuff [laughter] so you know um nobody loses if if you're on the show you're a winner\nOkay so that actually leads me to something else that I wanted to ask you about because\nThere's been a lot of media coverage of recalls drag race because it has become so popular has really uh elevated the careers of the drag queens who appear on the show to super stardom level as you said and I think it was in a big New York times article a while ago\nThat talked you know is there a risk in the dry and community a little bit between um the clean to get to be on on your show versus the many many many who don't because you know I've been reading that\nUh you know be when booking shows now folks are looking for a recall girls essentially who've been on the show and perhaps not looking very hardworking drag queens who who just haven't been on TV [noise]\nYeah well that that is the nature of show business and you know I I've been doing this for a long time um I've been in fashion I've been out fashion\nMajor funding from point is provided by Geico offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks or SUVs and providing twenty four seven customer service more information on auto insurance at ... dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven on him [noise]\nFrom WB or Boston and NPR I make the ... this is on point in town halls and congressional debates across the country one subject comes up more than any other health care democratic candidates are hitting the GOP hard for attempting to repeal the Affordable CARE Act\nRepublicans are trying to see me away from that saying on the campaign trail that they want to protect people with preexisting conditions\nEven though in Washington GOP leadership says that if they win a larger majority they will push for an Obamacare repeal again after the midterms so how will this play out at the ballot box I'm next on point healthcare the mid term and what voters really want\n[noise] live from NPR News in Washington ...

out in Arizona I'm obviously a very interesting Senate race going on out there between democratic congresswoman\nChristians cinema and Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally their vote both are running for Senate\nIn Arizona and this is a moment from last week's Senate debate in Phoenix\nThe reality is that Arizona is are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and Martha voted to take that protection in a way\nThat that is this a flat out lie again either just classic fear tactics if they turn on a TV all over the country right now the Democrats have nothing to run on and so they're choosing to play with fear I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions\nSo the first voice you heard there was democratic congresswoman a Christian cinema and the second voice was Republican congressman Martha mix Sally\nJonathan Cohn ... how is it possible that Martha mix Sally is saying that she voted to protect people with preexisting conditions when she like many many other Republicans\nVoted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act this is the blocks that I think a lot of a Congress people are finding themselves Republican Congress people are finding themselves and how are they trying to get out of that box\nSo the simple answer is that she's not telling the truth\nUm she's trying to whitewash a record and tell her tell voters she voted differently than she actually did the long answer is that the Affordable CARE Act the way it protects preexisting conditions I mean you can do it a bunch of different ways\nYou could for example set up a government health care plan and Justin role everybody um but if you want to work with private health insurance and you have to regulate the plants and it's hard because insurance companies have gotten very good\nUh they need to to survive financially they've gotten very good at forgot how not to cover bills from sick people and how not to take sick people on\nSo you have to tell the insurance companies that they have they can't deny coverage to somebody who has a pre existing condition but you also have to tell them that they can't charge more to people\nWho have pre existing conditions and you also have to tell them that they have to cover a full range of benefits they can't leave out the benefits that would make insurance useless to people with certain conditions and you have to tell them that by the way if someone if you accept someone even if they have a pre existing condition you actually have to cover that pre existing condition\nSo the problem with Republicans have done when confronted with this when they started to repeal the Affordable CARE Act last year and suddenly they realized that wait a minute people care about they not be happy with everything about the Affordable CARE Act a lot of people are angry about it but they liked that protection for pre existing conditions\nSo they put it in a line and there are in their bill that said okay we're going to protect people with preexisting conditions and we're going to stop\nOr insurance companies from denying coverage outright well that's fine but they left the door open to other mechanisms and so did other ... pretty much every effort you've seen\nBy Republicans whether it's the house repeal bill ... voted for whether it's the plan that Josh Hawley floats in op ed in St Louis what they all have in common is that they pick and choose one or two of these mechanisms but they leave the other loopholes open and I can promise you\nThose loopholes they will go they will seize on them and they will drive right through them and you basically have a system where at least in some states and for some people it's going to look a lot like the one of the old days where people who have cancer people who have diabetes aren't able to get the coverage than you\nDo man is ah I'm really interested to hear what you've heard from voters because I think it's easy to um rally around in popular provisions in the Affordable CARE Act like preexisting conditions as as as we've been talking about\nBut health care and this this country is so complicated that even when someone you know who's as well versed in it as Jonathan Cohn\nTries to explain what goes about explaining the you know the secondary and tertiary level issues that come with any of the proposals that we've heard over the past many years I mean is it is the debate on the campaign trail getting to to that level um that you're hearing in Missouri and if it does\nUm how are voters responding to that\nWell let me give you just a couple of quick example\nI've covered a lot of events rallies and so forth for Holly and McCaskill [noise] um I was at two in the last couple of weeks for Holly\nOkay at one in a very prominent um St Louis county suburb of one of the top Republican officials who I talked to before Holly began speaking was telling me about their child a had health issues they were concerned about the pre existing conditions\nAnd he collars Holly and ask them about it\nAnd says you know are you going to be able to do this we've got this lawsuit I mean this was and I'm just standing there listening to this and how he's giving the answer and I told your thing and there's other ways to do it doesn't have to be the Affordable CARE Act this officials seemed otherwise placate it he supported Holly on other issues [noise]\nFast forward a week later I met another event another part of the county big Republican rally no these are all Republican loyalists some woman\nAnd that is whispering to him after after he gave his speech and I went over and asked her what she asked him about what she's really big with him on several issues\nBut she was really concerned about pre existing conditions and she just wanted to know how he was going to do this now that intrigued me because you usually don't run across that especially at parties and events where this issue is just like on everybody's mind\nWhat will so did she then uh when she heard would've ... attorney general Holly had to say did she did she have confidence in his answer she believe him\nYes okay so So Jonathan Cohn that's this this is a perfect example because I I Want to know against because of the complications of health care um is it possible that no matter how hard Democrats hammer away at this because they have a congressional vote now that they can you know they can sort of pin to the G O P\nThat when a those same GOP candidates are saying well but there are alternative plans that can take care of all your concerns is that convincing enough to voters\nWell you know we'll see we'll see in November I'm I think it's a real concern the reality is as you said um as as President Trump said healthcare is very complicated it's easy to throw all this information out there and confuse people I Do think Democrats have one very important thing going for them which is\nPeople get lost in the weeds and you know they'll get confused and you know politicians say X or y but\nHealthcare is one of the dishes where I think instinctively you asked your average voter which party it probably ah is going to do more to protect your health your words like cares more about healthcare\nInstinctively people associate that with the Democrats now they made you know they may not like Obamacare they may be other thing about that I think Democrats raised taxes too much or you know too much regulation but you know at a fundamental level which is the party that tends to defend Medicare which is the party that has all you know has had presidents going back to Harry Truman\nFighting to help people get healthcare which you know whose name is on this law that for whatever its flaws you know people wanna keep nuts Obamacare So I think instinctively the default here is to favor Democrats if he gets confusing\nAnd this it all we have a we even have a Fox News pull the recent Fox News full from just a within the last week I think that found that forty nine percent of Americans believe that Democrats would do a better job on health care compared to thirty four percent who say Republicans would\nThat's absolutely right and historically that's been the trend you know if you look at the long term trends are Democrats you usually have an advantage on healthcare adept and you know and if you look at when it did you know it did after the Affordable CARE Act became ... after the implementation um but it's basically return to its normal level and I think\nDemocrats can draw on that reservoir of trust on the issue of health care and use that and I think that's why you see Republicans as desperate as they are and why you see\nJosh Holly and Martha ... and all these other Republicans you know trying to sort of pretend they voted for something that they did end or you know and and using other ways to try to get out of this because it's a big vulnerability\nI still wonder that when it comes to that moment of ah actually casting a vote filling in that bubble pulling the lever what have you [noise]\nAt that moment because you know the GOP is running on so many other issues that matter to a lot of voters we're hearing so much talk with a lot of talk about immigration and about jobs et cetera so\nLet's sort of our callers simply wouldn't get an answer to some of those questions were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk let's go to Michael who's calling from Chester County Maryland Michael you're on the air\nProvide advice for getting through the daily grind of owning a business more

antiquated laws that discriminated against racial minorities and for them to pay sold to be able to them\nI'm Audie Cornish concerns over voters depression him and the term this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News it's all things considered today from four to six thirty nine point nine WB you are\nThis is on point I'm making Chuck liberty we are talking about health care and the mid term elections and how much this one issue\nMaybe on voters' minds as they cast their ballots a in two thousand Eighteen I'm joined today by Joe ... political reporter for St Louis public radio Jonathan Cohn is also with us senior national correspondent at huff post covering see a healthcare social welfare and politics and let's go to the bones here because of Lance\nIs on the line he's calling from Antioch, Illinois Lance you're on the air\nOh I've been self employed for ah twenty eight years since Nineteen Ninety five and deal with this whole healthcare thing for many many years\nAnd I I actually had Blue Cross Blue Shield here in Illinois good insurance and I was able to pay as little as two hundred dollars ten years ago\nFor all for myself my wife and my daughter and then when Obama came into effect I could no longer buy that health insurance at all and if I Want to even get a policy even close to it it's ten times that amount\nSo to say that the Democrats have done a better job on health care for the self employed not so not so I Can't afford it or if they get a share ministry yeah ministry a type of a contract not live under Obamacare\nYeah Tennessee a quick question is are you eligible for any of the subsidies are that the Affordable CARE Act okay you're not\nYou don't know because people who are in what you call the middle class self employed people they don't make enough to\nGet the really fancy healthcare but they're stuck in the middle there still make too much to get any of the subsidy so I don't make too much to get any any type of welfare or anything else but I don't make enough to ah pay two thousand dollars a month for health care\nYeah Lance thank you for your call Jonathan Cohn ah this I think it's this is absolutely the other side of the major health care or challenges that we have in the United states it and the people like labs are right that\nThat we still have the problem the spiraling cost and that it the AC didn't cover everyone who needs assistance with health care so he wants to go back to the days where I actually I should probably should've asked him I'm not sure what he thinks about preexisting conditions but he wants to go back to a time where he can actually afford the premiums for certain kinds of plans\nYeah I mean this is the single biggest a failing problem shortcoming of the Affordable CARE Act\nUm you know if you go but you know the the the problem was in the old days insurance that was available only available to people in good health and it had lots of gaps in it frequently the people who have insurance were not aware of these gaps\nUntil they got sick but you know the prescription coverage might be partial\nThere whereas in your lifetime limit on policies on on on benefits that sort of thing um if you didn't get really sick you didn't notice if you did get really sick he got stuck with some really big bills they forgo care comes and says we're going to change that insurance has to be available to everybody has to cover\nYou know all the things that employer policy would cover and that made it more expensive so that they added these tax credits to help people afford it\nWell what happened was in a ... for people who are poor for or lower middle class into the middle class\nIt's worked out quite well for the most part I'm as income goes up though you get less financial assistance people are exposed to the full cost of these plans and uh your caller just now it sounds like one of those people who's now facing just on affordable health insurance\nAnd is looking for alternative so the question is how you deal with that do go backwards to the way it was do you just take away where do you say All right we need to give those people like your caller the same kind of access to coverage that people who were lower income have do you give them more subsidies to just create a you open up Medicare and Medicaid\nTo them these you know that is the fundamental debate a going forward isn't it\nIsn't the debate because I'm not actually sure I hear that conversation only here is to repeal replace or or preserve you know it'll be having a substantive debate in Washington or maybe even any of these congressional races about alternative next steps\nWill we're not having the context of this election because Republicans have power and and and for them it's a simple towards either keep what we have or go back to the way it was however you do hear on the Democratic side uh lots of talk about you know all the people were thinking about running for president they're all talking about everything from Medicaid\nIn Michigan a there's a list is like and I was talking about has said I favor letting people buy into Medicare if they can't\nAfford health insurance and of course there's Bernie Sanders\nAnd many other Democrats who say hey we need a single payer system so on the Democratic side this was a very active conversation that really breaking through the noise right now but I promise you that if Republicans or lose at least one house of Congress to repeal really comes off the table finally this is the conversation we're going to have leading into me when he twenty presidential election\nWell since we were talking about a premiums and the and the aspect of the healthcare system that the ... act\nDid not solve that cost issue came up at a Senate debate in Miami in Florida earlier this month and Florida Republican governor Rick Scott really railed against Democrats for failing to live up to promises that he said they made a under the Affordable CARE Act\nWhat they say premiums your cost per family is going to go down twenty five hundred dollars than almost doubled since ... copayments rough you unless your doctor now we know that was his ally the century you and who is your plan and we know that was a complete lie so if you look at the Affordable healthcare act what they said it was going to do didn't do it\nHow we have got to make sure we take care of people with preexisting condition\nOkay so that Florida Republican governor Rick Scott in in that same debate incumbent democratic Senator Bill Nelson really called out Scott for saying that he supports preexisting conditions\nI just heard the governor say that he favors the insurance for pre existing conditions exactly the opposite of what he has allowed the state of Florida to file suit to declare unconstitutional\nPre existing conditions protection that is in the law that is unconscionable\nThat's from an early October debate for the Florida Senate race let me just turned quickly now if I Can't read Epstein he's national political reporter for the wall Street Journal a and he's been traveling in various places across the country listening to what's going on in these congressional races and he joined us today from Washington read welcome to on point\nI make them so uh you know to Jonathan and Joe have been telling us a lot about what they're seeing and races that they've followed ... ... is the pattern that they laid out something that you've been witnessing on the campaign trail as well\nWell the thing to remember is that like for Democrats running in races all over the country up and down the ticket\nHealthcare is not just the the most important issue they're talking about for a lot of them it's really the only issue they're talking about but uh I was just in Nevada this weekend a writing about the Senate race there in Jacky Rosen a Democrat who's running is really pushed\nHealthcare and and the preexisting condition argument front and center in her campaign uh the the democratic superPAC that's backing her I a hundred percent of their ads on Facebook are attacking the Republican on preexisting conditions on health care and it's it's an issue that Democrats clearly think who's worked for them and as we've seen\nBy the way that Republicans have handled the preexisting condition question uh so many of them are now vowing to protect a pre existing ... previously protection\nPreexisting condition protections that they voted on some cases dozens of times to strip or that it's really a potent argument that both parties see as something that they need to be behind at this point\nOkay so uh so read Jonathan and Joe let's just talk for a second about I'm a ... which hit on it a little earlier but I Want to dig a little deeper into what is at least one of the latest GOP plans um that was introduced in late August ... senators and then a similar plan came up in the house called the\nUh it's named the insurance coverage for patients with preexisting conditions or act and it actually borrows words directly from the ... if I have this right saying that ensures quote may not establish rules for eligibility based on\nHealth status medical conditions claims experience or medical history but Jonathan Cohn I mean is that the exactly the same thing as the pre existing coverage that's currently under the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd it's the same phenomenon we've seen before where it has some of the pieces of the Affordable CARE Act but it leaves out others it leaves out the essential benefits\nA requirement for example which is a requirement that you have to cover things like mental health and that you have to have full prescription coverage and again insurance companies have gotten very good at manipulating those levers in ways that can make insurance either\nUnattractive or unusable to people who have serious medical conditions and don't forget that you know a ... you know we talk about pre existing conditions as if it's just these requirements on insurance companies but it's also the financial assistance that lets people by the insurance is also the expansion of Medicaid which covers millions of people many of whom have\nPreexisting conditions and the repeal plans that Republicans have voted for all undermined weekend eliminate both that or or or alter that funding for the subsidies and for the Medicaid expansion and so if you're just you know having this this this this Republican bill which by the way you know who knows if they could even

honesty into guns and we have a a excerpt of that book at our website on point radio dot org and and our gate and just just before the break you were telling us about your your first experience and\nIn Tulsa, Oklahoma a but there's so much detail that you write about the justice one experience we could spend the whole hour talking about it um but I but I Want to just kind of fast forward to the key moment here is that\nA is that Charles your your uh your one time father in law are uh he ended up actually buying you know I think ... isn't that right\nYeah and I think\nWhat people don't take from that is that where I'm from Oklahoma\nGuns or a way of life and not always for the reasons that we might think were the reasons that we might read about they are integral to the way that fathers get to know their son yeah\nAnd in some instances when you're much younger that father might buy you a twenty two rifles so you can\nGo on the Web it's a word you know squirrels or what have you and this was him doing something father at least for me which was I mean my first gun\n... what kind of gun was it like twenty six holiday Gluck ... why did you choose that one because I was interested in self defense\nAs much as any other part I merchant ship team leader but at that moment you know we're talking about curing we're talking about firing weapon we're talking about understanding what lethal force is we're talking about um the mechanics of self defense shooting up since the shooting a and we're talking about why\nSome people had been gun buying firearms in a even\nAs far back as twenty seven twenty twelve and what that meant that was where many of the conversations that I was having I was not having conversations about shooting better than any ugly I was having conversations about staying alive\nOkay so what was so what was these are conversations you're having with Charles yes yeah so what\nWas he telling you about why what was his his thoughts about why some people were buying firearms in twenty ten twenty eleven\nPeople want to protect what's there's people\nFeel that that is their right and and and it is I mean we have laws that say this\nAnd people are very very interested and letting everyone else no if you come over here you might not walk away and that for many is a deterrent uh-huh\n[noise] I I mean I guess one thing I was wondering is um you know or just before a un after President Obama was first elected we saw a a surgeon gun sales did that ever entered the conversations with you and Charles\nOh yeah and also when I approached this topic with other folks um it was always a question of how much ammunition might cost right in this state where you can buy ammunition sporting goods store you know like we have what are called I'm at the time or academy sports\nAnd you can walk in there and in by any real caliber of handgun ammunition and how much of it people would buy a relates to who's president\nSo for instance now there's this kind of a surplus and people can't really move firearms is as much as they could win a President Obama was in office because a lot of people still harbor to fear\nThat somehow the president was going to round up your guns and tried to take them from you or limit the kind of firearm that you might be able to buy so you should buy this kind of salt right for this kind of handgun a and those while you know\nThe dishes\nWere also real fears and I've always said this and I I Wish people would really take it to heart because I Do it does not matter\nIf what you believe isn't what someone else believes it matters that you believe that they believe it\nSo if someone tells you they're afraid take them at their word don't tell them to their face that they're wrong you're going to irritate them and make them mad\nNow make there for your your fear and then walk through it you know walk walk that out and that's where I was trying to take this conversation or even before you know I I even thought that I might entertain becoming that good with a pistol and I we get stymied mostly for the reasons that we've already spoken about\nYeah you know uh I was wondering if you might be able to read to us the section of the memoir where do you talk about uh the day that you got home\nOr or ... or what what you did after you got home with that new clock that Charles your father in law had had purchased for you could you read that part of the demand more to us\n[noise] yes ma'am it's got a lotta Oxford comments that um [noise] that day I got back\nBox set it on my bed and looked at it for some time I had an open did that the gun show I knew the gun inside the box and never been fired and I knew it was mine I didn't feel proud what I felt was something more like fear\nLike the fear I was taught to have for the God of the Old Testament the being who was so Marshall he drowned the planet cast out a favorite son and told her father to murder his son to prove his love\nFear the way I was taught to feel it as a black man trying to earn an education navigate among the police\nStay out of jail and stay alive I knew that the first time I lost respect for that pistol no larger than life just it could kill me we're getting me killed\nOpen the box and picked up the Gluck I was amazed at how intrude as it was the process of removing empty magazine putting it back and recognize slide was it really that easy\nA person with a gun tends to feel a lot like Superman with X ray vision laser site and hopes mash strength which is why telling that person to use those super powers will generally result in the person looking at you like your lunatic\nAppointed a gun at the blank white bedroom wall and my second storey apartment and squeezed feeling the hard click the trigger the soft tap the hammer in an empty chamber\nI put the gun back in its case knowing that next week the chamber would no longer be empty and that this bit of polymer plastic and metal would no longer be inexpensive paper wait what a weapon so lethal I Wish we could invent it\nIt's RJ young reading an excerpt of this new memoir let it bang a young black man's reluctant odyssey into guns\nAre gay I you know what if you could explain to folks who are listening to that that X or do you do you show this deep respect for the power of the weapon in your hands or some\nUh definitely conflicted feelings about having it at all so how is it that you got from that to being a certified NRA shooting instructor\n[noise] I got to a point in my journey that I wanted to answer one fundamental question that was present it to me over and over and over again as a truism the truism was\nA good guy with a gun is better than a bad guy with a gun\nAnd I put a question mark at the end of that statement\nAnd wanted to find out for myself if that was true and us began countless rounds and trips to the gun range to get good really really good like master Yoda on day go by this is how you use the force good\nYeah [noise] and and you did it\n... yeah yeah I did but use your heart rate when given ...\n[laughter] but you know I mean so the thing is is that you have\nYou just you you tell in the memoir and you're describing to us now how you know in order to connect with your ... your father in law and you're just owned passionate really throw yourself in understanding this culture that he's so much a part of the ... you become as you said like you you're pursuing a jet I Dream\nCom [noise]\n\nYou've been through a lot together\nWonderful memories going to the Cape your child's kindergarten graduation the trips to Vermont\nYou and your car that is it's been great maybe it's time to let go and get some new details\nIf you donate your old car to WVU are it'll have a new life supporting the

B. U. R. dot org slash cars thanks [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're speaking this hour with RJ young he's author of the new memoir let it bang a young black man's reluctant odyssey\nInto guns or an R. J. just before the break we heard Douglas Jefferson their vice president of the national African American gun association or I'm just what you thought of what he had to say that ... that there is a multi ... there were a bunch of reasons why the association was formed a protection to the the desire for self protection amongst\nAfrican Americans and he was also talking about trying to get the word out about\nA African Americans and gun history in America\nYeah and I got the profile dug for the book you know so that was cool and heard his voice in quite some time it's been on tape but that's that's the message messages there is a responsible way to use this there are folks like myself\nWho believe that they should be armed for self defense and there is the historical aspect of guns were taken from people who look like\nYou get to dismiss out of hand and I take that part a straight to the heart\n[noise] so I'm just wondering I [noise] I\nI hear Douglas Jefferson saying that a lot of African Americans maybe there is increasing interest in gun ownership because of the concern about self protection and perhaps the especially in recent years [noise] but our gee did you ever feel like you were actually\nPotentially making yourself less safe by carrying a weapon especially open carry because of the fact of\nImplicit bias or racism in America and I mean I'm dancing around the question but I cannot help but to think of what happened to Philando Castile who was a legal gun owner in America and disclose to an officer that he had a weapon and was shot dead\nIn that incident speech more to watch the in our age should have done in an opportunity for them to stand up for folks like keeping land or cash deal and like dumped Jefferson and the people for which that organization represents but in regard to me\nI'm going to help me man a magnet let me\nLet let me let me break it down a I Walk into studio right where I'm a member careless you shut up and I have on a Black Panther shirt got caught on it because that's what the movie's really about I have on a Black Panther hatch\nWhat kinda stand up I wear jumper genes I wear Jordan's I have locks that are rated up if I have a nine millimeter Gluck Seventeen on my hip\nThat ain't going to be the kind of thing that makes people at home and at ease and that has a lot to do with the way that I'm drafted also has a lot to do with my skin color believe it or not uh I Know people don't necessarily want to believe that but I still encounter rooms where I Am not welcome\nSo I don't get to go all round is if that doesn't matter but I also don't get to go around as if a gun in a room\nIs not bigger than any illicit you can walk in there you're not going to have an open and honest conversation with someone if you know that they have a firearm because that is the threat of hurting you because they don't like what you have to say and that's not correct and that's not right but it is true it is a fear\nSo in the course of getting really good with a firearm I'm also a journalist and I am asking questions and I'm looking at data and I'm looking at statistics and I'm thinking account of my own experience\nAnd what I come to find out is not only am I not safer I'm In more danger if I have a gun on my person if I have a gun within reach\nSome thinking about your former father in law Charles now did did you ever have did you ever tell them this that that the very same\nDesire for self protection that made it made him such a firearms enthusiast or even if he shared that desire you actually felt less safe a\n... because of the fact of race in America when you had the weapon then before you didn't is that something that he he he understood\nLater later as we continue to go through this and later as I had my credentials as I had a standing firm which do you\nHave to continue this discussion like we had spoken about I hadn't fired a gun but I also was able to outline this in the book with a use of force attorney here in Oklahoma and he had a similar discussion with a friend of his uh this attorney was white his friend is black and his friend who he was\nReally respect for four of and was Reverend about said hey man when I get pulled over and you get pulled over it's just different and I don't need you to tell me that it's not I don't need you to tell me that people should not\nJudge me by the color of my skin I Need you to recognize that it does happen and to support me in a way you can support me is to speak up for me and the rooms that I'm not in that I'm not allowed in that I might not ever walk into and I thought that was where I got to with Charles I could see that toward the end\nYeah [noise] well our Jay hang on here for just a second so many interesting people about this conversation uh or or about this issue I should say\nI Want to bring in one more voice Tiffany where joins us now she is joining us from Cincinnati, Ohio and she's founder of the brown girls project a group that offers makeup workshops and other activities for building self esteem and African American women and girls\nAnd she also organizes firearms training classes for African American women Tiffany where welcome to appoint\nHello hello hello thank you\nSo so how long have you been a gun owner and then teaching or organizing firearms classes\nI'm organizing the firearm classes and sad hunger only a couple of years I'm owning one for about a year\nOkay and so and before that ... guns in your family\nI'm not really a I have a grandfather from ... Georgia the hunt\nKnow he had an old shot gun that he kept in the house yet five daughter then two granddaughters and we knew that what that was but there\nWas a training interacting with it\nI see so what what uh what was the reason it took you to buy a gun\n[noise] um actually it it it was the new\nI don't want to say new but this heightened racial tense climate and the area that I live in um that made me say I need to be able to protect myself and as a single mother or be able to protect my children um during the Trump campaigning at\nMy children were very very\nUm tuned in to what was happening with how the newer politics and they were able to feel that the tensions riders well um and they were very concerned\nAnd when a Trump gotten off as my son who was Fifteen at the time was very emotional about it and he he was concerned\nNow what was going to happen to us people were being I'm feeling okay to be more aggressive to say things that they didn't say before\nWho are either they invade your your personal space and he'd heard all these stories what if somebody does something to us and him being you know I have a son or daughter and then it myself he's got well I have to protect you that and I'm like no way kid that's my job and then I thought about it like how would I really that that\nDo do you ... Hannah I'm ... I'm Sorry I didn't I didn't mean to interrupt there but do you really\nYou feel now they're having a gun has made you and your families safer\n[noise] um [noise] I still protect it I feel that if someone crosses my threshold I have something other than my fifth and iron to throw\n'em I feel that at night when my kids were coming home for extra curricular activities and the seasons change and it's gotten darker um if someone were to approach it I definitely feel like I'm I can handle myself and and make my kids safe\nYeah uh ... what do you what do you have to say the Tiffany 'cause I I I hear her and I hear\nThe voice to someone who feels that ah that the places that we usually look for protection and society\nGovernment law enforcement et cetera than our fellow citizens that there was a failure there which is why she felt like she she needed to to buy a firearm a to protect her and her kids\nThat perhaps a sense of society feeling us is also a reason why a lot of white gun owners buy a gun and it just to me feels I understand Tiffany's desire of course every parent wants to protect their child but it feels like we've we've all we're all feeling each other\nWe're turning to weapons as a means to means for protection\nI had this very discussion I'm with my girlfriend here recently who is in charge of a five year old and a three year old both girls and she's a single mom so yeah she's going to do everything in her power\nAnd streaming or W.

McCaskill most of the ads that she is paying for our about healthcare a she has been she conducted over fifty town halls over the last year and a half\nAnd it quickly became apparent that health care was a big issue she actually started focusing on it before many other Democrats elsewhere in the country jet I covered her first one about Eighteen months ago and that's when some of the started\nNow was a health care was the big issue for her or for voters engaging with her at these\nTown hall voters engaging with her and what were the very first one in April twenty Seventeen and it was brought up then and by the time I caught up with her at another one I'm a year ago in October twenty Seventeen that was a major major focus of\nMost of the people in the audience and these were open town halls these were just open to anybody not not particularly partisan and what what people say to her\nWell they were concerned uh because at that time if you recall on twenty Seventeen oh that's one of the votes were taking\nA in Washington about doing away with the Affordable CARE Act and while people have had issues with it ah people many of the public or we're getting concerned because a either they were getting their\nHealth care on the exchange or they were concerned about how it was going to affect\nA the coverage that they had one of the problems in Missouri out out of the urban areas in the rural areas we did not expand Medicaid and as a result in the last year a number of rural hospitals have closed\nThursday and friday sunshine in the mid forties\nAnd an orange there's headed our way for the weekend with rain and wind forties to new fifty degrees\nThis is not a void nine WVU are nobody be worn out or\nThere'll be the worst supporters include Geico protecting people and their vehicles for over Seventy five years guy could was proud to offer car insurance and more to Massachusetts drivers to\nAdditional information at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto the one eight hundred nine four seven a U T or in the chestnut hill school since the Eighteen sixties focusing on elementary letters each three through sixth grade open house Sunday November fourth T. C. H. S. dot org\n\nIs on point I'm making Chuck her body we're talking about health care in the mid term elections and how much people's attitudes in hopes for\nThe American health care system may influence their vote or in these midterm races which we can stay with Jonathan Cohn he's national is senior national correspondent at huff post covering healthcare social welfare politics man is also joined us Joe is political reporter for St Louis\nI play a little bit of tape for both of you here in terms of how this health care issue is playing out in Arizona I'm obviously a very interesting Senate race going on out there between democratic congresswoman\nChristians cinema and Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally their vote both are running for Senate in Arizona and this is a moment from last week's Senate debate in Phoenix\nThe reality is that Arizona is are worried about losing access to this critical coverage and Martha voted to take that protection way\nThat that is this a flat out lie again either just classic fear tactics if you turn on TV all over the country right now the Democrats have nothing to run on and so they're choosing to play with the air I voted to protect people with preexisting conditions\nSo the first voice you heard there was democratic congresswoman a Christian cinema and the second voice was Republican congresswoman Martha mix Sally\nJonathan Cohn ... how is it possible that Mars and mix Sally is saying that she voted to protect people with preexisting conditions when she like many many other Republicans\nVoted to repeal the Affordable CARE Act this is the blocks that I think a lot of a Congress people are finding themselves Republican Congress people who find themselves in how are they trying to get out of that box\nSo the simple answer is that she's not telling the truth\nUm she's trying to whitewash or record and tell her tell voters she voted differently than she actually did the long answer is this the Affordable CARE Act the way it protects preexisting conditions I mean you can do it a bunch of different ways\nYou could for example set up a government health care plan and Justin role everybody um but if you want to work with private health insurance and you have to regulate the plans and it's hard because insurance companies have gotten very good\nUh they need to to survive financially they've gotten very good of forgot how not to cover bills from sick people and how not to take sick people on\nSo you have to tell the insurance companies that they have they can't deny coverage to somebody who has a preexisting condition but you also have to tell them that they can't charge more to people who have pre existing conditions and you also have to tell them that they have to cover a full\nRange of benefits they can't leave out the benefits that would make insurance useless to people with certain conditions and you have to tell them\nThat by the way if someone if you accept someone even if they have a pre existing condition you actually have to cover that pre existing condition\nSo the problem with what Republicans have done when confronted with this when I started to repeal the Affordable CARE Act last year and suddenly they realized that wait a minute people care about they not be happy with everything about the Affordable CARE Act a lot of people are angry about it but they liked that protection for pre existing conditions\nSo they put it in a line and there are in their bill that said okay we're going to protect people with preexisting conditions and we're going to stop\nOr insurance companies from denying coverage outright well that's fine but they left the door open to other mechanisms and so did other ... pretty much every effort you've seen by Republicans whether it's the house repeal bill ... voted for whether it's the plan that Josh Hawley\nFloats in op ed in St Louis what they all have in common is that they pick and choose one or two of these mechanisms but they leave the other loopholes open and I can promise you because it's happened before that when insurance companies see those loopholes\nThey will go they will seize on them and they will drive right through them and you basically have a system where at least in some states and for some people it's going to look a lot like the one of the old days where people who have cancer people who have diabetes aren't able to get the coverage than you\nDo man is ah I'm really interested to hear what you've heard from voters because I think it's easy to um rally around in popular provisions in the Affordable CARE Act like preexisting conditions as as as we've been talking about\nThe health care and this this country is so complicated that even when someone you knew who says well versed in it as Jonathan Cohn\nTries to explain well goes about explaining the you know the secondary and tertiary level issues that come with any of the proposals that we've heard over the past many years I mean is it is the debate on the campaign trail getting to that level um that you're hearing in Missouri and if it does um how are voters responding to that\nWell let me give you just a couple of quick example\nI've covered a lot of events rallies and so forth for Holly and McCaskill [noise] um I was at two in the last couple of weeks for Holly\nOkay at one in a very prominent um St Louis county suburb of one of the top Republican officials who I talked to before highly began speaking was telling me about their child a had health issues they were concerned about the pre existing conditions\nAnd he collars Holly and asked them about it\nAnd says you know are you going to be able to do this we've got this lawsuit I mean this was and I'm just standing there listening to this\nAnd Holly's giving the answer and I told your thing and there's other ways to do it doesn't have to be the Affordable CARE Act this officials seemed otherwise placate it he supported Holly on other issues [noise] fast forward a week later I met another event another part of the county big Republican rally now these\nSome woman and that is whispering to him after after he gave his speech and I went over and asked her what she asked him about what she's really big with him on several issues\nBut she was really concerned about pre existing conditions and she just wanted to know how he was going to do this and that intrigued me because you usually don't run across that especially at parties and events where this issue is just like on everybody's mind\nWhat will so did she then uh when she heard would've ... attorney general how we had to say did she did she have confidence in his answer she believe him yes okay so So Jonathan Cohn that's this this is a perfect example because I I Want to know against because of the complications of healthcare\nUm it is it possible that no matter how hard Democrats hammer away at this because they have a congressional vote now that they can you know they can sort of pin to the G O P\nThat when a those seem GOP candidates are saying well but there are alternative plans that can take care of all your concerns is that convincing enough to voters\nWell you know we'll see we'll see in November I'm I think it's a real concern the reality is as you said um as as President Trump said healthcare is very complicated it's easy to throw all this information out there and confuse people I Do think Democrats have one very important thing going for them which is\nPeople get lost in the weeds and you know they'll get confused and you know pumps and say X or y but\nHealthcare is one of the dishes where I think instinctively\nYou ask your average voter which party it probably ah is going to do more to protect your house your words like cares more about healthcare\nInstinctively people associate that with the Democrats now they made you know they may not like Obamacare they may be other thing about that I'm using Democrats raised taxes too much or you know too much regulation but you know at a fundamental level which is the party that tends to defend Medicare which is the party that has all you know has had presidents going back to Harry Truman\nFighting to help people get healthcare which you know whose name is on this law that for whatever its flaws you know people wanna keep nuts Obama Care so I think instinctively the default here is to favor Democrats if he gets confusing\nAnd this is what we have a we even have a Fox News Paul recent Fox News full from just a ... within the last week I think that found that forty nine percent of Americans believe that Democrats would do a better job on health care compared to thirty four percent who say Republicans would\nThat's absolutely right and historically that's been the trend you know if you look at the long term trends are Democrats you usually have an advantage on healthcare a gift and you know there and if you look at when it did you know it did after the Affordable CARE Act became ... after the implementation um but it's basically return to its normal level and I think\nDemocrats can draw on that reservoir of trust on the issue of health care and use that and I think that's why you see Republicans as desperate as they are and why you see\nJosh Holly and Martha McSally and all these other Republicans you know trying to sort of pretend they voted for something that they didn't want to you know and and using or other ways to try to get as good as a big vulnerability\nBut I still wonder that when it comes to that moment of uh actually casting a vote filling in that bubble pulling the lever what have you how much health care will be on the minds of voters at that moment because you know the GOP is running on so many other issues that matter to a lot of voters we're hearing so much talk with a lot of talk about immigration and about jobs et cetera so\nLet's sort of our callers simply we can get an answer to some of those questions were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk let's go to Michael who's calling from Chester County Maryland Michael you're on the air\nAnd insurance

Democrats are doubling down on state races in Nevada the party is pushing to elect the first democratic governor in Twenty years\nAgo to return all the voters we've identified with but he's\nTheir candidate making convincing case wears them anyway how's how's it going to fix the on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News tomorrow morning at\nFive or Ninety point nine W. B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station\nDoes his own point I'm making Chuck liberty we are talking about health care in the mid term elections and how much this one issue\nMaybe on voters' minds as they cast their ballots in two thousand Eighteen I'm joined today by Joe ... political reporter for St Louis public radio Jonathan Cohn is also with us senior national correspondent at huff post covering the healthcare social welfare and politics and let's go to the phones here because of Lance\nIs on the line he's calling from ... Illinois last year on the air\nOh yeah I've been self employed for Twenty years since Nineteen Ninety five and deal with this whole healthcare thing for many many years\nAnd I I actually had Blue Cross Blue Shield here in Illinois good insurance and I was able to pay as little as two hundred dollars ten years ago\nFor all for myself my wife and my daughter and then when Obama came into effect I could no longer buy that health insurance at all and if I Want to even get a policy even close to it it's ten times that amount so [laughter]\nMy health care for the self employed not so not so I Can't afford it I have to share ministry yeah ministry type of a contract not live under Obamacare\nYeah Tennessee a quick question is are you eligible for any of the subsidies are that the Affordable CARE Act okay you're not\nYou know because people who are in what you call the middle class self employed people they don't make enough to\nGet the health care but they're stuck in the middle there still make too much to get any of the subsidy so I don't make too much to get any any type of welfare or anything else but I don't make enough to pay two thousand dollars a month for health care yeah\nLance thank you for your call Jonathan Cohn uh this I think is this is absolutely the other side of the major health care or challenges that we have ... in the United states it and the people like labs are right that\nThat we still have the problem was spiraling cost and that it the AC agent cover everyone who needs assistance with health care so he wants to go back to the days where I actually I should probably should've asked him I'm not sure what he thinks about preexisting conditions but he wants to go back to a time where he can actually afford the premiums for certain kinds of plans\nYeah I mean this is the single biggest\nA failing problem shortcoming of the Affordable CARE Act um you know if you go but you know the the problem was in the old days insurance that was available only available to people in good health and it had lots of gaps in it frequently the people who have insurance were not aware of these gaps\nUntil they got sick but you know the prescription coverage might be partial there whereas in your lifetime limit on policies on on on benefits that sort of thing um if you didn't get really sick you didn't notice if you get really sick he got stuck with some really big bill the Affordable CARE Act comes and says we're going to change all that insurance has to be available to everybody has to cover\nYou know all the things that employer policy would cover and that made it more expensive so that they added these tax credits to help people afford it\nWell what happened was in a ... for people who are poor or lower middle class into the middle class\nIt's worked out quite well for the most part I'm as income goes up though you get less financial assistance people are exposed to the full cost of these plans and uh your caller just now it sounds like one of those people who is now facing just on affordable health insurance\nAnd is looking for alternative so the question is how you deal with that do go backwards to the way it was do you just take away where do you say All right we need to give those people like your caller\nThe same kind of access to coverage that people who were lower income have do you give them more subsidies to just create you open up Medicare and Medicaid to them these uh you know that is the fundamental debate a going forward\nBut it isn't the debate because I'm not actually sure I hear that conversation only here is to repeal replace or or preserve it will be having a substantive debate in Washington or maybe even any of these congressional races about alternative next steps\nWhat we're not having the context of this election because Republicans have power and and and for them it's a simple traits either keep what we have or go back to the way it was however you do hear on the Democratic side\nUh lots of talk about you know all the people were thinking about running for president they're all talking about everything from Medicaid by and medic I mean this candidate up in Michigan a there's a list is like and I was talking about has said I favor letting people buy into Medicare if they can't\nAfford health insurance and of course there's Bernie Sanders\nAnd many other Democrats to say hey we need a single payer system so on the Democratic side this is a very active conversation that really breaking through the noise right now but I promise you that if Republicans or lose at least one house of Congress to repeal really comes off the table finally this is the conversation we're going to have leading intimate twenty twenty presidential election\nWell since we were talking about a premiums and the and the aspect of the healthcare system that the ... act\nDid not solve that cost issue came up at a Senate debate in Miami in Florida earlier this month and Florida Republican governor Rick Scott really railed against Democrats for failing to live up to promises that he said they made a under the Affordable CARE Act\nWhere they say bring him your cost per family going to go down twenty five hundred dollars almost doubled since ... co payments rough [noise] they send you wouldn't lose your doctor now we know that was his ally of the century you wouldn't lose your plan and we know that was a complete lie so if you look at the Affordable healthcare act what they said it was going to do didn't do it [noise]\nHow we have got to make sure we take care of people with preexisting condition\nOkay so that Florida Republican governor Rick Scott now in in that same debate incumbent democratic Senator Bill Nelson really called out Scott for saying that he supports preexisting conditions\nI just heard the governor say that he favors the insurance for pre existing conditions\nExactly the opposite of what he has allowed the state of Florida to file suit to declare unconstitutional pre existing conditions protection that is in the law that is unconscionable\nFrom an early October debate for the Florida Senate race let me just turned quickly now if I Can't you\nThe for the wall Street Journal a and he's been traveling in various places across the country\nListening to what's going on in these congressional races and he joined us today from Washington read welcome to on planes hiding them so uh you know to Jonathan and Joe have been telling us a lot about what they're seeing and racist that they've followed ... ... is a pattern that they laid out something that you've been witnessing on the campaign trail is well\nWell the thing to remember is that like for Democrats running\nIn races all over the country up and down the ticket healthcare is not just the the most important issue they're talking about for a lot of them it's really the only issue they're talking about but ah I was just in Nevada this weekend a writing about the Senate race there in Jacky Rosen the Democrat who's running is really pushed\nHealthcare and and the preexisting condition argument front and center in her campaign uh the the democratic superPAC that's backing her I a hundred percent of their ads on Facebook are attacking the Republican on preexisting conditions on health care and it's it's an issue that Democrats clearly think who's worked for them and as we've seen\nBy the way that Republicans have a handle the preexisting condition question are so many of them are now vowing to protect a pre existing ...\n... ... previously protection\nPreexisting condition protections that they voted on some cases dozens of times to strip or that it's really a potent argument that both parties see as something that they need to be behind at this point\nOkay so uh so read Jonathan and Joe let's just talk for a second about I'm a ... which hit on it a little earlier but I Want to dig a little deeper into what is at least one of the latest GOP plans um that was introduced in late August ... senators and then a similar plan came up in the house called the\nUh it's named the ensuring coverage for patients with preexisting conditions or act and it actually borrows words directly from the ... if I have this right saying that ensures quote may not establish rules for eligibility based on\nHealth status medical conditions claims experience or medical history but Jonathan Cohn I mean is that the exactly the same thing as the pre existing coverage that's currently under the Affordable CARE Act\nNo and it's the same phenomenon we've seen before where it has some of the pieces of the Affordable CARE Act but it leaves out others it leaves out the essential benefits\nA requirement for example which is a requirement that you have to cover things like mental health and that you have to have full prescription coverage and again insurance companies have gotten very good at manipulating those levers in ways that can make insurance either\nUnattractive or unusable to people who have serious medical conditions and don't forget that you know a ... you know we talk about preexisting conditions as if it's just these requirements on insurance companies but it's also the financial assistance that less people by the insurance is also the expansion of Medicaid which covers millions of people many of them have\nPreexisting conditions and the repeal plans that Republicans have voted for all undermined weekend eliminate most of that or or or alter that funding for the subsidies and for the Medicaid expansion and so if you're just you know having this this this this Republican bill which by the way you know who knows if they could even pass", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city":
