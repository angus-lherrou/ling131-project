two thousand twelve at Kansas Speedway but it was during a tire test but it's a pretty critical moment in your in your career can you tell us about what happened then\nYeah sure um you know most of the crashes that you're going to see on TV or see a race car driver KCUR\nOr I'm not going to be [noise] I'm\nExtremely dangerous to their health and there's a lot of precautions and things learned over the years to make the cars really safe and always felt that way when I was driving a car that I was in extremely safe environment and\nAway from harm but almost ... uh we were racing or we had a

... we're talking this hour with Dale Earnhardt junior he is a retired NASCAR driver or one of the most popular drivers in NASCAR history to time winner of the Daytona five hundred he retired with twenty six wins and the NASCAR cup series\nAnd he's the author of a new book it's titled racing to the finish my story and it's the story of all the concussions he suffered as a NASCAR driver what effect they had on his life and what he did to heal himself\nAnd why he's speaking out about concussions and NASCAR as well we've got an excerpt at our point radio dot org or not the deal before the break we were talking about that really hard hit that you took on the tire test in in twenty twelve or in Kansas\nAnd I want to play a little bit of sound of releasing this very significant race it happened not long after that at Talladega this is kind of the book and so the the big hits that you took\nThat scared me straight as you were saying I'm a little bit earlier so first of all let's listen to what happened in the last lap of the good Sam roadside assistance four hundred at the Talladega super speedway\nIn Alabama I'm there was a huge pack of cars there are in that last lap and here's what happened\nIn that last lap the cars are basically for deep they're going at two hundred miles an hour or if you haven't seen it or you don't remember it it's on YouTube and it is breathtaking to watch now here's Dale Earnhardt junior is over the radio conversation with his crew chief Steve tart right after just moments after that Talladega crash\nEverybody [noise] I don't know [noise] it's like a\nWell to deal tell us about that moment because I think it was after that are and how you felt after that that's what took you to go get help\nYeah so this was four weeks after the Kansas crashed that hit it or been so so terrible for me\nAnd I had been suffering with those symptoms for those four weeks and I finally started to feel like my old self again coming into Talladega that weekend so there was a big big sense of relief for me but there was also\nA sense of fear because at Talladega they have these big PACs our cars and when there are those type of crashes is they're they're impossible to skate so I knew the chances of me being involved in another accident and we're very happy for that particular weekend\nSo I was very nervous about that I all I wanted was just to be able to get through that race clean with no problems and I felt like I'd be home free\nAnd um get I got involved in that crash in ... and during a crash cart tee ball on the side of the car and spun the car around and I immediately went all the way back to having the symptoms that I had before and maybe even worse and so\nBut this is a different kind of injury the right because we were like whipped around yeah so the ... this was instead of a an impact you know direct impact this was a very quick fast spin\nAnd so I knew immediately something was wrong with me again and I was really angry about it a and very emotional an unusually emotional for some reason and you can hear that in the in the radio\nCommunication and uh that's something not typically probably wouldn't be having I wouldn't be really having that personal of a conversation over that radio because it's something that the entire team in ... all the fans can here and have access to\n'em but in those moments when you're injured and you're not really in control your emotions and your anxieties and all those things and so\nUm [noise] I ... I knew that drew my through reading about\nConcussions and hearing these stories so over the past five years you know there's just been so much coverage of concussions whether it's NFL players or what have you uh retired players they're just so much content out there so many stories and I can't [noise]\nUm I couldn't help myself from sort of absorbing some of that and and it frightened me you know so when I was and I learned and read about Larry layering concussions together and having concussions very close together in a very short period of time and right\nSo here I Am and I'm thinking man I'm really playing with fire I better take this seriously this could be something you know these these issues could become permanent that would be a awful to have to wake up every day with something um\nSomething couldn't correct well can I just I've been here for a second 'cause ... you really you write about in the book about how right after that that crashed that did that second hit at Talladega as you were saying like you were\n... more emotional less less restrained I mean NASCAR drivers have to be amongst the most ... emotionally controlled people in the world right when you're whirling around a track of two hundred miles an hour\nBut are you seeing the book that now I was just angry angry all the time that you drove your car back to the garage and ESPN had a TV camera there waiting on me\nBig pack of reporters wanting to ask you about the crash\nHe started talking in your eyes get why any volume picks up in your face starts turning red and here's what you said\nI Can't believe that everybody's no ... nobody festival enough to\nRealize just how ridiculous that was and that was ridiculous if it's what we did every week I wouldn't be doing it I'll just put it so you like that [noise]\nHis alley writes every week I'd find a job it's bloodthirsty if that's the way people live alone Lance ridiculous I don't even want to go day tell her doubting next year but I got much choice [noise] it's really not rice and I don't know it's just as it's old is pointing out at all when they lose like [noise]\nA lot of money right there is there's a lot of wasted I mean if\nThis race and that's how we're going to continue to rise and nothing's going to change I think that's our building cars so there's a lot of money\nDale Earnhardt junior how out of character was that for you [noise] I think it's\nPretty asked out of character just be that\nUm to be that aggressive I think was out of character for me\nAnd I could feel a mom oceans I'm In that moment you know sort of not knocking feel myself not being able to shut up you know not being able to buy my lip and and and keep those opinions to myself because they were going to do mean no good bye\nI'm sharing them and that in that environment and I did get some pushback from NASCAR about those comments to particularly the bloodthirsty comment and [noise]\nUm they weren't very happy with me and I know better than that you know I Know NASCAR well enough and and my intentions that is in my career had been to try to lift the sport up and be a great representative for the sport and then that moment I was not doing that and I couldn't control\nThat was the worst part about it in and um\nI could not control my emotions in and with that injury having just occurred and I dealt with that for the next you know forty eight hours a day trying to\nCalm down trying to make sense of what I was feeling I'm trying to figure out what I was going to do about it um and luckily I got pointed in the right direction to see\nA specialist in their surgeon to a that was local in Charlotte a doctor petty yeah and so that man got that right there was the saving grace for me because I don't know whether I Would have made the right decisions going forward to take care of myself had not been put in front of the right people\nYeah so we got a lot of college when I talk to you know when it gets it right just a second here but but but let me ask you mean the way you write about are the kind of hits you took we were talking about two big ones there but but also there's a lot of 'em and I'm putting smaller in quotes here has a NASCAR nothing's really small\nBut you know 'cause everything's going so fast I just wonder like how many of your fellow drivers have had concussions how often do you think drivers are behind the wheel\nOr you know in these races with their uh you know not at a hundred percent because of the effects of of getting hit in the head all the time\nI think it's very rare I actually do um I feel like that that crashed in two thousand twelve was an anomaly for me I\nFeel like that it was a um you know just a unique style of accident and impact that not a lot of drivers will experience in their career um for the for you know for the majority of my career I never you know\nPresenting Palestinian narratives of the M.

a top tier NASCAR driver a he's a two time winner of the Daytona five hundred Fifteen time winner of NASCAR most popular\nDriver award and a earlier in the hour we talk in detail about two concussions that he suffered in two thousand\nThe book Dale Earnhardt junior writes about how in Nineteen Ninety eight for example his car rolled in a race and his head hit the roll cages so hard that his helmet had put put a big dent into the bar that was in Nineteen Ninety eight crash\nAnd then in two thousand to April twenty eighth he crashed during the nap the auto parts five hundred at the California speedway infant panic California\nWaiting and we're talking with the rest of the personnel\nKnocked out of my writing job with the insanity ours a memory and rice and everything else\nGuy I think we've got the guy that's all it is\nYeah definitely that long pause that's what everyone hope that all it was but shortly before the September two thousand two protection won four hundred in Kansas City so several months after that Fontana crash a Earnhardt junior was interviewed about the concussion he had in California\nI made my own decision and a ... a man than in the car was the only thing that really could help me decide\nYou know exactly how bad the situation was or how long I needed to get better so I Know better next time I shouldn't have kept it a secret as much as I did but um [noise]\nYou know I didn't want to cause too much alarm because it really wasn't a serious I guess everybody has made it out to be\nDale Earnhardt junior back in two thousand two well joining us now is Michael Mickey Collins he's the director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical center sports medicine concussion program\nAnd he started treating Dale Earnhardt junior four concussions in two thousand twelve you also wrote the forward for a racing to the finish the new book Michael Mickey Collins welcome to on planes\nHigh magna or it's really great to have you because uh obviously as as Dale writes in the book you're real a key figure in his healing from the multiple concussions he suffered when he first came into your office\nI mean you treated thousands of of of folks and professional athletes knew what did you see when this NASCAR driver came to you\n[noise] well I've seen him shut deal twice um two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen and on both occasions you know the first time I saw Dale\nWe actually got Dale better pretty quickly from that\nAnd he did very well with our therapies a second time I saw Dale he was very sick uh with these issues that we commonly see with concussion and quite honestly\nI I didn't care as much about deal becoming a race car driver again I I Want a deal to become a human that felt normal and that was the first president for everything and\nAnd that just jump in here though because I mean the the the sickness that that he was suffering he he writes about so clearly in the book uh there was a vision problems balance problems uh all the all the things I hand eye coordination all those things that you need to be in control of the vehicle moving it two hundred miles an hour\nOr to be in control of life of life you know ... racing really wasn't it wasn't even on the radar uh initially saw Dale and and you know we really identified will learn a lot about\nConcussion and there's so much we learn now in terms of identifying where the average signals coming from and and matching the right treatment to the right problem and\nAnd we were able to do that with the L and kind of pinpoint what the problems were in and said I'm On a course of rehab that um that eventually got them better and and the deal is is doing great now and it's it's really nice to see\nYeah so uh let me call and I think one thing that surprised me about what the ... in the book is that you prescribed\nBoth times is very very specific specific regimen of exercises and other protocol essentially that would\nPush his brain to the limit of what it could tolerate at that time because I was under the impression that uh perhaps this is now very much out of date but the thought was that you should reduce cognitive load when brain is healing from from concussions\nI that's a common perception or misperception really of how we approach concussion treatment\nWe've actually identified now that there are six different types of concussions and there's some types of concussions were quote unquote rest or at least regulated rest it may be indicated\nBut in details profile of difficulties with the way you treat the problems that they all had is actually through ... training and so it depends on what type of concussion you have as to how we approach it whether it's a more active based approach or whether the rate you know regulation or whatnot but\nYou have to you need to go to a clinician that can identify again where's the average single coming from and then and then matched the right tribute to the right problem that's what concussion is becoming and it's very exciting because this is not a homogenous event it's a very heterogeneous event if this if this thirty different types of knee injuries why do we think there's one type of concussion\nWe'll Dale Earnhardt junior in in the book you write that the second time that you saw it\nThat you didn't actually get all that many phone calls from from drivers because that's just not not necessarily what would a driver cultures like but you did hear from some drivers who had either previously suffered from concussion or hadn't really reached out for help\n[noise] yeah actually that was so ah interesting I guess I'm you know a\nHearing from retired drivers or even drivers that had just recently had suffered a concussion that we're looking for some direction and some advice and look and just really just to be able to contact Mickey had to get a ... where he was in and see him\n[noise] um that was\nI think the beginning of the reason for writing this book and make you told me time and time again\nOr whether it's an article someone's red or he's read or whether it's you know whatever it is like you're helping people you're pushing people to do the right thing you're directing people to us this is making you're making a difference here and he'll tell you that he has people that come in every week that connect\nUh you know their visit to the hospital to something they read or saw me talk about and that encourage meant for Mickey to continue to talk continued to be honest continue to be an open and transparent\nHas a resulted in this book and ah you know so that I I Love helping people especially when you can follow along with their progress or if it's\nYou know I've made friends by meeting strangers and directing them to Mickey and the continuing to support them in continuing to you know\nEncourage them through the process and not made some pretty good friends to sorry to interrupt you there but but there's a moment that you write about after your first meeting with Nikki Collins said was possibly one of the most important things that he said to you that\nAre you are so concerned freaked out really about uh how much you were struggling after your your dual concussions in in twenty twelve\nThat that he told you that it could be fixed now ... why did that and why was it so profound for you that you know he did that on a couple of occasions\nI had I'll I'll I'll toss I'll talk about this one in particular I had my eyes were not working I'm not focusing not I couldn't they weren't stable if I walked across the room\nThey ... you know the by the environment shook and I my eyes just wouldn't\nUh wouldn't settle and it was so so frustrating\n'cause it it was there every minute of every day and it affected anything and everything you did\nAnd it was there for months it it wouldn't getting better I was working and rehabbing and doing those doing exercises in homework that Mickey had given me and it wasn't\nChanging and uh I was getting more and more worried and so I called Mickey innocent Mickey I really just got to ask you something real quick and I said to have you seen this problem\nAnd a cause a a patient's ... patients idea is that the doctor has to stay positive he's not going to be a negative person and tell you this isn't going to work and this is what you got a new you know he's going to be positive because he believes that he can fix it and\nW.

E. dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker ... we're talking about students for fair admissions versus Harvard it's a federal court case going on right now that alleges that Harvard University may discriminate against Asian American students\nBut a lot of people are looking at the casing really what's on trial is affirmative action and we're joined today by Peter would he's president of the national association of scholars there are a group that filed\nAn amicus brief this summer in support of students for fair admissions\nWe're also joined by Nicole gone ... she's a supervising attorney at Asian Americans advancing\nJustice a nickel gone over to you you just got a quick a quick hit there right at the end of the the previous segment so pick up on your thought I mean ... what do you see this case really as and and do you see any credence or any evidence that Harvard or discriminates against Asian Americans as the plaintiffs are alleging\nShore so I'm\nAn Asian American civil rights lawyer that fights discrimination and racism against Asian Americans every day in a variety of contacts of course I Would be concerned about discrimination against Asian Americans and Harvard's admissions process\nNow the claim here is intentional discrimination and while I Do see that there is some negative effect on Asian Americans in the admissions process based on the data that I have seen\nI Do not think that it is at all related to the consideration of race in the admissions process nor do I think that it is intentional discrimination I think there is a disparate impact\nFor Asian Americans do two legacies and other preferences that predominantly a benefit white privileged applicants and I also don't think Asian Americans are alone and experiencing the disparate impact on of those policies but can I jump in here because it's\nNot clear because the plaintiffs allege that they they see evidence in the thousands of pages of documents that have been released during discovery in this trial that they see evidence that\nOf that of a either a disk of discrimination or at least biased against Asian American students in one of the four factors that are that Harvard uses in in admissions they've you know they will get academics that look at extracurricular they looked at athletics and they look at\nUm this is this thing called a a personal which is character and anything that personal category that they say patched Harvard shows a pattern of marking down Asian American students for for no real reason other than perhaps\nA bias shores someone to address the personal score issue I think there's a number of things to consider about the personal score so first statistically\nThey're saying the Asian Americans are consistently rated lower on the personal score but that's because of how the Oregon they organized the data so they organize the data by academic death style which is Ninety nine percent based on SAT scores and GPA\nAnd they're saying that\nUm the students in the highest exile who are you know Asian American or whatever they're getting ... lower ... personal scores than other racial groups but I think that it's a mistake to organize that data by academic ... because it doesn't necessarily correlate just because someone\nAs scores high on the SATs doesn't mean that their application is demonstrating all of these personal qualities and so actually if you don't organize it by academic dial than there is no stick statistically significant difference\nOkay Peter would let me turn back to you in sort of a step back here for big picture because twice or in terms of when affirmative action has been taken all the way to the United States Supreme court\nIn Nineteen Seventy eight in the back of your case and in two thousand three and grab three ball injure Harvard's admission process these have actually been highlighted by the justices as the way to use\nRacial factors in admissions at the right way to use racial factors in admissions and that it's not a deciding factor because\nUh there are many thousands of qualified applicants but it it could be a factor that used in in the entire mix here it was held up as as as the right way to do it so what's what's the problem now that you see\n[noise] well first of all the the ... case in Nineteen Seventy eight was fractured opinion the court split for for one\nOne was Lewis Powell who was Powell was the only one who looked to Harvard and fought the its approach to diversity ought to be compelling no other justice agreed with him at the point\nThat remained in the category of Supreme Court did go all the way to solve some three when in the quarter is\nSandra Day O'Connor decided to resurrect poll eccentric opinion in makeup law the land\nSo now ... Supreme Court has not instance said the the pursuit of diversity taking some code of racial preferences would be a suitable thing the\nColleges and universities could do not that they had to do it but the the ... and that's where the law stands on those who was reaffirmed in the Fisher case with your years ago\nOn what's at stake here is what's been the all along which is should the United states be a country to the dog home full law away on buses title six or the\n... civil rights act like teen sixty four that no person in the United states show on the grounds of race color or national origin be excluded from participation in order to light the benefits to be\nA word to be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial systems as far as ending affirmative action we could say the Harvard does have other options\nYou could take the option of saying we no longer want to receive federal aid therefore we're willing to put our money aside in order to discriminate because we'd like to discriminate\nAnother option is that Harvard which has a dull moment melt thirty nine point one billion dollars could expand and manner that could accommodate students who are qualified and rightly long in of going through\nA Nicole ... give you a chance to respond to that\nShore so I Do want to push back against um this notion that Asian Americans are definitively being discriminated against and I want to do that by sort of talking about the admissions process\nSo I think it is a fiction that every other score or every other consideration in the admissions process\nIs objective and\nI think there's a lot of research that establishes that SAT scores and grades even extracurricular activities to some extent\nSystematically penalize black and Latino students um and some subgroups of Asian American students as well and so I think to sort of look at the admissions process and to look at the personal score as the only one that could be potential Tobias is incorrect\nBecause all of these factors are in perfect all of them to some extent are vulnerable to implicit excellent bias in the case of SAT scores systematic discrimination against certain\nUm you know racial groups\nAnd so I don't think that the remedy for any of this is to eliminate the consideration of race but it is actually to have race consciousness and a lot of scholars would tell you\nThat the way to remedy discrimination is to consider race and to make sure that these um that racial groups are treated unfairly compared to check\nOkay so I Want to take a step back and actually bring in the voice of Harvard University itself because back in July or I had a chance to sit down with Harvard president Larry back out right at the beginning of his his presidency at Harvard and\nWe had a long conversation linked to that whole conversation at on point radio dot org but I'm going to play an excerpt here for you because I began by asking Larry back out again Harvard's president about what he sees as the overall mission of Harvard admissions process and he is and what it is\nThe admissions process should try to construct a class to bring together a group of students in a residential learning environment which optimize has the opportunity for them to learn not just from the faculty bought from each other\nAnd diversity is an important component of that because we learn from our differences\nDot com and ADD smart homes sponsor of last seen the new true crime pod cast from someone who you are and the Boston Globe investigating the largest

college admissions process sees once again on trial currently in a federal court case against Harvard University we've done a lot of callers who want to join us let's go right to them Mohammed is calling from New York New York Mohammed you're on the air\nIs thanks for taking my call and high magna I'd really love your program\nI'm calling I'm a with this comment and I have a question at the end and a common is that I'm In my career where I live here in New York City I worked in a newsroom for my career I'm retired now and I see\nThe school system in this city public versus the exceptional schools as apartheid structured\nAnd the other part of this comment is that when you look at the African American community and the history of African Americans in this country that are African Americans have like a ... a ... four hundred year deficit ... and\nPursuing I'm a equity in this country and that's reflected in our schools\nAre going to most of the public schools in this in the city of New York or you don't see Asian and white\nCivil how are you are you saying that you believe affirmative action is needed then to a\nLevel that feel to write the historical inequities\nYes I yes I Do and I think that um I'm an Asian Americans who are dissatisfied with their percentage at a Harvard or have their heads in the sand or at Harvard or less than fifty percent of the student body is is African American\nWell let me take it back to me on on on that point and forgive me for interrupting but there are a lot of voices we want to do and so I'm very much appreciate your call oh let's get a different perspective from DJ who's calling from Norwich, Connecticut DJ you're on the air\nThank you for having me on this morning um as far as affirmative action goals you know I think a lot of implicit bias has to do with some of these things I mean yes if it wasn't for affirmative action some things would have never been able to say please\nPut their lives in in the race balancing but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's all for the good you know I grew up in Palm Beach County Florida\nAnd maybe the African American myself I went to someone who is through high school in elementary school or I couldn't believe this woman and right there in my community I live the bus way over here because it wasn't even black students going over there\nAnd my sisters following through the same thing and and during the eighties early seventies where it will be very violent and things that I made sure and I mean I don't I don't I don't know the minute it says a double sided coin you know him as far as like with Asian Americans with Harvard\nI think it has to do with the as far as like some of the personal credit here that needs to be in order to get into the school\nI think that it has to do with the fact that\nFrom my experience of them a lot of other people and experience though I Know about the Asian community they're not very inclusive of and so I think they may have something to do with the about the personal effects but at the same time I think that is a testament to how well versed they are and how much they are all about the academics as opposed to some of those others\nOkay did you have to take it back to be there a mud thank you so much for your call Nick hold on let me just go to you quickly because even though I feel like a\nI mean uh uh do you do is talking about his experience as an African American male or in this country he also then sort of made some presumptions about the Asian American community as well I just wanted to give you a chance to respond to that\n[noise] sure um yeah I don't really agree with the Jane as a group Asian Americans are not very inclusive or you know are more about academic than um than anything else I think that is as stereotyping and I think that\nKind of its tablet shows why we need the policies like affirmative action because our\nThat people don't have the opportunity to interact with each other and to break down those stereotypes and that is one of the points of considering race in admissions process and to have a diverse student body at in colleges is though that these barriers can be broken down and what you heard\nFrom D. J. it was probably the result of him not actually having that many interactions with Asian Americans along the lines of what Mohammed that that there is an apartheid system in our public\nSchools So Peter would let me turn back to you here because I just want to get down and I and we're going to I'm going to ask this question of Nicole as well but she's already spoken about how she believes diversity is is part of what's core to\nAn essential on a experience on American college campuses but if you were to have your druthers what would be the basis upon which colleges and universities in America admit students\nWould admit students on the basis of proven ability aptitude determination self discipline the qualities that make for someone who can undertaker rigorous college curriculum and the full range of things that go on in college who lives in to the maximum\nAre aren't those ... determine it a determination et cetera aren't those are very objectively measured though\nWell they can be subjectively measured but they're certainly objective qualities involved in it as well students who do well in their academics through grade school and high school in ...\nGroup showing the excelled in the courses that are available to them and gone beyond those courses or showing the determination that does not just a matter of somebody's objective opinion about it but he's actually almost rooted in their lives lived up to the\nPoint okay because I keep going back to what Edward Blum the men who is really the force behind this case what he said in two thousand Fifteen that he said the goal of these lawsuits is to eliminate the consideration of race in applications so he needed plaintiffs he needed Asian\nPlaintiffs now now Edward Blum has a long history of again bringing cases against affirmative action to the Supreme Court he also challenged the Nineteen sixty five voting rights act in Shelby County view holder\nOr and and won that case if the Supreme Court of getting a the court to overturn a very key part of the voting rights act so he's been focused on race a lot in America\nBut but what I mean Harvard uses a athletics as part of it's a admissions process is why why should athletes have twice as much chance to get into Harvard as anybody else what does that have to do with\nTheir merits there or what about legacy admissions why not bring a case against\nA students who may have a leg up simply because they had a family member who went to Harvard University I mean I feel like there's a lot of other issues apart from race that a separate that the housing that has no ... have not in the way Harvard admit admit students\nWell Harvard may be making dog poop decisions when it comes to the preferences gives her legacies ... for uh people enough flux but\nThose are decisions that the private university republic one for that matter are free to make\nOne they make the decision also then based on what they see as a the mix of students that they need to ... to have a diverse campus\nBecause this country passed a law through Congress signed by president upheld by numerous Supreme courts which is the title six of the arm\nOr Nineteen sixty four law and that just makes it plain that to this country discriminating on the basis of race is no go don't do it\nNow if Congress were to pass a law that says ... into your preferences for athletes who would be strange law but no such law currently exists this is about Bain law\nI see okay so let's go to another call here Eli is calling from Steven city Virginia Eli you're on the air\nLike now I just wanted to call in because I think a lot of the narrative around this case has been saying that Asian Americans don't believe in affirmative action um a lot of people in the Asian community do believe in an affirmative action um East Asian American all that\nAnd the majority of the planes any cases are Chinese American feeding 'em and that\nYou know they're not under represented in college ... in the slightest\nNow for a minute and really helps black and brown students in America which Asian American theater ... sometimes I consider granting that I got ... a pathetic Islander\nOn South Asia and South Asian the ... you know if this is going to give them a leg up we absolutely I went to the theater studies though and I think there is a case that really hurting the overall Asian American community to benefit\nA few students will Eli thank you so much for your call let's get a view from Samantha who's calling from La Crosse Wisconsin Samantha you're on the air\nTo naughty point nine W.

to her reporting on Syria that on point radio dot org Sarah welcome to the program Hi good to be here\nSo I Want to actually read uh just the the leader for a recent article that you wrote a K ... and you begin quote it has felt practically inevitable for years that I'd have to write the following sentence Sears Holdings Corp wants towering force in American malls that was a central and creating the blueprint for the twenty century retail\nIs preparing to file for bankruptcy why did it feel inevitable\nWell because this is the result of a very very long slow decline and I sort of break it into two parts ah Sears in two thousand for a a financier named Eddie Lambert orchestrated it's merger with Kmart\nAnd that has been quite disastrous chapter I he's mismanaged the company and a number of ways that I'm sure we can delve into in more detail ah and now has played a key role in bringing it to this point of bankruptcy\nBut long before that throughout the nineties in the eighties Sears the missteps for just piling up that left it not well positioned to compete in\nToday's retail environment okay so let's talk about some of those missteps because I think at first blush people when they see a major retailer or have to declare bankruptcy these days\nThey think it's because they haven't been able to keep up with a you know online shopping and the the the major changes in the way Americans are shopping is that the case or I mean it sounds like you're saying that the missteps came along before Amazon came along\nYes exactly so we can we can relate to the Nineteen eighties when\nSears was sort of just cutting off of it but I think of as it it didn't puerile period that postwar post World war two I threw the seventies when it was in you know just as really dominant retailer and in the eighties I think it had a bit of hubris\nOn and it started to get distracted by adding different minds have business so it acquired cold wealthy banker it acquired a finance firm called dean Witter just started\nTaking its eye off the ball of what it knew how to do best was which was to tell people stopped\nAnd then also some free Internet changes started happening that Sears didn't quite know how to grapple with and that was mainly in the form of these so called category killers these big box paradise is\nIn the forecast mostly sunny today ... should be around sixty

ad campaign the softer side of the ears were talking to\nIt means for retail in America in two thousand Eighteen the once dominant perhaps the dominant retailer in the United states for more than a century can't hold on and is going into chapter eleven we're talking this hour with Sarah holes actually the Bloomberg opinion columnist covering the consumer in retail industries\nVicki Howard is also with us She's a business and cultural historian and a professor at the University of ... ethics and author of for main street tomorrow the rise and fall the American department store\nAnd and Vicki Howard before the break we were talking about how Sears a century ago really changed the way Americans shopped particularly in rural parts of the country you know was that because of uh the catalog\nOh yes I I mean before Nineteen twenty five it was a huge mail order from you know yeah it's competition was um Montgomery Ward it also had a catalog in the late Nineteen century uh but uh uh this was a way that um\nRural people could access all of the goods that were manufactured in in the United states that were um manufactured in northern factories and shipped out on railroad cars you know across the country\nAnd you could order your your clothes or your your um equipment for your farm or a you know everything under the sun was available in these catalogues\nOkay so the company was founded I mean as the years as we know it was about was created an Eighteen Ninety three by Richard ... years and a hell of a Curtis Roebuck what was it about them and how they approach business that all that has allowed them to see this opportunity that there were all these ... customers in rural parts of the country\nUm I mean I think the ah they started out as a selling watches so it was just a sort of limited of from in terms of what it would have had offered to begin with but it really grew later when Julius real civil got on board um\nAnd he took the company into\nIt sort of a modern day for um uh so I I think that this was the gilded age you know it was an era of you know big gap between the rich and the poor\nAnd but you know it was a time of industrialization\nAnd I'm also movement into cities and a\nGrowing consumer culture at the time I was focused on cities but you know lots of people in the country also um wanted access to some of these goods and this was a way for them to have it on other otherwise they would have had to you know travel long distances to go into cities to to shop in the department stores or\nMaybe they would have just been able to shop in their country store their general store in their area in a rural area so it really was about I'm reaching those segments and then when it became a department store in the Nineteen twenties then it shifted gears and became a more of a main street an entrepreneur um a sort of\nGoing it's small towns across the country and then eventually you know really gets his later section in after World War two\nWas Sarah ... isn't as one of the most interesting things about seniors as a major American Company that over the course of several decades was able to open up markets and opportunities for a for consumers in rural areas and as as Vicky how are just saying you know also in suburban areas becoming becoming the store that\nHad the catalog and was an anchor store in so many moles in America\nYeah I think in some ways a story it's yours is the story of the American economy right that you can see those clear links from and adapting to a largely still Berlin agrarian society to seeing what the automobile would do to change the patterns in shopping patterns on and making that adaptation so quickly\nI mean you think about that they didn't start stores still Nineteen twenty five and I believe\nA within a decade stores where the majority of their business compared to ah the catalog and so the fact that it was so nimble you know we talk now about the extraordinary changes in the Amazon has been able to bring to bear and speed with which it even able to disrupt the market well that's pretty speedy disruption too and that's why I think yours occupies\nSuch an important place in retailing history in Congress yeah\nSo we'll talk more about the uh the effects of online retail a little later in the program but we've got callers who want to join us 'cause I mean most Americans have interacted with the Sears or ... years perhaps at least was in their lives so lots of lots of memories you go to Deborah who's calling from Watertown, Connecticut Deborah you're on the air\n... making great show I I'm I have worked for two great American institutions the earth and potential um and potential continues to thrive and fears of course is not\nI started my race years when I was a kid during the Vietnam War um my father was military sergeant stationed in Japan so we ordered everything that we needed\nI Would pour over it for hours [laughter] um I think fear has been off to fight and heading for trouble for a long time I worked for years in the Nineteen seventies when I was in high school in house where\nUm the guy I worked for his name was John man I Hope you have kids here this he was the top housewares manager and the entire country he was very innovative very successful very aggressive he he wasn't there about knowing the merchant\nTo see what other stores were charging so he could set prices in sales based on that information he had made cooking chicken and ham inside the store grilling it so that the smell would attract customers who might not be thinking about\nI Love to see sounds like a real creative manager\nHe was totally like that and he never\nEver ever got promoted the owner and manager of one department in one store because he didn't have a high school that I mean he had a high school degree but nothing beyond that and and you know and\nI especially remember just one story that I'd love to share from those days about I'm an old style\nManager here I was sixteen years old and I was on the phone with the customer who wanted to order a replacement parts for his Webber grill which was not hard but he was really really difficult and really unhappy in part to help well it turned out that the reason he was so unhappy with that his wife had left him\nAnd she had I'm\nTaking the parts but not the grill uh-huh\nAnd and I and I didn't I couldn't handle and when I finally said to him excuse me sir it's not my fault that your wife left you and I hung up on it\nAnd he called store manager and demanded that I'd be fired yeah and the store manager who we never saw on the floor who was a you know young man college educated wars suit came down to you know get my head on a Potter and drawn stuck up for me uh-huh\nHe said she shouldn't have done it she's young it's her first job she's a good worker and then he sat me down and he gave me you know the coffee yeah always right lecture but he stuck up for me\nWe'll Debra thank you so much for your call and for your memories there and and a really wonderful example about or perhaps how were qualified people that you weren't at least in this case weren't getting promoted thank you Deborah let's go

crash or all the ran out\nOf a wildly popular all Catholic now they're just going back and we're or a load the at the all of the corporation and all the debt on somebody else\nI see Chris thank you for your call Sarah ... ah did that happen to Sears were they were they purchased by hedge fund or or a private equity business at one time\nI still any land bridge that who just stepped down as CEO and who orchestrated it's merger with Kmart he is a hedge fund guy\nOn and he has used a lot of those hedge fund tactics to try to keep Sears a flow in recent years so and this is one of the main knocks on his tenure is that he didn't really have an merchants instinct he wasn't running series like a retailer he was running it was sort of his hedge fund guy had on and so he has\nAnd you know doing things like spinning off it's real estate providing loans are selling things like that crashed into a brand sort\nOf moving around financial chess pieces to keep it alive but he wasn't really making it a better retailer\nWill so should we talk more about this then because we think the presumption when you hear that a retailer goes into bankruptcy as it somehow they were doing business wrong but it may have nothing to do with that I mean\nAs a as our caller pointed out we have so many examples Toys R us he's right is another one ... who's a hedge funds were private equity managers

retailer it's been\nA retailer at the heart of American Life for more than a hundred years and ah what that means for retail as we move forward in the digital age\nI mean let's listen here to a clip from a Sears ad from the Nineteen nineties featuring Bob Vila home improvement television host also a Sears commercials spokesperson talking about all the things you could accomplish with Sears products [noise]\nRemodeling a kitchen or bad is such a big job\nMoving you trust to do it all and do it\nRight Hi, Bob Vila procedures and the home improvement professional maybe you've been dreaming about a beautiful new kitchen or updating your bad well if it's too big a job to do yourself trust the job just Sears they've been in business for over a hundred years\n... lived there in the Nineteen nineties wanting the ears long history\nWebsite a debit says Sears was our parents and our parents parents store when I think as the years I think of craftsmen Kenmore the only two brand I ever bought there there are still manufactured and can be bought elsewhere uh so that's a comment from our website on point radio dot org let's go to Dave who's calling from Buffalo New York Dave you're on the air\nHow are you doing doing great day what you for taking my call yeah go ahead [noise]\n[noise] okay yeah you're on a it said I'm a I'm a current year employee [noise] um I'm a service technician and you know what I'm we're just getting bigger and bigger\nOr not actually attached to the ... the outlet uh-huh fears is always going to be there as they explained it to us if you think of it this way\nLet's go full circle years it was a catalogue company like apple or look for them to you guys talk very interesting and you know Sears catalog company and then they started having spores more and more everywhere\nSo that now that the the digital age is here in the millennials vi everything on line just about and a llama I'm a father than kids and I and I grew it's years over Twenty years yeah you know a great place to work\nAnd I read and I'm going full circle\nSo they can just jump in here for like do you mean first full circle what do you mean by that because as you say your service technician in ... your your business is is is as busy as ever\nUm yeah you don't have your you know what we're um Sears and the fact groups or are they in the center for applied to electronic because we'd do other I'm like we do\nA Lowe's Home Depot or rules um that's why we do all the service I see Steve along with all the store\nYou know wherever wherever they want is just so we do the orange juice or\nDave I'm going to take it back from his take you so much for your call Sarah ... a with a bluebird opinion columnist David he's feeling confident lease for his part of Syria's business and he's he's the company's coming full circle what do you think\nSo I think there's something to the fact that the services area is if if you had to shell out some bright spots at Sears services would be one and that's a key part of their strategy of trying to revitalize the company as counting on that day you trust them for those issues and so you buy your appliances within\nBecause uh they have this relationship with you via their services business so there is something to that that this idea than coming full circle I think they would have to have a more robust e commerce business for that to be a plausible outcome and we just don't see them as a formidable competitor in that space and\nLook at the labor's been saying for years that Sears is going to shrink to profitability and that just hasn't happened they keeps shrinking they keep closing stores they keep investing in the e commerce business and they've had seven straight years of ... okay\nSo since you mentioned e commerce just just remind us broadly how much overall of American retail right now is done on line it it it actually maybe less than we think\nThat's right ah we're at the point now where I Believe the most recent figures show nine point five percent of all commerce has done online and certainly I it's it varies a lot by category right in categories like grocery it's probably more around one to two percent in categories like apparently it's probably more around twenty or thirty percent\nTo wonder if there is present in apparent okay but overall less than ten percent correct instill in an even with Ninety percent of of overall shopping done in brick and mortar stores tears couldn't capitalize on that are having problems doing\nExactly and I think that's right yes this is definitely a story at Amazon and its disruption but it's also a story and so you're getting hammered by its traditional retailing counterpart I we we mentioned briefly before Home Depot and Lowe's are those are two extraordinarily well run retailers that have taken share from Sears\nAt Best Buy stock in your all time high is that it as it has staged a remarkable turnaround in his taking share from Sears and on the apparel side of the business a lot of the disruption there has been from off price stores like T. J. max and Ross which had been on a hair in recent years and he can share away from traditional department stores like seers\nWell let's go to John who's calling from Detroit Michigan John you're on the air\nThank you so\nI bought my first craftsman set of tools back when I was a teenager in the seventies and I was a you know no pun intended die hard uh Sears version [noise] um and then when\nI got involved in the communities of Detroit we'll find out that there's actually catalog houses are right down the street from me that were built in the forties the ... were purchased right out of the catalog unfortunately a Sears is kind of waned on the east side of Detroit or the last Twenty years and it's probably been ten years\nI they just don't pay us like they used to\nYeah well John thank you for your call Vicky how are you the the business and cultural historian John reminding us that you could ... there was a time you could buy a house out of a Sears catalog\nYeah I think I might have lived in one myself uh from the Nineteen twenties I'm In um upstate New York so I I'm familiar with them they're\nThey're lovely homes and um\nIt I think that they had their special a special catalog devoted to to them that closed down I think right around the Nineteen forties I Believe on but you know you you can see homes from the turn of the century Nineteen twenties in any community in the U.S on ... you might possibly be able to identify them as a serious home yeah\nWell so picky Howard a minute ago a Sarah ... talked about how uh in two thousand Eighteen\nYes e commerce is huge and getting bigger but we're still doing Ninety percent of our shopping in brick and mortar stores and you've written about the rise and fall of the American department store so so why is there seeming disconnect between how much we shop and where we shop and why some department stores fears among them are having trouble hanging on\nI mean we haven't really talked much about Wal Mart and Amazon is sort of taking over our in our thoughts of you know as the as the big competitor for these brick and mortar stores but you know when I was writing my book I I thought mostly about Wal Mart as as a competitor for the traditional department store um\nAnd you know fears used to occupy a space that Wal Mart to um uh uh now does a as the largest retailer in the country a Wal Mart be overtook the years and I'm In the early Nineteen nineties so I think that it\nNeeds to be seen in through that longer um trajectory of it Sarah a signal or you know her early comments that\n... what happened to Sears not just about the last few years it's about sort of long term trend I'm going back to the Nineteen eighties and it it's it's\nIt is an inevitable um I I Do believe that um\n[noise] uh that all of those uh missteps a\nMight have made a difference you know in the short term of survival of a from like\nLike Sears but I Do think that if you look at the department store industry as a whole that that sector has been a losing out to the big box stores to just before them even a even before them they just counters target a K. Mart Walmart all all founded in Nineteen I'm sixty two\nAnd a growing up going through the Nineteen seventies that to the traditional department store of which Sears is it a\nHe's a party is more of a staple goods um standard where sort of chain right we got sector's been losing out\nYou know so I'm hearing over and over again through this hour uh Sarah ... that's a leadership matters right vision and an executive or\nNinety two boys seven WVU ages break eighty nine boy one WB UH Brewster and streaming or W.

Harvard shows a pattern of marking down Asian American students for for no real reason other than\nPerhaps virus shores to address the personal score issue I think there's a number of things to consider about the personal score so first statistically\nThey're saying that Asian Americans are consistently rated lower on the personal score but that's because of how the Oregon they organize the data so they organize the data by academic textile which is Ninety nine percent based on SAT scores and GPA\nAnd they're saying that\nUm the students in the highest exile who are you know Asian American or whatever they're getting ... lower ... personal scores than other racial groups\nBut I think that it's a mistake to organize that data by academic ... because it doesn't necessarily correlate just because someone anyone Asian American or otherwise\nScores high on the SATs doesn't mean that their application is demonstrating all of these personal qualities and so actually if you don't organize it by academic dial than there is no stick statistically significant difference\nOkay Peter would let me turn back to you in sort of a a step back here for big picture because twice or

New York New York Mohammed you're on the air\nIs for taking my call and high magna I'd really love your program\nI'm calling I'm a with this comment and I have a question that in common is that I'm In my career where I live here in New York City I worked in a newsroom for my career I'm retired now\nAnd I see the school system in this city\nPublic versus the exceptional schools as apartheid structured\nAnd the other part of this comment is that when you look at the African American community and the history of African Americans in this country that\nAfrican Americans have like a ... a four four hundred year deficit ... and\nEquity in this country and that's reflected in our schools are going to most of the public schools in this in the city of New York or you don't see Asian and white\nSo Mohammed ... are you saying that you believe affirmative action is needed then to a\nLevel that field to write the historical inequities\nYes I yes I Do think that um I'm an Asian Americans who are dissatisfied with their percentage at a Harvard or have their heads in the sand or at Harvard ... less than fifty percent of the student body is is African American\nWell let me take it back from you on on on that point in it and forgive me for interrupting but there are a lot of voices we want to join so I'm very much appreciate your call oh let's get a different perspective from DJ who's calling from Norwich, Connecticut DJ you're on the air\nThank you for having me on um as far as affirmative action goes you know I think a lot of implicit bias has to do with some of these things I mean yes if it wasn't for affirmative action some things would have never been able to say police\nBut it isn't in the race balance thing but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's all for the good you know I grew up in Palm Beach County Florida\nAnd maybe African American myself I went through some of this through high school and elementary school or I couldn't believe this woman and read very much humidity in the bus way over here because of what a million black students going over there\nAnd my sisters following through the same thing and and during the eighties early seventies where it would be very violent things that I make sure\nAnd I mean I don't I don't I don't know the man it's as a double sided coin you know him as far as like with Asian Americans with Harvard I think it has to do with the as far as like some of the personal credit here that need in order to get into the school\nI think that it has to do with the fact that\nFrom my experience of them a lot of other people to experience though I yeah I Know about the Asian community they're not very inclusive of and so I think they may have something to do with the about the personal effects but at the same time I think that is a testament to how well versed they are and how much they are all about the academics as opposed to some of those others\nOkay did you get back to be there a mud thank you so much for your call Nicole gone oh gee let me just go to you quickly because even though I feel like a I mean uh uh did you was talking about his experience as an African American male or\nIn this country he also then sort of made some presumptions about the Asian American community as well I just wanted to give you a chance to respond to that\n[noise] sure um yeah I don't really agree ah with DJ that as a group Asian Americans are not very inclusive or you know are more about academic than um than anything else I think that is a stereotype and I think that\nKind of tablets shows why we need\nThe policies like affirmative action because our country and so segregated that people don't have the opportunity to interact with each other and to break down those stereotypes and that is\nOne of the points of considering race any missions process and to have a diverse student body at in colleges is though that these barriers can be broken down and what you heard from DJ at what's probably the result of him not actually having that many interactions\nWith Asian Americans along the lines of what Mohammed that that there is an apartheid system in our public\nSchools So Peter would let me turn back to you here because I just want to get down and I and we're going to I'm going to ask this question of Nicole as well but she's already spoken about how she believes diversity is is part of what's core to\nAn essential and uh experience on American college campuses but if you were to have your druthers what would be the basis upon which colleges and universities in America admits students\nHe would have to admit students on the basis of proven ability aptitude determination self discipline the qualities that make for someone who can undertaker rigorous college curriculum and the full range of things that go on in college who lives in to the maximum\nAre aren't the only ... to determine it a determination et cetera aren't those are very objectively measured though\nWell they can be objectively measured but there are certainly objective qualities involved in it as well students who do well in their academics through grade school and high school and who helps\nTranscript showing the excelled in the courses that are available to them and have gone beyond those courses or showing the determination that does not justify a matter of somebody subjective opinion about it but he's actually almost rooted in their lives lived up to the\nOkay because I keep going back to what Edward Blum the man who is really the force behind this case what he said in two thousand Fifteen that he said the goal of these lawsuits is to eliminate the consideration of race in applications so he needed plaintiffs he needed Asian plaintiffs now now Edward Blum has a long history of again bringing cases against affirmative action\nOh in the Nineteen sixty five voting rights act in Shelby County view holder a and and won that case that the Supreme Court or getting on the court to overturn a very key part of the voting rights act he's been focused on race a lot in America\nBut but what I mean Harvard uses a athletics as part of it's a admissions process is why why should athletes have twice as much chance to get into Harvard as anybody else what does that have to do with their merits there or what about legacy admissions why not bring a case against\nUs students who may have a leg up simply because they had a family member who went to Harvard University I mean if you look there's a lot of other issues apart from race that a separate that the haves and the haves and have not in the way Harvard admit admit students\nWill Harvard may be making ... decisions when it comes to the preferences gives her luggage sees him for old people enough blood ... but\nThose are decisions so the private university republic one for the murder or fried Meg swung\nOut they make the decision also then based on what they see as a the mix of students that they need to ... to have a diverse campus\nBecause this country passed a law through Congress signed by president ... Supreme courts which is the or played all six of the arm\nOr Nineteen sixty four law I'm not just mix of planes the to this country discriminating on the basis of race is no go don't do it\nYou know if Congress were to pass a law does those remote into your preferences for athletes would be strange law but no such law currently exists this is about Bain law\nI see okay so let's go to another caller here Eli is calling from Steven city Virginia Eli you're on the air\nLike now I just wanted to call in because I think a lot of the narrative around this case has been saying that Asian Americans don't believe in affirmative action um a lot of people in the Asian American community do believe in an affirmative action I'm an East Asian American Woman\nAnd the majority of the planes have any cases are Chinese American feeding 'em and that\nYou know they're not under represented in the college scene and the flight us you know for a minute action really helps black and brown students in America which Asian American students sometimes I consider granting that I got ... uh Pacific Islanders\nI'm South Asian South Asian the didn't you know if this is going to give them a leg up we absolutely owe it to the student cities though and I think this is cases really hurting the overall Asian American community to benefit\nA few students will Eli thank you so much for your call let's get a view from Samantha who's calling from La Crosse Wisconsin Samantha you're on the air", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "17"}
