alleged drinking habits in high school and college\nWell what about today's college students they've grown up in a world where sexual assault education is part of the curriculum on many college campuses end where social media can provide any more told trail of deeds and misdeeds\nBut has any of that changed how college students party now this hour on point today's college drinking culture you can join us on air or on line what was the drinking scene when you were in school and if you're in college now what does partying look like is drinking the blackout\nUnusual or the norm and do the

originally from Madison, Wisconsin and jak because he also runs ASU bar stool sports website jak welcome to you hire OK so first of all let me just get a quick\nSort of picture here if I were to ask you you know describe what the drinking scene is like on campus where you are how would you answer that metal and let's start with you sue PC\nIs a school without a Greek life so that does end up shaping a lot of what our drinking she looks like but people were mostly gravitate towards hard alcohol um especially I found during our freshman sophomore years when alcohol might be a little bit harder to get hold up because you're not legally able to buy it\nAnd there is a very strong blackout culture where people are generally drinking to blackout ... that's the whole point well it's not entirely the whole point although\nI wouldn't say the goal or at a point but it is not ... it's a part of our language you're very common to have someone say oh I Can't even remember what happened last night I blacked out and it did some point it is\nAlmost a goal depending on who your friends are the kind of social senior running in within the school maybe because of the stresses of the week but it is a release you're trying to reach that point of innovation where\nYou can't even really remember what happens and access\nAnd as you said it's it's not stigmatized that was not the best jak

drinking culture on American college campuses today I'm joined by meddling DeAngelis she's Twenty one year old senior at Boston College Brianna Picard also joined us She's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and is now a first year law student at the George Washington University School of law\nAnd jak McCarthy's with that he's in Tempe, Arizona he's Twenty one ... year old senior at Arizona State university and we're one hundred forty three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk we want to know what you think about college drinking culture\nNow ah and again as we talked about before\nBefore the break we're we're we're discussing this given in in the light of the hearings regarding judge Brett Kavanaugh and I'm Wondering if in college now is this suddenly making you think\nAgain about ah what you drink how much you drink or the party and culture on your campus and whether or not we're living in a world now where five ten Fifteen Twenty years from now can all come back to haunt you where it\nEight hundred forty three eighty five five as I said and we got a lot of comments coming in on social media and on our website uh for example a Don Kathleen is saying on Facebook she says I live in a college town and my residence is surrounded by college housing\nThursday through early hours of Sunday is a display of drunk and debauchery it's typical to see dozens upon dozens of weaving drunk students can racks of course in the next party\nA until the culture of privilege binge drinking and how that plays out in colleges addressed this shows no evidence of slowing down All right I Want to bring in one more guest into this conversation Wesley Perkins joins us now he's with us from Geneva New York\nHe's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges and he's been conducting research at high risk alcohol consumption in college students\nFor three decades and he's also author of the social norms approach to preventing school and college a substance abuse Wesley Perkins welcome to you\nFactor much good to be here well first of all just reflect with us on what you heard uh in in the previous segment and this this story is I'm from Jack in Brianna and Madeleine about campus drinking culture now ... are we at a place that's different at all from where we were Thirty years ago\nWell I think what what I was hearing from them is not something I'm calling you will hear students or\n... or even graduate says they reflect back I have to say [noise] um we're in many ways though not at a very different place than we were even going back Thirty years ago if I might say quickly with a couple of points of what the what the reality is on campuses based on\nA scores scores of studies the over arching an irrefutable\nFindings of a massive amount of research now is that first of all high risk or heavy drinking sometimes called binge drinking it is significant and sometimes quite tribes and it's quite tragic consequences are [noise]\nAre prevalent and they're at their highest levels in college students of age Eighteen to twenty four years old [noise] and those are compared to any other age population and compared to non college young adults are the same age ... this is the heart of the of the problem is\nWhen we talked about alcohol abuse and high risk those levels have declined slightly in the last decade with more innovative interventions but the big picture of high risk in college still remains having said that\nEven given the relative high rates of problem drinking in college it is not now nor has there ever been in previous decades the norm amongst college students\nThe best measures of a of of of high risk drinking or about twenty five to thirty percent engaging an occasional occasionally in high risk drinking with some frequency about twenty percent might be described as frequent heavy binge drinkers\nAnd it's important to know that to put it in perspective one quarter of students consumed two thirds to three quarters of all the alcohol that's consumed on campus and this is true across all all different kinds of campuses we've researched\nOne quarter of students are consuming two thirds to three quarters of the alcohol that's consume so the high risk drinking is relatively concentrated it's not the norm but it's a serious problem connections some significant\n... yeah so so it was a person is just one quick point of clarification um maybe said if I didn't catch it when you say high risk drinking how are we defining that\nWell uh sometimes today with the word a binge drinking issues and typically what is used most commonly and measures are measures such as using five or more drinks that are setting or more of five for men or for for women to adjust for gender differences [noise]\nRecent decades that we've had better measures that focus on you used to talking about drinking five or four or more in a two hour period because\nI mean eight hours or it might mean a very short period of time but the most important thing is\nUh whether they're consuming enough to get their blood alcohol level is up\nTo a high risk level such as a point oh eight which was the I'm a legal limit in terms of driving\nWhen a ... one gets above appointed away one gets into the serious risk areas and that's a so if we were talking about drinking a far more in a two hour period without intention of some of the students were describing to\nAlter their consciousness quickly that's the kind of high risk drinking that we're most concerned about because that's what is most likely to produce the consequences\nOkay now Madeline you have both the advantages and disadvantages sitting right across from me here at the on point table and I can see your face you you have kind of questioning look on your face what are you thinking yes what I think\nIs interesting about what the difference may potentially be if we're going to talk about the difference between drinking over the past decades is that there does seem to be at least a PC gravitation towards hard alcohol which\nWhen I'm stuck into my parents are people from previous generations seems to be different it seemed people seemed shock that there are just handles ... or whatever he needs to get a hold of easily available sit like basically right off the bat your freshman year and\nI don't know if maybe Brianna or jak find that to be similar experience their school but I Do think that's an interesting trend re enter you want to jump in here\n[noise] yeah um I think there's probably a fifty fifty shot at whether you're going to be drinking heart alcohol or beer on depending on the situation and what your you know drinking for 'em ... before football game tended to be more beer\nGear heady whereas party hosted a fraternity and eat for ... you know whatever that tended to be more um hard liquor centric do I think that's definitely a notable point okay and Jack\n[noise] um I Would definitely agree with ... like if you're going to a tailgate or something and stuff they're going to be beer heavy but\nI think definitely for house parties and certain things like that are hard liquor is kind of like where people are kind of having because they don't want to carry your carrying around a thirty she's a beer while you're at a house party is a lot more inconvenient than just carrying around a bottle and sharing it with your friends okay wisely Perkins\nI mean you've been studying this for several decades do you see that same trend\nRight well I think it is true that are depending on what the particular context you might see more beer being consumed or or more hard liquor\nBut the the fact of the matter is that\nUh we could go back decades and find a a function grain alcohol being poured for big parties that were quite common in certain circumstances back in the Nineteen seventies eighties and so forth [noise]\nUm and uh still nationwide beers a drink of choice although a in some sectors and some schools\nAre some hard liquor may have in the increase popularity but it's when we use the word trends of uh we're just not seeing major trends without regard [noise]\nUm and the bottom line still is how many drinks you're consuming how quickly and if you haven't been eating at all [noise] uh you know they can enter your bloodstream pretty quickly no matter what type of alcohol you're consuming certainly of heart alcohol can can enter your bloodstream very quickly if you're doing\nTen shots in a row and that sort of thing but if you are trying to drink as many beers as you can in a row that can be equally um a devastating too so [noise]\nUh I think we have to temper the uh the notion that oh this hard liquor is that it's a new phenomena and and it explains all the problem is that it's ... it's a mixed\nPicture still looks just a we have so many college when I joined us callers I promise I'm going to get to you but I Want to ask was ... one more question here because you know look I I get it there maybe some people listening to this saying why all the shock\nI mean you you just made me you sound like you know a a a shock teetotaler who's saying oh my God there's nobody drinking on college campuses\nDoes your car has a nickname doesn't hold wonderful memories of good times with family and friends\nWill make your cars last memory the best one yet donated to W. B. U. R.\nWe'll get top dollar for the old car and you'll be supporting the news in programming you love\nAnd who may be eligible for a tax deduction go to W. B. U. R. dot org slash cars and thanks [noise]\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking about college drinking culture today and we're joined by meddling DeAngelis she's a Twenty one year old senior at Boston College ... joined us as well she's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and now she's the first year law student\nAt the George Washington University School of law jak McCarthy is with us either Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State and Wesley Perkins is also with us he's a professor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre happening and maybe people will say like oh maybe I can remember or maybe they just saying that it's totally not possible it just seems to me like\nI don't know it's just like lie and basically because you already know that whoever drink so much as he's portrayed too with the cakes and everything like that had to be a blackout and from what your guests\nAre they speaking ... it's like corrupt rating that if\nMy ... you can't control that you're going to get to that point right time\nVeronica thank you for your call jak McCarthy my turn to you on that or I mean you heard the question what do you say\nUm I definitely say for the blackouts especially I think\nWe're missing a point to that some people do they have like bigger issues that nobody knows about so sometimes they do go out to drink and like kind of forget about their problems I think that's also like another reason people are blocking out up there because they have issues that you don't exactly know about like I've seen it firsthand with friends and other people out of the bars\nThey have other issues and the the um mass and seem alcohol because they are trying to cover up those issues Wesley Perkins what what's your response to that question\nWell I think that if it if you start from they are going to a party are going to a ... bar point of view first of all of that is only as a segment of the population but you observe the people who were the most extreme and you go home and we're talking with your friends and have stories about\nUh the person who passed out on the dance floor or who started a fight or who uh got sick or if you had to clean them up and that sort of thing [noise] and uh we have millions of uh stories about them it can be funny it could be that it can be scary ... and so forth but we talked about it is what most of the talk is about\nAnd understandably these these are situations of concern in many instances\nBut when we talk about them so much and we have thousands of words for being intoxicated but only two or three for not being intoxicated moderation being sober at about students but you can think of thousands of words for being drunk\nThat's reflects the talked and so consequently it tends to normalize in people's perceptions that this blackout culture as we are talking about are describing it is something that is the norm and it's accepted ... not a big deal but in fact\nThe blackout behavior which can lead to a very serious consequences particularly in terms of\nOf a sexual assault or or or or ... serious problems over there but the it's it's largely knows a segment of the population but so many people don't speak out about it is against it because they think well it is enormous what most college students to read it it's the same phenomena of\nOf ah students saying\nWell most students do this but not me that is a very common pattern and because we just don't talk about the majority who are normal and it's not just from survey research we can demonstrate this we demonstrate this with anonymous B. C. testing on campuses campuses around the country who have done this and shown that\nThere may be twenty percent coming home late night with a intoxicated and the rest are coming home and not having consumed alcohol or had consumed very little [noise] so it's it's the biological evidence in Missouri ovens is overwhelming but it's still a serious\nProblem well let's go to Marie who's calling from Hartford, Connecticut you're on the Emery\nAnd there are I just wanted to comment on the seemingly close relationship to sexual assaults on college campuses and the use of alcohol my daughter is in a recent graduate and she confided in me that her circle and girlfriend a six or seven of them\nW. B. U. R. Boston NPR News station\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate to end debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court if he clears that hurdle the final votes would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios in who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well\nAnd one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend I Will say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this has gotta be close very I guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most\nAh let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n[noise]\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear in their entirety over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's first nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation it is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh\nThrough and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes Nina Totenberg is with us here in the you know what's on your mind\nWell you know Mitch McConnell is not what you'd call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing that final cleanup hit for their side\nAt but don't be fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for a matters that he wanted to advance\nWhether it's his agenda on the court or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything in this is true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nAnd you know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is\nThe Democratic troops to the extent that he can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today [noise] it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days and Brakkton what's the scene like this morning\nWe'll Steve there are\nSome crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the day is still young [noise] ah there is a group of speakers that are standing up to the side of me maybe a fifth yards away or they have had a number of people come up and share their stories a lot of people who have survived a\nSexual assaults ritual trauma and the sharing the story is basically saying we cannot put a Supreme Court you cannot elevates so much of the Supreme Court has been accused of such crime directions not been founded what what\nThey're saying shifts if one of the central tensions one of the things which really divided the country in the last several days [noise] as well but don't talk about that a little bit more on mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary\nThe well was poisoning from the outset\nWhen President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh from a list of names pre approved\nBy hard right special interest groups for whom the national interest is a trifling concern compared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court\n... worse than when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public discarding decades of bipartisan precedent and warning norms of transparency and the fairness\nAnd finally the dams broke\nUnder the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh committed a sexual assault in high school\nIn twenty and Eighteen the Republican majority conduct at a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings and Nineteen Ninety One look fair by comparison in this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side\nNo independent investigation of the fact to inform the questioning the even hired an outside counsel to put a witness Dr Ford on trial\nOnly at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus\nRepublicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations an investigation which was then severely ... scribe by the White House\nOur Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for delay knowing full well\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control of wind nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could've moved this nominee two weeks ago or one week ago\nDemocrats had nothing no say and don't when it comes to who\nComes to the floor but in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats for moving forward\nWhen it comes to complaining about the leg two words you never come from our Republican friends lips Merrick\nGarland Republicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction with this nomination in reality again\nUsing Democrats as a strongman because what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not do sort of come forward or conscience there and our Republican friends\nAre are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford\nAnd her deeply held memories of what happened to work of a smear campaign are they using doctor for the mere campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony\nAnd then trying to blame Democrats I don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee when future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons\nFrom the Senate's conduct here\nAs a shameful culmination of the scorched earth politics practice by the hard right in America people who will stop at nothing\nTo entrench an advantage on our nation's courts let the confirmation process for judge Kavanaugh be recorded as a sorry epilogue to the brazen theft\nOf Justice Scalia's seat the signal many us and\nA bipartisan cooperation and consultation on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices and for what\nFor whom or Senate Republican leaders willing to discard or semblance of fairness to confirm judge Brett Kavanaugh\nCertainly a product of an elite education but also someone with hard right conservative jurisprudence far far away from what average Americans\nHave raised them even higher this time when we vote later this morning we will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly well qualified to judge show our highest court\nNot anymore not after all this United States Senate will also be making a shape whether the states that partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence or will reaffirmed that in the United states of America\nEvery one is innocent until proven\nGuilty will either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically inconvenient\nAnd signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the center the mob can attack\nAnd the Senate case what will stand up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation will still define this body\nWill either give notice it totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough\nTo destroy an American flag or will declare that our society cannot must not will not set the bar so low so modern president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this\nExcellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of justice that have served our nation so well for so long for on full display\nSo let's sit back and sample of fear the choice moments that the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks the very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was announced as the president's choice\nWhere are the junior senator from Oregon declare that just nominate would pave the way they're tearing it his audience crowds of oral out protesters still filling out in the blanks on they're picking sides that weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\n\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great\nMoral struggle in which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil\nOr you're fighting against it more recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii you argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy\nAdmit and I'll listen to this\nHe deserves less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct that's from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nApparently got due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great confidence offering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties\nThat was incredibly enlightening\nInnocent jokes beer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings\nAt play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh fast most southern straight earlier this week just stop and consider the snap shots they\nAbsurd it they've started the indebtedness say\nIs our approach\nFrench court justice this is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\nBefore the end of\nDried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct and resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation\nMirror hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated it was clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats or consider this nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction and so called resistance until the final vote was called for a few weeks\nTheir average played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here\nThere were excuses for delay those fell flat\nThere were brush destruction of judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside factor at first and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice and Everytime\nHospital for women hospital the vulnerable people hospital workers same old tracks same old playbook but here's the problem\nThey all players weren't working the distortions were being liberated drowned out by the facts\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nCombined we read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court three hundred plus opinions were sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses for all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character nothing like the character so it was fair amount of president they owe taxes weren't working\nWasn't going to get the job done the resistance\nDemanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened next uncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpen into political weapon\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow mysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for the truth the community selected testimony organized a new hearing and most recently asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh FBI investigation\nBy any fish that are the facts the actual facts to base straightforward\nNo corroborating evidence not not\nWas producers support any\nOf the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh no corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiring or from anywhere else nothing well that wasn't enough for our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always sort of get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they've been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nThe Democrats move the goal posts yeah again\nI Believe the latest story you have to hold investigation is invalid now let's do this because individuals who had only recently been told secondhand or third hand about nearly forty or all allegations weren't treated as a central witnesses let me say that again\nThe latest story as it the whole investigation is invalid because the end of it\nOh second hand or third I Am about nearly forty year old allegations weren't treated as a central witnesses\nNever mind that they didn't actually witnessed anything they didn't want us anytime\nSo let's be clear madam president these are not witnesses these are people supposedly and possession of here say let's say first heard thirty five years after the suppose\nMr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called in this more normal setting but are these thoughts can drag out again I go back to that ... vote to repeal Obamacare where there's lots of last minute drama if you know the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nAbsolutely and reduce the number of senators that there's that very often this voting period is a time when you see senators looking quite college or they'll be standing and knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment\nDoesn't it absolutely aren't even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal you know historical things Senate do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask you about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree it would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that for an addict thumbs down vote on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the combination\nFor Mitch McConnell of off a lifetime really of campaigning for changed the federal judiciary and let's just this little listen to a little bit more as they go through the rules are killers\n[noise] mister Kenny Mr Udall Mr Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia is a no vote their Scott Detrow\nWe're seeing that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal\nOK so Lisa Murkowski is I Know um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe Manchin\nA at the moment it appears to be I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live out the vote is in is it fluid entail its final senators can change their minds and do you see that's right or you can't have a firm stance now the final vote goes until they banged the gap\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or as soon as they know who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has yet to Delaware went checked to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for ... cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week delay in barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report\nThe Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been a and they're really that are that in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at the report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is that the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench you would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving the the bench in the conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this\nConfirmation process is generated on the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering the relative to Democrats that according to our polling as is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been have been protesting this nomination he he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only will eggs senators look bad no evidence\nJoe Manchin of West Virginia who we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over until it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a you'd Vance does keep procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination\nOr you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabinet along with Joe mansion and Lisa Murkowski voting no Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he's one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state the cycle he's been a\nHead in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia He's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of his state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat and he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you were going to see a lot of liberal blowback I mentioned in the final month\nOf he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us\nThis vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex covenant has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nHe Steve could be with him\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell looks like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell and you know\nTo give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into them in terms of the midterms are barely a month away that's the big ... big deliverable for our base that frankly you know I think we're looking for something\nTo get him to the polls in November we we'd we'd been really lacking in the enthusiasm there'd been a doozy has them gap has a lot of the service has shown as NPR's surveys show the earlier this week that really aerobics in part because of the whole fight over Brett Kavanaugh to have a when I think it's just really going to be encouraging to Republicans\nHaving been through political campaigns Alex would you put a lot of credence in that a parent gain and enthusiasm right now we are months out from the election and Democrats except in this moment had been far more energized\nAbsolutely look ... mid term elections are all about turning out your voters a ... and that was a challenge for us going into the midterms oh it's why the out of\nPower party normally does very well in midterms because when you're when you're out of power when you're in the resistance your voters are going to be more amped up and the people\nThat are kind of fat and happy but now after this fight with Brett Kavanaugh and we've seen in the way that the Democrats for Republicans perspective have basically engaging in character assassination Republicans feel like they're not just attacking Brett Kavanaugh they're attacking\nConservativism and Republicans as a whole and Republicans are United and fired up in a way that we just have not been in the Trump era and I think to win to exceed is just sort of the nail on the coughing in terms of locking down and it is yes\nI'm Alex Conan's I Want to ask about the timing of this vote or Republicans had been perceived as rushing to get the vote done before the election because they were afraid they might lose the Senate it might be far more difficult to get a replacement nominee through because it was probably almost certainly be after the election [noise]\nI'd like to know if you feel that the Republican strategy actually was something different that Republicans were determined to have this vote come to a conclusion before the election because of what you said they wanted a deliverable as you termed it for Republican voters they had to have an accomplishments run on\nWell I think the process is the process and then a while I understand that Democrats would like to draw this out forever because they don't want to fill the seat with the Trump appointee from a Republican perspective we wanted\nWe want it ... a a another plenty on the bench last week so that they could be there for the start of the the new Supreme Court session\nSo I think in part of it is driven by the Supreme Court counter part of it is driven by the fact that we don't want to have a nominee just hanging out there indefinitely while their character assassination continues\nAnd then yes I Do think part of it is the ... the political factor\nWhich is there's an opening on the Supreme Court if we can put another Trump appointee and others salad\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where a dramatic vote has just taken place in the U.S Senate in the nomination to the Supreme Court of President Trump's choice Brett Kavanaugh it was an extremely close vote and a West Virginia senator who was the\nAh choose choose the presiding officer and was Shelley Moore capital of West Virginia let's give a listen\nOn this vote the yeas are fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nFifty one to forty nine as the gavel goes down almost as close as it could be if it had been a fifty fifty tie we presume that vice president Mike Pence would have come in\nAnd broken that time fifty one to forty nine almost entirely along partisan lines the one Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh is Joe Manchin of West Virginia the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh is Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nAnd we should emphasize before we begin our discussion here this is what's called a cloture vote this is not the final vote this was a vote to end the debate to kind of test\nBut not an absolute test because senators could choose to vote differently if they feel moved to do so when the final vote comes tomorrow\nNPR's Nina Totenberg has covered the United States Supreme court about as long as well\nAs anyone and she goes in our studios here along with NPR's Ron Elving who's covered politics for very long time as well good morning to get both in mourning mourning thanks for joining us throughout the morning here and uh Nina I Want to start with you let's just back away from the drama of the last couple\nOf weeks and talk about the historic consequences of this choice presuming that Kavanaugh gets through as he got through the vote today how is the U.S Supreme Court to different court than it would have been a with a different nominee or than it was before he came\n[noise] well it was going to be a much more conservative court regardless whoever Donald Trump pick from his famous list it was going to be someone way more conservative than Anthony Kennedy the man that is being replaced\nAnd that will kill the court that was sort of like a balance sports sometimes mainly going in the conservative direction but about a quarter of the time and some of those very big cases going the other way\nTo the liberal side now in almost every case that is a closely contested one where the voters five to four I think you can expect the conservatives to win and\nThey may move on an agenda to increase executive power to decrease actually congressional power in some ways to\nAnd to um to take on\nLegal questions that have only been sort of on the wish list of hardcore conservatives for fifty to a hundred years\nNow it's interesting you use the word agenda I think that if some conservatives ah we're listening to you they might object to the word agenda and argue that conservative judges or just applying the law as they see it but it is an agenda in the sense that it's a very different way of viewing and reading the law correct this would\nBe don't even this term which is so far pretty doggy term frankly with not very compelling big hot sexy cases even this time so far with a half the docket agreed to and the rest yet to come\nThere is three cases asking for reversal of very longstanding precedence so you could see a lot of the law changed quite dramatically and some of it would not make headlines you would only\nSee it when you went to do something and found you could no longer do that whether you're on the right or the left you could be blocked where you could be suddenly find as people are now finding for example that the court in recent years has on the question if arbitration\nSaid to people you can't bring a class action challenging a clause in it and when you were hired that says any dispute over salary or anything else has to go to arbitration you can't bring a class action suit in court challenge that\n... that example because it reminds us that while Kavanaugh's nomination has been viewed through the lens of roe versus Wade of abortion rights there is an almost infinite variety of cases\nIn which presuming he is confirmed on the final vote tomorrow he would have an opportunity to rule and they would include abortion rights and a lot of things short of overturning roe versus Wade and they would include labor rights and\nAnd and many other things let's also remember that there was a relatively true statement made by Charles Schumer the Democrat from New York when he gave a speech shortly before the vote\nAnd he said Democrats have been accused of delaying the nomination Democrats have not he said and what he means is Republicans have had the majority Republicans reset the Supreme Court rules so that a so that a minority cannot block\nA action and so if there's been any delay it's been been because of division and the Republican ranks there've been a number of Republicans who have been uncertain votes one of them Lisa Murkowski who ultimately voted no on this test vote here this morning Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nAnother one being Susan Collins of Maine who issued in a sense a partial decision and let's listen to the words that you spoke to reporters a little bit earlier today we're not going to hear Susan Collins of Maine but what you said out\nIs out on the floor is that I'm voting yes voting yes on cloture however uh I Am not going to announce until a little bit later on today what I'm going to do later what I'm going to do in that second vote which is the way it works ride Ron Elving\nIt is but it let's let's be Frank it it's pretty rare for people to vote for cloture and then turn around and vote and and I didn't really matter what we should do that\nWell that the justification that people put forward is they say I Believe in fairness to both sides we should have some more floor debate and we should hear all the arguments as though we haven't\nAnd at the end of that we should\nBe fair enough to this candidate to give him a final vote on the floor now I plan to vote no but I think he should have that final vote on the floor\nShe has not said that let's be you know she did and I say that\nAnd and I think there'd be an awful lot of folks who'd be very surprised if tomorrow she votes no but she has that option she may I don't think she's actually well who knows whether or not she's enjoying the amount of pressure that he's on like she does not seem to be having a good time but there was a time when the rules\nWere different when that sort of thing what happened you'd get sixty votes for cloture and then maybe you only fifty two votes to pass\nAnd now you had a principal and the principal was I don't believe we should block this person from getting a final vote and win the majority clearly favors this person I don't favor the person but I also don't favor cutting off their chance to have a final vote with a filibuster\nOkay so we've talked about Republicans who have been doubtful Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who was a no vote at least on cloture Susan Collins of Maine who was a yes vote on cloture but it's held out at least for a number of hours today her decision on the final vote\nAnd then there is a Republican who was never expressed any doubt about that nomination and let's listen to a little bit of today's speech on the Senate floor from Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nEvery effort was made to ensure that the fact free verdict of the mob and the media would win out over the actual\nEvidence made sure the mob prevail\nBut they are uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say\nAround here the son of a bottle or\nThe Senate is not quite had the final say but they got to step closer to a day with his fifty one to forty nine vote\nThat we have been covering and then we will continue covering here and special coverage from NPR News let's bring another voice into the conversation now ... is executive director of the Georgetown Institute of politics and public service a veteran democratic strategist did I pronounce your name correctly mile\nYou got an excellent I'm very excited thank you very much so what are you thinking about as you learned this news of the fifty one forty nine votes to advance Kevin\n[noise] well you know it's all going to come down I think the person to watch uh as you guys have been talking about now that she's actually two people I'm kinda curious to watch over the next twenty four hours a and they are the um [noise]\nUh Susan Collins a while we'll see what she has to say at three o'clock mhm [noise] but uh you know she might be actually trying to\nUh go back to sort of regular order in the Senate and saying you know he deserves a vote I'm going to vote no but he deserves to vote that could be possible I think like Lee ... possible and the other person is Joe mansion who\nUh I think Democrats are probably split and whether or not they're surprised a an his vote today a to a vote for cloture um but he also could come out against so we'll see I think right now\nUh if if I were a betting man I Would probably bad for narrow confirmation tomorrow but what those two senators do over the next twenty four hours is going to tell us everything we need to know\nI Want to note there are so many layers to this story there is the question of Senate votes there is the broad question of policies that could change laws that could be interpreted or reinterpreted as Nina Totenberg has been discussing and then there's the reality of politics we are deep into an election campaign where it is seen as possible that one\nOr plausibly although it's a long shot in both\nHouses of Congress could flip\n\n\n\nIs special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep in Washington DC where we have been listening in the last little while to a historic vote on the floor of the United States Senate\nThe vote was fifty one forty nine the fifty one goes in favor of Brett Kavanaugh President Trump's nominee to serve on the Supreme Court he's not quite there yet this was a vote to end the debate\nAnd then the final vote comes tomorrow we would anticipate a final vote that may go exactly the same way fifty one to forty nine but senators are by no means obligated to vote the same way and sometimes they do\nVote differently on final passage than they would on ending the big as a matter of fact one Senator Susan Collins of Maine has specifically said that she voted yes this morning to advance the nomination but then she would give a different statement sometime later today perhaps around three o'clock\nAs to what her actual votes would be on the floor tomorrow so\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp the help committee health education labor and uh uh the ... pensions there's your help good yeah\nWell done she voted she voted her out of committee but said that you still had concerns about how ... how much you would be strong on public education\nAt the end of the day she and Murkowski in tandem wound up voting against a colon and for or against 'em do off and wound up forcing\nA Mike Pence to come and break the tie which was the first time I had been broken in a decade since March to dominate when Dick Cheney has come down and break the tie on a package of tax\nJust a reminder the devoted to it was a vote for continuing the process the vote tomorrow is the vote on the substance and your mood choose to vote differently on the substance than you do on the process let's bring another voice into this conversation as we continue our special coverage from NPR News ... executive vice president for policy of the leadership\nConference and she was once an advisor to Democrat Patrick Leahy was one of the senior Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee which of course considered Kavanaugh's nomination ...\nCome on and so what are you thinking about this for\nWell I'm thinking it's interesting that and notable that there's\nBipartisan opposition to even proceeding or ending the debate on Brett Kavanaugh I think that is very revealing about how widespread the concerns are about his conduct and I know one of your earlier guest said that there was not a hint of misconduct but\nThat's just simply not true the American public saw serious allegations of misconduct brought forth when Dr Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the committee and that was watched by so many American household\nFifty yards and it's not correct to say there was no evidence because there's no evidence of someone sworn testimony and considerable detail but let me push back on something that you just said there you said there was bipartisan opposition to continuing debate\nThere was one Republican one Republican out of fifty one who voted no\nAh this has been a very very partisan vote in ... equally part of some of the Democratic side as\nWell I don't think I think it is\nBipartisan by by the nature of having Lisa Murkowski vote no on cloture and voting against voting on against cloture voting to end debate is a very a serious thing for a Republican senator to do\nA usually people uh want to at least allow the vote to proceed or the nomination to proceed so for her to say no today as opposed to just saying no tomorrow when it was the confirmation vote it sends a really strong signal\nAbout how troubled she is by this by this nominees fitness to serve on our highest court so I Do think it's remarkable I think that is very unusual and I do think later this afternoon we'll hear more from\nSusan Collins about how she will ultimately vote on the confirmation vote but I think this nomination is in trouble and so today's procedural vote is just the preview for uh the the consequential vote which is a confirmation vote currently scheduled for tomorrow\nYou don't presume that this was settled I don't need a Totenberg\nSo you know there's been a lot of criticism of the way the Democrats and in particular a ranking member Feinstein handled the Christine Blasey Ford letter in early July [noise]\nUm and you you were a senior staff member for Senator Leahy when he was either the chairman or the ranking member I don't remember which are Christian shifts both so\nAt ... and and Dianne Feinstein and said well I was just protecting her confidentiality but is there a third way this could have gone\nIt it was there a better way for the Democrats to have handled it realistically now\nSo I think it is it's in retrospect I'm sure people have different views but what how I think Senator Feinstein as ranking member handled this as\nShe handled it as a you know the woman who came forward wanted her confidentiality protected did not want to become public and I think Senator Feinstein honored her wishes\nAnd I think that's admirable but other people think it is less admirable but uh you know I think in retrospect I'm sure people have many different views but I think Senator Feinstein showed that she really understands what the whole me too movement is about\nWhich is when you are a survivor of sexual assault it should be up to you to decide when to tell your story if ever you decide to tell your story\nAnd I'm thinking about that was it impossible for her to tip off the FBI to mention that to someone so there could be very quietly looked into\nWell I think there is an interesting story that hasn't gotten much attention where Senator Whitehouse referred a you know a tip someone had come forward from Rhode Island or to the chairman staff and the chairman staff released the person's name\nUm so I think that's just an example of this fear that there wasn't the kind of trust that you could ...\nAnd still preserved confidentiality or share it even with the FBI and still preserve confidentiality so I view it as that or if I really was respecting the survivor here and I think that's actually something to be praised not criticizing\nI suppose we should mention in the end confidentiality wasn't held the memo was leads to a publication called the intercept Feinstein or staff have been accused of doing that I Believe she denied it there are other people that could have been there was another lawmaker at least one of the lawmaker who uh had possession of the letter we don't know who else might have been told\nAnd in what way but in the end it leaked do you believe it all to mostly\nHad to leak was there an option where nobody ever found out about this allegation which had been uncorroborated than that I had an individual or didn't want to go on the record\nI I don't know who leaked it but I think that\nWhat this experience has shown and many centers have been confronted with us over the past week as there are thousands and thousands if not millions of women who have stories of sexual assault who will never tell anyone\nOr who will sudden he confessed to a senator or they're interrupting in in an elevator I think what this last couple of weeks has shown America is how many women have experienced sexual assault\nAnd there are thousands of reasons why they don't report it don't tell anyone and part of the big reason is they don't think people will believe them they don't think that it will do any good\nAnd I'm I'm really worried that\nChristine Blasey Ford's treatment and President Trump mocking her to laughter and a campaign rally ... exactly the wrong message to those survivors everywhere that they won't be listened to they won't be taken seriously and there'll be mocked\nYou know let me ask about one thing along those lines from our colleague David Greene spoke earlier today with Julia ... she's a journalist for the Atlantic who wrote a long article a touching on some of the issues that you just mentioned and she describes herself as a victim of past sexual assault when she was in her teams\nBut said there was a difference between the broad issue of needing to listen to women needing to take seriously and investigate these kinds of allegations of difference between that broad issue and the specific question of whether a specific individual can be proved guilty through some neutral process here\nHas there been some confusion of one with the other on this issue people who are concerned about the broader issue have assumed that Kavanaugh must be guilty because they're concerned about the issue or the reverse for that matter\nWell first I Would say this is not about his guilt or not kill this is a job interview and Republicans prevented\nAny corroborating or supporting witnesses from being hurt by the committee and then Republicans prevented the FBI from reaching out to people who would support Christine Blasey Ford's account or Debbie Ramirez is account so I find it really troubling that\nAnd streaming or W.

you Nelson NPR News Berlin okay\nIf you went looking to trace the arc of this me to moment we're living through you'd be hard pressed to come up with better bookends than the following today the U.S Senate voting to cut off debate on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court and moved to a final vote despite allegations of sexual assault and has passed\nAnd one year ago today with the New York times broke a bombshell story\nThe times headline on October fifth twenty Seventeen read Harvey Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades or one of the two reporters who broke that Weinstein story was Jodi Kantor and she joins me now hey there\nHi how are you I'm well thank you I started here you just pointed out today a picture of what you were up to a year ago today and it's it's a bunch of you all crowded around to the computer and the New York Times' newsroom about to hit send on the Weinstein story and you write none of us knew what was going to happen when we sent that out into the world\nDidn't my partner Megan to me and I we certainly felt the power of the story as we were reporting it and because of the times was doing bigger investigation of sexual harassment we knew that this is part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were reporting on Fort factory workers\nBut you never know what's gonna happen to investigation wet it's when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt party\nLike to say as we were working on it he said hurting align skiing is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA andme ... really with not a household name 'em\nAnd and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was ... years ago by trying to\nTake off globally but it just kept going\nGoing there were so many times in the past year when I productions that this was going to\nBurn out or you know the women were authentic simmered down or the news was finally going to stop and he never did and what happening with judge Kavanaugh I think is representative of that there's a feeling that this reckoning only continues engrossed Becker let me ask you this if if Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend\n[noise] do you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too\nI think if he's confirmed there will be massive today about what this means for me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which probably have some validity I'll give you the ... the obvious one is that people will say this is a setback he this confirms anyway\nUh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't matter um\nWomen were ... you know ignored yet again this is a replay of any to hell the other argument however is that\nEspecially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country she put high school on the table\nRight she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the president's and we also saw moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they were able to literally stop the national conversation for a second and say listen to these stories\nOne footnote to this conversation before I let you go Jody ... we just heard there from our reporter psoriasis or hurting also that today also marks the award of the Nobel Peace prize prize is often Xena sending a political message\nUm any word went to people working to stop sexual violence as a weapon of war I Wonder if that's one more book and if you like to the global scope of this me to\nMoment that you hope that motion a year ago\nI woke up to the same news and have the same side I think it's a reminder scale I think it's a reminder of the global reach that and also media reminder perspective at a moment when we're all so immersed in the ... news media this as a reminder that this
