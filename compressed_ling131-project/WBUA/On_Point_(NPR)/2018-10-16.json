Bush spelled out his vision for advancing freedom globally through American foreign policy\nSo it is a policy of the United states\nDo seeking support the growth of democratic movements\nAnd institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world\nEven to\nA different people from two different parties here a spouse ... roughly the same idea but you call this policy failure right why well\nThere's lots of different reasons the easiest way to see this is look at the world we had in Nineteen Ninety three were restricted everything was going to go swimmingly and the world we're in today are back in Nineteen Ninety three of the United states is on good terms with all the major powers including Russia and China\nA democracy is in fact spreading into Eastern Europe and in parts of Latin America or Iran has no nuclear enrichment capability at all in Nineteen Ninety three Iraq has been disarmed after the first Gulf War\nOr the Oslo peace process is underway ah so we were thinking that maybe we're going to get you know peace in the middle east as well as just stored Mary optimism\nThere now fast forward to twenty Eighteen\nUm the uh relationship with Russia and China is worse than it's been since the Cold War\nOr there's been no progress towards peace in the middle east in fact most people believe the two state solution at the United states has actively promoted is farther away than ever\nIran had a as many as Nineteen thousand centrifuges before ... signing the nuclear deal but they're essentially all eight nuclear power and oh India Pakistan and North Korea have all tested nuclear weapons\nAnd finally democracy is in retreat in lots of different places of Freedom House are reported last year that it was the twelfth consecutive year of a decline in global freedom\nSo when you have President Bush thing but that's our goal and tyranny in the world that gold doesn't seem to be working out one final point of the economist magazine last year and it's democracy index downgraded the United states from being a full democracy to a flawed democracy\nWhich seems to me if the project here was to spread American values far and wide that project has failed and was quite significant geopolitical consequences for us as well as the costs we've seen in a variety of different places\nWithout a doubt but are you saying that uh for example the retreat of democracy of ... worldwide is it that it can be see that that American foreign policy efforts can be seen as having contributed to that retreat\nI think they've contributed they're not the sole cause as well but for example I think we pushed democracy very quickly er into places uh Eastern Europe\nAnd what we're seeing now the backsliding in Hungary backsliding in Poland or suggests that that project has not gone particularly well certainly American efforts to a transforming the middle east at the at the point of a rifle barrel in fact have clearly failed\nA you know had the United states not invaded Iraq and two thousand three would not have gotten ISIS\nUm the effort to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi led to a failed state and other American interventions in places like Somalia and Yemen have made things worse rather than better\nBy the way from all of this is going on then countries like Russia and China and Iran and North Korea and others sit there and say well the American objective is to overthrow other governments and turn them into democracies we're not really full democracy so we have to be worried about that so what can we do\nOne reaction is you seize Crimea to stop in Ukraine from moving towards the west and other possibilities you get nuclear weapons because then the United states will have to leave you alone and might even be willing to meet and talk with you as well\nSo in a sense the project which is an admirable when in terms of his ideals tends to generate a backlash in a variety of places\nSo one of the questions or that you that you explore in the book the key question is how this notion of the primacy of the U. S. project to spread democracy persisted for so long because\nI mean we can we went through some of the examples but it wasn't on impeachable a part of U.S foreign policy for so long you couldn't even question this as one of the duty that America had to the world being this guiding light for democracy\nBut you said that there is an entrenched foreign policy elite that helps\nA that idea that notion persist across administration who are they who is this foreign policy elite\nYou're talking about a it's a a broad a group of set of people are I Would say you know when a Ben Rhodes the former national security advisor referred to the foreign policy blob\nIn Washington that's essentially what I'm Talking about but we're talking about the formal institutions of government the parts of the actual government bureaucracy the defense department intelligence services State Department so they are part of this of this for a whole sort of think tank world the PIN number of supporting institutions in Washington that\nRight to comment on foreign issues on I've pretty much daily basis then of course we have very special interest groups in lobbies on a whole series of issues from arms control to human rights to ethnic lobbies to the business community\nAs well I Would put in parts of the media who writes about foreign affairs and of course people like me in academia who are also actively engaged in writing who train students and off and go to Washington\nTo work so that's who I'm Talking about um and what's striking to me about most of that group not every single member of it but most of that group is the remarkable consensus behind what I've called the birth of Gemini this idea that the United states first of all has to exercise global leadership in every corner of the world\nAnd second it has to do that and the pursuit of the spreading of these various liberal ideals\nAnd there's a whole I could talk about the different sort of sacred cows within their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines\nIn favor of that you see this and the fact that most Democrats supported the Iraq War back in two thousand three\nUm you see that in the fact that people tend to circulate amongst different think tanks without much a difference because they're all kind of interchangeable or to some degree and finally I think you see that in fact that the various quotation soup and uh playing here from Republicans and Democrats alike all subscribe to the same set of ideals\nBut as I Want to get to them in in a second about how you ... you see this foreign policy elite is on accountable but Iraq is it the disaster of the Iraq War is isn't it it's an interesting moment to discuss here because I Want to dive into that a little bit\n'cause he and he said that the majority of Democrats supported the Iraq War but I wasn't that in part because it was also sold to the American people as a war for the security of national security of the United states I mean that's part of what you say here that the foreign policy elite as\nFrequently are collected issues of security in order to uh to get people on board with this idea of spreading democracy I mean isn't Iraq where the perfect example of that um\nI I think it ... it shows you how easy it is to steer 'em a stir the debate and one of the points I make in the book is that\nThe foreign policy elite down especially presidents in the executive branch have all sorts of advantages in selling policies to the world\nUm and I point out that there's actually a pretty significant gap between what the American people actually say they want they want more restrained foreign policy they don't want to engage in all these crusades around the world [noise]\nSo how do you convince them to go along\nWell you do the things that the Bush administration did but again it's not unique to the Bush administration you inflate threats\nAnd New England has the dealers featuring the eight passenger pilots and GPS equipped to court for life around here learn more at Honda dealers of New England dot com [noise]\nI'm Jeremy ... said after Pete Souza left his job as White House photographer for President Obama he became a star on Instagram\nUsing photos of Obama to comment on the Trump Administration I correct myself up sometimes when I when I was just the right picture I comment Pete Souza on his new book shade a tale of two presidents that next time on here now\nLaurent new Ninety going ... NPR News to [noise]\n\nSome point I'm making a check her body was speaking today with Stephen Walt his new book is the hell of good intentions America's foreign policy elite and the decline of us primacy\nA and professor wealth lots of comments coming you know we just read a couple of them to you on Twitter pole moves or us is saying questioned the premise that the u._s. was ever really on a humanitarian intervention military or otherwise I says\nShould counters arguments are limits of allowable debate are showing\nA David Crandall says liberal Gemini missing from our discussion is the counter effect that liberal values of human rights et cetera have been used as a stalking horse for American corporate had Gemini which is highly questionable democratizing influence or just your thoughts on on those two comments first of all the malt\nI'm I'm sort of sympathetic to both comments I've never thought that the American foreign policy was heavily driven I Want to be very carefully are heavily driven by corporate interests in this sort of narrow sense yes the United states has favorite of a you know globalized economy and that's good for some corporations not all\nOf them and in some cases there have been corporations that had particular influence over U.S foreign policy but I don't think that's what we do we do a lot of things that actually don't benefit corporations at all go back to the\nUh Nineteen nineties for example a Dick Cheney when he was running Halliburton used to complain about our sanctions happy foreign policy 'cause it was making it impossible for Halliburton and oil services corporation to do business with Iraq were to do business with Iran\nCheney wanted to make money but our foreign policy was one of sanctioning\nBoth of them and then that very same person if ... during the Iraq War and Halliburton got to go in and uh you know and have billions of dollars of us contracts there\nThat's right I'm a ... and finally uh I I think the United states does not devote a lot of effort to a purely humanitarian intervention it's hard to get the United states to do something purely to help other people I'm not talking about rescue missions and things and things like that [noise]\nUm but I Do think that motivation has been there a that his ... has driven certainly the intervention in Libya was I think driven in good part by the desire to prevent what people suspected would be if not a genocide at least mass killings in ... and the desire to end now\nAt that point then uh the sort of desire also to try and do regime change took over and what had originally been justified by purely humanitarian concerns and approved by the U.N Security Council on that basis became something bigger\nYeah but so just to follow up on this idea of a corporate interests when we're talking about the foreign policy elite in Washington now are some of those corporations the funding sources for many of the think tank we were just talking about and the previous segment\nYou know there's no question and and if you look I think at the role of\nOf the military what do you know Eisenhower calls the military industrial complex they are very actively involved in funding a variety of think tanks organizations who now not surprising need and want the United states to have an ambitious foreign policy and a very strong military because that's where they make the money\nAll right well lots of college just looked at least get a couple of them in here ... calling from coming Georgia you're on the image\nI think so much for taking my call 'em you know I I just think are under under our current president um who is an amoral agent uh mostly concerned with well\nI worry that are American values\nAre going to be malleable or that they might even be for sale I think the current controversy around Saudi Arabia and uh the uh journalists a highlight this conflict of interest and I just want to know your thoughts are on our values for sale\nMitch thank you for your call Stephen Walt well\nIn some respects I think uh our values have always been to some degree for sale or there have always been a offensive trade offs that there were set of ideals that the United states has stood for and wanted to promote in the world and there were other imperatives as well with our national security or others [noise]\nUh and we have always sort of wrestled with which of these uh to favor and most of the time it's your national security and economic prosperity that tends to wind out\nOf most of the time we are seeing a particularly stark\nA vision of that right now with the controversy over the possible murder of a Saudi journalist can show you are in Istanbul and it's interesting to see that the you know for example there's this supposedly this big conference in Saudi Arabia or next week and a bunch of corporate sponsors and other participants have been pulling out of it says\nPresident Trump has been waffling it seems to me on this one ah that his initial statements were were quite forgiving he seems to be you know in typical Trump being fashion\nKicking up sort of squid ink cloud of distortion about it\nUm [noise] it's I think you know the the concern the caller has is exactly right here and I think one of the larger issues with President Trump is his inability to separate out some of his own personal interest and possibly personal financial interest from the broader interest of the country\nWell so let's talk more about the Trump Administration now because the you open your book saying that um then candidate Donald Trump had a clear articulation of his view of these foreign policy failures that we've been talking about throughout this hour Stephen Walt so so let's just just to remind folks what what the president then candidate\nForeign policy here he is on the campaign trail from April twenty sixteen\nUnfortunately after the cold or a foreign policy veered badly of course we failed to develop a new vision for a new time in fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense\nLogic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance which led to one foreign policy disaster after another they just kept coming and coming\nThat's Donald Trump on April two thousand sixteen now Stephen what we could talk a lot about the foreign policy decisions the president has made since then about the Paris climate accord about or his or just discussions with North Korea about the Iran nuclear program but I really want to focus on Syria here for for a moment because\nUh you know we just heard the president twenty sixteen saying lots of foreign policy disasters led by foolishness an arrogance\nBut now we're hearing a for example national security adviser John Bolton\nTalking about extending the American mission in Syria beyond the Syrian civil war and to containment of Iran for as long as Iranian forces are in Syria or Iranian backed militias are anywhere in the region\nA so here's the national security visor Bolton again issuing a stern warning to Iran or at a group called a United against nuclear on summit last month\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed the hell to pay\nThe John Bolton there are Stephen Walt not necessarily talking about a democratizing force but a an expansion of the U.S military mission in Syria so is the is the Trump Administration being pulled by the same a foreign policy forces that we've been talking about this hour\nUm I think in the twenty sixteen campaigned a Trump who's not a sophisticated thinker on these things but he did into it or that something had gone badly wrong with U.S foreign policy and that resonated with the American people are when he said you know American foreign policy is complete and total disaster a lot of people out of their heads in agreement\nAnd that was especially effective against Hillary because she could out or tried to counter foreign policy credentials but I think what you've seen is a ... a since Trump became president although his style his approach to the presidency and has\nA public style of handling diplomacy whether it's by Twitter or by his personal interactions with other leaders is completely different and I think we're remarkably counterproductive\nWhat strikes me most about it is how he has been pulled back in a lot of these same directions I'm certainly uh the fact that I having complained about nation building and we're not going to we're going to get out of the nation building business\nYou know he sent more troops to Afghanistan or as you recounted he now seems to be willing to commit the United states to stay in Syria a much longer even though we don't really have an idea of what we're trying to accomplish potentially indefinitely essentially indefinitely I'm\nA he has bought a hook line and sinker the idea that Iran is some mortal threat to American interests are throughout the middle east uh and that of course\nHas led him to double down with Saudi Arabia doubled down with a Egypt a double town or with Israel as well but notice that those are all of our traditional Middle East ally so he's not doing anything different there\nUm you'll recall he was very critical of NATO ... says NATO countries head start spending more they had actually started spending more even in the Obama administration would of course she has no reaffirmed the American a commitment to NATO in a variety of ways as well\nW.

G came from a Turkish media in Turkish officials but but what role does turkey play here and and how important are they to to this case yeah\nThat's the big question so all that we know really about the details of what happened to your office she'll get has come from unnamed Turkish officials speaking to journalists including myself\nMostly sunny today hides in the mid fifties should be partly cloudy tonight lows around forty degrees tomorrow mostly sunny eyes will be still in the mid fifties right now fifty degrees in Boston this is WVU our\nReport for on point comes from Carver night offering secure data protection solutions for growing businesses including automatic back up for a server than computers higher veil ability and disaster recovery solution and automated data migration learn more in ... dot com and\nPosters Smith printing posters on wrinkle resistant fold double fabric that transport flat for conference presentations poster Smith provides a service to research communities worldwide learned more foster Smith dot com [noise]\n\nDoes it on point I'm making a chocolate bar ... we're talking about renewed scrutiny on us Saudi relations following the disappearance and reported\nKilling of journalists and dissident Jamal ... showed gee\nI'm joined today by Steven Cook he's a senior fellow for Middle East and African studies at the council on Foreign Relations and also joined today by Bernard Haykel professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University\nA and a professor heckle ... before the break he said what it's worth exploring further this question of a President Trump's relationship\nWith the house of salad and then perhaps we should even focus on Jared Kushner and his relationship with crown prince Mohammed or been some on I mean how would you describe how close they are\n[noise] well you you probably know that the first overseas trip that President Trump took was to Riyadh yes where he was fed it in and received you know as a great kind of international statesmen and he you know seem to appreciate that\nI'm a lot um and then a special relationship developed with ah the president's son in law Jared Kushner and to deal with a whole series of topics one was at the fight against ISIS and the ... campaign\nOr the other was the Israeli Palestinian peace process and lost the was the uh relationship the business and economic relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia and this was at a time when the Saudis where\nOur instill our reforming diversifying their economy they want it to invest in the United states they want to buy a lot of things from the U. S. and build strong connections with us institutions banks universities et cetera\nSo that relationship is is is a very personal and tight one and I think um and this is my speculation but I think that a significant amount of the ah attention an anger that has been directed at Saudi Arabia has to do with um the feelings that many Americans feel about President Trump\nOK well Steven Cook said the ... the president has said that he he would vote quote severe punishment right if\nIf a Saudi or influence or us out of Saudi Arabia is proven to be behind the death of ... uh but at the same time the president said he doesn't want a\nThat punishment to effect arms sales for example I'm a bit at least ten billion dollars in arms sales to the Saudi Government so what position does is put the president it\nWell the president certainly been all over the place on this issue as you point out I I think he's statements\nHave a be in an effort to provide time for the Turks and the Saudis to figure out a story I think it's abundantly clear that the president is in an awkward position and who's inclination is\nActually to continue the relationship with Saudi Arabia a uninterrupted\nAh I think that the statement about severely punishing the Saudis\nWas or something where the White House was acknowledging a the pressure and a two weeks for commentary about the disappearance of democracy spoke to\n'em but uh overall uh this is a president who has not made human rights a priority\nAnd hum has looked upon ah Washington's relations with other countries particularly countries in the middle east and particularly Saudi Arabia\nAs a very important for American commercial transactions and he has mentioned a hundred and ... ... a hundred and ten billion dollar\nBy the Trump Administration but was actually agree to under the Obama administration but signed after President Trump a came into office yeah\nAnd I appreciate the correction that I had said ten billion but you're right it's a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal but the point Steven Cook I mean we\nWe can talk about uh the economic ties between Saudi Arabia and the United states but they're also strategic very deep strategic elements to this long standing relationship between these two countries in the house sensual of an ally is Saudi Arabia in the region and does that\nDoes that does that sort of essential nature make it is that the thing that has allowed multiple administrations to talk about human rights on one hand but overlook human rights violations by the Saudis on the other well\nThat has long been the dilemma for American policymakers when looking at Saudi Arabia as well as quite frankly other countries in in the middle east\nI'm ... and Saudis importance it really depends on how you look at the middle east right now\nOr even the fact that the Trump Administration regards Iran as it's number one priority encountering Iranian influence around the region\nIn Saudi Arabia is critically important to the to the United states you've had 'em Egypt which has lurched from one crisis to another really can't project power around the region\nOr many of the other countries um are too small um to play a leading role as America's ally they can be part of a an American regional order\nA but a Saudi Arabia really is the the big country it's the custodian of the two holy mosques which gives it a certain\nLegitimacy in in the Muslim world it is a large producer of a of of oil it's not the largest any longer the United states is um but still many of a Washington is most important allies were trading partners do rely upon\nA oil from Saudi Arabia and the fact that we the United states who's interested in in a global capitalism water or the fact that the Chinese the Koreans the Japanese the Indians are are all depended upon oil coming out of this region in significant portions of it coming from Saudi Arabia\nThe United states has a a a compelling interest\nUh in how to reduce the building and supporting Saudi Arabia security well I think\nSo I just want to get hurt it's okay I just want to get Bernard Haykel view in on this for for professor he called for as long as there's this unified approach between the United for between Washington and in Riyadh in terms of their view of the Iranian threat\nDoes that make it impossible to imagine a significant break between these between these two countries between the United states and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nUm I I think it is impossible and I've described the relationship as a structural relationship not a transactional want even though President Trump seems to characterize it as a transactional relationship\nThat the relationship with Saudi Arabia you know started in Nineteen forty five\nIt was ... they were instrumental in the Cold War and the fight against communism their instrumental in regulating the global oil market which is a fungible and global market which means that if any disruption happens in Saudi Arabia even if we are entirely self sufficient in the United states we would feel the effects\nIn terms of price immediately they are fundamentally important the Saudis for the stability of the of the region which has been a longstanding American\nOr an interest in this part of the world you also have Iran you have Islam you have to fight against ah the the radical Islamists the Saudis are instrumental again and fighting against radical Islamism and in particular\nAnd a mom and been some on M. B. S. because he has made it\nA policy of the kingdom to turn away from Islamism and towards nationalism and populism\nAnd that again is you know very important for the United states because if he if he succeeds in Saudi Arabia that would set a pattern for the entire region right there are many reasons for this relationship and it it transcends either Trump or MPs\nI Want to play a clip here are on sort of how that tension is playing out amongst other uh leaders in Washington on CBS his face the nation on Sunday Republican Senator Marco Rubio said that the United states relationship with Saudi Arabia goes beyond that a hundred and ten billion dollars in arms deals we were talking about\nI Would just say it's unfortunate because Saudi Arabia is an important part of our Middle Eastern strategy they are a key leverage and heads point against Iranian influence in the region but that cannot supersede our commitment to human rights\nSteven Cook ... what does the United states\nStands to lose perhaps morally if that's the right approach to take care Bye bye this continuing close relationship with with Saudi Arabia I mean we have\nThe listeners on line who is who talking to us about what about uh you know remembering the terrorists that came from Saudi Arabia after nine eleven and again Yemen comes up over and over again there's a U.S a hundred year famine that Yemen is facing the worst humanitarian catastrophe\nA ... in the world right now largely driven by Saudi bombing there I mean it does not the United states stand to lose something by\nWith the so called inclusion tight relationship\nWell this is the central dilemma for American policymakers who ah want uh to secure American security interests around the region\nOr who wants to fight the Islamic state and wants to counter Iranian influence\nUm it has allies in the region who will do things that are run counter to American values and oftentimes with American either ... American policymakers of overlooking or with their blessing ah this is\nYou fall collection is on view at Charles River apparel dot com\nAnd then gained working to make higher education more affordable with us engage unlimited subscriptions students can access over twenty two thousand text books online homework access codes and study God send gauge unlimited B.

G who joined today by Steven Cook he's senior fellow for Middle East and Africa studies at the council on Foreign Relations and by Bernard Haykel he's professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University and we're at one eight hundred and forty three eight to five five that's eight hundred\nFor two three talk and let's go to some callers here Dolores is calling from Waterford, Pennsylvania you're on the air Dolores\nHigh magna and hello to your gas up before I have a couple of questions I like to make a point I'd if anyone wants to get some good insight into the kingdom of Saudi Arabia they need to read when Al Al Sharif book daring to drive it's a good insight\nUm it's a good read and it provides a an eye opening a exposure to how these guys operate\nNow here's my question I mean it's going to believe who in their right mind is going to believe that this was conducted by a rogue element you had an individual show up with a bone saw if you I mean to me that's a signal you intended to conduct\nSome sort of nefarious this had been premeditated and my other point\nIn his ... somebody you for a second so those reports so far the only the only sources for those reports are Turkish officials unnamed Turkish officials so that hasn't actually been independently confirmed it just I just want to remind folks of that but go ahead oh\nOkay and hear Donald Trump\nIs the one who has claimed that the media is the enemy of the people and only not only speculating of course 'cause I don't have evidence but in my mind is I'm looking at this and you have you know the world's leader\nClaiming that the media is the enemy of the people I mean an MBA circle they think well shall we can take this guy out who's gonna care ...\nI mean I personally I think Trump could care less about the show in that interview on the White House lawn yes say was you know another act it's another lie I mean I Am hoping that Congress ... you know get some intestinal fortitude hair\nAnd can can do something yeah I'm In that show these global dictators that maybe they have a friend and Donald Trump a gift and Donald Trump\nBut that the U.S Congress is going to start taking some action against the human rights violations that are occurring around the globe will\nDelivers thank you for your call Steven Cook let me turn turn that to you a first of all do it to ... assertion that the president's own rhetoric against journalists may have emboldened ah folks like the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\n[noise] yeah and this is something that has been part of the commentary since uh the first reported missing of ... I'm In I think that certainly it's unfortunate that the president refers to press who's the enemy of the people\nAre certainly underscores for dictators around the world that the the White House will will downplay attacks on the media but let's also be clear\nUm people like Vladimir Putin's Turkish president rigid type one uh others around the world the Chinese um are are arresting journalists harming journalists\nSo one can imagine that uh if the decision was made at the highest ah levels in Saudi Arabia they looked around the world and they saw how the Russians were killing people in small British towns or in Dupont Circle Washington DC Dupont Circle who tells\nThe Chinese are rounding up people turkey is the leading jailer of journalists in the world none of those countries have paid a price for that\nAnd that ah the\nSaudis must to believe that they wouldn't pay a price either so I think yes in part it does have to do with a President Trump's rhetoric but I also think it is an international environment\nThat transcends a trend since President Trump\nOkay so I'm going to explore that a little more in the second specifically regarding some of the things that ... G himself had ...\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman but Steven Cook there was a point that you mentioned a much early in the program that I should have dug deeper in into and that is um how much does the president's personal business interests in\nSaudi Arabia first of all what are they specifically and how much do you think that is influencing or his approach\nTo this current diplomatic crisis\n[noise] well there's all kinds of allegations concerning the president and his family's business ties with Gulf monarchies and I'm not aware that there's a Trump International hotel in Riyadh\nUm but uh there are an extensive links between the Trump organizations in countries all over the world and this is a continuing question whether ah the president is making decisions based on his family is a personal financial interests or on behalf of the United states\nUm we do know that um the the government of Qatar through a an investment fund\nHas invested in a building in New York City that was in tremendous debt that's owned by the Christian or companies\nCut their in Saudi Arabia are at odds so um there was a lot of different uh business interests and it's very very hard to pinpoint specifically how the president is making decision on on these issues I think any president in United States would be in a tremendously awkward position\nWith allegations coming from a a a NATO ally like turkey that the Saudis a strategic ally in the middle east had murdered someone and they're constantly in in in Turkey is you know main city\nOr how the president would respond to that ... anybody occupying the oval office would be trying to weigh the ... how much to emphasize a values and freedom of the press and protections for the press versus a relationship with a country like Saudi Arabia\nWell and look the Saudis spend a lot of money in Washington right the Washington Post is reporting that Saudi Arabia plowed twenty seven million dollars into lobbying in Washington Jeff last year making it one of the highest spending country seeking to influence U.S policy that's according to\nPublic records uh well let's take another call here said is calling from Green Bay Wisconsin said you're on the air\n... I Am calling to rank an alarm bell on the on over reaction to the um how shall chi situation I'm In terms of spending to the political domestic political forces and international Middle Eastern countries\nThemselves the greatest violators of human rights who are trying to exploit this situation\nIn order to affect American foreign policy I remind us of a similar situation we were in Nineteen Seventy six what emerges American president Jimmy Carter may human rights they\nCentral piece of his foreign policy pricing pressure on the bench already on a on human rights record\nWith all the displacement and the conversion of the coast in our in our life at the long run to the greatest American full and a significant deterioration of human rights in Iran resulting in over a million Iranians get ... million in exile and Seventy million living under tyranny\nIs what happens when when one of the earth and foreign policy um treats human rights as if they saw and point on does not understand the strategic dimensions that are involved in that in in our relations\nSaid thank you for your call a Bernard Haykel what is how do you respond to said\nWell I I think he makes a good point and the and and the story that he tells about Iran is a this is certainly true um\nI I think that ah you know the the point that he's trying to make us far Saudi Arabia is concern is that you know there is a very important strategic relationship here um that the that\nThe states that are engaged in let's say the Turks are with their campaign of of uh of leaks ah some of which may be disinformation we don't know whether they're true or not the Turks are allies with the Qataris who hate the Saudis the Turks and the Saudis are rivals um the Iranians are rivals to the Saudis one has to be really careful\nUh in coming to a conclusions about what to do as a result of of this tragic an episode I think that the most important things to focus on is a crime was committed to get people punished for the crime but not\nTo jeopardize the relationship that we have that the United states has with its strategic allies in the region because the repercussions of let's say undermining Saudi Arabia and causing a the weakening of the regime there could be a civil war and let's not forget that in the middle east we have four or five failed states with lots of war is raging\nNinety two point seven WB you wait his very eighty nine point one WVU wage Brewster and streaming at W.

titled racing to the finish my\nOf all the concussions he suffered as a NASCAR driver what effect they had on his life and what he did to heal himself\nAnd why he's speaking out about concussions and NASCAR as well we've got an excerpt at our point radio dot or a net no deal before the break we were talking about that really hard hit that you took on the tire test into in twenty twelve at in Kansas\nAnd I want to play a little bit of sound of a really ... forget race it happened not long after that at Talladega this is kind of the book into the big hits that you took\nThat scared me straight as you were saying I'm a little bit earlier so first of all let's listen to what happened in the last lap of the good Sam roadside assistance four hundred at the Talladega super speedway\nIn Alabama I'm there was a huge pack of cars there are in that last lap and here's what happened\nIn that last lap the cars are basically for deep they're going at two hundred miles an hour or if you haven't seen it you don't remember it it's on YouTube and it is breathtaking to watch now here's Dale Earnhardt junior over the radio conversation with his crew chief Steve tart right after just moments after that Talladega crash\nYou'll get money [noise] [noise] I don't know if I could very\nWell to deal tell us about that moment because I think it was after that are and how you felt after that that's what took you to go get help\nYeah so this was four weeks after the Kansas crashed that had it been so so terrible for me\nAnd I had been suffering with symptoms for those four weeks and I finally started to feel like my old self again coming into Talladega that weekend so there was big big sense of relief from me but there was also\nA sense of fear because at Talladega they have these big PACs cars and when there are those type of crashes as they're they're impossible to skate so I knew the chances of me being involved in another accident we were very high for that particular weekend\nSo I was very nervous about that all I wanted was just to be able to get through that race clean with no problems and I feel like I'd be home free\nAnd um get I got involved in that crash in ... and during that crash your car tee ball on the side of the car and spun the car around and I immediately went all the way back to having the symptoms that I had before\nAnd maybe even worse and so but this is a different kind of injury the right because we were like whipped around yeah so the ... this was instead of a an impact you know direct impact this was a very quick fast spin\nAnd so I knew immediately something was wrong with me again and I was really angry about it a and very emotional an unusually emotional for some reason and you can hear that in the in the radio\nCommunication and uh that's something I typically probably wouldn't be having I wouldn't be really having that personal of a conversation over the radio because it's something that the entire team in all the fans can here and have access to\n'em but in those moments when you're injured and you're not really in control your emotions and ... and all those things and so\nUm [noise] I ... I knew that drew my through reading about\nConcussions and hearing these stories so over the past five years you know there's just been so much coverage of concussions whether it's NFL players or what have you uh retired players they're just so much content out there so many stories and I can't [noise]\nUm I couldn't help myself from sort of absorbing some of that and and it frightened me you know so when I was and I learned and read about lowering layering concussions together and having concussions very close together in a very short period of time and right\nSo here I Am and I'm thinking man I'm really playing with fire I better take this seriously this could be something you know these these issues could become permanent that would be a awful to have to wake up every day with something\nUm changed about you and something couldn't correct well\nCan I jump in here for a second because he knew really you write about in the book about how right after that sat crash that did that second headed Talladega as you were saying like you were\n... more emotional less less restrained I mean NASCAR drivers have to be amongst the most ... emotionally controlled people in the world right when you're whirling around a track at two hundred miles an hour but are you seeing the book that now I was just angry angry all the time that you drove your car back to the garage\nWith his engage on limited subscription students can access over twenty two thousand each text books online homework access codes and study guides then gauge unlimited C.

eight crash\nAnd then in two thousand to April twenty eighth he crashed during the nap the auto parts five hundred at the California speedway infant ten of California\nWhere you were talking for so\nLong to bring my infant\nThese are ... and everything else\nI think we've got the gun that's all it is\nYeah definitely that long pause that's what everyone hope that all it was but shortly before the September two thousand two protection won four hundred in Kansas City so several months after that Fontana crash a Earnhardt junior was interviewed about the concussion he had in California\nI made my own decision in a like a real pain in the car was the only thing that really helped me decide ah\nYou know exactly how bad the situation was and how long I needed to get better I Know better next time I sit and again that is sacred as much as I did but um [noise]\nYou know I didn't want to cause too much alarm because it really wasn't a serious I guess is everybody has made it out to be\nDale Earnhardt junior back in two thousand two well joining us now is Michael Mickey Collins he's the director of the University of Pittsburgh Medical center sports medicine concussion program\nAnd he started treating Dale Earnhardt junior four concussions in two thousand twelve you also wrote the forward for a racing to the finish the new book Michael Mickey Collins welcome to on a plane\nHigh maintenance or it's really great to have you because uh obviously as as Diehl writes in the book you're real a key figure in his healing from the multiple concussions he suffered when he first came into your office\nI mean you've treated thousands of of of folks and professional athletes and he what did you see when this NASCAR driver came to you\n[noise] well I've seen him a side deal twice um two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen and on both occasions you know the first time I saw Dale\nWe actually got they'll better pretty quickly from that\nAnd he did very well with our therapies a second time I saw Dale he was\nVery sick with these issues that we commonly see with concussion and quite honestly I didn't care as much about Dale becoming a race car driver again I I Want to Dale to become a human that felt normal and that was the first president for everything and\nAnd that just jump in here though because I mean the the sickness that that he was suffering he he writes about so clearly in the book uh there was a vision problems balance problems on the oldest sings a hand eye coordination all those things that you need to be in control of the vehicle moving it two hundred miles an hour\nOr to be in control of life of life you know racing really wasn't it wasn't even on the radar initially when we saw Dale and and you know we really identified will learn a lot about concussion\nAnd there's so much we learn now in terms of identifying where the average signals coming from and then matching the right treatment to the right problem and\nAnd we were able to do that with the L and kind of pinpoint what the problems were in and said I'm On a course of rehab that um that eventually got better and and Dale is is doing great now and it's it's really nice to see\nYeah so uh but Mickey Collins I think one thing that surprised me about what they wrote in the book is that you prescribed\nBoth times is very very specific specific regimen of exercises and other protocol essentially that would push his brain to the limit of what it could tolerate at that time because I was under the impression that\nUh perhaps this is now very much out of date but the thought was that you should reduce cognitive load when brain is healing from from concussions\nRight that's a common perception or misperception really of how we approach concussion treatment we've actually identified now that there are six different types of concussions and there's some types of concussions were quote unquote rest or at least regulated rest it may be indicated\nBut in details profile of difficulties with the way you treat the problems that Dale had is actually through ... training and so it depends on what type of concussion you have as to how we approach it whether it's a more active based approach or whether the rate you know regulation or whatnot but\nYou have to you need to go to a clinician that can identify again where's the average single coming from and then and then matched the right treatment to the right problem that's what concussion is becoming and it's very exciting because this is not a homogenous event it's a very heterogeneous event if this if this thirty different types of knee injuries why do we think there's one type of concussion\nWe'll Dale Earnhardt junior and in the book you write that the second time that you sought treatment from uh from Mickey Collins\nThat you didn't actually get all that many phone calls from from drivers because that's just not not necessarily what would a driver cultures like but you did hear from some drivers who had either previously suffered from concussion or hadn't really reached out for help [noise]\nYeah actually that was so\nAh interesting I guess I'm you know a hearing from retired drivers or even drivers that had just recently had suffered a concussion that we're looking for some direction and some advice\nSupport for WVU ours live stream comes from the New England Honda dealers the

through the process and made some pretty good friends to sorry to interrupt you there but but there's a moment that you write about after your first meeting with Mickey Collins said was possibly one of the most important things that he said to you that\nYou are so concerned freaked out really about um uh how much you were struggling after your your dual concussions\nIn in twenty twelve but then he told you that it could be fixed now ... why did not why was it so profound for you\nThat you know he did that on a couple occasions I had I'll I'll I'll ... I'll talk about this one in particular I had my eyes were not working I'm not focusing not I couldn't they weren't stable if I walked\nAcross the room they ... you know the by the environment and shook and I my eyes\nJust wouldn't uh wouldn't settle and it was so so frustrating 'cause it it was there every minute of every day and it affected anything and everything you did\nAnd it was there for months it it wouldn't getting better I was working and rehabbing and doing those doing exercises and homework that McGahn given me and it wasn't changing and ah I was getting more and more worried\nAnd so I called Mickey innocent Mickey I really just got to ask you something real quick and I said to have you seen this problem\nAnd a cause a a patient's ... patients idea is that the doctor has to stay positive he's not gonna be a negative person and tell you this isn't going to work and this is what you got a new you know he's going to be positive because he believes that he can fix it and\nNinety two boys seven WVU ages break eighty nine boy one WB UH Brewster and streaming or W.

have shifted their story I see\nAre they are no they no longer appear to be denying that anything happened to your mouth because she'll be while he was there a conflict\nNow they're shifting to he was killed there but it was a a a kind of rendition gone wrong Jared ... rendition what what horribly awry ... um and so that's that seems to be there to play\nOkay so I'm seeing here the Associated Press

Steven Cook he's a senior fellow for Middle East and African studies at the council on Foreign Relations and also joined today by Bernard Haykel professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University\n... before the break you said ... it's worth exploring further this question of a President Trump's relationship with the house of salad and then perhaps we should even focus on Jared Kushner and his relationship with crown prince Mohammed or been some on I mean how would you describe how close they are\n[noise] well you you probably know that the first overseas trip that President Trump took was to Riyadh yes where he was fed it in and received you know as a great kind of international statesman and he you know seem to appreciate that\nI'm a lot um and then a special relationship developed with um the president's son in law Jared Kushner and to deal with a whole series of topics one was uh the fight against ISIS and the ... campaign or the other was the Israeli Palestinian peace process\nAnd lost the was of the uh relationship to business and economic relationship between the United states and Saudi Arabia and this was at a time when the Saudis were\nUm instill our reforming diversifying their economy they want us to invest in the United states they want to buy a lot of things from the U.S and build strong connections with us institutions banks universities et cetera\nSo that relationship is uh is is a very personal and tight one and I think um and this is my speculation but I think that a significant amount of the ah attention an anger that has been directed at Saudi Arabia has to do with um the feelings that many Americans feel about President Trump's\nOkay well Steven Cook though the ... the president has said that he he would vow quote severe punishment right if\nIf a Saudi an influence or us out of Saudi Arabia is proven to be behind the death of ... uh but at the same time the president said he doesn't want a\nThat punishment to affect arms sales for example a ... of the at least ten billion dollars in arms sales to the Saudi Government so what position does is put the present and then\nThe president certainly been all over the place on this issue as you point out I I think his statements\nHave uh being an effort to provide time for the Turks and the Saudis to figure out a story\nI think it's abundantly clear that the president is in an awkward position and his inclination is actually to continue the relationship with Saudi Arabia or uninterrupted\nI think that the statement about severely punishing the Saudis\nWas or something where the White House was acknowledging a the pressure and a two weeks for commentary about\nThe disappearance of democracy joke tea um but uh overall uh this is a president who has not made human rights a a priority\nAnd um has looked upon ah Washington's relations with other countries particularly countries in the middle east and particularly Saudi Arabia\nAs a very important for American commercial transactions and he has mentioned or a hundred and ... hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal uh which actually was not struck by the Trump Administration vote was actually agree to under the Obama administration but signed after President Trump a came into office yeah\nAnd I appreciate the correction that I had said ten billion but you're right it's a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with that but to that point Steven Cook I mean we\nWe can talk about uh the economic ties between Saudi Arabia and the United states but they're also strategic very deep strategic elements to this long standing relationship between these two countries I mean how sensual of an ally is Saudi Arabia in the region and does that\nDoes that does that sort of essential nature make it is that the thing that has allowed multiple administrations to talk about human rights on one hand look overlook human rights violations by the Saudis on the other\nWell that has long been the dilemma for American policymakers when looking at Saudi Arabia as well as quite frankly other countries in in the middle east\nI'm ... and Saudis importance it really depends on how you look at the middle east right now or even the fact that the Trump Administration regards Iran as it's number one priority encountering Iranian influence around the region\nIn Saudi Arabia is critically important to the to the United states you've had 'em Egypt which has lurched from one crisis to another really can't project power around the region\nOr many of the other countries um are too small um to play a leading role as America's ally they can be part of a an American regional order\nA but a Saudi Arabia really is the the big country it's the custodian of the two holy mosques which gives it a certain legitimacy in in the Muslim world it is a large producer of a of of oil it's not the largest any longer the United states is\nUm but still many of a Washington is most important allies are trading partners do rely upon\n... the United states is interested in in a global capitalist water or the fact that the Chinese the Korean the Japanese the Indians are are all depended upon oil coming out of this region in significant portions of it coming from Saudi Arabia the United states has a a a compelling interest\nUh in the radius stability in supporting Saudi Arabia security well I think\nSo I just wanted to get this okay I just wanna get Bernard Haykel you in on this for for professor he called for as long as there's this unified approach between the United for between Washington and in Riyadh in terms of their view of the Iranian threat\nDoes that make it impossible to imagine a significant break between ... between these two countries between the United states and Saudi Arabia [noise]\nUm I I think it is impossible and I've described the relationship as a structural relationship not a transactional want even though President Trump seems to characterize it as a transactional relationship\nThat the relationship with Saudi Arabia you know started in Nineteen forty five\nIt was ... they were instrumental in the Cold War and the fight against communism their instrumental in regulating the global oil market which is a fungible in global market which means that if any disruption happens in Saudi Arabia even if we are entirely self sufficient in the United states we would feel the effects\nIn terms of price immediately they are fundamentally important the Saudis for the stability of the of the region which has been a longstanding American\nOr an interest in this part of the world you also have Iran you have Islam you have to fight against ah the the radical Islamists the Saudis are instrumental again and fighting against radical Islamism and in particular\nAnd a mom and been some on M. B. S. because he has made it a policy of the kingdom to turn away from Islamism and towards nationalism and populism\nAnd that again is you know very important for the United states because if you if you succeed in Saudi Arabia that would set a pattern for the entire region right there are many reasons for this relationship and it it transcends either Trump or MPs\nI Want to play a clip here are on sort of how that tension is playing out amongst other uh leaders in Washington on CBS his face the nation on Sunday Republican Senator Marco Rubio said that the United states relationship with Saudi Arabia goes beyond that a hundred and ten billion dollars in arms deals we were talking about\nI Would just say it's unfortunate because Saudi Arabia is an important part of our Middle Eastern strategy they are a key leverage point against Iranian influence in the region but that cannot supersede our commitment to human rights\nSteven Cook what does the United states\nStands to lose perhaps morally if that's the right approach to take care Bye bye this continuing close relationship with with Saudi Arabia I mean we have\nThe listeners online who's who's talking to us about what about uh you know remembering the terrorists that came from Saudi Arabia after nine eleven and again the Yemen comes up over and over again there's a U.S a hundred year famine that Yemen is facing the worst humanitarian catastrophe\nA ... in the world right now largely driven by Saudi bombing there I mean it does not the United states stand to lose something by\nI don't want to call it an unquestioning relationship but they're so close it close in tight relationship\nWell this is the central dilemma for American policymakers who want to ah to secure America's security interests around the region\nUh who wants to fight the Islamic state and wants to counter Iranian influence\nUm it has allies in the region who will do things that are run counter to American values and oftentimes with American either ... or American policymakers of overlooking or with their blessing ah this is\nOpen house November fourth Newton country day daughter\nAnd New England Honda dealer between the eight passenger pilots and GPS equipped to court for life around here learn more at how the dealers of New England dot com\nLove ya live out is to sell the state of war crimes she lost her family and for a time for freedom she found the courage to speak out about the atrocities that can turn now she's won a Nobel Peace prize\nConversation not MRI\nPlus the latest on the search\nFor it to mark his show on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News [noise] tomorrow morning at five Ninety four nine W. B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station\nThis is on point I'm making a Chuck ... we're talking this hour about scrutiny of the U.S Saudi relationship this is in the wake of the disappearance and reporting killing\nOf dissident journalist ... gee we're joined today by Steven Cook a senior fellow for Middle East and African studies at the council on Foreign Relations and by Bernard Haykel he's professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University and we're one eight hundred and forty three eight to five five it's eight hundred\nFor two three talk and let's go to some callers here Dolores is calling from Waterford, Pennsylvania you're on the air Dolores\nAnd hello to your gas up before I have a couple of questions on that can make a point ... if anyone wants to get some good insight into the kingdom of Saudi Arabia they need to read my now Sharif's book daring to drive it's a good insight\nUm it's a good read and it provides a an eye opening a exposure to how these guys operate now here's my question I mean who is going ...\nThat this was conducted by a rogue element you had an individual show up with a bone saw if you I mean to me that's a signal you intended to conduct some sort of nefarious this had been premeditated and my point\nIs illegitimate somebody for a second so those reports so far the only the only sources for those reports are Turkish officials unnamed Turkish officials so that hasn't actually been independently confirmed it just just want to remind folks of that but go ahead oh\nOkay and hear Donald Trump\nIs the one who has claimed that the media is the enemy of the people I Know and I can only speculate and of course 'cause I don't have evidence but in my mind is I'm looking at this and you have you know the world's leader claiming that the media is the enemy of the people\nI mean an MBA circle they think over how we can take this guy out who's going to care ... I mean I personally I think Trump could care less about the show in that interview on the White House lawn yes say was you know another act it's another lie I mean I Am hoping\nThat Congress ... you know get something catch total forty ... hair and can can do something yeah I'm In that show the global dictators that maybe they have a friend and Donald Trump a gift and Donald Trump\nBut that the U.S Congress is going to start taking some action against the human rights violations that are occurring around the globe will\nDelivers thank you for your call Steven Cook let me turn turn that to you a first of all ... to ... assertion that the president's own rhetoric against journalists may have emboldened ah folks like the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\n[noise] yeah and this is something that has been part of the commentary since uh the first reported missing of democracy choked gee I'm In I think that it's certainly it's unfortunate that the president refers to press as the enemy of the people\nAh it certainly underscores for dictators around the world that the the White House will will downplay attacks on the media but let's also be clear\n'em and people like vitamin Bruton Turkey's president rigid type or one or others around the world the Chinese um are are arresting journalists harming journalists\nSo one can imagine that uh if this decision was made at the highest ah levels in Saudi Arabia they looked around the world and they saw how the Russians were killing people in small British towns or in Dupont Circle Washington DC Dupont Circle who tells\nThe Chinese are rounding up people turkey is the leading jailer of journalists in the world\nNone of those countries have paid a price for that and that ah the Saudis must have believed that they wouldn't pay a price either so I think yes in part it does have to do with a President Trump's rhetoric but I also think it is an international environment\nThat transcends a trend since President Trump\nOkay so I'm going to explore that a little more in the second specifically regarding some of the things that ... himself had has set about a\nA crown prince Mohammed bin Salman but but Steven Cook there was a point that you mentioned a much early in the program that I should have dug deeper in into and that is\nHow much does the president's personal business interests in Saudi Arabia first of all what are they specifically and how much do you think that is influencing or his approach to this current diplomatic crisis\n[noise] well there's all kinds of allegations concerning the president and his family's business ties with Gulf monarchies I'm I'm not aware that there is at Trump International hotel in Riyadh\nUm but ah there are an extensive links between the Trump organizations in countries all over the world and this is a continuing question whether ah the president is making decisions based on his ah family is a personal a financial interest or on behalf of the United states\nUm we do know that um the the government of Qatar through a an investment fund\nHas invested in a building in New York City that was in tremendous debt that's owned by the Christian or companies\nCut their in Saudi Arabia are at odds so um there's a lot of different uh business interests and it's very very hard to pinpoint specifically about how the president is making decision on on these issues I think any president in United States would be in a tremendously awkward position\nWith allegations coming from a a a NATO ally like turkey that the Saudis a strategic ally in the middle east had murdered someone and they're constantly ... in in Turkey is you know main city\nOr how the president would respond to that anybody occupying the oval office would be trying to weigh the ... how much to emphasize a values and freedom of the press and protections for the press versus a relationship with a country like Saudi Arabia", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "16"}
