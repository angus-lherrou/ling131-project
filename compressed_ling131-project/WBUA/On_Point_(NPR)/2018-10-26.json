within a great example\nUh and you talk about leg goes\nHow is it that leg goes are indicative of Silicon Valley ruining the work place\nWell yeah you have to draw a line from one of the other 'cause everybody loves goes you know everybody loves goes and I just didn't realize that legos were now a workplace thing and a lot of people I've talked to about this were equally surprised I was\nActually interviewing someone about agile which is this new workplace methodology that's become almost a religion and ah\nWe were talking about that and in the course of that conversation the guy said oh no you got to talk to the lego people and I said with a lack of people and he said oh there's\nYou can pay three thousand bucks or five thousand bucks and become a certified lego trainer and then you can go sell engagements to corporations you can make a fortune\nRunning lego workshop and like what I what is that I thought he was joking writing signature real thing and and I I ended up meeting a lego trainer and spending a half a day with her and I played little lego games and it's sort of this\nUh there's this whole school school of a lego thinking called lego serious play with a little trademark

Silicon Valley and a former editor at Newsweek\nAnd we have a cut here from the pilot episode of Silicon Valley or Dan was not a writer at on the show at this time but this is from the pilot episode where Richard Hendricks played by Thomas middle ditch winds up in the doctor's office\nWhen he's faced with a really stressed inducing decision whether or not to sell his company for ten million dollars or keep ownership of the start up he created for a lower price so in this clip you hear a Richard speaking to his doctor\nSo few will survive with the garden variety panic attack for Silicon Valley\nWe see people like you all the time for [laughter] disaster from off\nNow you know while back we had a guy here in almost the exact same situation take the money or keep the company for\nWell for\nOne way or the voting to be armed with a self inflicted gunshot because he really regretted not taking our money\nA little black humor there about the pressures that telecom valley exact may face a but in reality things can get a little strange and most definitely uncomfortable if not out inappropriate because\nIn this next cut you're going to hear Bloomberg anchor Emily Chang diving into the front like world of Silicon Valley she did that in her book row Tokyo which was published earlier this year and she told Business Insider in February about the shocking details of some tech women's day to day lives\nI don't want to get into a hot tub and pitched investor as my business while holding up their what woman wants to do that while wearing a bikini and these things are really happening\nSo that's a Emily Chang are talking about one of the things that\nMay happen ever does happen in Silicon valley now look the ... the thing about your book that I think is the deepest point that you make it how\nSilicon Valley views it's actual employees and actual workers tell tell me more about that because part of what you wrote seems I'm very familiar to me in terms of how industrialists of\nOld also sell their workers right only I think it's actually even worse so the the view\nToday and Silicon Valley is that workers are essentially disposable\nWould you see you their fuel like the coal you're throwing a steam engine to keep it going so you you hire them you you burn them out turn them out and just hire again and you just high turnover and high burn out I'm\nOddly enough it's counter to what Silicon Valley was even as recently as when I started writing about Silicon Valley in the late eighties\nAt that time the gold standard with something called the H. P. way right which was really human centric really employ centric it was a great place to work and to stay um ...\nPackard right you'll at Packard and then ... and David Packard right they had a whole management theory about management by walking around they handed a profit share\nQuite a bit with their employees I mean it was it was the standard of an and look it will turn into a blue chip companies right no longer but [laughter] but it was at the top of the heap once the garage that that the bill and they found it H. P. and as a national landmark\nRight and and the the one thing I I loved about it too they would have a big picnic for the whole company once a year and your families and ... and they view the company as a family and they\nThe two of them would sort of all the hamburgers you know they would sort of certain people are sort of symbolic but but you know there's a certain humility to it and they wanted people to stay for their entire careers they bought\nLand for employees to go camping in or a you know for recreation in different parts of the world where they had officers\nThere were really much very much about the people in their country then the next wave in the seventies and eighties you have this sort of counter cultural way we have like the jobs in Wozniak kind of thing and when I came into covering tech\nIn the late eighties it was still kind of hippy ... be counter cultural pro people was a great place to work if you landed a job and one of these places like\nOh fantastic and that has radically changed and that's no longer you know that kind of place it's it's very stressful\nYeah well then again it just comes up and you're saying 'cause we've got a caller who was who's talking exactly this about um the value of employees are in this day and age so let me just will get his say here Robert is calling from Omaha Nebraska Robert you're on the air\n\nAnd it was saying that the value of unemployed ... of an electric when you're a transactional issue\nUh the start and there's nothing there's nothing new or just returned to for ... it's sort of things are a little slower literature\nRobert thank you so much for your call a ... ... what do you think about that means he's kind of saying what I said earlier that a lot of the sounds really familiar\nIt it it does in a way I'm ... I went back in ... I'm going to read books by industrial ... of a previous generation and see what they what they thought so I read Henry Ford's memoirs and read Thomas watching junior who was the c._e._o. of IBM\nAnd a ... was not the rubber bands but\nAnd and Henry Ford obviously was not a nice guy yeah have you get to the very end of his memoirs and there's a laptop and you're like oh my God whoa whoa whoa whoa but be before that part though it's amazing he's saying I Am doing this to try to create as many jobs for his many human beings as I can\nAnd to treat them really well um he at one point had to stop go round and try to find jobs that disabled people could do because those people were pushed out of the workforce find me all the jobs you could do if you only had one on\nFinding all the jobs you can do if you were blind make a list and then we're going to go higher those people so they can work and they can ah they can make make a living yeah\nBut it does so this is the key difference though right that there was a time I'm not for every company but for many companies the point was to grow the company\nAnd doing so involved in trying to be the best employer they could be\nBut ... ... you know sometime in the seventies and eighties we American Capitalism turned over to shareholder value creation that that was the ultimate goal of the company to serve the interests of shareholders who wouldn't that be and and I guess what I'm saying when I'm Wondering is in your book are you writing that you think\nThat that Silicon Valley because it's full\nOf some of these billion dollar valued companies that may or may not be turning a profit that essentially they put they put all the shareholder value creation like on hyper speed that it it is by far the most important thing I'm a of anything that these companies can do and and that's the pernicious thing is is that what you're saying\nOkay it's hyper capital and it it's you have Nineteen Seventy the turning point is Milton Friedman publishes his famous essay about shareholder capitalism in every CEO goes this is great all have to do is\nTo return a money to investors time my own compensation to the stock price and anything I can do to make that happened is great got the pension fund\nYou know usually all in involves hurting employees and so you had four stakeholders you had a customer's employees the community and investors and Milton Friedman just will investors come first now\nIts investors are the only ones who matter so you have companies in Silicon valley that\nHave run for years have never made a profit don't treat their employees well deliver what they call MVP minimum viable product um dodged taxes will get apple and Google hiding all this money offshore and not paying taxes 'em\nAll to benefit investors if companies were BCS have become fabulously rich a founders have become fabulously rich but the company itself is not profitable yes or can't feed its employees very well um so it's it's a really inside out kind of version of capitalism\nOkay well let's just get another call here we're speaking with dandelions is author of lab rats how Silicon Valley may work miserable for the rest of us Marge is calling from Lebanon, Connecticut merger on the air\nHello thank you um [noise] I Want to say that I worked for a large insurance company in Hartford, Connecticut for thirty six years my father also retired from this company\nHe worked there forty years all the time I was growing up I Do not remember him working overtime he was home at five o'clock for supper every day we had weekends to go away and so\nForth now they'll they'll twelve years I worked in a wonderful unit I was able to accomplish every project they gave me on time or before a target date then they re arrange things that five years before I retired I retired and four years ago but five years before I retired\nFrom the west or cultural coalition in Worcester culture dot org [noise]\nWhy does something wrong you don't read like wildfire\nLarry Nassar was sentenced to up to a hundred and Seventy five years in prison for sexually abusing more than one hundred young athlete believed a new NPR pod cast examines the cases big mystery how did he get away with it for so long\nPlus the latest on suspicious package threats on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nTomorrow morning at five or Ninety point nine W. B. U. R. Boston is NPR News station\nThis is on point I'm making trucker Bertie we're talking this hour with dandelions he's author of the new book lab rats how Silicon Valley made work miserable for the rest of us\nAnd also joining us today from San Francisco is a new Williams she's cofounder of the British unite an organization that's calling for more ethical and inclusive start up and venture capital culture where one eight hundred and forty three eight to five five it's eight hundred for it to three talk and India and dance so many\nFor example toy Yoda is saying that in my experience what makes will work life miserable isn't Google but the dogma of work flow innovation that the software industry keep inventing a let's see a sea says I've seen a slightly positive change in that we're moving towards more open cubes and collaborative workspaces but not much else\nYet a and Victoria Morrison on Twitter is saying real dandelions is making a good point here I Know some posts millennials on young people who reject current tax culture will be reinvented or find another way to make a living let's go to Steve who's calling from Boston, Massachusetts Steve you're on the air\nA guy that I have to take issue with some of the things that are your your perspective it'll give you my own my own background or work Fifteen Years for until a a good portion of the time I was actually working in the VCR investing in companies in Israel\nAnd then I left new girl and the um I\nWork in our during your what your caller safari silicon were reluctant to suffer as in Israel or the people around the world and showing them what's going on in Israel and my mom you're\nMuch more exposed to this is that most of the companies that own the church was my experience when I was there were some interesting was that the companies that were most successful companies would want to really put the emphasis\nOn the employees because basically the start of culture the culture is grounded in a knowledge in your brain power reunion a version of bringing your idea of\nThe human capital up yeah part\nAnd that's your when capital and want to invest him out of the best ones do invest in it do well in my experience is is that the people who are working in those environments are energized ... incentive are compensated and enjoy it and feel it throughout your contribution\nWill Steve thank you so much for your call let's getting dance response you\nKnow I I think you know I are completely in agreement I think there are there are companies doing that and and those people are happy\nUm um but\nLet's say ... I mean see everything that came out and we were in the last couple of years is not like that right ... Amazon warehouses are not like that\nI'm In ... when he mentioned I'm\nWorking in Israel one of the best stories I came across in the last couple years was an Israeli start a guy who was so desperate to raise money that he\nOffered to give up one of his kidneys if anyone would give him a half million dollars to buy a stake in this company and I'm a true story and I thought it like what do we come and even the BCS I called him that is the most dystopian thing I've ever heard right and I mean it was maybe kind of a publicity stunt and um [noise]\nAnyway but yeah there are there is a lot of just hoping\nStuff out there [laughter] yeah well any of this let me just ask you briefly a are we\n... because we've talked a lot about Amazon Google Facebook I mean are we are we ... are we over waiting the influence of these like the old for big Silicon Valley companies or does you know it's because he was saying that he not obviously not every company is going the way it is are there actually maybe medium or a smaller size\nOr come the tech companies that are doing a better job that we should actually be focusing on instead\nAbsolutely there definitely are I think it's really hard to shift that narrative from the biggest tech companies because they have so much influence over our economy as a whole yeah um I think the really interesting thing too that I Want to touch on that gentleman's comment is that you know we're really ushering in this age of knowledge work\nUm and we're approaching it and that very industrial mindset that was that turn of the century kind of way that we thought about working and\nYou know we have a lot I again it's just it's always a little bit of the better with the sweet like we're all excited to have the devices that are at our fingertips all the time they let us do so much but at the same time productivity is like through the roof in some ways and now expectations from workers are completely unrealistic and out of\nThis I Want to do because I mean because with knowledge work the asset is the worker right ... if not workers are not the liability whereas sort of sort of the standard way of looking at labor is that's that's the lover that as a manager or as a CEO that you can pull up and down most quickly in order to\nA massage or profits for that quarter right just cut words words you make money but but in this case we're we're talking about like the ... assets of a company or the workers themselves so\nMy question you new to you and yet is that ... in trying to shift perspective a little here\nUm for for these tech companies for any business in America right now like how do you make that pitch that\nYou focus more on workers you make life better for workers are empowering them or a ... that that will actually produce longer term profits but it's slow it's slower work I mean how do you make that pitch in an environment where those quarterly returns are so pressing yeah I think it has to\nFrom the top down but some from the ground up so\nI mentioned earlier you know awareness and intention ... kind of the two things that keep coming up for me so a couple of examples of of some some tech startups that people have been talking a lot about and interestingly enough these are companies that\nMay or may not be venture funded a so like actually male chip as an example of one that has been in the in the news recently they're completely bootstraps so they never raised any venture capital\nThey're valued at I think four billion dollars as a company now um and they have to owners they're based in Atlanta they're not even based in Silicon valley I Know a few people that worked there I Know that they have very generous benefits they had very like\nUh they're very generous with their policies with people they have a profit sharing policy so\nI think um when we think about like some of the the ways in which we can look at you know structurally or how a start up or how a tech company has formed and how we want to think differently about it to me it comes down to like alternative ways of thinking about financing those start ups um I think it's about alternative ways of thinking of corporate structures\nUm and I think it's alternative ways of thinking about the culture around it so some examples of that would be\nYou know how radical transparency I'm within your company and sometimes even with the the outside you know external forces and as much as you can be transparent with them so buffer is another an example of a tech company that\nIs radically transparent and if I'm not mistaken I think they share is a private company um but they share a all of their numbers are with the public and they've told an entire story of actually how they just recently bought back\nUh their ownership of the company from their investors are because they want it to be able to build it more sustainably and they weren't happy with the way that they're the way they were beholden to their investors was driving them to do things that they felt like we're unhealthy for their company an unhealthy for the people working there\nUm and then I'd also say like again companies that are doing profit sharing models are building them and kind of a more co op style of model where people really want the employees to be able to participate in the success of that company as well so everyone is invested in this excessive and everyone gets to reap the rewards instead of just\nA few people at the top um I think there's a lot to be said about having those more flexible schedules and\nUm you know enabling remote work I Know from my team ah or I should say multiple teams because I run a few different things uh you know we tend to be really focused on the delivery bulls and we plan those together though it's a route okay here's the timeline we've all set together here the things that we need to deliver by the time\nI don't care if you want to work like at two in the morning I don't care if you want to work at two in the afternoon I don't care if you want to go to the movies for the entire day and maybe you only work three days out of the week like\nAs long as they were all Hitler yeah hit the gold on how you have your life now now\nThere are a lot more callers who want to get to hear but then one quick not from you and what you're hearing from India\nOh you ... we we totally agree and and um [noise]\nThere's a a another company called Base Camp that are used in Chicago and software company and I I I'm I'm sort of detecting a few common threads with with the other companies that you're talking about in the end and that is one of these have never took any PC\nTo they're not really obsessed with hyper growth are growing at an incredible rate they believe in slow growth\nThey are profitable they charge money for their software and they make a profit they have no interest in going public they want nothing to do with Wall Street and when I look through another list of companies that have parental

just\nWhat is going on what is a connection we have seen\nA we know the FBI and all you know ATF all the related agencies are investigating that\nI'm so this is it's it's it's a sensitive time in DC I mean I I you know work primarily or I work a lot of time on Capitol Hill as well\nAnd they're getting notice as say remember to check your mail you know do you know anything looks suspicious please alert Capitol police these are procedures um they said this is something that's really rattled I think everyone in the country right now\nDaniel deal on struck by the fact that you're talking about the leading figures Democratic Party some of their major a liberal supporters uh George Soros the actor and producer Robert Deniro\nOr you know and it looks like it's it's addressing the hierarchy in some ways of Democratic Party how the Republican leaders responded to this\nRepublican leaders have has condemned this um you know they have made it clear from the start that they're not supporting obviously are encouraging this in any way I think what's also interesting though is that you have a number of quite prominent figures are on the right in in the right wing media sphere\nTo identify

on point on David Folkenflik\nAnd we're talking about the biggest stories the week you can join our conversation what do you make of trial balloons from the White House about sending troops to the border to opening asylum laws\nWhere one hundred for two three eight to five five that's ... hundred and forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook and on point radio my guests today are Daniel deal with the Toronto Star\nAnd came up the Washington Post and of course our own news analyst shirt on point Jack Beatty up some and the president has talked a lot this week about the caravan of migrants wending its way about a thousand miles south of the U.S border in Central America south of even of Mexico at this point\nUh that that is certainly gotten a lot of news coverage and it's a very real issue on the other hand I'm\nIn the president's framing of it as part of a a a a visual vital national security concern is it the sense that there is something that the president needs to address on a federal level or their sense of distant turning attention maternal elections I think\nThere is that I think he wants to make the sense that there that the government needs to take action but it is important to point out the facts here that this caravan while it is traveling we've talked the latest an estimate from Mexican officials and that it is about more than nine hundred\nMiles south of the U.S Mexico border so it is still significantly far away\nUm you know experts in the region and ... on the issue has said for a long time that these are people who are you know seek or who are fleeing from violence and terrible conditions in their home countries and trying to find refuge in the United states and that\nYou know the vast majority of these or asylum seekers who will try to obtain legal status inside the United states\nUm I Do want to point out one use development that broke last night that the administration is considering invoking a national um basically they're national security powers and then a national security rationale\nTo block um you know people at the border who come here to seek asylum it's ... they're considering using kind of the same national security rationale that they use to invoke the travel ban and the different iterations of the travel ban\nAnd the early part of his presidency which I Do want to point out the the final iteration of that ban was upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court and\nOne option that the administration is now considering is doing that on the southern border um you know experts say you know under US law you have to you know if someone presents themselves at the border as someone seeking asylum you have to let them apply for asylum\nBy the administration does appear to be testing how far that national security his national security powers\nCan go on and addressing this issue at the border which clearly we've seen the president become more I'm more focused on in these last several days and weeks\nDuring a bill or our listeners may or may not know that ... as well as reporting for the star from Washington or you kind of bird dog the statements from the president for major officials are pretty much in real time in a rather extraordinary way\nI'm On Tuesday vice president Mike Pence bolstered the president's claim that there are unknown middle Easterners mixed in with Central American migrants moving towards the U. S. borders here's what the vice president to say\nThe United states of America intervenes and prevents him terrorists or suspected terrorists from coming into our country every day so it's just inconceivable that there would not be individuals of from the middle east as a part of this growing the character\nDaniel how accurate of depressed\nWas a characterizing what we know about that a caravan\nThey've been hugely inaccurate I mean you could teach that statement in in like a logic class um you know he he must present tense made his statement that is arguably factual this is based on department of homeland security statistics about people on terror walked those being prevented from entering the country and then made it completely unfounded link a leap\nFrom that to the care of and you know just because ten terrorists or suspected terrorists or a bunch of terrorists or prevented from entering the country um has no obvious a connection to people are trying to walk into the country from Honduras Guatemala\nAnd so I think consistently the president at first and then joined by the vice president and others in human history I shouldn't\nHave made logical leaves and completely baseless claimed about this ... that have no granting at ... in reality at all\n[noise] Jack Beatty is there nothing to the idea that that we should be concerned about the the borders I mean there seems to have been a significant rise a number of people in recent years have been seeking asylum\nWe certainly should be concerned about it but we should be concerned under the age of civil law laws which involve the right to seek asylum in the United states\nYou know what's going on here is the politics of fear of which Mr Trump is a master during the two thousand campaign he let it out is it real power is I don't want to use the word see here\nHe's playing on fear\nA fear of the nation under attack by brown skinned people coming up from the south\nAnd reporters have talked to people as far north as Minnesota who's an interview with the times with a woman in Minnesota who said you know\nIf these people aren't stop they're liable to come up here in Minnesota\nAnd to be going into the cabins that that people have a summer homes and and staying there for the winter and then when the people who ... who come in the summer they'll be these these uh these migrants will be living in their cabins course they'd have to walk the thousand miles to the border and then the Fifteen hundred miles to\nTo uh to Minnesota but this this is what's here is the magnification of deep seated American anxieties especially among conservatives about keeping the country ... ... you know in violent\n[noise] we've got a call from El Paso Texas said John is calling a John my understand if you do some work down there that's related to this\nNew or they take my call we we work with a a little militia down here we're mobilizing on the order to make sure that the caravan not make it into our country we're disgusted with what you people in the media have been doing a we're sick of your rhetoric at a press\nAnd we're not going to happen not going to share what we do advocate is it good discourse back and forth and and uh just disagreement a in a civil way but we're not we're not going to have people abusing each other on the air\nOr we are going to return however to one of the comments that are that I Want to follow up with Daniel Dale of Toronto Star a and think about the question he hadn't flag questions about uh statements made by the president other members ... that he had been burned down because a lot of them weren't factual here's a\nA just Wednesday a couple of days ago\nFormer White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci went on the air or and she called President Trump his man he advises a liar he then went on Bloomberg TV yesterday to clarify\nThat what he meant was that the president was an intentional liar\nIs yes the president is speaking mushrooms yes the president is lying but he's doing it intentionally to incite surf in ... which would include left leaning journalists and most of the left leaning politicians and so what ends up happening is\nThey come out like a hall monitor and the elementary school or junior high school and they say oh wow the president's lying and his face and basically laughing at 'em okay if someone's taking your lunch money in the cafeteria if you call the hall monitor it's\nNot going to help you okay you got to defeat the person at the table with your roof\nSo Daniel Dale ... compares sort of fact checkers people who are doing real time ah verifying of information given to the public by their leaders home monitors\nA recently also a trolley or worse old of a a buzzfeed posts a piece where he says look depressed is participating in a cycle of um disseminating missed fruits or to the public even as doing fact checking here's what he says he says that the cycle feeds itself simply by virtue of the media reporting on the president\nTrump lives at a rally or by tweeter press conference the press reports that he lies Trump tells his supporters the media's unjustly attacking him his supporters believed that news organizations dinner perpetuating and feeling Trump's claims simply by amplifying and checking his statements what do you make of that there\nA lot of thoughts there um I I think the problem is actually the opposite I still think there is insufficient fact checking in true test\nDon't think it has regularly the case that the media is is in Boston is incessantly seizing on Trump's false statement that rallies or making a big deal about them and fueling\nA media hatred among Trump supporters I think many Trump supporters dislike the media for reasons entirely separate from the fact checking I think many of them are not reading are fact checking and I think the only alternative to\nGeico offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks are SUVs and providing twenty

opened her NBC morning show making Kelly today with an apology for what you'd have to say\nHi Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry he made her that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another\nA black person making their face later or a white person making errors darker can make a costume complete I defended the idea\nSaying as long as it as it was respectful and part of a Halloween costume if they'll pay well I was wrong and I am sorry\nKnown my other life I'm the media correspondent for NPR News and I last night reported a that a person with direct knowledge of the matter said that her show was gone from NBC she would not be hosting the today show and that she was involved\nIn essentially exit negotiations with the network all of that has not played out yet so many Kim what do you make of the networks response to her remarks um ah that that we just heard um I think\nIt says that I mean there was as firestorm of criticism after her initial comments on on the today show and I think I was watching the clock and it seemed like some of her fellow panelist Ross the kind of caught off guard\nIt looks like an NBC is doing what they feel they have to do a ... I eat I don't cover the media but in the reporting that's been out there in our publication and in other news outlets on\nThat that had at NBC News and the lack held a town hall shortly thereafter those comments and sad and really condemned those comments according to sources who were there and who told us another\nAnd other news outlets I think that says why they didn't use our innovation just thought they had to do at this point\nUh I Want to thank you I Know some men you have to dash and cover a few days to thank you for joining us that's the voice of sung Kim of the Washington Post thanks for having me I Want to take a couple of calls about making Kelly uh we've got a call from Tampa, Florida Carl go ahead\n[noise] um I Am as sensitive as anyone else a I'm a ... there's a lot of my life like you for taking my call\nI think that um sometimes on the on on racial issues we couldn't go over the talk I really don't think that there's anything that they can go to college I I come from a society which we have a class of people that were yeah\nI Do a little bit iffy Asian all types of does not have any real issue connotation\nIf you if you if you're on the road then you go to unless you're going to be able to do nothing which actually ridiculous I Wonder whether and because she had a lot of ... whether they wanted to get rid of use this as an excuse\nWell thank you so much for that call call call I appreciate it very much it's worth pointing out and perhaps not incidental that making Kelly's ratings were were not strong a and that her embrace by our colleagues even prior to this incident was not warm we've got another call on this subject from Omaha Nebraska rich go ahead\n\nAll right um yeah about Megan Kelly I I I think I I I'm not a fan of Megan Kelly I'm but you know in in hearing reports about how this all came about um I think uh we all make mistakes\nUh especially on the air um\nOh a story that comes out from the news service and they have to retract the story a she made a mistake she apologized or I don't think there was anything malicious about her intense ah so I I really don't think uh they're taking the right course of action\nI'm ... I'm very much appreciate your input on that rich important to hear thank you so much a Jack Beatty you know obviously the question of blackface plays into a\nA you know a rich and very painful history of ah the way in which white says that not only treated blacks or over the decades and centuries but\nHow they've depicted them at the same time Megan Kelly said she was unaware of the full scope of that history and her apology how does the decision of NBC to essentially a park with her I said well you\nWell it's not so much how it sits with me it's how it fits with the American public a in a massive study called hidden tribes the study of America's polarize landscape just recently released\nA group called more in common they they interview that fold eight thousand people they had our long interviews focus groups et cetera et cetera on the question of political correctness in like eighty percent\nOf Americans of all stripes say it it is a problem in the country\nAh three that includes three quarters of African Americans it includes Seventy nine percent of young people where you tend to think political correctness is rife the only group in the in the tribes of America as a divided here\nThat thinks political correctness understood however you want to put it a is a good thing by a majority are eight percent of the population and these are defined as progressive activists they are very affluent they have a very white\nAnd they are often highly educated but they're all by themselves and that's what he ... he decided he calls them team walk\nThat's not what the what the whole American public seals they don't like political correctness on the other hand eighty two percent of Americans think hate speech is a problem so the American public doesn't like political correctness I'm not saying that this was an example of it but it will be called that and they don't like\nA hate speech either\nDaniel deal you know it's interesting we we heard a lot about political correctness on the campaign trail back in twenty sixteen and it seems like it's popped up in some races maybe a quarter Stewart does underdog race in Virginia against a democratic senator\nTim Kaine how much is a our racial resentments and how much is the question of political correctness of influencing some of the uh the political races you're you're tracking around the country\nI think it is having a significant impact or at least Republicans are trying to make it happen I think that it can impact in quite a number of house race in the ... the Corey Stewart Senate race in Virginia as an obvious example um you know he is wrapped himself in the ... Confederate flag almost literally Mr Stewart I'm but I think you know perhaps even more interesting is the Wii more subtle\nUh efforts that a Republican superPAC and candidates are trying to make in various races um they are in several cases trying to tie their democratic opponents to terrorism I'm In one case a there are in in New York state they are emphasizing the fact that a Rhodes Scholar who's running for the Democrats\nUm was once a rapper who use profanity in his in his political music\nUm and and so these I think are quite an subtle appeals to bigotry or or generously racial resentment um and it's either that they feel that this is a compelling message to many voters or that this is their best message I'm In a in a very challenging for them\nAnd they'll get their whole ... have been questions of whether race informs some of the arguments we've heard about of of voting rights and voter access a during this election season or a subject we've covered on this show but nonetheless one that keeps having new fresh fresh revelations every every day or so\nI think about the Georgia race how does race in form\nA or what's happening governor's race what's happening in terms of voting rights there\nWell I think race race as a huge factor as it often is in southern racism and many other races um you know we have a a a female African American candidate running for the Democrats\nAre yes we have a a white male candidate running for the Republicans the white male ... also happens to be the secretary of state of the state I'm basically in charge of\nElection issues uh and as usual we found that many of the people who are being\nA you know drop from the rolls or otherwise being blocked or discouraged from voting are disproportionately members of minorities particularly African Americans and so in in multiple ways it is impossible to separate race from from Georgia gubernatorial race\nW.

her sister who passed away after\nAnd Brandon don't pose the chief of police in Burlington, Vermont a jeep composer you've a cold this one the priorities of your time they're directed that way by the mayor of Burlington what steps have you taken their\nSo one of the things we realized right away the mayor and eyes that we couldn't just take a policing approach and if you're wondering why she for police got this job of addressing the opioid crisis because most\nAmerican cities um don't have a department of health right we're either relying on county government which we don't have much of an Vermont or state government to\nProvide a solution but at the end of the day it's local governments and their collaborations with hospitals and addiction services providers that have to uh come up with an answer to turn the tide it's the number one source of accidental death in our society today period no matter how you cut it um [noise]\nWhat we did was learn about opioid addiction and one of the things we came away with is that although it's an imperfect solution that unlike crystal meth or on my crack cocaine other drugs there are medicines that interrupt the cravings and withdrawal and the urges the human body for heroin and fentanyl\nAre that don't exist for these other drugs and they're like a cage said even orphan methadone there's a lot of stigma around um\nYou know just the the idea of medication assisted treatment but period it saves lives uh the evidence is irrefutable and otherwise I won't get us out of the spiritual Malaysia that some people say leads to drug addiction it will lower the mortality rate we can take a deep breath and we could move forward so [noise]\nAh with the mayor directed is that we do everything we can to get every opportunity to put people into medication assisted therapy or as of late at our needle exchange if you were to walk in to get some clean syringes and say I'm not ready for treatment you wanted to try some of the medication\nOr you'll get a prescription for it and the prescriptions written by a doctor or a doctor who lost his son to a opioid overdose um if you go to our emergency department with an overdose of sort of just being made conscious again and being\nKicked out the door hey we saved your life but you still have the problem which is what happens in nearly every emergency department in America you can get a prescription for given orphan in Seventy two hour appointment with an addiction psychiatrist that's a new pilot\nAnd we worked very hard in Vermont a familiar Merle Weinberger up to Governor Scott to get legislation in place\nThat mandates medication assisted therapy for every prisoner or in our prison system who needs it and I'll say briefly that if you look at that a model in Rhode Island which made a commitment to get him getting every prisoner in his prison system who needs it the right medication the right time\nThey reduced post in car sort of\nOverdose deaths by sixty two percent by two thirds in fact there down in Rhode Island twelve percent as of last year an overdose deaths two thirds of that reduction two thirds of their twelve percent ... percent of it is just due to what they've done in their prisons and in Vermont where we're trying all these things ah and hopefully they'll turn the tide\nUm kitten O'Neill with this of helped a Matty and people like her\nI mean\nI Believe that would ... then incarcerated multiple times and never received medication assisted treatment while in prison [noise]\nUm you know I think for a Lincoln is an incredibly special place really progressive I think it could lead\nThe country in responding to this um but you know the fact that it is a law enforcement issue is a problem that it's being treated that way this is a public health issues so if if it's if it's being ... you know our jails are the biggest opportunities for rehabilitation in this country right now\nAnd we need to act on that but it needs to we need to step back this is a public health issue and from our again is doing a great job and I think a lot of these measures would have been helpful\nTreatment is still a huge issue and a lot of rural states you know where this this epidemic is occurring you know you have to drive hours to get there but if you don't have a car you know um and then the programs are Twenty one day twenty eight day off an absence based programs you know so there's a lot of issues than I Do think that\nBurlington and you know I'm ... will be leading this and I appreciate that but I'm more needs to be done\nI just want to be clear when you talk about absence base which is another way of describing some of the things like twelve step you're saying that's not actually always helpful folks right I mean 'cause in popular culture for people who don't struggled addiction they may think well that that's going to get them on a good path or it's it's it's easily enough done\nYeah I think you know I'm Brandon just referred to this is a lot of stigma around medication assisted treatment and my family when ... was first starting to get clean had the idea well if you're taking that that down or if you're taking the pronouncing laying out really clean clean or not so far right\nAnd we can just you know there's so much evidence that show that these treatments are the most effective way to treat this disease and sell denying people access are making it difficult for them to have access to it\nYou know I'm I think you know if you if you have an issue\nDon't say people you know like you can't have these drought that would help you get at her and we make it difficult for people to get pissed drunk on that would make them get better and there's stigma around that within the recovery community which I think it's hard to\nLike if you please please go ahead please no I I I think it's important to even be more categorical about what Kate is saying if we stick to an abstinence based plan to help our way out of the opioid crisis we are headed\nFor unmitigated disaster um if somebody is is hell bent on being obstinate were behind them every step of the way clinically if you look at that public health research in the medical research abstinence fails well over Ninety percent of the time as an intervention\nIt's the medicines that we have available to us that reduced uh the these bad outcomes
