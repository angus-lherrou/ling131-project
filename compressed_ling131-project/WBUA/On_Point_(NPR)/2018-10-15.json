all let's just jump right into a how\nThe president is sort of positioning himself and his hopes for the ... elections we heard a little bit of that are on his interview with Leslie stall sixty minutes this weekend\nI'm you know he made he responded to her questions about or his mocking the Christine Blasey Ford and the president actually told style that he didn't want to get into it because bottom line he said quote we won\nThe cabinet fight and that it's going to help the GOP in the ...\nThe way now justice Kevin always treated has become a big factor\nIn the ... have you seen what's going on with the polls\nSo enough totally ... let me start with you here what do you make of the president's interview on sixty minutes and sort of how he's placing himself very much in the middle of what's at stake in the midterms\nWell it is an interesting decision on his part to\nAnd where he sort of made fun of Christine Blasey Ford and talked about how she couldn't remember any of the critical details and he took credit for that is helping relieve lock in judge Kavanaugh's confirmation\nI think a lot of people would not necessarily agree with that but we are seeing in the midterms is I think you know a month ago it seemed like the Republicans were going to hold on to the side of the Democrats were going to retake the house\nNow that seems all the more likely uh it seems like it's going to be really tough for the Democrats to retake the Senate but they're very good shot\nAt the house and part of that you would expect to see any way because\nWhile there was an enthusiasm gap more Republicans are showing excitement about proposing that something you expect to see is an election approaches but I think it was accelerated by the Kavanaugh fight in a real us versus them dynamic that takes place it's not unusual what we're seeing with Republican voters where\nYou know early on that we're maybe not that enthusiastic but now that they're faced with the prospect of a takeover by the opposition are getting more excited and more enthusiastic so I think some of what the president says is true in a sense of the dividing line from sharpened and I think some of it would have happened anyway\nSupport for on point comes from exact science is offering call a garden for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening tests they can be used at home by

for trial and it was almost like a trip to grow all [noise] um [noise] it was just absolutely wonderful uh\nThe uh ... uses Schumer's is a ... or ... or ... or a sharp produced a driver or [noise] um\nAnd he's you know Steve was starting her before it gets you a question because I Do I Do want to hear your question but since you said you went to the Richmond, Kentucky rally or with the president\nThis weekend um and he said it was wonderful I'm just wondering when the president says things that are demonstrably untrue um you know when he basically says the Democrats want open borders to flood the country with criminals we heard that that clip earlier her\n... they don't know I don't think any Democrat who they advocated open borders to flood the country with criminal\nOh yeah yeah you know so that you're totally wrong\nTo flood the country with ... to flood the country with criminals\nYeah that's correct and march thirteenth out of control\nYes but well I guess what I'm Wondering a Steve is that that the president's asserting that the Democrats won commercials that come into the country no Democrat has ever said that so I'm just wondering when he says things that are that are untrue does that does that trouble you at all\nIt's not it's not on true there is a dreadful correct\nOkay uh and so then you're the question that you know your your your sadly wrong\nOr I don't think I've heard a single Democrat say they want to welcome criminals into the country but but you ... the question that you that you had for for for a panel\nKind of a moot point really um you know the question I heard was due to think that a President Trump will\nBuild easy one day and get somebody from in front of the bill one or think she'll go outside to go on for a report from around [noise]\nOkay well Steve thank you so much for your call a ... been David let me turn to you first let's just take us Steve question there about a a a questions about the future of General Mattis as secretary of defense there okay what do we know\nMinutes interview the president said something about mad as being sort of something like sort of a Democrat or something like that which clearly he did not intend to praise and it probably was suggesting that I'd I'm mad as has somewhat more [noise]\nYou know perhaps dovish views for lack of a better term than the president doesn't certain things and that raised a lot of questions about whether or not\nA modest was going to stay that long after the midterms and veterans are traditionally of time with a lot of cabinet members may leave and perhaps Madison's on that list um I think it's a little early to know where he would go for a replacement I mean there's generally you go into the military community or to a former lawmaker but there is some precedent for going to the corporate world\nI think it's early to say but I think uh it was the first time at least that I knew of that there had been that clear of a signal from the White House the possibility that Madison might not be around for that much longer was in the air\nOkay Ayesha Rascoe I had asked the caller about ... what he thought of\nA ... when the president says things that are are untrue and obviously he took exception to that but I the reason why I had asked that is because at these rallies the the president does say things that that we can prove that have no\nNo and no evidence behind them and I mean I guess I was just wondering how much that has an impact on on people who\nAre are going to these rallies how much impact that might have on potential swing voters we heard at least with the with our caller that it makes no difference to him whatsoever because he doesn't think any of it is untrue and I just want to know your response to that\nFor people at those rallies and and I've been to a few rallies I I was at a rally in Iowa at\nWeek I think our time runs together with a with a with a President Trump but the people at these rallies at they were so energize\nThey were amped up they are you know they are true believers so I I don't know whether they take everything that Trump says that the literal truth or they know they say that maybe he's joking sometimes\nBut they they are his fans regardless he does say things like he'll say there are thousands of people\nOutside and that that that clearly won't be true waiting for his rally they're they're not thousands of people outside but he says these things\nBut I don't know that at this point whether it makes much of a difference to the people that support him that like ... ah that are entertained by the things that he says and that that's the core things that he says resonates with them for swing voters\nIf you are skeptical of President Trump then these things being point pointed out or make you may make you questioned him even more but but you kind of have to start from a place of if you already questioning President Trump\nRight So Adam Smith the that same question to you as as Asia said it seems as if it's the the swing voters who could be a influence or or push either way of based on what the president says ... things that are that are both true and and don't have any basis in fact\nIf anybody can find the swing voters I'm struggling to find them everybody's so dug in on both sides\nBut I Will say you know sometimes I think the media and the pundit tree of culture take some of the things that Trump says when he's being a little tongue and cheek we send it sometimes take it too seriously no he's not literally in love with the leader of North Korea\nOr no he doesn't literally think Elizabeth Warren is Pocahontas but there are things that are that the the crowds and they are just enormous crowds don't quite take literally like we do know that that's what\nI had our caller who said that everything the president said was true and yeah and push back on me several times\nAnd if he can my emails a Smith a Tampa Bay dot com if you can email me the name of a single Democrat that said he wants to open borders more criminals can come in you know I Will happily eat my reporter's notebook [laughter] barbecue and I ... I mean just to jump in and yeah go ahead and that's how I\nMean it may be that he wasn't saying that Democrats are declaring that they're in favor of criminals coming in at that that's the impact of everything that they want to do I mean that's sort of how I took what he was trying to say but to me the caller really exemplified to the extent to which were in this country in a very much an us versus them situation\nAnd the people who are motivated seems to me uh as much or more by hatred sometimes of the other side as belief in their own side it's one reason I think that as we approach the election uh there's more energy from the Republicans because the prospect of democratic takeover pointing to people like\nNot only Nancy Pelosi but even Hillary Clinton as a villain who could be empowered if the election goes the wrong way and it's a very resonant with a lot of people and it's I think we're seeing one reason for the energy on on both sides really this absolute a disc taste and dislike an aversion to people on the other side of the political debate\nMm well let's go to David who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma you're on the air David\nI I I was watching sixty minutes interview and I would absolutely astonished that Trump's projection of ...\nA putting that on the Democrats um which is something we ... does is just sort of you know smoke and mirrors everything I mean if you look at the Capitol hearings as an example up\nAdjust theirs are supposed to be impartial he does Fox News interviews he brings Hillary Clinton up in his opening statement a for a doctor or\nLike a huge I mean why travel dot com and college fine where consulting work with high school students that are buying achieved their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship award Moritz College find dot com\nAs a producer of cultural programming and the greater Boston area WB you are is very important Laura Conrad man down executive director of the Jewish arts collaborative WB you are underwriting as a participant in the W.

R. underwriter called six one seven three five three eighty four or five one\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking with a panel of top journalists about what to look for in the week ahead and we are joined today by ... she's NPR's White House correspondent Adam Smith is also with us he's political editor for the Tampa Bay times and the Taliban David joins us as well as an editor at the wall Street Journal Washington bureau and\nAnd we've got lots of comments coming in here's one from our website or on point radio dot org DX says the fact that Florida keeps being hit with storm should make them start to think twice about politicians like governor Rick Scott\nWho denied climate change and\nSince we're just talking about storms and climate change we should play this moment from President Trump's interview with Leslie stall on sixty minutes\nA lovely so open with hurricane Michael and asked the president if he still thinks climate change is a hoax now the president didn't necessarily a he said he didn't necessarily trust scientists because he believes scientists have a political agenda uh and then he said this\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nAyesha Rascoe let me just turn to you quickly on that I mean the scientific consensus is overwhelming that our current at the climate change that we're seeing is indeed a human driven or human exacerbated just your your thoughts on hearing that clip from the president\nIt was interesting because when the when the White House and and when President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year there were a lot of questions from reporters are constantly you know asking uh\nThe the White House does President Trump still believe that climate change is a hoax and they kind of refused to answer and at that time President Trump wasn't giving interviews like he's giving now\nSo this is like the first time that he was really pressed on climate change since he became president and he basically repeating even though he's not seize that is not a hoax he's still repeating this idea that he doesn't really believe it or he doesn't think that it's really an issue\n... well uh I should note that the president tweeted today that he's going to Florida in Georgia with the first lady to tour hurricane damage and visit with FEMA first responders and law enforcement uh so to that point let's go to a color here Beth is calling from St Petersburg Florida you're on the air Beth\nHi ah I'm just curious I'd love to hear Adam perspective on the impact that politics will play on recovery of hurricane Michael because here you have Trump\nComing and um and he sort of control the purse strings Trump and Scott the Republican versus Gillum the Democrat and happened in his backyard pretty much so I'd love to hear your thoughts on\nThat best thank you for your call Adam go ahead\nWell if I'm One of the people in those are hard hit communities in North Florida I'm actually should be pretty happy that this that everything is so political and we're just a few weeks away from the election because lord knows Rick Scott and Donald Trump or going to do everything they can to look like they are effectively responding to this thing\nUh that said you know you've got some candidates Andrew Gillum a is basically sort of shut down his overt campaigning so he can stay in a ... in Tallahassee and look what he's involved you've got candidates like Rhonda than just the fellow who's running for governor\nWho is struggling to get attention and to some extent Bill Nelson our senior senator who whom Rick Scott is running against\nIs also I think having a little bit of a hard time getting noticed so politics never disappears\nUh but that said I I think it's a it's a very very big motivator to respond properly\nYeah well let's switch gears here than and talk about uh the increasing tensions and questions around uh\nThe disappearance and as the as the as Turkish officials are saying the murder of journalist and dissidents ... a ... and the Taliban David or the president's tweeting today that he just spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia and the king denies any\nShow the a and that now the president President Donald Trump saying he immediately sending secretary of state Mike Pompeo to meet with the Saudi king your thoughts on that well\nIt's a bit of a mixed message coming out of the White House and whether that's by design or simply because that's how they are a little bit hard to say uh it's true he did say that about Saudi Arabia reminds me a little bit of some of his comments about\nA president ... you know he says that ah they denied very strongly he said it could be some rogue actors are in the case of the Russians you may recall he said it could be some four hundred pound guy on the bad I don't need a lot of other yeah in a basement you know I don't think a lot of other people suggesting it could be route killers unconnected to\nSaudi Arabia um so the one hand and the sixty minutes interview he talked about that there's going to be severe punishment if it turns out\nThat the Saudis are behind it on the other hand he's taken the idea of canceling her arms deals with the Saudis off he he he's just\nTaking that off the table a and has talked about how much he has a good relationship with them but then he turns around and sends pump HBO and talks about getting to the bottom of it and it just I think in some ways a reflection of our fairly complex relationship\nWith Saudi Arabia where they're an authoritarian country without any question on the other hand we have a lot of commercials Roy relations with them we sort of counter them to be a stabilizing force\nIn the middle east and the one last thing I just want to say is is President Trump tends to have kind of a\nPersonal relationship with leaders that's how he describes it he'll he'll say whether he means it literally or not that he and Kim fell in love with each other or he and president Xi have chemistry it's for him a lot about how he feels his personal relationships are with these folks and it's clear that the leader of Saudi Arabia had been some you know and be asked as people call him\nYou know had a very strong effect not only on a leader said Washington but also let's face it are many journalists he's a charismatic guy and all these things are complicating factors in\nUs well a Natalia since you mentioned that moment on sixty minutes interview let's hear it a this was when the president told\nLeslie stall that he would be quote very upset and angry if the Saudi Government uh did indeed assassinate ... but then as the Taliban David points out President Trump also said he didn't want to lose big arms contracts\nThey order a military equipment\nEverybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted it China wanted we wanted to we got it so would you cut that off ... well I think what I don't want to do\nRowing Lockheed Raphael and all these ... I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order to like that there are other ways of ah\nPolishing to use a word that's a pretty harsh word but it's true\nThat the president speaking to Leslie stall sixty minutes this weekend at let's go to Jose who's calling from Aspen, Colorado Jose you're on the air\nOh pretty good I'm not sure that are going\nTo push to commit a oh first of all are a lot of people are familiar with his long um\nQuestion I'm only a predicament desert for the Trump will go to ... just was very very bored of military ... or ... or your courage to that\nMm well I Hope they we just heard that clip of the president on sixty minutes saying he doesn't want to or do anything to damage those contracts and that there are other ways of quote punishing a the Saudis iffy deems that necessary so perhaps not\nYou know wondering what your journal okay we're a\nGreat well let me turn to Ayesha Rascoe for her son ice you what do you think\nThese these military contracts with Saudi Arabia\nTo point out that a lot of these are kind of like promises or like instant like kind of letters of interests are intent so all of the money that he's talking about it's not fully locked in so it it's really um I\n... I don't want to overstate the mouths of of actual military contracts that the U.S has with Saudi Arabia\nAnd he also talked about the Saudi Saudi Arabia kind of just easily going to China or Russia to buy military equipment but they've already invested\nAnd US military equipment so it would be difficult for them they can't just switch over I and go get Russian\nA Russian equipment or Chinese equipment so this idea that it would be a easy for them to just switch it is not necessarily true but Trump is is kind of making this point that he doesn't want he's drawing the line in the sand\nThat he wants to leave arms deals on the table with Saudi Arabia that could set up\nHer body this is on point in the twenty sixteen election then candidate Donald Trump said that American foreign policy

you ... what you see as a America's one of America's animating a foreign policy forces as a liberal a Gemini that's the kind of at the center of your book what do you mean by liberal a Gemini\nWell it's a a short term for the grand strategy of the United states has been following say since the end of the Cold War I'm it's liberal not in the sense of being left wing or right versus right wing but liberal in the sense that it seeks to promote\nThe classical liberal values of individual rights democracy free markets or things like that and it's a Gemini a because it sees those things can only be spread around the world if they're done\nUnder American leadership at America's bashed in through the active use of American power in some cases including the use of military power\nSo when you think about it this is a strategy that doesn't seek to preserve the status quo it would actually wants to revise politics all over the world\nSupport for on point comes from college find where consulting

... dot\nCom [noise]\nIs on point I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking this hour with Stephen Walt he's a professor of international affairs at Harvard University and author of the new book the hell of good intentions America's foreign policy elite and the decline\nOf us primacy and you can join us where one eight hundred forty three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk a let's listen to a little bit more\nOver the past generation have talked about a U.S primacy of being a reason why this country ought to spread democracy around the world this is first of all you're going to hear from secretary of State Madeleine Albright of course served under President Bill Clinton\nAnd she popularized the phrase indispensable nation to describe the United states he or she is in Nineteen Ninety eight at doing remark she gave at Tennessee State university\nWhat is needed above all is American leadership we are the only superpower and as a result of that we had many responsibilities and privileges we stand tall and therefore we can see further into the future and I think that therefore we do have very special role\nThan in two thousand five at his second inaugural address President George W. Bush spilled out his vision for advancing freedom globally through American foreign policy\nSo it is a policy of the United states\nDo seek and support the growth of democratic movements\nAnd institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny and our world\nEven to\nA different people from two different parties here with us ... roughly the same idea that you call this policy failure right why\nWell there's lots of different reasons the easiest way to see this is look at the world we had in Nineteen Ninety three where we expect that everything was going to go swimmingly and the world we're in today are back in Nineteen Ninety three of the United states is on good terms with all the major powers including Russia and China\nA democracy is in fact spreading into Eastern Europe and in parts of Latin America or Iran has no nuclear enrichment capability at all in Nineteen Ninety three Iraq has been disarmed after the first Gulf War\nOr the Oslo peace process is underway ah so we were thinking that maybe we're going to get you know peace in the middle east as well as his ... ordinary optimism\nThere now fast forward to twenty eight team\nUm the relationship with Russia and China is worse than it's been since the Cold War or there's been no progress towards peace in the middle east in fact most people believe the two state solution that the United states has actively promoted\nIs farther away than ever Iran had added a as many as Nineteen thousand centrifuges before fight signing the nuclear deal but there are sexually or a late nuclear power and oh India Pakistan and North Korea have all tested nuclear weapons\nAnd finally democracy is in retreat in lots of different places a Freedom House are reported last year that it was the twelfth consecutive year of a decline in global freedom\nSo when you have President Bush saying that that's our goal and tyranny in the world that gold doesn't seem to be working out one final point um the economist magazine last year and it's democracy index downgraded the United states from being a full democracy to a flawed democracy\nSo it seems to me if the project here was to spread American values far and wide that project has failed and was quite significant geopolitical consequences for us as well as the cost we've seen in a variety of different places\nWithout a doubt but are you saying that uh for example the retreat of democracy of ... worldwide is it that it can be see that that American foreign policy efforts can be seen as having contributed to that retreat\nI think they've contributed they're not the sole cause as well but for example I think we pushed democracy very quickly er into places uh Eastern Europe\nAnd what we're seeing now the backsliding hungry backsliding in Poland a suggests that that project has not gone particularly well certainly American efforts to a transformed the middle east at the\nAt the point of a rifle barrel in fact have clearly failed a you know had the United states not invaded Iraq and two thousand three would not have gotten ISIS\nUm the effort to overthrow Moammar Gadhafi live into a failed state and other American interventions in places like Somalia and Yemen have made things worse rather than better\nBy the way for all of this is going on then countries like Russia and China\nAnd Iran and North Korea and others sit there and say well the American objective is to overthrow other governments and turn them into democracies we're not really full democracy so we have to be worried about that so what can we do to prevent that from happening to us\nOne reaction is you seize Crimea to stop the Ukraine for moving towards the west and other possibilities you get nuclear weapons because then the United states will have to leave you alone and might even be willing to meet and talk with you as well\nSo in a sense the project which is an admirable when in terms of its ideals tends to generate a backlash in a variety of places\nOne of the questions or that you that you explore in the book the key question is how this notion of the primacy of the U.S project to spread democracy persisted for so long because\nWas but it wasn't on impeachable a part of U.S foreign policy for so long you couldn't even question this as one of the duties that America had to the world being as guiding light for democracy ah but you said that there is an entrenched foreign policy elite that helps\nA that idea that notion persist across administration who are they who is this foreign policy elite you're talking about\nYou know it's a a broad a group of set of people are I Would say you know when a Ben Rhodes the former national security advisor referred to the foreign policy blob\nIn Washington that's essentially who I'm Talking about but we're talking about the formal institutions of government the parts of the actual government bureaucracy the defense department intelligence services State Department so they're part of this\nOf this whole sort of think tank world the number of supporting institutions in Washington that right to comment on foreign issues on a pretty much a daily basis then of course we have very special interest groups in lobbies on a whole series of issues from arms control to human rights to ethnic lobbies to the business community\nAs well I Would put in parts of the media who writes about foreign affairs and of course people like me in academia who are also actively engaged in writing who've train students and often go to Washington\nTo work so that's who I'm Talking about um and what's striking to me about most of that group not every single member of it but most of that group is the remarkable consensus behind what I've called the birth of Gemini this idea that the United states first of all have to exercise global leadership in every corner of the world\nAnd second it has to do that and the pursuit of the spreading of these various liberal ideals and there's a whole I could talk about the different sort of sacred cows within their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines\nIn favor of that you see this and the fact that most Democrats supported the Iraq War back in two thousand three um you see that in the fact that people tend to circulate amongst different think tanks without much a difference because they're all kind of interchangeable or to some degree\nAnd finally I think you see that in fact that the various quotations you've been playing here from Republicans and Democrats alike all subscribe to the same set of ideals\nBut as I Want to get to him in in a second about how you ... you see this foreign policy elite is on accountable but Iraq is a disaster of the Iraq War is isn't\nIt it's an interesting moment to discuss here because I Want to dive into that a little bit\n'cause you know you said that the majority of Democrats supported the Iraq War but it wasn't that in part because it was also sold to the American people as a war for the security of national security of the United states I mean that's part of what you say here that the foreign policy elite as\nFrequently are collected issues of security in order to uh to get people on board with this idea of spreading democracy I mean isn't Iraq where the perfect example of that um\nI I think it ... it shows you how easy it is to steer 'em a stir the debate and one of the points I make in the book is that the\nForeign policy elite down especially presidents in the executive branch have all sorts of advantages in selling policies to the world [noise]\nUm and I point out that there's actually a pretty significant gap between what the American people actually say they want they want a more restrained foreign policy they don't want to engage in all these crusades around the world [noise]\nSo how do you convince them to go along\nWell you do the things that the Bush administration did but again it's not unique to the Bush administration you inflate threats\nAnd told me advice or a matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can

R. dot org slash cars and thanks [noise]\n\nTo some point I'm making a check her body we're speaking today with Stephen Walt his new book is the hell of good intentions America's foreign policy elite and the decline of us primacy\nA and professor of wealth lots of comments coming in just read a couple of them to you on Twitter poll mousse or us is saying questioned the premise that the u._s. was ever really on a humanitarian intervention military or otherwise\nI says Noam Chomsky debunk this and wall should counters arguments are limits of allowable debate are showing\nA David Crandall says liberal Gemini missing from our discussion if the counter effect that liberal values of human rights et cetera have been used as a stalking horse for American corporate had Gemini which is a highly questionable democratizing influence uh just your thoughts on on those two comments first of all the Walt\nI'm I'm sort of sympathetic to both comments I've never thought that American foreign policy was heavily ... but I Want to be very careful they're heavily driven by corporate interests in this sort of narrow sense yes the United states\nKind of me and that's good for some corporations not all\nOf them and in some cases there have been corporations that had particular influence over U.S foreign policy but I don't think that's what we do we do a lot of things that actually don't benefit corporations at all go back to the\nUh Nineteen nineties for example a Dick Cheney when he was running Halliburton used to complain about our sanctions happy foreign policy because it was making it impossible for Halliburton and oil services corporation to do business with Iraq or to do business with Iran Cheney wanted to make money but our foreign policy was one of sanctioning\nBoth of them and then that very same person ... during the Iraq War and Halliburton got to go in and uh you know and have billions of dollars of us contracts\nThere that's right I'm a ... and finally uh I I think the United states does not devote a lot of effort to a purely humanitarian intervention it's hard to get the United states to do something purely to help other people I'm not talking about rescue missions and things things like that [noise]\nUm but I Do think that motivation has been there a that his ... has driven certainly the intervention in Libya was I think driven in good part by the desire to prevent what people suspected would be if not a genocide at least mass killings in ... and the desire to end now\nAt that point then uh the sort of desire also to try and do regime change took over and what had originally been justified by purely humanitarian concerns and approved by the U.N Security Council on that basis became something bigger\nYeah but so just to follow up on this idea of a corporate interests when we're talking about the foreign policy elite in Washington now art ... some of those corporations the funding sources for many of the think tank we were just talking about in the previous segment\nYou know there's no question and and if you look I think that the role of\nOf the military what do you know Eisenhower calls the military industrial complex they are very actively involved in funding a variety of think tanks organizations who ... not surprisingly then want the United states to have an ambitious foreign policy and a very strong military because that's where they make the money [noise]\nAlright well lots of college this list at least get a couple of them and hear Mitchell is calling from coming Georgia you're on the image\nI think so much for taking my call 'em you know I I just think are under under our current president um who is an amoral agent uh mostly concerned with a well I worry that are American values\nAre going to be malleable or that they might even be for sale I think the current controversy around Saudi Arabia and uh the uh journalists a highlight this conflict of interest and I just want to know your thoughts are on our values for sale Mitch thank you for your call Stephen\nWalt well in some respects I think uh our values have always been to some degree for sale or there have always been a a sense of trade offs that there were set of ideals that the United states has stood for in order to promote in the world and there were other imperatives as well with our national security or others [noise]\nUh and we have always sort of wrestled with which of these uh to favor and most of the time it's your national security and economic prosperity that tends to win out\nMost of the time we are seeing a particularly stark\nA vision of that right now with the controversy over the possible murder of a the Saudi journalist can show you are in Istanbul and it's interesting to see that that you know for example there's this supposedly this big conference in Saudi Arabia or next week and a bunch of corporate sponsors and other participants have been pulling out of it says\nPresident Trump has been lawfully it seems to me on this one ah that his initial statements were uh were quite forgiving he seems to be you know in typical Trump being fashion\nKicking up sort of squid ink cloud of distortion about it\nUm [noise] it so I think you know the the concern the caller has is exactly right here and that's why I think one of the larger issues with President Trump is his inability to separate out some of his own personal interest and possibly personal financial interest from the broader interest of the country\nWell so let's talk more about the Trump Administration now because the you open your book saying that um then candidate Donald Trump had a clear articulation of\nHis view of these foreign policy failures that we've been talking about throughout this hour Stephen Walt so so let's just just to remind folks what what the president then candidate Trump said when he critiqued the status quo of U.S foreign policy here he is on the campaign trail from April twenty sixteen\nUnfortunately after the cold or a foreign policy veered badly of course we failed to develop a new vision for a new time in fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense\nLogic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance which led to one foreign policy disaster after another they just kept coming and coming\nThat's Donald Trump on April\nWe could talk a lot about the foreign policy decisions the president has made since then I mean about the Paris climate accord about or his uh just discussions with North Korea about the Iran nuclear program but I really want to focus on Syria here for for a moment because\nUh you know we just heard the president twenty sixteen saying lots of foreign policy disasters led by foolishness an arrogance\nBut now we're hearing a for example national security adviser John Bolton\nTalking about extending the American mission in Syria beyond the Syrian civil war and to containment of Iran for as long as Iranian forces are in Syria or Iranian backed militias are anywhere in the region\nA so here's the national security visor Bolton again issuing a stern warning to Iran or at a group called a United against nuclear on summit last month\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed the hell to pay\nThe John Bolton there a Steven will not necessarily talking about a democratizing force but a an expansion of the U.S military mission in Syria so is the is the Trump Administration being pulled by the same a foreign policy forces that we've been talking about this hour\nUm I think in the twenty sixteen campaigned a Trump who's not a sophisticated thinker on these things but he did into it or that something had gone badly wrong with U.S foreign policy and that resonated with the American people are when he said you know American foreign policy is complete and total disaster a lot of people out of their heads in agreement\nAnd that was especially effective against Hillary because she could titled or tried to counter foreign policy credentials but I think what you've seen is a ... ah since Trump became president although his style is approach to the president and his\nPublic style of handling diplomacy whether it's by Twitter or by his personal interactions with other leaders is completely different and I think we're remarkably counterproductive\nWhat strikes me most about it is how he has been pulled back in a lot of these same directions\nI'm certainly the fact that I having complained about nation building and we're not going to we're going to get out of the nation building business\nYou know he spent more troops to Afghanistan or as you recounted he now seems to be willing to commit the United states to stay in Syria a much longer even though we don't really have an idea of what we're trying to accommodate potentially indefinitely essentially indefinitely I'm\nA he has bought a hook line and sinker the idea that Iran is some mortal threat to American interests are throughout the middle east uh and that of course\nHas led him to double down with Saudi Arabia doubled down with a Egypt a double town with Israel as well but notice that those are all of our traditional Middle East ally so he's not doing anything different there\nYou'll recall he was very critical of NATO a NATO countries had started spending more they had actually started spending more even in the Obama administration would of course he has no reaffirmed the American a commitment to NATO in a variety of ways as well\nNinety two

political editor for the Tampa Bay times Adam welcome to on point thanks good to be here or at first of all let's just jump right into a how\nThe president is sort of positioning himself and his hopes for the ... elections we heard a little bit of that are on his interview with Leslie stall sixty minutes this weekend\nI'm you know he made he responded to her questions about\nOr his mocking of Christine Blasey Ford and the president actually told stole that he didn't want to get into it because bottom line he said quote we won the Kavanaugh fight and that it's going to help the GOP in the ...\nThe way now justice Kevin always treated has become a big factor\nIn the ... have you seen what's going on with the polls\nSo enough totally ... let me start with you here what do you make of the president's interview on sixty minutes and sort of how he's placing himself very much in the middle of what's at stake in the ...\nWell it is an interesting decision on his part to defend a an earlier speech that he gave where he sort of made fun\nOf Christine Blasey Ford and talked about how she couldn't remember any of the critical details\nAnd he took credit for that is helping really locked in judge Kavanaugh's confirmation I think a lot of people would not necessarily agree with that but we are seeing in the midterms is I think you know a month ago it seemed like the Republicans were going to hold on to the side of the Democrats were going to retake the house\nNow that seems all the more likely uh it seems like it's going to be really tough for the Democrats retake that set it but they have a very good shot\nAt the house and part of that you would expect to see any way because\nA while there was an enthusiasm gap more Republicans are showing excitement about ... and that's something you expect to see is an election approaches but I think it was a celebrated by the Kavanaugh fight in a real us versus them dynamic that takes place it's not unusual what we're seeing with Republican voters where\nYou know early on that we're maybe not that enthusiastic but now that they're faced with the prospect of a takeover by the opposition are getting more excited and more enthusiastic so I think some of what the president says is true in a sense of the dividing line to sharpen and I think some of it would have happened anyway\nAnd a genetic log on radio Boston the Harvard admissions

and comment a\nReader [noise] we went to a rally in Richmond a cookie\nOr for trial and it was almost like a trip to grow all [noise] um [noise] it was just absolutely wonderful I'm\nThe I'm ... years was Schumer's is a ... or ... or ... or a sharp roost a driver or [noise] um\nAnd then or he or she was just starting or before it gets you a question because I Do I Do want to hear your question but since you said you went to the Richmond, Kentucky rally or with the president\nThis weekend um and he said it was wonderful I'm just wondering when the president says things that are demonstrably untrue um you know when he basically says the Democrats want open borders to flood the country with criminals we heard that that clip earlier her ... they don't know I don't think any Democrat who they advocated open borders to flood the country with criminal\nOh yeah yeah you know for half you're totally wrong\nTo flood the country with ... to flood the country with criminals\nYeah that's correct and my Thirteen out of control\nYes but well I guess what I'm Wondering a Steve is that that the president's asserting that the Democrats won commercials that come into the country no Democrat has ever said that so I'm just wondering when he says things that are that are untrue does that does that trouble you at all\nIt's not on true there is a drug for correct\nOkay uh and so then you're the question that your your your your sadly wrong\nOr I don't think I've heard a single Democrat say they want to welcome criminals into the country but but\nYou ... the question that you that you had for for for a panel\nKind of a moot point really a question I heard was due to think that a President Trump will\nGo easy one day and get somebody from room to build one or think she'll go outside to go on for a report from around [noise]\nOkay well Steve thank you so much for your call a ... been David let me turn to you first let's just take us Steve question there about a a a questions about the future of General Mattis as secretary of defense there okay what do we know\nWhat I was raised because during the sixty minutes interview the president said something about mad as being sort of something like sort of a Democrat or something like that which clearly he did not intend to\nPraise and it probably was suggesting that I'd I'm mad as has somewhat more [noise] you know perhaps dovish views for lack of a better term than the president doesn't certain things in that raised a lot of questions about whether or not\nA modest was going to stay that long after the midterms immigrants are traditionally of time with a lot of cabinet members may leave and perhaps Madison's on that list um I think it's a little early to know where he would go for a replacement I mean there's generally you go into the military community or to a former lawmaker but there is some precedent for going to the corporate world\nI think it's early to say but I think uh it was the first time at least that I knew of that in there had been that clear of a signal from the White House that the possibility that Madison might not be around for that much longer or was in the air\nOkay Ayesha Rascoe I had to ask the caller about ... what he thought of\nWhen the president says things that are are untrue and obviously he took exception to that but I the reason why I had asked that is because at these rallies that the president does say things that that we can prove are have no\nUh no no evidence behind them and I mean I guess I was just wondering how much that has an impact on on people who\nAre are going to these rallies how much impact that might have on potential swing voters we heard at least with the with our caller that it makes no difference to him whatsoever because he doesn't think any of it is untrue and I just want to know your response\nFor people at those rallies and and I've been to a few ... I was at a rally in Iowa at\nWeek I think our time runs together or with with a President Trump but the people at these rallies at they were so energized they were amped up they are you know they are true believers\nSo I don't know whether they take everything that Trump says that the literal truth or they know they say that maybe he's joking sometimes\nAre his fans regardless he does say things like he'll say there are thousands of people outside and that meant that clearly won't be true waiting for his rally they're they're not thousands of people outside but he says these things\nBut I don't know that at this point when they make so much of a difference to the people that support him that like ... ah that are entertained by\nThe things that he says and that that's the core things that he says resonates with them\nFor a swing voters if you are skeptical of President Trump then these things being point pointed out or make you may make you questioned him even more but but you kind of have to start from a place of if you already questioning President Trump\nRight So Adam Smith says the same question to you as as Asia said it seems as if it's the the swing voters who could be a influenced or or push either way of based on what the president says things that are that are both true and and don't have any basis in fact\nIf anybody can find the swing voters I'm struggling to find them everybody's so dug in on both sides\nBut I Will say you know sometimes I think the media and the pundits three of the culture take some of the things that Trump says when he's being a little tongue in cheek we send it sometimes take it too seriously no he's not literally in love with the leader of North Korea\nOr no he doesn't literally think Elizabeth Warren has Pocahontas but there are things that are that the the crowds and they are just an enormous crowds uh don't quite take literally like we do not\nHave had our caller who said that everything the president said was true and yeah and push back on me several times\nAnd if he can my email is a Smith a Tampa Bay dot com if he can email me the name of a single Democrat that said he wants to open borders more criminals can come in you know I Will happily eat my reporter's notebook [laughter]\nBarbecue well maybe I mean just to jump in and yeah go ahead and that's how I mean it may be that he\nWasn't saying that Democrats are declaring that they're in favor of criminals coming in and that that's the impact of everything that they want to do I mean that's sort of how I took what he was trying to say but to me the caller really exemplified to the extent to which were in this country in a very much an us versus them situation\nAnd the people who are motivated seems to me ah as much or more by hatred sometimes with the other side as belief in their own side it's one reason I think that as we approach the election uh there's more energy from the Republicans because the prospect of democratic takeover pointing to people like\nNot only Nancy Pelosi but even Hillary Clinton as the villain who could be empowered if the election goes the wrong way and it's a very resonant with a lot of people and it's I think we're seeing one reason for the energy on on both sides really this\nAbsolute a disc taste and dislike an aversion to people in the other side of the political debate Mm well let's go to David who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma you're on the air David\nMagnet panel I I was watching sixty minutes interview and I was absolutely astonished that Trump's projection of the street and the viciousness\nUh putting that on the Democrats um which is something we typically does is just sort of you know smoke and mirrors everything I mean if you look at the Capitol hearings as an example of a justice is supposed to be\nImpartial he does Fox News interviews he brings Hillary Clinton up in his opening statement a for a doctor or drop apologizes for Kavanaugh in history but I'm not a word about Dr Ford\nNature works landscape dot com and college vines were mentors selected from Harvard Stanford's do more work with your child to provide mentors ship in college admissions guidance Morris College falling dot com [noise]\n\nAnd Dr Jeffrey liking the chairman president and CEO of or tax you are under writer there was a question about how we should get our message out\nAnd the end of the day we chose WVU ours because of their ability to provide the balance of complex kinds of discussions important in our current and that's paid off I hear about it every day from Boise patients and physicians and from others\nMore information about underwriting on WB rock hall fix one seven three five three four five one [noise]\nThis is on point I'm making a truck or body we're talking with a panel of top journalists about what to look for in the week ahead and we're joined today by ... NPR's White House correspondent Adam Smith is also with us he's political editor for the Tampa Bay times and the Taliban David joins us as well as an editor at the wall Street Journal Washington bureau and\nAnd we've got lots of comments coming in here's one from our website or on point radio dot org DX oath says the fact that Florida keeps being hit with storm should make them start to think twice about politicians like governor Rick Scott\nWho denied climate change and since we're just talking about storms and climate change we should play this moment from President Trump's interview with Leslie stall on sixty minutes\nAh Lesley Stahl open with hurricane Michael it asks the president if he's still things climate change is a hoax now the president didn't necessarily a he said he didn't necessarily trust scientists because he believes scientists have a political agenda and then he said this\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but\nThis um I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put at a disadvantage\nAyesha Rascoe let me just turn to you quickly on that I mean the scientific consensus is overwhelming that our current at the climate change that we're seeing is indeed a human driven or human exacerbated just your thoughts on hearing a that clip from the president\nIt was interesting because when the when the White House and and when President Trump pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year there were a lot of questions from reporters are constantly you know asking\nUh the the White House does President Trump still believe that climate change is a hoax and they kind of refused to answer and at that time President Trump wasn't giving interviews like he's giving now\nSo this is like the first time that he was really impressed on climate change since he became president and he basically repeating even though he's not see said it's not a hoax he's still repeating this idea that he doesn't really believe it or he doesn't think that it's really an issue\n... well uh I should note that the president tweeted today that he is going to Florida in Georgia with the first lady to tour hurricane damage and visit with FEMA first responders and law enforcement or so to that point let's go to a color here Beth is calling from St Petersburg Florida you're on the air Beth\nHi ah I'm just curious I'd love to hear Adam perspective on the impact that politics will play on recovery of hurricane Michael because yeah you have Trump\nComing and um and he sort of control the purse strings Trump and Scott Republican versus Democrat and happen in ... backyard pretty much so I'd love to hear your thoughts on\nThat best thank you for your call Adam go ahead\nWell if I'm One of the people in those are hard hit communities in North Florida I'm actually should be pretty happy that this that everything is so political and we're just a few weeks away from the election because lord knows Rick Scott and Donald Trump or going to do everything they can to look like they are effectively responding to this thing\nUh that said you know you've got some candidates Andrew Gillum a is basically sort of shut down his overt campaigning so he can stay in a ... in Tallahassee and look what he's involved you've got candidates like round to than just the fellow who's running for governor\nWho is struggling to get attention and to some extent Bill Nelson our senior senator who whom Rick Scott is running against\nIs also I think having a little bit of a hard time getting noticed so politics never disappears uh but that said I I think it's a it's a very very big motivator to respond properly\nYeah well let's switch gears here than and talk about ah the increasing tensions and questions around uh\nThe disappearance and as the as the as Turkish officials are saying the murder of journalist and dissident Jamal a ...\nAnd the Taliban David or the president's tweeting today that he just spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia and the king denies any knowledge whatsoever of whatever may have happened\nTo show the a and that now the president President Donald Trump saying he's immediately sending secretary of state Mike Pompeo to meet with the Saudi king your thoughts on that well\nIt's a bit of a mixed message coming out of the White House and whether that's by design or simply because that's how they are a little bit hard to say uh it's true he did say that about Saudi Arabia reminds me a little bit of some of his comments about\nA president putting you know he said that uh they denied very strongly he said it could be some rogue actors uh in in the case of the Russians you may recall he said it could be some four hundred pound guy on the bed I'll get a lot of other yeah you know based on you know I don't think a lot of other people suggesting it could be route killers unconnected to\nSaudi Arabia um so the one hand and the sixty minutes interview he talked about that there's going to be severe punishment if it turns out that the Saudis are behind it and the other hand he's taken the idea of canceling her arms deals with the Saudis off he he he's just\nTaking that off the table a and his ... talked about how much he has a good relationship with them but then he turns around and sends pump HBO and talks about getting to the bottom of it and it's just I think in some ways a reflection of our fairly complex relationship\nWith Saudi Arabia where they're an authoritarian country without any question on the other hand we have a lot of commercials really relations with them we sort of counting them to be a stabilizing force in the middle east and the one last thing I just want to say is is President Trump tends to have kind of a\nPersonal relationship with leaders that's how he describes it he'll he'll say whether he means it literally or not that he and Kim fell in love with each other or he and president Xi have chemistry it's for him a lot about how he feels his personal relationships are with these folks and it's clear that the leader of Saudi Arabia and ... had been some you know and BSS people call him\nYou know had a very strong effect not only on a leaders in Washington but also let's face it on many journalists he's a charismatic guy and all these things are complicating factors in\nWell a enough probably since you mentioned that moment in the sixty minutes interview let's hear it ah this is when the president told Leslie stall\nThe Saudi Government uh did indeed assassinate ... but then as necessarily been David points out President Trump also said he didn't want to lose big arms contracts\nThey ordering military equipment\nEverybody in the world wanted that order Russia wanted it China wanted we wanted it we got it so would you cut that off ... well ... what I don't want to do\nRowing Lockheed Raphael and all these ... I don't want to hurt jobs I don't want to lose in order like that there are other ways of ah\nPolishing do use the word that's a pretty harsh words that is true\nThat the president speaking to Leslie stall sixty minutes this weekend at let's go to Jose who's calling from Aspen, Colorado Jose you're on the air\nOh pretty good I'm not sure that are going\nTo push to commit a first of all are you are familiar with his long um\nQuestion I'm only a predicament desert for ... ... ... just for free and border military ... or ... or ... to\n... well I Hope they we just heard that clip of the president on sixty minutes saying he doesn't want to or do anything to damage those contracts and that there are other ways of quote punishing a the Saudis iffy deems that necessary so perhaps not\nYou know wondering what your journal okay we're a\nGreat well let me turn to Ayesha Rascoe for her son ice you what do you think\nThese these military contracts with Saudi Arabia I\nHave to point out that a lot of these are kind of like promises or like instant like kind of\nLetters of interests are intense so all of the money that he's talking about it's not fully locked in so it it's really um I ... I don't want to overstate the mouths of of actual military contracts that the U.S has with Saudi Arabia\nAnd he also talked about the Saudi Saudi Arabia kind of just easily going to China or Russia to buy military equipment but they've already invested\nAnd US military equipment so it would be difficult for them they can't just switch over I and go get Russian\nA Russian equipment or Chinese equipment so this idea that it would be a easy for them to just switch it is not necessarily true but\nTrump is is kind of making this point that he doesn't want he's drawing the line in the sand that he wants to leave arms deals on the table with Saudi Arabia\nThat could set up a a kind of a standoff with Congress because you have law makers who are calling for a hawk or a arms sales of Saudi Arabia and if they decide if you have", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "15"}
