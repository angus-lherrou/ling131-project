News the Brett Kavanaugh vote I'm Jeremy ... in Washington that name Brett Kavanaugh is likely to be in our lives for decades he will change the balance of the Supreme Court\nReplacing the courts swing vote Anthony Kennedy and he may have an impact on control of Congress and how much President Trump is able to accomplish for the remainder of his presidency this hour how did we get here what does Kavanaugh's confirmation mean for the Supreme Court\nAnd what are the ramifications for the country a country that is in the midst of the me too movement and a month away from the mid term elections let's start with the defining moment on the Senate floor when America found out that Brett Kavanaugh was all but guaranteed to sit on the court Mr President\nI Will follow chicken from judge Kaplan\nMaine Republican Senator Susan Collins with her closing argument in support of Kavanaugh that came after a contentious three months that began on July night\nHe's a brilliant jurist with a clear ineffective writing style universally regarded as one of the finest and sharpest legal minds of our time\nPresident Trump had promised to nominate judges who oppose abortion rights Canada's name came from a list given to the president by the federalist society an advocacy group with the conservative agenda that Kevin uh told senators that he viewed the landmark roe versus Wade decision is settled law\nAs a judge it is an important precedent of the Supreme Court by it I mean roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey been reaffirmed many times\nShe sees precedent on precedent which itself is an important factor to remember and I understand the significance of the issue the jurors credential issue and I understand the significance as best I can\nI always try and I do hear of the real world effects of that decision as I tried to do of all the decisions of my core of the Supreme Court\nHe also promised to be fair and impartial judge\nBeing a good judge means paying attention to the words that are written the words of the constitution the words of the statutes that are passed by Congress not doing what I Want to do\nIn early September Democrats used there two days of questioning Kavanaugh to point out that they weren't given enough information about his record that after the first round of hearings Kavanaugh's confirmation looked like a sure thing\nUntil a week later when the Washington Post published a story about allegations from Christine Blasey Ford who claims Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when both were in high school she agreed to testify about it before the Senate Judiciary committee in one of the most watched congressional hearings in decades\nMain motivation and cutting for waiting list to be helpful and fight facts hamster cabinet accents had damaged my life\nSo that you could take into a serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed it is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr cabinet is there is just sit

works landscape dot com [noise]\nWe're back now with a special report from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh vote\nI'm Jeremy helps in in Washington so what does the nomination and confirmation process we've witnessed over the past three months I mean for the Supreme Court the conservative Kavanaugh will replace Justice Anthony Kennedy who was for three decades the swing vote on the court we heard from\nThis week is Ninety eight was appointed by Gerald Ford and said Canada should not be on the court\n... the ... and he\nShould have been in for a ... but I think this is his performance during the hearings cause me to change when la\nNina Totenberg an extraordinary moment of former justice saying that about a nominee\nWell what he said was that because Kavanaugh had framed his entire critique at his the second round of hearings as a partisan attack not just on Democrats but I'm liberal groups and I'm like liberal activists that all those people when they come to the Supreme Court\nCould rightly maintained that they won't get a fair and unbiased hearing from him and you saw Brett Kavanaugh today the wall Street Journal tried to walk back is what he said call his emotional comments but he didn't say specifically which ones in any event Steven's point was that uh\nThat he might have to recuse himself now I think that's an they're highly unlikely\nPossibility given Kavanaugh's demeanor and how does that happen\nAlso that of justice refuses himself or herself\nIt usually happens when there's a set of rules you know that say you're supposed to recuse yourself if you have any financial interest if your family is involved in any remote way if you're some very close friend has some financially or something like that there's a whole set of canon of ethical conduct but\nBecause the Supreme Court is the last place to go and if you recuse yourself there are only eight and they could be tied um the justice has tried very hard not to have those conflicts\nYou can't take back a conflict like this and and I doubt that he's going to bow out out of a lot of if any cases because of what he said\nWell Tom Goldstein President Trump has had a number of rallies where people chant lock her up about Hillary Clinton and Brett Kavanaugh I got up there or before the Senate Judiciary committee and said that this was revenge on behalf of the Clintons\nCould he be a an impartial judge in a case that involved the Clintons were a left wing group he pointed out left wing group says well well the Clintons might\nBe a very special case a given also his involvement with Ken Starr investigation in terms of things involving liberals and conservatives then yes there's I think zero percent chance that he's going to recuse himself it would be in in essence an admission that he can't be neutral in the front issues like abortion affirmative action same sex marriage and the like\nI Can't see him doing that I think that\nWhat he is likely to do is probably try and find some opportunities ah like he has recently with the editorial that he wrote to try and asked for some sympathy from the public and understanding exactly the kinds of pressure that he was under and when he was feeling in terms of how his family was under the spotlight with these attacks and\nTry and kind of walk back the sense that he has some active partisan and get back into the mode where in his original testimony when he first came before the the committee and really gave us this air of being a truly neutral arbiter of questions that come in front of him\nI Want to go through some key issues here that people are thinking about as they contemplate what Kevin I Will mean for the Supreme Court abortion first of all you know what do you think this is going to mean for the issue of abortion\nWell I think it's pretty clear that at at least\nThere are five justices on the court who now will begin to whittle away at abortion rights they may not overtly reverse roe versus Wade\nBut we could end up in a situation in which in those states where abortion is that the abortion rights are are popular they remain and in those states where they are highly unpopular they know there is no longer a clinic there because they can't function under the rules that are laid down by the state law what about\nSame sex marriage a Justice Anthony Kennedy a who is retiring who did retire or authored that decision Tom Goldstein about same sex marriages that issue going to come up\nAgainst well I don't think in terms of whether there is a right to same sex marriages would be very surprising to see the court\nKind of do a one eighty on that there are areas of the law where there's just playing the joints\nWhere you don't have to overrule something so to take abortion the standard is whether it's an undue burden on the woman's ... exercise of the right who knows what that means you can feel into that whatever it is you want almost and that's why I'm more conservative court can allow more state regulations but there is a right to same sex marriage it's a binary light switch on light switch off thing I Can't see them doing it where\nThere isn't necessarily a right to\nIs all kinds of things that go with it like a king you require the floor is too is against same sex marriage to design a floral arrangements for your wedding or as we saw\nA ... a cake wedding cake or a photographer to take photographs or go to the photography studio and have them develop\nWedding I mean most states have laws that require equal treatment of everybody you can't just pick and choose who your customers are as long as they behave themselves\nBut their ... you know so far that remains the law of the land as it is but unless Congress were to pass a federal statute requiring equal treatment of\nUm same sex couples for example it's not necessarily true that that would ... that would be true everywhere\nRight one thing that you're likely to see is a Supreme Court that's more sympathetic to religious objections\nTo doing things for example involving abortion or same sex marriage in light the county clerk who doesn't want to provide the marriage certificate that sort of thing the core right maybe there but the things that actually also help same sex couples really feel like they're equal maybe more in question what\nAbout the issue of presidential power President Trump is currently under investigation the Robert Mueller investigation is going on it will will cabinet being on the court make any difference there well we\nWe know that he has said things that are at least ... the least questioned the correctness of than famous Nixon tapes decision which would which required the ... President Nixon to turn over tape recordings that incriminate it him in the end that were written into an ongoing criminal investigation\nUh it is true he's also said that it's one of if he cited it in a list of one of the great cases showing the independence of the judiciary but he also said things that maybe it said had said maybe it was wrongly decided\nThat we really don't know where he is on that what we do know is that he's a very very strong advocate of executive power in a wide array of areas\nAnd even proposed at one point that Congress should pass a law that would exempt that President from criminal investigation or civil suits while he's president\nNo on this question he only has one vote obviously but I Do think you'll probably get a lot of respect for this he spent a lot of time the executive branch you spend it in the White House and he was part of the Ken Starr investigation and so his view of how disruptive this can be to the presidency to have you know criminal proceedings in Grand juries like may get a lot of attention from the other justices\nWhere is Kevin are going to fit a on the court in terms of the other conservatives you already have Justice Alito Justice Thomas now justice Gorsuch pretty reliable conservatives in ... as he become the swing vote on the court Robert in it\nIn a technical sense there probably are some cases like the case involving Obamacare and we she cast the deciding vote but mostly\nObama and the other conservatives and in the court or at least pretty much in lock step on the outcome\nI mean he dissented in gay marriage he dissented and gerrymandering he just send it in a whole bunch of other you know ... ... in a whole bunch of other cases as long as Anthony Kennedy was on the court\nHe could move the balance board a little bit when he decided that this was a subject I'm which he agreed with the liberals to some extent or another\nThere's nobody like that in the center of the court and now there are four\nPretty liberal justices I Would call them to most liberals they would seem to be moderate liberals but they are on the liberal side and then five quite hardcore\nConservatives with chief justice Roberts I think really worried about the court institutionally not going too far too fast but uh that's probably what's holding him back I think\nYeah and I think though that ... that phrase too fast is probably where it's going to be you're going to see the chiefs influenced the most not that he's going to switch sides who's going to turn into a liberal all of a sudden\nBut rather that he is going to want to keep the pay slow so that the court isn't being seen as extremely aggressive and partisan particularly over the course of the next say twelve months or so\nOr he may not want to see cases overturned rat quite rapidly but he wouldn't mind seeing the law evolving a conservative\nDirect there are three cases in front of the court right now asking the court to reverse very longstanding precedence and there's a whole sort of a architecture of conservative legal fought that wants to the court to do that with the whole wide array of areas\nThis is a special report from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh vote I'm Jeremy ... and the vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court comes on the year anniversary of the me too movement it also comes a month before the midterm elections which would determine whether Democrats or Republicans control the house and the Senate\nAnd how much President Trump will be able to get done for the remainder of his presidency\nNPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell start with you what does this mean for the key races coming up\nWell the one thing that we are going to be watching very closely at what it means for Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota who voted no\nUh she was under a lot of pressure to support cabinet because she is running for re election in a state that President Trump won with ... significant margin in twenty sixteen\nPolls have shown her slipping recently but she put out a statement saying that she was making her decision based those on the fact that she thought that his performance at that hearing was partisan and because she's worried about the message it would send to women and young girls about the treatment of the way\nAccusations of sexual assault she is in a precarious situation here running against a very conservative House Republican who has strong name id in that state\nAnd she as far as I can understand it from talking to people that know her well made that decision here but that that decision may be a really big and you know it may take a hit for her in the polls or the person I'm watching his Joe mansion in West Virginia who is the only Democrat who voted yes\nAnd he said that he you know Manhattan is looking out for what's right for West Virginia again a state that President Trump won fairly significantly in twenty sixteen\nDominican much in our NPR lead politics editor is this going to impact the races of people who don't have to vote on this I'm thinking of people like\nThat to work or who's running in Texas against Ted Cruz\nWell he's got his own an uphill battle and uh that's the fact that a Texas is Texas so [laughter] that's a different situation but I think ... is right to zero in on some of these red state Republican a red state Democrats who are running in places\nThat President Trump won you know Texas is among those kinds of places but first and foremost you gotta look\nA like a tells you mentioned that Heidi Heitkamp you know someone like John just said you know he's seen in Montana in Montana seems finding his race but Joe Donnelly who I really wonder if he would have rather\nKind of said nothing or before saying no immediately after uh that Thursday hearing uh I don't think Democrats quite realized how this was going to fire up Republican white men in particular this\nUh you know our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll really showed a big shift among Republicans and it was driven by by men within the Republican Party\nOr who shifted very quickly\nAnd you know you have something like eighty percent of the Republican Party right now saying that the elections are a very important and that significant because that's basically a tie statistical tie with Democrats\nAnd Democrats had a ten point advantage on that over the summer now does that remain this high or does that recede given the fact that cabinet looks like he will be confirmed\nAnd the fact is Democrats democratic women democratic men they have been fired up this entire time and are expected to stay at that level\nOkay well let's listen we've been talking to a a couple of strategist on each side here this is John ... bend a Republican strategist and here's what he thinks that this means\nWhat we found that in the last we is there certainly seems to be some Republicans come out [noise] um the probably had is that particularly murder Republicans are not huge fans of this president he makes up for that oftentimes by getting conservative Democrats [noise]\nBut at least from a lot of the surveys I see it in the last week a lot of them though number one that the Democrats overplay their hand that it wasn't even that they didn't believe professor Ford\nThey just were unhappy with a lot of the tactics that they saw the Democrats taking and felt that uh they were they were just merely playing politics\nAnd I'm so it was interesting too it's it's ... the Republican Party a bit and um\nI I think the question now is can they keep that sort of small momentum going all the way until election day\nOkay so that's a Republican strategist distance democratic strategist Anna Greenberg\nI think it's very helpful for Democrats I think it's going to galvanize women who are already feeling aggrieved\nBut I also think that the way from kind of doubled down and attacked Dr Ford rallies and I think Kevin ... slowly I think all hands are fairly easily been confirmed in the end um well it's ... Democrats even more\nTells me I was down on Capitol Hill earlier today I'm Talking with protesters outside the Supreme Court and outside the capital\nAnd some of them said to me I think he's going to be confirmed\nBut that's just going to make me more excited to go out and vote for Democrats this November ... what do you think when you hear those two strategist who who is going to be more energized well\nI think that Dominican as of right it's really hard to get people Democrats more energized than they already are I Do think that there is a question that has been raised not just by Democrats but by some Republicans about how much this support for the president that we're seeing right now is conditional on this issue we seen that happen over and over and over again\nWhere a Republican voters and Republican elected officials will join Trump's side when he's doing something that they like and then quickly abandoned him when he does things like handle rally at the end says things that are politically incorrect or offensive\nAnd that's been the story of the relationship between traditional Republicans and this president since he was elected and in fact since he became the nominee so I it will be interesting challenge to see if that changes in the situation as well\nYou know what do you think\nSee I realized that I'm I'm a I'm really not helping you at all here but [laughter]\nBut I I don't actually know I'm inclined to think that this was a bump for Republican enthusiasm and it will recede at least partially because probably because some of the wives of these guys will tie them up and not let them go out and ... [laughter]\nMet a girl is the thing is when you're talking to Jon Benet bender who's a Republican and Anna Greenberg democratic pollster both very good at what they do they're both looking at how this plays with their bases and like I was saying both bases are fired up over this right the real issue I think for what's going to determine this election\nIs how those swing voters those middle of the road suburban women or do you know go out and vote in this election do they go out and vote in some of these kind of moderate to right leaning districts in these house districts now look remember Democrats need twenty three seats Internet twenty three seats\nTo take back the house I think that what we've seen over the past week or two\nWith how the Senate numbers have moved there is a very real possibility\nThe Democrats wind up losing out in the Senate where they lose a couple of seats and wind up taking back the house that's a very real possibility has been a real possibility from the beginning and it's starting to look more like the most likely scenario because\nThe ... the Republican leaning a in suburban women have really moved very sharply and been sharply opposed to President Trump\nA all along and there was a huge list of a potential targets in those are in those swing slash suburban district\nAnd the numbers in the Senate let's read reprised those or reprint the um there are a twenty six to ... twenty six Democrats up\nFor democratic Democrat and only nine and then only nine Republican seats and and and that ten of those are and overwhelmingly red states so out of the Democratic seats the of the seats the Democrats have to hold onto our and overwhelmingly red states it's a it's\nIt requires a huge uphill climb well it's worse than that it's actually the worst landscape ever for a Senate map that any party has ever faced since the direct election of senators\nI guess Lindsey Graham would say it's it's hell and beyond health [laughter] so so ... for Democrats um we're in the midst of course of the me too movement and even during this entire\nNomination process for Brett Kavanaugh to executives at CBS News became the latest men to be ousted it because of allegations of of a sexual misconduct let's say\nPresident Trump has been accused himself Brett Kavanaugh as we know has been accused they it it appears both have ... so far survived those allegations while so many other uh\nHave fallen Kelsey a one in three women\nHave been victims themselves of sexual assault one in six men I think as they watched everything that went on how does that play I mean they they have personal experience with the kinds of things that Christine Blasey Ford was talking about\nYeah and I think that one of the things that we're seeing is that there and women are finding more space to have this conversation and it's important to remember that the conversation about Ford and cabinet is one element of a much much broader ... like a much broader debate in this country about who do you believe", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "06"}
