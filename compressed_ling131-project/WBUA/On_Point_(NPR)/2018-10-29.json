martyrs we have a link to that or don't point radio dot org rabbi rent and burg welcome to the program I magna so you're first\nThoughts today on um how ... how we should be looking at and thinking about what happened on Saturday a tree of life\nHey we need to be seeing it in context um when Trump is saying this is so hard to believe and I think this is absolutely\nDevastating a but it's absolutely conceivable given the context of anti Semitism historically and on the rise in America given the context of our lack of protections for gun violence given the context of ongoing tree\nThing hate crimes in America and the rise of white supremacy I'm this absolutely is\nAh if it said that a lot of contacts and and I argue in the piece that it also sits in the context unfortunately of our history of of murders in Judaism\nMm Mm I should note here that we've got a couple of comments that are coming online Nancy banks tells us on Facebook that while I Do not in any way wish to diminish the horror of the killings in Pittsburgh to black men were also murdered last week\nOr possibly a hate crime a lot of heat for one week and in fact a ... point that shooter was ... who had who could gunned down those two black men in Kentucky said that whites don't kill allegedly said whites don't kill whites and we also have\nYou know we're not even a couple of weeks off the pipe bombs or that were sent to various political leaders around the country as well so that's why I'm trying to ... talk specifically about rising anti Semitism but also in the broader context of\nA as I keep calling this ecosystem of hate here but but a rabbi written bird tell me a little bit more about um the you know how is that\nWe should look to or what exactly you see in American plead political leadership right now that maybe the maybe stoking all of this\nAt a white supremacist administration and Trump has been in self\nAttacking trucks are us for a long long time he's been using even after the tree of life shooting he's been making use of the global asked what she does very very odd and both of these are new contemporary anti Semitic dog whistles\nI had the idea that there is a Jew who is powerful and on front and secretly ... you know finding infiltration is\nA is a very very ancient idea um but it's it manifesting now in a in a myriad of ways\n... well I mean Howard Simon let's talk a little bit more about the specific things that um that the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA was really ranting and raving about online I mean ah you know he talked a lot about uh his hatred of\nUm of the ... the Jewish refugee relief organization I'm ... that that originally began and I'm more than a century ago as an organization to a Jewish refugees around the country but now he's a leading organization in the United states helping refugees from all walks of life\nA and that you know he believed that they were encouraging and infestation a ... in the United states and that's one of the reasons why he wanted to\nWell he he he murdered people in order to end the assistance to refugees and talk and that there was a conspiracy behind that as well so Howard just talk to me more about about how those threats come together\nWell ah this isn't the story just about the Jews are just about the tree of life a synagogue a where I basically\nGrew up [noise] if you know history you know that in a way the Jews are the canaries in the coal mine of social and political ah disarray and and and and break down\nAnd and I think you need to look at it in that context ah the first thing I thought of yesterday morning was the mother Emanuel church in Charleston\nWere quite similar thing happened uh attacking worshipers on this case in a church I'm fed by a lot of the same paranoia\nAnd and anger and and and\nConspiracy thinking a then that's how that's how I I look at it uh over the course of history ah conspiracies a conspiracy theories about the Jews have been a it convenient and deadly\nA answer easy answer for uh people who are disengaged and in an angry at the system ah it's been it's been true for hundreds if not thousands of years\nAnd here in America is part of a medley of hate\nOr that we're seeing across the spectrum\nOr we're seeing we're seeing racially motivated a paranoia we're seeing\nA religiously motivated paranoia where we're seeing we're seeing politically motivated paranoia and and the language has gotten a harsh on all sides I mean conservatives will tell you and I think they're right some of the some of the language that the the Democrats have used to\nHave to have lean toward the idea that everything is a fight or that everybody is or who is who is a political opponent is somehow not quite human\nWhat the point we've reached here or there are a lot of reasons for it there are lots and lots of reasons for it uh is is that anybody we disagree with politically\nOr is it subhuman is not quite human is is an other with a capital of that is dangerous and in comprehensible and out to destroy society uh it it seems like the connective tissue of our of our culture has has has has gone missing\nAnd I think the founders when they when they set up our system wanted contention but they they relied on the idea that there would be character isn't the people\nThat there were ... communities communities where people would know each other and us understand each other's humanity even if they disagreed with them politically and and that's kind of disappeared and that that kind of hollowing out of our civic culture is what's allowed this to happen it's what's allowed\nUm the shooting in Charleston to happen it's it's what's allowed people to send pipe bombs to democratic leaders it's is what led a Mr ... hours to uh to say I'm going in and and head into a a a building that I Know all too well where my parents both\nTaught Sunday school where I was bar mitzvahed um and and the scenes of mayhem there are just a beyond imagining but that it's all part of this larger context of the hollowing out of our civic life\nCan I can yeah go ahead [noise] I think both sides rhetoric is not helpful in this\nUh at this gates the context in which a group of people have power\nAnd are stoking hate\nAnd our fostering humanizing language and are putting separating families\nPutting children in cages creating Muslim bans removing a

is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking about the massacre at Pittsburgh's tree of life\nSynagogue about America's rising broader ecosystem of hate and what to do about it and joined today by David Friedman Howard Simon and rabbi Daniel written bird and rubber ... just before the break we had that color a shalom who was taking issue with some things that you had said and I wanted to give you a chance to respond\nSo the idea that Trump could not possibly be an anti Semitic because he has a Jewish daughter in law it's going to be a Jewish daughter not Jewish son in law\nIs ridiculous it's like saying that he couldn't possibly be in a Sachin is because he's had three wives and somebody observes on Twitter right the idea of it that he somehow you know dissolved of his white supremacist stoking of his blaming the the caravan on Soros\nOf his constant attacks on source calling you know calling lock him up even a few days ago at a rally um that he uses the word globalized again and again and again but somehow he's auto magically freed from\nFrom connection because of his daughters decisions not resonate with me the idea that George Soros is\nSomehow this um you know is involved in the confiscation of Jewish property is actually a right wing conspiracy theory that has been debunked and SARS himself addressed it in an interview it's not ... he's a fourteen year old in Hungary\nUh when the Nazis were there um\nAnd yeah I I I I really do not understand the Jewish Trump mindset I Will say that very clearly the Torah commands us\nAgain and again and again to protect the stranger who is among off the vulnerable maybe I commend the thirty six times more than any other myths but in the Torah to protect the stranger because we were ...\nNon citizens and the the immigrants among us and I I take that obligation very seriously and I know that those five to ... to paint us as I'm having some sort of secret power operating behind the scenes um are are just part of a larger ...\nRight yeah it is that you Howard yeah so how can I just I definitely will return the ... but I also just want to sort of put together some other pieces of this this broader puzzle here because\nI I Do wonder why we can't or are not just you know I I take the point that there are lots of bad actors on multiple sides of things but let us just confront head on\nThis ecosystem that as being\nUm if not virgins at least a ... I don't I don't know legitimize or not it's tamped down by a Republican leadership in America right now I can speak to that because I've been covering them for years and I've got several examples of even just in the past week but please go ahead go ahead\nNo no our or to to to take it ... through the ... for a second and the notion that Donald Trump is the best friend the Jews over her is orderly\nOr and here's the reason uh for the Jews to live in peace and security in the United states\nOr we need the the ideals in the ... the ideals that the founders put forth and what's best in us to be not only president but but evident\nAnd and and the Jews survive\nAnd thrive in places where there is a free exchange of ideas where everyone is regarded as part of the community and no one is written out of the story on the theory that they are not human\nAnd and what Donald Trump has done is that he is taken every shred of discord\nCynicism hatred and fear that has always been residents in American Life going back to the very beginning we were talking about slavery we're talking about the Native Americans is ...\nBloody threads in his hands and rhetorically is used them to get elected and is using them to govern I'd I don't you like the phrase white supremacist just because it sounds like too much of rhetoric and and propaganda but\nTruth is that he rose to power on fear\nHe rose to power on fear of the other or whether it was a in Central Park or on the caravan or anywhere else in American Life he has an on unbelievable gift for gathering those threads together and rhetorically using them to gain power\nAnd that is the scenario that is the worst possible scenario for the Jews and indeed for everybody else in this country and that that's the concern right and there's no doubt that use weaponized all these things politically and that's the moment that were in\nMiami so she has no matter how he chooses to use it by virtue of being president the United states he has the most powerful or and perhaps most influential voice here but if you also look\nMore broadly I mean just a couple of examples from the past several months earlier this week before the shooting at tree of life house majority leader Kevin McCarthy put up a tweet warning\nOr that three wealthy Jewish Democrats including George Soros Michael Bloomberg were quote buying the mid term election he deleted that tweet before the shooting on Saturday but it was up there for a while I people have perhaps heard of the fact that ... Representative Steve king of Iowa in August after\nVisiting Auschwitz gave an interview to a right wing Austrian party that has historical ties to Nazis you know talking about uh that he was in support of their their far right groups and that emphasizing hardline anti immigration stances\nUm and that the western civilizations on the decline and that he said if the is this party where in America pushing the platform they push they would be Republican\nAnd we also have for example Senator Chuck Grassley looking to uh George Soros and saying he he can believe that source may have funded\nThe quote unquote mobs that protested against judge Kavanaugh\nSilly all of these I should say justice Kavanaugh now but all of these things\nTogether to me seems to be I don't know it it it just you know political cynicism and using these conspiracy theories some of it is true belief but that this is this ecosystem that I'm Talking about here that has grown up and Donald Trump may be an outcome of that ecosystem and so if if it that is the case\nUh Howard let me just turn back to you and what do we do about it I mean we even have Lou Dobbs on the day of this shooting on Saturday ... running an an ... a conversation with judicial watch where the guest says that there's a store is occupied State Department\nYou know I heard that comment about the SARS occupied State Department\nI think the only answer is leadership\nIs voting as David Was saying uh with uh people have to get out in the in in an express their their views and their their concerns as we are are designed to do in America which is through the ballot box next week and then in the twenty twenty election\nSo voters have to an individual says to the individual by individual voting it also has to be leaders we ever paradoxical system here in the sense that it's of the people by the people for the people\nAre as from the bottom up but we in order for it to work properly we need leaders of conscience and character and and and and I would say the answer is we will hear it when we hear it\nFrom from somebody or from people who come forward as leaders to to explain that America is a community\nAnd uh we're individuals and we'd prize individual ism in America ... per also community and we can't operate without that so it's going to take leaders to come forward to to convince Americans as a whole that there's an answer to using\nFear and hatred is a way to gain power a ... there's gotta be that's that's the only way forward\nRight well rather rent Bergen David should have been I Know you want to

Michigan get you're on the air\nThey are having me on back now I think you are a panel for taking time to meet today and I I wanted to bring up something here quickly because I Do live in a state of Michigan which obviously would drag for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and\nYou know our neighbor one of the counties that helped Donald Trump won the election and I find too interesting thing or one interesting thing here in this day and then I have a question for you as well to um one thing I find interesting here in the state of Michigan is that there seems to be\nThis consensus of white is Donald Trump's economic policy going to be moving forward obviously it was a heavy manufacturing state\nThis is a state that kinda gone through with a lot of the the deregulation that Donald Trump had gone through with the previous governor Rick Snyder but again he wasn't the kind of fiery personality that Donald Trump was and he was more so\nJust to a progressive guy who was an office there but I Want to ask you this question and in terms of\nYou know what does potentially what looked like in the state of Michigan to be a blue wave coming in or what the impact and what that leads on the state and local level here meaning for Donald Trump and the Republican Party in Michigan and twenty twenty you know this was one of the state the guy that went over a there's a proposal ballot ear that will potentially\nUm you know changed the district the voting districts which could blend in favor the Democrats I guess in this in in the house especially in the state of Michigan and so I find it to be a very perplexing yeah eight which you know not many people seem to talk about when it comes to a battleground\nState Garrett ... thank you so much for your call Janet Hook what do you think I mean if if indeed there is sort of a a good democratic showing and twenty Eighteen Michigan could that have an impact on twenty twenty\nOh for sure and actually there if there's one state of consequences that that seems poised to have a blue wave it's probably Michigan it's only because\nUh the governor's race there is so clearly going in the Democrats' favor Gretchen which were ... seems to have a pretty sizable\nUm stance leading the polls and they're sort of miscellaneous house races down ballot the um incumbent senator there I'm Debbie Stabenow ... is pretty safe for reelection\nUm and in Michigan as in the other Midwestern states that gave Trump is Marge and it was by such a narrow margin ahead it doesn't take much to tip it against I'm up against President Trump than twenty twenty\nYeah and then as Garrett was asking uh it seems that question that he's hearing a lot in Michigan are is what are we going to be the next steps for the president's economic policy and the next two years and how that might that have an impact on a ... on on Michigan on on Michigan in Michigan\nWorkers well it depends a lot on what happens with the parents that he proposed and imposed because it's just it's the economic impact of that is sort of uncertain and he alternates between\nA talking about imposing more and more tariffs on the one hand or using them as a bargaining chip it probably um help stabilize the the industries in Michigan that they've come to a new NAFTA style agreement\nBut um if there's one thing about Donald Trump and his policy that's safe to say it's I kinda don't know what's next\nOr or I'm not sure I'm not sure how many policies the president hold near and dear to his heart I mean I think\nIf it's if it's not working and you know there's two years before the next presidential election of if something's not working you can just turn to do one eighty into All right we're going to we're going to do something else and when it comes to Michigan or just the presidential race the twenty twenty race in general I think a lot depends on who you who is the Democratic nominee and what is it the contrast\nBetween approaches and styles and in their view on the ...\nFeel like the the country's headed in the right direction when we get that far\nRight you know and and I definitely understand how a twenty Eighteen and the midterms are connected to twenty twenty but my goodness we need to get through next week first of All right\nSo let's say let's go to Georgia because there's a bunch of really interesting races a happening down there and joining us now from Atlanta is Steven salaries political reporter for Georgia Public broadcasting we have\nA link to Stevens reporting on point radio dot org Steven welcome to the program I met thanks for having me it's great to have you okay so I think the the big headline grabbing race in Georgia right now is that gubernatorial race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the current secretary of state\nFor Georgia what what's the latest polling show how close is this race\nWell it's a very close race there's also a libertarian candidate which matters because if either candidate doesn't get fifty percent plus one vote we could be going to a December fourth run up and polls really have the two neck and neck and have for quite a while now\nAnd so really uh every vote counts and every person counts and by this point there aren't many voters that are undecided it's just whether they're going to decide to vote early or vote on election day okay\nSo this is then one of the reasons why I'm the news over the past several weeks around I'm voting rolls and purging voters from the rules has become a such a big deal in\nA ... in Georgia because of course as I just mentioned Brian ... is the current secretary of state for for Georgia so I just want to hear a couple of pieces of sound from\nLast Tuesday's gubernatorial debate in Atlanta uh first of all we are going to hear from democratic candidates Stacey Abrams really a refuting a Brian ... statement that he has not suppressed voters as secretary of state even though there have been reports that maybe some one hundred thousand Georgians have been purged from the rolls\nThis is a man who had someone who arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot he raided the offices and organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of oppression feed the narrative because that or suppression in only about blocking a vote it's also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worried that their votes don't count\nWell at that gubernatorial debate Republican candidates secretary of state Brian Kemp said that he has a quote absolutely not suppressed minority voters\nVoters should look at the numbers and know that this is all a distraction to take away from is Abrams extreme agenda that she has for a government takeover of healthcare wanting to give the scholarship to those that are here illegally and many many other radicalization\nHis current secretary of state for Georgia Brian Kemp Steven Fowler take give us take a minute here to walk us through this controversy in Georgia what exactly has happened with voter rolls in Georgia and how important of an issue has become and the last week of uh of campaigning before the election\nWill so the two candidates we have here really are the diametrically opposed in the voting rights and voting access\nSecretary of state camp has done a lot to clean up the role some people say purge the roles of removing people voting there's also a record number of Georgians registered as of yesterday it was six point nine million people\nAnd the early voting numbers are higher than they've ever been before the twenty fourteen midterms were at one point one million people that have cast a ballot early as opposed to about four hundred thousand and twenty fourteen\nBut on the other hand Stacey Abrams has dedicated a lot of her political career to getting more people to vote getting minorities to vote getting younger people to vote who haven't done and so the two have clashed over the years and it's complicated in this gubernatorial race\nLearn more at carbonate dot com ...\n\n...\n... is your old car like a member of the family you know you'll miss it when it's on your vehicle can live on listening to WVU are on your new cars

editor and publisher of inside elections that provides nonpartisan campaign analysis Janet Hook is also with us She's national political reporter\nFor the wall Street Journal and let's go straight to our callers there's a lot of them so Leo calling from Akron, Ohio Leo you're on the air\nMagna thanks for taking my call um we're healthcare voters and I'm among other big top big issues I'm\nUp to this election and it it's just\nSo I don't really ridiculous to hear these claims that these GOP a lawmakers or protecting people with preexisting conditions when their votes have said just the opposite and I know that they're picking on people not paying attention to everything in the weeds leading up to the election\nBut I mean you have the you have to be off the grid to not know that\nPeople with preexisting condition [noise]\nLeo thank you for your call Janet Hook 'em your your thoughts on what you said\nWell if a NATO was right in talking about how central the health care issue is for the Democrats and if every wondered whether or not it was an important and winning issue there is nothing quite like the Republican response I think they're really nervous about the power of that issue um\nIn past for the past I don't know six elections the repeal of Obamacare has been the central I'm campaign promise for Republicans they didn't come through with that and now the healthcare system is kind of in a mess again and\nTo the extent that there is one issue that has really broad residence for people it's the protections for people with preexisting condition that pre pre existing conditions that Obamacare provided for the Democrats realize that and now the Republicans seem to be realizing it too\nWell this is playing out in so many different races across the country let's go to Nevada here where it in a debate between the candidates for Senate in Nevada\nUh we had democratic representative Jacky Rosen who's running against incumbent Republican senator Dean Heller there and you're going to hear first a this is representative Rosen\nA asking senator Heller to tell the Nevada family and their son whose name was dean why Heller who broke his promise to protect people like dean who have pre existing conditions you\nPromise and protect their health care and that way you would protect our protections for pre existing condition\nAnd then you went back to Washington\nAnd you for your promise\nSo I Want to tell you what can the camera\nTo ask you have to look him in\nReally tell them the truth\nAbout why you broke his promise and why you support slashing protections for pre existing conditions why you want to hurt their son\nThat's representative Jacky Rosen who's running against and Nevada incumbent senator Republican Dean Heller and here's how ... responded to Rosen's assertions at that debate\nYou can fit in turns you can say to under which are you concerned at a thousand times it's just not true\nI wrote a roast the replacement bill for the Republican Party I Know exactly what's real and what's that bill includes preexisting conditions how has your whole took them in the eye and tell them the trend is that it was sort of on\nThe debate a between Republican incumbent Dean Heller and democratic representative Jacky Rosen in Nevada and joining us now from Las Vegas is Megan ... she's political reporter for the Nevada independent and we have links to her reporting don't play radio dot org\nMegan welcome to the program Hi thanks for having me so how much is healthcare factoring into this race between senator Heller and representative Rosen well\nAs you just heard during that back but but it's been a huge focal point of the race\nUm you know like like you all are talking about earlier this is something that Jackie rose and that the Democratic a first term congresswoman has been\nReally making an issue of in the race and and what it really comes down to is the fact that there was this sort of now in the mid press conference that happened last summer where a Dean Heller stood alongside our Republican governor Brian Sandoval and and they both expressed and if it can concerns about\nThe first repeal repeal and replace proposal that Senate Republicans have brought forward but then he ended up actually voting in favor of of you know advancing repeal and replace the debate and voted in favor of one of the\nThe repeal bill and so this has been a huge focal point of the campaign she has run numerous ads against him accusing him of flip flopping on the Affordable CARE Act she had that as sort of memorable ad\nAttacking Heller as senator spineless featuring one of those sort of inflatable two men you might see outside an auto repair shop and accusing him of sort of blowing in the wind when it comes to the Affordable CARE Act with it but it's been a huge issue in the race\nAnd how effective has it been on the campaign trail so far I mean what are the one of the polls in this late stage telling you\nThe this race is still really close and you know if you listen to folk talk about it you know maybe maybe at you know Jacky Rosen should've been a little bit had given that Dean Heller was considered going into this cycle you know the most\nVulnerable Republican incumbent senator facing reelection um you know facing reelection and a state that Hillary Clinton won a\nIn twenty sixteen and so you know he was sort of a you know didn't have the edge going into the race but there are still neck and neck um you know if you look at the polls he's been a little bit ahead and some of the old on the most of them within the margin of error so\nYou know everyone is expecting that to be you know an extremely close race and come down to the wires I think you know the big question and and we're going to be seeing as how that message you know rather than eight with ... you know nonpartisan than are independent voters here um you know whether they do how the significant concerns about health care and and from what we've seen healthcare\nVoters here in Nevada and like all\nWell a nascent Gonzales a little earlier in the air you were talking about how there are certain there's a there's a possible outcome where Republicans gained seats in the Senate but this is one of those places where they are looking somewhat vulnerable so what are you seeing in Nevada\nWell I think I'm One of the reasons why the Republicans have a chance to gain seats is I'm not convinced the Dean Heller joined illusion for much for much of a cycle and I really you know we had it as a toss we've I think we've and it's a toss up for the whole\nThe whole reason we're probably keep it there but in in the back of my my like you know I think he's still going to I think he's going to lose and so that matters to mouth but if he's if he hangs on or maybe Republicans hang on to Jeff wakes open seat in Arizona\nThen you know that increases their ability to actually gain seats but\nNobody has been interesting in a plug all plugged in Nevada independent from Megan in in her boss John and in the show and the whole team because they know Nevada better than anyone what's what struck me is how Nevada has been more of a slog for Democrats than what I expected\nYou just like well it's a Hillary Clinton state but Republicans have a chance to hold the governorship Dean Heller as a chance to be reelected there's two\nCompetitive congressional districts that Democrats are defending a jak you raisins third district\nAnd the fourth district which is open as well and I think Democrats have had to spend more time and energy to move and money and they would have wanted to hold those seats so it's kind of I think we are this is mid term Nevada enough presidential in mid to Nevada tends to be more Republican\nMaybe what do you think about that\nI think that's that's exactly right and that's one of the interesting thing ... sort of keeping an eye on so far as you know turn out it is much better for Democrats with early voting which start at a little over a week ago hearing about it than better than it was and when he fourteen and which we saw a complete red weigh ins in Nevada and Republicans swept at\nYou know controlled all of the state's constitutional officers of the legislature on the competitive house seat I truly was you know a red wave on which which stands in such a stark contrast to what happens in twenty sixteen um but but that point is exactly right you know Democrats traditionally don't perform as well during\nThe term elections on what's really going to come down to you know\nAll that effort they are putting in with their ground game to try and get folks to turn out with the help of the powerful coronary union here um which is part of what's known as the Reid machine are started by you know obviously former science overcrowded leader Harry Reid\nUm you know under his his tenure\nAt the big question is Ken Ken Democrat you know make this look a little bit more like a presidential year as opposed to the ... midterm year in which they traditionally don't they're\nSuch it's such an interesting thought that the midterm Nevada or mid term any state might be different than president the the ... state in the presidential year but one question for you\nMaking I mean here we are just a week to go before the midterms and I heard you say that you know I'm obviously there's a lot of question around whether what direction certain voters might go independent voters in Nevada et cetera but\nHow much uh it's the uncertainty right now is it is it that like are there are people still out there making up their minds based on certain issues or maybe last minute campaign stops or is it simply a get out the vote question now because I'm just like who out there still doesn't know how they're going to vote in Nevada\nMajor funding from point it's provided by Geico offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks or SUVs and providing twenty four

in uh Kentucky said that whites don't kill allegedly said whites don't kill whites and we also have\nYou know we're not even a couple of weeks off the pipe bombs or that were sent to various political leaders around the country as well so that's why I'm trying to want to talk specifically about rising and anti Semitism but also in the broader context of\nA as I keep calling you this ecosystem of hate here but but a rabbi written bird tell me a little bit more about um the you know\nHow is that we should look to or what exactly you see in American political leadership right now that maybe that maybe stoking all of this\nI there is a tremendous amounts didn't we have a a white supremacist ah administrative action and Trump has been in self attacking George Soros\nFor a long long time he's been using even after the tree of life shooting he's been making use of the word global asked what she does very very often both of these are\nNew contemporary anti Semitic dog whistles a the idea that there is a Jew who is powerful and an front and secretly ... you know funding infiltration\nUh is is a very very very ancient idea um but it's it manifesting now in a in a myriad of ways\nMm [noise] well I mean Howard firemen ah let's talk a little bit more about the specific things that um that the shooter in Pittsburgh a was really ... ranting and raving about\nOnline I mean ah you know he talked a lot about uh his hatred of um of the ... the Jewish refugee relief organization um highest right that that originally began as I'm more than a century ago as an organization to a Jewish refugees around the country but now he's a leading\nOrganization in the United states helping refugees from all walks of life\nA and that you know he believed that they were encouraging an infestation a ... in the United states and that's one of the reasons why he wanted to\nWell he he he murdered people in order to end the assistance to refugees talk and then there was a conspiracy behind that as well so Howard just talk to me more about about how those threats come together\nWell or the Susan storage just about the Jews are just above the tree of wars or synagogue or were are basically grew up [noise] if you know history you know that in a way the Jews are the canaries in the coal mine\nA disarray and and and and break down and and I think you need to look at it in that context of\nThe first thing I thought of yesterday morning was the mother Emanuel church in Charleston were quite similar thing happened uh attacking worshipers or this case in the church uh said by a lot of the same\nParanoia and an anger and and and\nConspiracy thinking a then that's how that's how I I look at it uh over the course of history ah conspiracies a conspiracy theories about the Jews have been a it convenient and deadly\nA answer easy answer for uh people who are disengaged and in an angry\nAt the system ah it's been it's been true for hundreds if not thousands of years and here in America is part of a medley of hate\nOr that we're seeing across the spectrum\nOr we're seeing we're seeing racially motivated a paranoia we're seeing religiously motivated paranoia where we're seeing we're seeing politically motivated paranoia\nAnd and the language has gotten harsh on all sides I mean conservatives will tell you and I think they're right some of the some of the language that the the Democrats have used to\nHave to lean toward the idea that everything is a fight or that everybody is who is who is a political opponent is somehow not quite human\n... the point we've reached here and there are a lot of reasons for it there are lots and lots of reasons for it uh is is that anybody we disagree with politically\nOr is it subhuman is not quite human is is in other with a capital oh that is dangerous in in comprehensible and out to destroy society uh it it seems like the connective tissue of our of our culture has his his his gone missing\nAnd I think the founders when they when they set up our system wanted contention that they relied on the idea that there would be character and the people\nThat they were to be communities communities where people would know each other and us understand each other's humanity even if they disagreed with them politically and and that's kind of disappeared and that that kind of hollowing out of our civic culture is what's allowed this to happen it's what's allowed\nA shooting in Charleston to happen it's it's what's allowed people to send pipe bombs to democratic leaders it's is what led a Mr powers to uh to say I'm going in\n... in his head into a a a building that I Know all too well where my parents both taught Sunday school where I was permits but\nI'm In the scenes of mayhem there are just a young imagining that it it's all part of this larger context of the hollowing out of our civic life\nCan I could yeah go ahead [noise]\nI think this both sides rhetoric is not helpful in this moment and I think at\nA at this gates the context in which a group of people have power\nAnd are stoking hate and our fostering humanizing language and I put separating families\nPutting children in cages treating Muslim bans removing a transgender ah folks access to to legal protection I'm a ... in ways that that are real and impactful and people's lives\nWBUR your supporters include the provider group and insurance brokerage and

affordability and awareness that's prevented street more it prevent history dot org to dark\nReality that I don't know a Jew in America\nHad the kind of a waking nightmare that something like that would be possible\nVigil are being held across the country for the victims of the mass shooting in Pittsburgh how much is a national climate of heat and division responsible\nWords matter and rhetoric and kind of this climate of bigoted rhetoric matters on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News tomorrow morning and\nFive Ninety point nine W. B. U. R. Boston's NPR News station\nChuck liberty we're talking about the massacre at Pittsburgh's tree of life\nSynagogue about America's rising broader ecosystem of hate and what to do about it and joined today by David Friedman Howard Simon and rabbi Daniel written bird and rubber ... just before the break we had that color a shalom who was taking issue with some things that you had said and I wanted to give you a chance to respond\nSo the idea that Trump could not possibly be an anti Semitic because he has a Jewish daughter in law is getting a Jewish daughter and son in law\nIs ridiculous it's like saying that he couldn't possibly be in a Sachin is because he's had three wives and some ... great ... the idea that that he somehow you know dissolved of his like the practice is stoking of his blaming the\nThe caravan on Soros\nOf his constant attacks on SARS calling you know calling lock him up even a few days ago at a rally\nThat somehow he's auto magically freed from from connection because of his daughter's decision to not resonate with me the idea that George Soros\nIs somehow this um you know it was involved in the confiscation of Jewish property is actually a right wing conspiracy theory that has been debunked and SARS himself addressed it in an interview it's not ... he's a fourteen year old in Hungary ah when the Nazis were there um\nAnd yeah I I I I really do not understand the Jewish Trump mindset I Will say that I'm very clearly the Torah commands us\nAgain and again and again to protect the stranger who is among off the vulnerable and their commended thirty six times more than any other myths that in the Tara to protect the stranger because we were\n... than the the immigrant among us and I I take that obligation very seriously and I know that those five to pay to paint us as I'm having some sort of secret power operating behind the scenes um are are just part of a larger like right\nOut of ... ... yeah it is that you Howard yeah so how can I just I I definitely under ... but I also just want to sort of put together some other pieces of this this broader puzzle here because\nI Do wonder why we can't or are not just you know I I I take the point that there are lots of bad actors on multiple sides of things but let us just confront head on this ecosystem that as being um if not\nBurdened at least a ... I don't I don't know legitimize or not it's tamped down by a Republican leadership in America right now\nCan I speak to that because I've been covering them\nFor years and I've got several examples of even just in the past week but please go ahead go ahead\nNo no I uh to to to take it through through the eyes of showroom if I can for a second and the notion that Donald Trump is the best friend the Jews overhead\nIs utterly wrong or and here's the reason uh for the Jews to live in peace and security in the United states\nOr we need the the ideals in the uh the ideals that the founders put forth in what's best in us to be not only president but but evidence\nAnd and and the Jews survive\nAnd thrive in places where there is a\nFree exchange of ideas where everyone is regarded as part of the community and no one is written out of the story on the theory that they're not human\nAnd and what Donald Trump has done is that he has taken every thread of discord cynicism hatred and fear that has always been residents in American Life going back to the very beginning we were talking about slavery we're talking about\nThe Native Americans et cetera he's he's gathered every one of those\nBloody threads in his hands and rhetorically is used them to get elected\nAnd is using them to govern I'd I don't you like the phrase white supremacist just because it sounds like\nToo much of rhetoric and and propaganda but the truth is that he rose to power on fear\nHe rose to power on fear of the other or whether it was a in Central Park or on the caravan or anywhere else in American Life he has an on unbelievable gift for gathering those threads together and rhetorically using them to gain power\nAnd that is the scenario that is the worst possible scenario for the Jews and indeed for everybody else in this country and that that's the concern right and there's no doubt that he was weaponized all these things politically and that's the moment that were in\nSo she has no matter how he chooses to use it by virtue of being president the United states he has the most powerful a and perhaps most influential voice here but if you also look\nMore broadly I mean just a couple of examples from the past several months earlier this week before the shooting at tree of life house majority leader Kevin McCarthy put up a tweet morning\nAh that three wealthy Jewish Democrats including George Soros Michael Bloomberg were quit buying the mid term election he deleted that tweet before the shooting on Saturday but it was up there for a while I people have perhaps heard of the fact that ... Representative Steve king of Iowa in August after\nVisiting Auschwitz gave an interview to a right wing Austrian party that has historical ties to Nazis you know talking about uh that he was in support of their their far right groups and that emphasizing hardline anti immigration stances\nUm and that the western civilizations on the decline and that he said if the\nCourse they would be Republican and we also have for example Senator Chuck Grassley looking to uh George Soros and saying he he can believe that ... may have funded\nThe quote unquote mobs that protested against judge Kavanaugh silly all of these I should say justice Kevin ... now but all of these things\nTogether to me seems to be I don't know is it just you know political cynicism using these conspiracy theories some of it is true belief\nBut that this is this ecosystem that I'm Talking about here that has grown up and Donald Trump may be an outcome of that ecosystem and so if if it that is the case\nUh Howard let me just turn back to you and what do we do about it I mean we even have Lou Dobbs on the day of this shooting on Saturday ... running an an ... a conversation with judicial watch where the guest says that there's a store is occupied State Department\nYou know I heard that comment about this or is occupied State Department\nI think the only answer is leadership\nIs voting as David Was saying a lot of people have to get out in the in in an express their their views and their their concerns as we are are designed to do in America which is through the ballot box next week and then in the twenty twenty election\nSo voters have to individuals such being driven by individual voting it also has to be leaders we have a paradox school system here in the sense that it's of the people by other people for the people\nAre as from the bottom up but we in order for it to work properly we need leaders of conscience and character and and and and I would say the answer is we will hear it when we hear it\nFrom from somebody ah from people who come forward as leaders to to explain\nThat America is a community and uh we're individuals and we'd prize individual wisdom in America ... per also community and we can't operate without that so it's going to take leaders to come forward to to convince Americans as a whole that there's an answer to using\nFear and hatred is a way to gain power uh there's gotta be that's that's the only way forward\nRight well rabbi ... burgundy which have been I Know you want to get a word in here but I Do have to make some space for our callers who've been patiently waiting so let me just go briefly to Lois who's calling from Northampton, Massachusetts Louis you're on the air\nHello thank you for taking my call I'm voting I don't know about leadership um education to talk of a Jew\nAs hum a conspirator or somebody as a hidden hand\nDirecting things manipulating things from behind the scenes\nThis has been a staple it's absolutely central to modern anti Semitism since at least the late Nineteen century there's absolutely no question when a Soros and others are vilified secondly I think the issues of", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "29"}
