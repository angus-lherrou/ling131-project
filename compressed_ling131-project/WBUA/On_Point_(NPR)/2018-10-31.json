an schools her eleven and Thirteen year old daughter she's founder of eclectic learning network and she's joining us today from Philadelphia also with us is Peter gray he is a professor of psychology at Boston College co founder\nAnd president of the nonprofit alliance for self directed education and the author of free to learn a\nNo Peter great I I still have some sort of basic questions about how a an schooling or self directed learning really work because it seems as if it requires or perhaps ... success is based on how self directed a child is\nAnd um you know I'm Wondering what about all those kids who if they are really given the choice to do anything they won all day long would just up to turn on the TV and sit there for eight hours\nRight [noise] well you know the kids that we see who uh sit there for eight hours turning on the TV are largely kids who are going to public school they're coming home and sit and watch a TV right [laughter]\nSo this issue of self directed what is it being to be self directed um [noise]\nI uh I'm an evolutionary psychologist so I'm interested in human nature the nature of children [noise]\nLook at little kids have you ever seen a little kid who hasn't yet gone to school who's not self directed who's not just curious playful and eagerly doing things they're exploring\nThe world almost from the moment they're born there looking around what's out there with new what can I learn about ...\nThink of all the things that children learn before they ever go to school and this is not this is not just some children that learn that this is essentially all the children they learned their native language from scratch\nThey learn an enormous amount about the physical world around them and the social world around them so I'm schooling is this what if we just left them continue to do that instead of\nPutting them away where their own questions don't count anymore where their own play is considered at best recess which is increasingly being taken away rather than a way of learning\nWhere socialization is almost cut off because they're not really allowed to talk to one another to cooperate people talk about [noise] socialization being missing if you're not going to school and what kinds of socialization truly is occurring there [noise]\nSo we send them to school and then we wonder why there are no longer self motivated right [laughter] because we've taken away the basic motives for learning curiosity playfulness because they have the ability\nIf I may just somebody here for a second I I thought I had read that quote from you I'm perhaps it was actually in the Boston Globe peace where how 'bout you said before that you believe that really basically all all kids should be made to learn is to learn how to read and maybe some some arithmetic and then leave the rest of it up to them\nYou know this was a myth quote okay I tried to get them to change that answer and I sent a correction that was published two weeks later that was a complete mess quotes [noise]\nOne of my own research has shown that children learn to read with out direct instruction when they are allowed to learn to read in their own ways at the time that they are motivated to do it they may ask for some help but nothing like the kind of construction and\nUh I have yet to see a child who's been a self directed education who hasn't eventually learn to read they learned to read it very different ages right\nWell so here's why I'm asking that question because if we're leaving a hundred percent of what a child learns up to that kid\nDon't we take the very grave risk that they're going to choose things that might well it might fulfilled them or it isn't the entire suite of what they need to be successful happy citizens of the modern world I mean I'm thinking what if a kid doesn't\nWe can make an argument that they're not learning these things in school right now but I'm going to set that aside but what if they don't want to learn things like civics or how government works or they don't want to learn about history or they don't want to learn about uh\nYou know financial issues et cetera all things that I Would argue are really ... you know really important\nUh to to living in the modern world aren't we sort of setting them back by not giving them at least the opening the door to these things to them\nWell you know ... if we make people learn things if we if we require them to learn things the first question is are they really learning it are they learning\nStays with them so let's take civics for example so in schools we deprive children of all their civil rights literally we deprive them of their civil rights and then we lecture to them about civics isn't that a real civics lesson where's the better civics lesson to say\nHey you're growing up in a democracy you're growing up in a world where you are responsible for your own life you are also responsible for other people\nYou you are also free to choose your own path and happiness isn't that a better civics lesson [laughter] than a lecture on it you are living if\nYou are limited in what in what you know that that you'll have ultimate than total freedom for your entire life which is not true we'll have to live in a society\nYou know something\nYes we do have to them and then the society and children who are growing up in charge of their own lives are experiencing what it is to live in a society they are learning how to live in a society and it's also not the case that there nobody has totally free nobody can do things that break the law\nYou know there are many many students who are in South directed education are going to learning centers or school learning stuff\nAnd they make rules they make the rules democratically there are lots of rules you can't let her you can't if you take out toys you have to put them away you can't there are rules against bowling and so forth but they're democratically made rules and isn't that a better civics lesson\n... been patiently listening here and I want to get your view what what's your response to my question here that perhaps where we're at risk of not introducing important lessons or a or subjects to children if they're totally self directed\nWell and for me I I question what the word introduced means so\nIn in this context because introducing if I'm looking at it from a school perspective their ears and indoctrination that comes from that and for me as a self directed in an schooling parent we can introduce but there is no indoctrination there is no forced to take that on and so\nThe idea that these things will not be introduced or seen or felt as something that I don't necessarily agree with that goes to the amusement park and that's physics\nAnd its best happening in motion for them to experience what that is for them when they're ready\nAnd whether politics all of these things are very much important but that happens at the playground or there's issues of race that happen everywhere we go that is not something that is specific to\nGoing to a traditional schooling setting that's everywhere so my daughters are huge and to making sure that their identity has affirmed everywhere that they go and they also participate in actions that create inclusion and diversity\nAnd equity so that has nothing to do with school\nWell a ... and Peter you can imagine that we have a lot of want to join us so let me just get a couple of them in here let's go to Alex is calling from big sky Montana Alex you're on the air\nHigh maintenance thank you so much for taking my call great conversation today um you know I just want to say that I Am thirty eight years old I was raised in the Massachusetts public school system in my parents' absolutely\nPractice something very similar to this on schooling or perhaps a free range parenting and certainly they didn't call it that but they eat those with very similar um you know they would\nPull me out of class to go to a museum or go see a movie goes to your family or friends if I was in a class and um had you'd be completed my work early or just didn't feel engaged with the lesson of the day they would uh have you moved over to\nAnother class and on some occasions even take me to another school across town to do something over there and\nYou know I can attest that it absolutely bread a sense of curiosity playfulness with this with me to this day but\nIt was a double edged sword that I think anyone should really consider as they are thinking about\nSean Leonard's executive director of the Cambridge

Kennedy saying no an amusement park is not physics physics is the math and process that results in a safe and exciting amusement park rides\nCat he thinks this sounds just like woo woo nonsense ... would you like to respond to that\nI mean ... caffeine and that's that's your position and I totally respect that um for me I see it differently and that's that's what makes us all unique and the biggest\nThe biggest thing about this about exploring what learning is is the liberation of being indoctrinated into a system that wasn't built for a person like myself\nIt was not built for me to truly explore and be innovative\nAnd look at this as an opportunity to really shine and that's what I'm allowing my children to do whether it has an effect that may be viewed as negative or not that's you know how anyone feels as none of my business is pretty much the model I follow\nSo as much as I appreciate her perspective um that's that's what works for us and my children are learning and growing and thriving so why doesn't matter to me\nAnd I also have another comment here on Facebook Jennifer Russell says formal school doesn't teach children socialization Jenna present it teaches them institutionalization let's go to Steven who's calling from Florence South Carolina Steven you're on the air\nThank you very much my questions I Hope aren't too simplistic but\nIf you could tell me what sort of things should I look for my child to see if he's a good candidate for this type of whirling at what age did it again and what sort of parameter or\nBoundaries are needed if we go into this sort of um in educational process\nSteven first of all I'm going to tell you there is no such thing on this program as overly simplistic question especially when we're talking about education so I actually thank you very much for your call Peter gray do you have some answers to receive\nThe question well Wendy began begins at birth [laughter] you you can't stop it from beginning at birth children are beginning to self educated as soon as they're more they're learning constantly they're constantly learning [noise]\nSo one of the questions that I've been interested in my own research is there are there some children who are\nMore cut out for self directed education than for others and this is many people think well some people are sort of self motivated they can take control of their own life and so on [noise] my experience has been a little children are all self motivated\nAnd that doesn't end if we allow it to continue it does not end if we allow it to continue I think the I think the important thing to ask for anybody who wants to take this route\nIs am I capable of trusting my child and I keep a bowl of allowing my child to learn what my child wants to learn even if it's not\nWhat I think my child should be learning at this point you have to give up a certain amount of sense of control now the truth of the matter\nIs reeling terror and my heart and let her as there is just gonna have\nTo give up a certain amount of sense of control you have to trust the nature of children I have learned over the years to do that because of my research not just because of my own experience with my own child but because of my research with many children [noise]\nAnd because of my research into the history of humanity\nThroughout almost all of human history children always self educated we'd never had schools we never had [noise]\nAnd so children come into the world burning to educate themselves we can't stop them from it unless we lock them away and closets and so on [noise]\nBut here's what we have to understand we are now living in a world where there's way more knowledge out there that any of us can possibly learn and who's to decide\nWhat's most important for any given child\nDon't we want people to grow up learning different aspects of math knowledge why should everybody learn the same little slice of all the knowledge and skills and the information\nThat schools have decided that says the slice everybody should learn yeah you have to trust your child your child may not study physics maybe your child will study art history or whatever else maybe\nWe'll never learned how to build habit shock value driving isn't that\nOf the matter is your child will have a job and the reason your child will have a job is because of your child has learned to take control of his or her own\nThat the graduates of self directed education are doing very well\nIn adult lives there and not having difficulty getting jobs let me get a response you Michael Apple what do you think\nWell first START I appreciate what's been said that I Want to ask what are the characteristics none of the children would have a parent you know we really want to society in which we should um\nThat children are simply the property of their parents when there's a growing movement in the United states for instance of anti Semitism of\nAnti you know\nClearly racist conscious things and\nI don't want to romanticize parents at all I Want to be very cautious about this because again I think parents have an ethical responsibility to be the best\nFor their children but I Do think we want to look around us right now and ask very serious questions about what is being taught are there any any limits are we romanticizing the situations that are that\nWe're putting parents so that's my first my first response fucking this um we have to ask\nDo we want a simply to have a society in which\nHer children are simply\nAnd parents having no responsibility whatsoever because the larger society what can we do to make it more certain that the vast majority of children who will go to public schools actually you have to kind of education that as many of the characteristics that movie computer won\nRight well Michael let me let the Peter Graham illegal respond to that but Peter go ahead I I think that's a wonderful point Michael that you've made and it's something that I've given a lot of thought to and concern to\nLet me be clear I Do not think that home based on schooling is the solution to our national educational problem\nI think it's a great solution for many many families it's clearly a great solution as far as I can tell for for a ... and her daughter is clearly a great solution for the many families that I have studied it works very well for them and that works very well for their children\nBut I don't think is the solution for everybody I think is probably even a minority of parents who should be doing this but what is happening and what is I think going to be that eventually the educational solution\nIs we're developing more and more learning centers and schools for self directed education is not happening within the public school system because the public school system has too many constraints you can move a certain direct a certain amount and the progressive direction\nBut then there's always the pushback to go back and the other way ever since schools have become compulsory we've had progressive educators trying to push it one way and that gets pushed back the other way this\nIs happening outside of the public school system but it's happening in a way that it could eventually become affordable to everybody and I would love to see public support for this right now the alliance for self directed education\nIs trying to bring public support\nFor Centers for self directed education so that children can be away from their parents they could be in a center\nWhere they have to learn the kind of community skills how to make rules how to live by rules how to get along with people who are different from you and have different ideas from yours different ideas from your parents I think this is all part of education very important part of education\nW.

A. G. E. dot com [noise]\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate body we're talking about immigration in the midterms and I'm speaking with a key Lamar sterling professor of law at Yale University where he teaches constitutional law\nProfessor Omar I'm giving you a ... a few more minutes and I said originally planned but I have two quick questions before I have to let you go here one is that you know the president said to ... that they are telling me\nPolitical they are telling me that he that he can use ... an executive order to an end birthright citizenship it is not clear at all who than they are I'm seeing a report here from Politico\nThat has sources in the White House counsel's office um and one of the sources told Politico that unless it became a policy a policy priority they didn't want to spin their wheels for long periods of time just to find the outer edges of authority for something that was probably going to be very inflammatory as well I mean do you know people in the White House counsel's office ... is it is it possible that\nI Do and one of the lead people is named Emmett flood happens to have been one of my favorite students of all time I wrote the clerk ship letter of recommendation to justice clear on his behalf he he got the clerk ship and and I think it's a very sound person and I can't imagine that he would disagree with me about what I\nSaid before I haven't talked to him but I'd be very hard because there are rules of constitutional law\nAnother person who was also a student of mine Steven Engel equipped for Justice Kennedy way back when I I wrote him a letter of recommendation were just Kennedy a brilliant student of mine\nIs the head of the office of legal counsel they are the body and historically tasked with giving legal advice to the executive branch of government so those would be the two offices and just so happens that I Do know that had ... or at least ... people and and both of those departments and I'd be very surprised if they disagreed with what I said\n... now if if it's even plausible that a change like this would happen it would have to come through a constitutional amendment or some sort of ... a three fifths majority action through Congress\nNeither of which seem a very plausible at this time but you said earlier that you believe that if if the president actually issued an executive order and legal action or taken against it and it made its way to the Supreme Court that the Supreme Court would decide nine zero against the president of the United states on this issue\nOr you will eat that confident because I'm thinking about justice cabinet right now who has you know in his own decisions on the DC circuit\nYou know as spouses quite an expansive view of executive power\nConvert cabinet as an originalist he's my student um and I testified on his behalf um before the allegations that occurred on September ... evidence of\nOf this year and precisely because he is an originalist and he and I play by the same ground rules I'm a Democrat he's a Republican I'm a liberal he's a conservative but we play by the same ground rules and this is and the ground are those are the text of the text there is the history precedent actually does matter of although in the end of the text and and and the history of matter\nThe most and it's just not a close question I'd be shocked that Brett Kavanaugh thought otherwise and and and and your audience might want to read things that I wrote in support of the cabinet nomination before the um\nThe various allegations occurred which we don't need to talk about an hour and I'm not really the question of how bright capital thinks about the constitution and I think he thinks about the constitution\nIn a a sound and so we're way paying attention to ... to ... history and to landmark precedents\nWilkie Lamar is sterling professor of law at Yale University where he teaches constitutional law speaking to us today from New Haven Connecticut professor ... thank you so very much\nThank you for having me important issue\nWell let's hear a little bit from a key member of the Republican Party who disagrees with the president's view that he can change birthright citizenship through an executive order your house Speaker Paul Ryan yesterday in an interview with Kentucky radio station W. V. A. okay\nCannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives you know we believe in and and the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment is pretty clear [laughter]\nUm and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process but where we obviously totally agree with President is getting at the root issue here which is um ... illegal immigration\nThat's how speaker ... Speaker Paul Ryan speaking to W. V. okay in Kentucky\nOr just yesterday well joining us now is Ellen go ... he is joining us from Miami and he is immigration reporter for USA Today we have links to his reporting on point radio dot org\nAs well Alan Gomez welcome back to the program thanks for having me All right so you just heard that Paul Ryan they're saying that what he thinks the president is really getting at is this route issue unchecked illegal immigration\nAnd you know today it this morning in the course of an hour and a half the president pumped out one two three four five tweets\nAre about a immigration specifically so how central is this as an issue not to Republicans in this midterm uh season\nI mean it's really become the issue and it's it's I think it started\nFrom Trump um he obviously this is something that worked for him and twenty sixteen [noise] um it wrote him to the White House from his first press conference announcing his presidential campaign um he was talking about Mexicans and\nWhich Mexicans are coming into the country and all that um and he wrote that through to the White House and so for him he's just taking a page out of his twenty sixteen political playbook\nAnd applying it to this midterm uh men it's and it seems like something that just kind of struck him just a few weeks ago because it was really the care of and that really started all them since October sixteenth um is really really started to you know digging it on this such has been a couple of weeks but in that time\nHe has threatened to cut five hundred million dollars in aid to Central America threaten to tear up the new NAFTA deal threaten the seal the entire southern border deployed these five thousand military troops to the border is considering suspending all asylum claims on the southern border\nAll for a group of migrants that's down to about thirty five hundred people at the ... at this point that it's still about nine hundred miles away [laughter] um so he started it but the Republican Party has wholeheartedly embrace that um and they've been arguing\nThe same tactics they've been taking the same tax\nAh for for weeks now and you see it and Senate races you see it in local house districts that are far far far from the border um so it's really become a central component um is not the defining issue of their campaign\nAnd how much is it resonating ah with with voters because when we talked about Democrats and health care last week one thing that reporters from around the country were telling us was that voters wanted to talk about health care are we seeing the same thing about immigration I'm with Republicans talking about it on the campaign trail\nWell this has been the fascinating thing to see if you poll all Americans um\nNumber one is health care and number two jobs in the economy a gun policy is number three immigration is fourth and this according to a Kaiser Family foundation poll but if you only isolated out the Republicans immigration is the number one issue them so clearly it's working for\nThe target audience that they're intending to um you know immigration is all riled up to ... is one of the things that really riled up his base in twenty sixteen\nAnd so after a summer where everybody was talking about this blue wave about in record numbers of enthusiasm when it comes to democratic registrations in early voting and all that\nThis is an attempt and this is a way to rile up the Republican base I mean there's no there's no work in the middle here there's no trying to get swing voters with with what they're doing right now this is strictly an issue this is strictly something that they're trying to do to rile up the Republican base in ... in ... there turn out next week\nWell let's get a call here let's go to Jay who's calling from Baltimore, Maryland Jay you're on the air\nThank you I feel like I'm a centrist here because I look at the immigration issue and I say\nAs a Democrat I feel like it exposes Democratic Party because it's so simple we have illegal and legal ... migration and the president and I'm fifty years old and for fifty years we've been talking about illegal immigration and he's trying to solve it\nAnd it just seems kind of crazy we well I don't think the big issue but I think it's a simple one to solve and he's trying to do that obviously wants to change birthright citizenship which should not be such a contentious thing I mean I'm a pro immigration guy I'm just a pro legal immigration Democrat\nI Believe in immigration and then but I Do think health care is much higher priority for me and what I Do and I think that\nThe Democrats and Republicans both want big changes but there's so many entrenched interests it's virtually impossible and I think each one claims each other and nothing gets done yeah things that you get done or not productive\nWell Jay thank you so much for your call Ellen ... let me turn back to you on that because one thing that jeeze comment makes me think of is it Republicans are pushing hard on these immigration issues I mean ... advertising in\nInterviews but are Democrats responding or they just simply trying to ignore immigration is an issue and focusing exclusively on health care and does that put them at a slight weakness when it comes to dealing with as you said at least in Republican mine's the number one important issue for them\nCharles River apparel dot com [noise] and posters Smith posters on rent\nClosest myth provided service to research communities worldwide learn more have most\nOn all things considered story starts with a new home when is set to become the first female Army Rangers\nEver that day we wind ... with the congregation from a woman was in the military leadership me now everybody when it went down to one to get her on the phone\nWill come to the program so I can I can get a my ... I Want to start just with your reaction there's more to every story on all things considered every afternoon it's\nAll things considered today from four to six thirty on Monday point nine WB you are [noise]\nThis is on point I'm making a talk her body we're talking this hour about immigration and the midterms and we're joined today by Alan Gomez is immigration reporter for USA Today he's with us from Miami and with us from El Paso Texas is ... he's immigration and border security reporter\nFor the Texas Tribune and it's got lots of listeners comment coming here here on line on Facebook mark first tells us Paul Ryan said unchecked illegal immigration is the big issue it isn't unchecked Obama deported loads of people in town and Trump continues to do it albeit with very different tones and\nThen mark said the problem is not being able to agree on what rates and types of immigration are the most beneficial for the country well let's go to Laurie now who's calling from Davenport, Iowa Laurie you're on the air\nThank you I I just wanted to say that\nI Am totally in favor of trips to the border\nThey care I think we need to protect our borders I think President Trump does not want any violence down there but it's obvious that the\nPeople are getting aid somewhere they have water bottle they have they have money [noise] something is sponsoring this and we need to protect America and\nAlso on a I'm not there no I Believe in voter ID I had to get one to get a library card I have to have identification can get a loan\nTo open a credit card to get a library card to start utilities there's nothing racist about it and everybody has to do it\nWhy can't they have id to vote\nWill Lorrie thank you so much for your call there uh I wouldn't do is I mean you hear Laurie from feeling very strongly about sending troops to the border and even about voter id so she's probably one of those voters that we were talking we're talking about earlier who immigration is is front and center number one in terms of the concerns the issues are concerned about\nYeah and it's interesting as you mentioned the idea that she doesn't want violence at that southern border um you know that's an idea that we've been hearing a lot about from the president and from other Republicans who have been warning about this caravan\nUm but I think it's important to provide some context to what these caravans are like I mean first off they're coming into the ... they're they're they travel ... ranch for their own security I'm traveling by yourself or in small groups or Central America Mexico is a very dangerous and never\nUm so they for ... years ago to just to make it there are more safely them in the last ... care of and that got here then provides a little\nBit of insight into what their intentions are um they arrived in April there was about five hundred of them that ended up making it to the border um about a hundred and twenty two of them were caught illegally entering the country but four hundred and one of them\nUm did exactly what they said they they were going to do they present themselves at ports of entry requested asylum um and and from more reporters that we have imbedded with the Caribbean moving through Mexico um the it's clear that that's that's what's going on here that it's not going to be five ten thousand people that arrived at the border it's already shrunk down to thirty five hundred\nAnd again they still have nine hundred miles to go um that's the equivalent of walking from Boston to Knoxville, Tennessee\nSo it's going to take a long time and by the time they get here it's going to be for fewer people and not exactly the kind of numbers that are going to be able to overwhelm or to take over us port of entry\nWell and especially with possibly the United states military there as well but but I'm Alan a little early in the show and then just clarify here that are isn't the Trump Administration also seeking to merely deny asylum claims to anyone who makes them when they arrive at the border\nThat his uh in the middle of the last bomber waiting for him before the election comes the this is something that they were talking about that they were considering uh mid ... they were planning the Tuesday rollout of this but things got pushed back because of the Pittsburgh shooting and and some of the other tragedies we've seen recently\nUm but yeah that is still a possibility um you know basically they're they're considering using the same rationale um that they use to implement the travel ban a shortly after Trump took office it was the first two versions of the travel ban were shut down by the courts but the third one survived\nAnd so they're looking at the legal right rationale behind that one and trying to apply somewhat similar argument to what's going on along the southern border to claim that this is some kind of national emergency that it's a threat to national security\nShould have the authority to at least temporarily suspend asylum applications that will surely be challenged in court the second one he announces it um but yeah that's one more thing that they could\nGrow out here right now in ... oh you know you're there in El Paso and I was I mean if you could talk to us about how this is playing out in a particularly interesting Texas congressional race this is the one uh we between incumbent representative\nA Republican we'll hard and Gina Ortiz Jones or his Democratic challenger right because they did that district that heard represents has many hundreds of miles up on the border\nTo correct It's got about eight hundred miles of the of the Texas Mexico border and it stretches from a far east Paso county\nUh all the way to uh to the outskirts of their county um which is includes San Antonio and big band and several border counties in between the you know this for this this was considered a closer eats a few months ago but the latest polling shows that um\nCongressman heard is I guess he's a little bit more comfortable if I have to say that then is um Ortiz Jones has imposed a significant a challenge and could still you know that that's the thing when when people mention poll numbers today they always go back to twenty sixteen and say well you know the polls were wrong then so I think that's giving\nA the Democrats and and the protects us a little bit of hope but\nA congressman heard also you know it was very public about his his the way he strives for bipartisanship um you know she and and partially work actually they you know they did that Facebook Live where you know DC was was snowed in and they had to drive back to to the sea and they they ended up doing the Pittsburgh live of their journey which\nI think when I'm pretty good way for for both of the congressmen to show that they they are able to work together and rural voters in Texas said either they're concerned about the wall and imminent domain and issues like border security but they are also um but by and large a lot of them are are frustrated\nAt some of what they they think is an action you know you talked to [noise]\nTo ranchers all along the border and they say you know they have to fix their fans are they have to call border patrol or people are going through their property that that's not to say they're not also compassionate and they realize you know that a lot of these people are just coming to work or to escape\nYou know their their home countries to seek a better life but they do think that something should be should be done about it so I think congressman heard in the minds of of his constituents has done a pretty good job of of trying to strike a middle down he's been somewhat outspoken at least early on about some of the president's policies but\nCloser to election day he's he's obviously you know it helps them to go more towards the middle and stay in line with Republican values but not to the to the extreme and um and to Mr Mr Gomez is point earlier with respect to the to the care of and\nUh he's absolutely right with respect that we don't know how many people are going to end up coming here and what I saw on the bridge and she was on Tuesday was migrants that were lined up at the port of entry waiting to get processed so\nWith respect to the caller's concerns and illegitimate concerned about who's coming into the country if you're a violent criminal lawyers can fit to come in undeterred it's not likely that you're going to present at the port eventually it was a lot of people are are definitely do\nYou know the the herd Jones races interesting to me because it will hurt his then I think he he represents as ... as you were saying earlier how um the views of communities on the border are much more they're more subtle and textured\nThan we might see a ... as we get further and further away actually from from the border 'cause I Know heard has been a very eloquent I'm advocating for more smart well technology versus hard wall high technology between the United states and Mexico but we got a lot of callers here so let's go to them Allen is calling from Baltimore, Maryland you're on the Alan\nHi magna thanks for taking the call uh I I think this is just another case where the Democrats are willing to play defense\nUm and to play defense against emotional appeals and instead focus on this rational discussion or um I think there's a lot of winning points that the Democrats have and I think better work brings some of them out surveys so that\nThe American public favors a permanent status for the dreamers something sort of permanent status and I think the Democrats can make the point that immigration has solve the problem with immigration can be solved immigration reform rather than through posting troops on the border\nAllen thank you for your call I'm Alan dumb and let me turn to you is that what you're hearing from Democrats and we just hearing more ... softer tone\nI mean I think it's interesting there do they use the word emotional when it comes to the Democratic responds because\nThat to some degree has and we there's there's quite a bit of your food in the last summer um with this abolish ice movement that that only a very small number of Democrats really truly embrace\nMajor funding for on point is provided by Geico offering car insurance as well as services for

times\nMost preeminent a costume designer who is telling the visual stories of African Americans on film through the fabric that she puts her actors and actresses and again we're at eight hundred forty three eight to five five\nA Ruthie Carter let me ask you can just jump back in time deep back in time here because I read a in a previous interview that you gave\nThat um your mother when you were growing up ended up being a very large influence on sort of how you see the world and maybe how you even got into to costume design is that right\nYes um when I was a younger a junior high school and through high school my uh mom worked for the CD she wasn't a social worker but um she worked in the office of a social worker it was a free counseling service for the city\nAnd people could drop in and get services counseling services so she knew kind of like everyone on the street you know she knew the homeless people she knew people you know um there was a guy named Tina and my mother knew about him and\nSo we would ride with her through um you know downtown or down go to ... drop us off to school and we see certain people and we\nLaugh in point or hide you know hide in the back seat\nAnd my mom would say you know he looks okay he's gotta clean shirt on today and she could you know just kind of some them up in a different way and it and it gave me pause and it's kind of showed me how to\nHow little more empathy for people and look at them differently you know sometimes she would even role that window down to our dismay and say you\nKnow ... how George you know how are you today\nAnd you know that kind of a view of\nYou know people is what I still used today to kind of embrace a individuality and that it helps within bracing culture and embracing people and places and you know just taking it all in\nYeah you've suddenly occurs to me I don't know why it suddenly occurred you know there's a long time ago but but ... ... on a day to day basis in the real world what we wear is a deliberate choice that we make every day to communicate to the rest of the world of who we are\nAnd when you're doing that when you are designing costumes for a film that essentially what you're doing right you're telling me on hold portions of each character's story or and so now they want to communicate that to the world constructed in that film and then to us as viewers\nYes I feel that costume design or can be defined as storytelling design and you when people want to associate costume designer with fashion and you know that's kind of in the world of costume design but the\nOverall a\nA goal is to tell the story to work within a larger story of the script but and the smaller story that is each individual person has the story with what they wear\nRight so so then how how did you get a down the path of working I'm In Hollywood I mean well ... let me ask you this way when did you first meet Spike Lee 'cause you've done one Fifteen plus collaborations with him\nYes I have it ... it it goes by fast [laughter] um I met Spike Lee in Los Angeles a friend who's a casting director now Robbie read introduced me to him he actually came to a dance performance that I had done the\nCostumes for and it in the lobby I was showing my portfolio to one of\nMy friends and I I guess he was observant and listening on she's got to have it had been completed but it hadn't gone to the Cannes Film festival yet\nAnd Spike Lee hum afterwards we all were about the same age and we all you know wanted to hang out together and we did and he kept talking to me about getting film experience and I really came from opera and dance and theater and that's where my sights set so\nI kept you know modeling around him I have this idea of getting film experience and he suggested that I call us see or UCLA to their film department and sign up on a student these projects and he said that would give me experience with being on a set\nAnd what that medium um would be like\nAnd so I did and before I knew it on a Saturday I was on a U.S see students ... are doing the costumes are well\nAnd then very soon thereafter came Nineteen eighty nine and and do the right thing\nI Want to play a clip well not all day I was actually the first one and then do the right then do the right thing okay I Want to restrict less likely\nThanks [laughter] mostly just go\nDo the right thing it's such an amazing movie still to this day so I wouldn't want to play a quick clip from here I'm this is a scene where you're going to hear a John John Carlos does he do

right thing and Ruthie Carter was the costume designer\nUh on that one of many collaborations she had with Spike Lee now the thing about this film a ruse if I may say is that it really one of his many powers as it captures this particular moment where we see on screen very powerfully this sort of combination of the materiality\nOf what the characters are wearing like a high top the boom boxes that the printed tease the jerseys\nUm but also as we heard that clip this moment of political consciousness as well absolutely so how does that play out in your design well\nHe was a the eighties which was the explosion of um color blocking and really saturated color Nike was a huge part of a\nA clothing or during that time and a guy's war colorful compression shorts underneath their basketball shorts and\nWe really wanted to represent you know pop culture of the moment and\nReally create this um this intensity of color in their environment\nAnd so what we did was we created like top side of African fabrics and you see bugging out wearing can take cloth shorts that we made and it was also the hottest day of the year and you know it was it was kind of thing in New York where when it got really really hot\nThat stuff would go down you know there could be riots there could be shootings and\nSo because of the heat the intensity of the heat the intensity and the saturation of the color and and the styles that um we present to kind of all the fed into the combination of what eventually happened story will\nUh we've got a lot of callers who want to ask you some questions raised so if Iranian turned to the ... the light we were talking with Ruthie Carter she is a two time Academy Award nominated costume designer uh she got those nominations for Malcolm X. in ... but those are two of the forty plus films that she's been a costume designer on\nThen that means we double checked [laughter] and then they didn't want any more TV project I your group\nAnd again congratulations to you for that but we're the one eight hundred forty three eight to five five eight hundred and forty three talk so let's go to Tanya who's calling from Detroit Michigan Tanya you're on the air\nAnd Geico

those nods for Malcolm X. in on this diet at her most recent work you've seen it it's in Black Panther she's also done the costume designer for everything from do the right thing\nTo the butler to what's love got to do with it and Selma as well and I wanted to just play a quick clip\nFrom Selma and you're going to hear David yellow he of course played the role of rubber Dr Martin Luther king in ... fourteen film and is seen he's giving a speech before leading a voting rights march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nAnd he's wearing a suit with a with a black and fuel striped tie and a style link black overcooked\nAgain going to want to come off the\nCosts don't want to come on [noise]\n\n[noise]\nBut we believe it's already been off what\n\nThe from the two thousand fourteen film Selma Ruthie Carter here's one of the cases several cases in which you were doing a film or depicting an act you know an actual person from history so how did you go about deciding how to design the clothing for you know for David who is playing Dr King well there\nAre several images that I could draw from of Martin Luther king there several books pictorial books that have been written and so the little nuances of his character were were I delved into the design um one or is that I'm a Martin Luther king was a real busts\nMen and ... if you look at him and his suits you noticed that you know there's a little flushed she area around the color of his neck where he button down shirt and it would\nKind of roll over the top and David are yellow the brilliant actor that he is gained weight for the role um and I wanted to sort of\nHelp that along and I made his a shirt policies so at least smaller than would we what would be required so that I can also see that little neck role that happened I'm at the color of king shirt I Love\nThat detail [laughter] it's not something I Would have ever noticed but it's all it's all what goes into sort of the whole experience of sort of occupying a character\nYeah and the costume has to support the actor there has to help support their performance and\nI'm just looking at a lot of black and white photographs you have to create a color palette that supports the mood of the story as well as isn't accurate depiction of the colors during that time now to David every day the shirt colors were too tight um he never come out and I would say he never complained\nUm maybe it just felt right\nRight for him and uh when I hear that that performance in particular I really hear Martin Luther king more than I hear David a yellow all\nRight well we're at one hundred forty three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk coast with your questions for the Carter and how she tells these African American stories through fabric on these amazing films that we've been talking about well let's go to Sarah who's calling from Lowell, Massachusetts Sara you're on the air\nI'm not an hello ms Carter I Am so excited that you are having a show talking about\nThis when I saw a Black Panther in the theater I was just blown away not only by the film but also by its potential as a teaching opportunity I met future who's been working on a project on how we can use\nTextiles including to teach science technology engineering and math topics and I just feel like you've provided such a rich palate here\nOf opportunities we can't we don't just send you know right now just sense to\nYou know being a robotics team or something like that but they could learn three D. print things\nThey could talk about textiles with special technology in them like the black Panthers suit stores kinetic energy well what kinds of mother energy could you put into a fabric how would you do it\nThey're just so many opportunities here and it was so exciting\nThere and thank you for your cold Ruth you have a response\nFor yes um what I Love about series lab is that it's a a\nIt's an exploration and what kids can do you never can hunters estimate what your children could can do and she certainly does represent that you know she\nI imagined was the mastermind behind the three D. printing up the queen's crown and her shoulder mantle she created the black panther suit and\nAnd I think it's just a great opportunity to use it as a vehicle for for learning ...\nA ruse if I may want to talk for a minute or two or hear from you or for a couple of minutes about ... in particular one of the films that you\nReceived an Oscar nomination for for your costume design there of course that's the Steven Spielberg film I'm about uh about a revolt honestly on a Spanish slave ship and so we have a scene here\nIn the films Nineteen Ninety seven and you're going to hear the leader of the slave revolt Josephine Cape played by the gym on a ... who who stands up\nUh during the mutiny trolleys put on trial for his labor of old and repeatedly cries for his freedom\nFor reasons for for the phone\nCrying out or\nA scene from the Nineteen Ninety seven Phil ... that scene where the leader of the slave revolt justice in case put on trial Carter if I remember correctly in that scene a king is wearing a western clothes right yes ah\nThe abolitionist and the reading we read that the abolitionist gave a clothing to the Africans and\nThere was an account that said in the courtroom they look like I'm sitting in the gallery and so I use those words to create um\nClothing that was donated especially forcing K who would have been given closing from the attorneys that were supporting the case and I also wanted to present him in a royal manner\nUm very regal at this moment where he says give us free and you'll notice that um the African sitting there and the gallery or mostly in these white bill Louis shirts up the period and\nI wanted to evoke the feeling of dubbed\nHuh now is it also a comedian's readings wrong because I I I thought the part of the reason why\nThe slightly baggy fit uh on on Joseph was as you said he had to wear borrowed close um and that's a said that they didn't quite fit properly but nevertheless gave as you were saying does this regal field him\nYes yes and I was assured of the parrot period was very below we pleaded ruffled shirt yeah\nAnd and this is a particularly interesting film to talk about because I'm ... and you also did the costume design for white royalty on the film oh I'm\nYes John Adams yeah and you know based on you know art history I looked at the composition of some of the great painters and\nAlso the history of the court case of the homicide all those things are important to paint the picture of royalty and\nThe Africans as you know when they first embark in Mystic Connecticut they are wearing blanket and\nNinety two point seven WB away his Barry

Lamar sterling professor of law at Yale University where he teaches constitutional law professor Omar I'm giving you a ... a few more minutes and I said originally planned but I have two\nQuick questions before I have to let you go here one is that you know the president said to ... they are telling me quote unquote they are telling me that he did\nCitizenship it is not clear at all who than they are I'm seeing a report here from Politico\nNow that has sources in the White House counsel's office um and one of the sources told Politico that unless it became a policy a policy priority they didn't want to spend their wheels for long periods of time justifying the outer edges of authority for something that was probably going to be very inflammatory as well I mean do you know people in the White House counsel's office ... is it is it possible that\nI Do and one of the lead people is named Emmett flood happens to have been one of my favorite students of all time I wrote the clerk ship letter of recommendation to justice on his behalf he he got the clerk ship and and I think it is a very sound person and I can't imagine that he would disagree with me about what I\nSaid before I haven't talked to him but I'd be very hard because there are rules of constitutional law\nAnother person who's also I'm a student of mine Steven Engel clerked for Justice Kennedy way back when I I wrote him a letter of recommendation for Justice Kennedy a brilliant student of mine\nHis head of the office of legal counsel they are the body and historically tasked with giving legal advice to the executive branch of government so those would be the two offices and just so happens that I Do know that had ... or at least ... people and\nAnd both of those departments and I'd be very surprised that they disagreed with what I said\n... now if if it's even plausible that a change like this would happen it would have to come through a constitutional amendment or some sort of ... a three fifth majority action through Congress\nNeither of which seem a very plausible at this time but you said earlier that you believe that if if the president actually issued an executive order and legal action or taken against it and it made its way to the Supreme Court that the Supreme Court would decide nine year old against the president of the United states on this issue\nAre you really that confident because I'm thinking about justice cabinet right now who has you know in his own decisions on the DC circuit\nYou know as spouses quite an expansive view of executive power\nCan recognize an originalist he's my student um and I testified on his behalf um before the allegations that occurred on September seven of of this year and precisely because he is an originalist and he and I play by the same ground rules I'm a Democrat he's a Republican I'm a liberal\nHe's a conservative but we play by the same ground rules and this is on the ground rules are the text of the text there is the history precedent actually does matter all although in the end of the text and and and the history of matter\nThe most and it's just not a close question I'd be shocked at Brett Kavanaugh fed otherwise and and and and your audience might want to\nRead things that I wrote in support of the cabinet nomination before the um the various allegations occurred which we don't need to talk about and are not really the question of how Brett Kavanaugh thinks about the constitution and I think he thinks about the constitution\nIn a a sound and subway paying attention to cost to she'll text to constitutional history and the landmark precedence\nWill kill them are is sterling professor of law at Yale University where he teaches constitutional law speaking to us today from New Haven Connecticut professor am I think he's still very much thank you for having me important issue well let's hear a little bit from a key member of the Republican\nParty who disagrees with the president's view that he can change birthright citizenship through an executive order your house Speaker Paul Ryan yesterday in an interview with Kentucky radio station W. V. E. okay\nWell you obviously cannot do that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives you know we believe in and and the constitution you know the conservative I'm a believer and following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment is pretty clear [noise]\nUm and that would involve a very very lengthy constitutional process but where we obviously totally agree with the president is getting at the root issue here which is on track to illegal immigration\nThat's how ... Speaker Paul Ryan speaking to W. B. okay in Kentucky\nOr just yesterday well joining us now is Ellen ... he's joining us from Miami and he is immigration reporter for USA Today we have links to his reporting on point radio dot org\nAs well Alan Gomez welcome back to the program thanks for having me All right so you just heard that Paul Ryan and they're saying that what he thinks the president is really getting at is this route issue of unchecked illegal immigration\nAnd you know today it this morning in the course of an hour and a half the president pumped out one two three four five tweets\nAbout immigration specifically so how central is this as an issue to Republicans in this midterm uh season\nI mean it's really become the issue it's foods started\nFrom from um you obviously this is something that worked for him and twenty sixteen I'm at wrote into the White House from his first press conference announcing his presidential campaign um he was talking about Mexicans and\nWhich Mexicans are coming into the country and all that um any real good through to the White House and so for him he's just taking a page and it was twenty six doing political political\nAnd applying it to this ... minutes and it seems like some people just construction\nThat really started on 'em since October sixteenth um is really really started there you know they get in on this it's just been a couple of weeks but in that time\nHe has threatened to cut five hundred million dollars in aid to Central America threaten to tear up the new NAFTA deal threaten the seal the entire southern border deployed these five thousand military troops to the border is considering suspending all asylum claims on the southern border\nAll for a group of migrants that's down to about thirty five hundred people at the post at this point that it's still about nine hundred miles away [laughter] um so he started it but the Republican Party has wholeheartedly embrace that um and they've been arguing\nThe same tax and they've been taking the same tax\nAh for for weeks now and you see it in Senate races you see it in local house districts that are far far far from the border um so it's really become a central component um if not the defining issue of their campaign\nAnd how much is it resonating ah with with voters because when we talked about Democrats and health care last week one thing that reporters from around the country were telling us was that voters wanted to talk about health care are we seeing the same thing about immigration I'm with Republicans talking about it on the campaign trail\nWell this has been the fascinating thing to see if you poll all Americans um\nNumber one is health care and number two jobs in the economy a gun policy is number three immigration is fourth I'm this according to a Kaiser Family foundation poll but if you only isolate out the Republicans immigration is the number one issue them so clearly it's working for\nThe target audience that they're intending to um you know immigration is what riled up to ... one of the things that really riled up his base in twenty sixteen and so after a summer where everybody was talking about this blue wave about in record numbers of of of enthusiasm when it comes to democratic registrations in early voting and all that\nThis is an attempt and this is a way\nTo rile up the Republican base I mean there's no there's no working on the middle here there's no trying to get swing voters with with what they're doing right now this is strictly an issue this is strictly something that they're trying to do to rile up the Republican base in ... in ... there turn out next week\nWell let's get a call here let's go to Jay who's calling from Baltimore, Maryland Jay you're on the air\nThank you I feel like I'm a centrist here because I look at the immigration issue and I say\nAs a Democrat I feel like it exposes Democratic Party because it's so simple we illegal and legal ... migration and the president and I'm fifty years old and for fifty years\nWe've been talking about illegal immigration and he's trying to solve it and it just seems kind of crazy we well I don't think it's a big issue but I think it's a simple one to solve and he's trying to do that you obviously wants to change birthright citizenship which should not be such a contentious thing I mean I'm a pro immigration guy I'm just a pro legal immigration Democrat\nI Believe in immigration and then but I Do think health care is much higher priority for me and what I Do and I think that\nThe Democrats and Republicans both want to make changes but there's so many entrenched interests it's virtually impossible and I think each one claims each other and nothing gets done yeah\nThings that you get on or not productive\nWell Jay thank you so much for your call Ellen ... let me turn back to you on that because one thing that jeeze comment makes me think of is it Republicans are pushing hard on these immigration issues I mean ... advertising in debate on the campaign trail in interviews\nAre ... are Democrats responding or they just simply ... trying to ignore immigration is an issue and focusing exclusively on health care and does that put them at a slight weakness when it comes to dealing with\nInspiring them to become responsible held for was the leader [noise]\n\n[noise]\nOne year ago the me too movement drew attention to the widespread problem of sexual harassment now the movements power is tested at the ballot box [noise]\nI'm not willing to compromise my values over election time is up\nSome lawmakers who could accused Mel face voters tomorrow on MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nTomorrow morning at five or ... point nine W. B. U. R. Boston is NPR News station\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate bar ... we're talking this hour about immigration and the midterms and we are joined today by Alan Gomez is immigration reporter for USA Today he's with us from Miami and with us from El Paso Texas is ... immigration and border security reporter\nFor the Texas Tribune and we've got lots of listeners comment coming here here on line on Facebook mark first tells us Paul Ryan said unchecked illegal immigration is the big issue it isn't unchecked Obama deported loads of people in town and Trump continues to do it albeit with very different tones\nAnd then mark said the problem is not being able to agree on what rates and types of immigration are the most beneficial for the country well let's go to Laurie now who's calling from Davenport, Iowa Laurie you're on the air\nThank you I I just wanted to say that I Am totally in favor of the border they care I think we need to protect our borders I think President Trump does not want any violence down there but it's obvious\nSome way or they have water bottle they have they have money [noise] something is sponsoring this and we need to protect America\nAnd also I I I'm not there now I Believe in voter ID I hadn't even get one can get a library card half will have identical sent to get a loan\nAnd credit card to get a library card start utilities there's nothing racist about it and everybody has to do it\nWhy can't they have id to vote\nWell All right thank you so much for your call their uh Allen do is I mean you hear Laurie from feeling very strongly about sending troops to the border and even about voter id so she's probably one of those voters that we were talking we're talking about earlier who immigration is is front and center number one in terms of the concerns the issues are concerned about\nYeah and it's interesting as you mentioned the idea is one by one said that southern border um you know that's an idea that we've been hearing a lot about from the president and from other Republicans who have been warning about this care of it\nUm but I think it's important to provide some context to what these caravans are like I mean first off they're coming into the ... they're they're they travel in ... for their own security I'm traveling by yourself or in small groups or Central America and Mexico is a very dangerous and never\nUm so they for ... years ago to just to make it there are more safely them in the last ... urban got here I think provides a little bit of insight into what\nTheir intentions are um they arrived in April there was about five hundred of them that ended up making it to the border\nUm about a hundred and twenty two of them were caught illegally entering the country but four hundred and one of them\nUm did exactly what they said they they were going to do they present themselves at ports of entry requested asylum um and and from more reporters that we have embedded with the Caribbean and moving through Mexico um the it's clear that that's that's what's going on here um ... it's not going to be five ten thousand people that arrived at the border it's already shrunk down to thirty five hundred\nAnd again they still have nine hundred miles to go um that's the equivalent of walking from Boston to Knoxville, Tennessee so it it's going to take a long time and by the time they get here it's going to be for fewer people than not exactly the kind of numbers that are going to be able to overwhelm or seek over us port of entry\nWell and especially with possibly the United states military there as well but but I'm feeling a little early in the show and then just clarify here that they aren't isn't the ... also seeking just merely deny asylum claims to anyone who makes them when they arrive at the border\nThat his uh in the ... the last bomber waiting for him before the election comes the this is something that they were talking about that they were considering uh mid ... they were planning the Tuesday rollout of this but things got pushed back because of the Pittsburgh shooting and some of the other tragedies we've seen recently\nUm but yeah that is still a possibility um you know basically they're they're considering using the same rationale um that they use to implement the travel ban um shortly after Trump took office it was the first two versions of that travel ban worship down by the courts but the third one survived\nAnd so they're looking at the legal right rationale behind that one in trying to apply somewhat similar argument to what's going on along the southern border to claim that this is some kind of national emergency that it's a threat to national security\nAnd the president should have the authority to at least temporarily suspend asylum applications that will surely be challenged in court the second if and when he announces it um but yeah that's one more thing that they could\nThrow out here right now who in ... oh you know you're there in El Paso and I wonder if you could talk to us about how this is playing out in a particularly interesting Texas congressional race this is the one uh ... between incumbent representative\nA Republican we'll hard and Gina Ortiz Jones or his Democratic challenger right because the debt that district that heard represents has so many hundreds of miles up on the border\nCorrect It's got about eight hundred miles of the Texas Mexico border and it stretches from a far east Paso county\nAll the way to uh to be altered their county um which is includes San Antonio and Big Bend in several border counties in between the you know this this this was considered a closer it's a few months ago but the latest polling shows that um\nCongressman heard is I guess he's a little bit more comfortable if I have to say that then is um which he's shown doesn't pose a significant challenge and could still you know that's the thing when when people mention pull numbers today they always go back twenty sixteen and say well you know the polls were wrong then so I think that's giving\nThe Democrats and and the protects us a little bit of hope but I'm with congressman heard also it was very public about his is the way he strives for bipartisanship um you know she and and partially work actually they you know they did that\nFacebook Live where you know DC was was snowed in and they had to drive back to the sea and they they ended up in his book life of their journey which I think when I'm pretty good way for\nFor both of the Congress rent to show that they they are able to work together and rural voters\nWall and eminent domain and issues like border security but they are so um but by and large a lot of them are are frustrated at some of what they they think it's an action you know you talk to [noise]\nTo ranchers along the border and they say you know they have to fix their fans who they have to call border patrol where people are going through their property and that's not to say they're not also compassionate and they realize you know that a lot of these people are just coming to work or to escape\nYou know their their home countries to seek a better life but they do think that something should be should be done about it so I think congressman heard in the minds of his constituents has done a pretty good job of trying to strike a middle down he's been\nSomewhat outspoken at least early on about some of the president's policies but closer to election day he's he's obviously you know it helps them to go more towards the middle and stay in line with Republican values but not to the extreme and um and to Mr Mr Gomez is point earlier with respect to the to the caravan\nHe's absolutely right with respect and we don't know how many people are gonna end up coming here and what I

much more they're more subtle and textured\nThan we might see a ... as we get further and further away actually from from the border because I Know hurt has been a very eloquent um advocate for more smart well technology versus hard wall high technology between the United states and Mexico but we got a lot of callers here so let's go to them Allen is calling from Baltimore, Maryland you're on the Allen\nI'd like to thank for taking the call uh I I think this is just another case where the Democrats are willing to play defense\nUm and to play defense against emotional appeals instead focus on this rational discussion or um I think there's a lot of winning points that the Democrats have and I think they do work brings about surveys show that\nThe American public favors a permanent status for the dreamers those sort of permanent status and I think the Democrats can make the point that immigration is solve the problem with immigration can be solved immigration reform rather than through posting troops on the border\nAllen thank you for your call I'm Alan Gomez let me turn to you it is that what you're hearing from Democrats are we just hearing more ... or softer tone\nI mean I think it's interesting or do they use the word emotional when it comes to the Democratic response because\nIt in to some degree it has a ... there was there was quite a bit of your for the ... over the
