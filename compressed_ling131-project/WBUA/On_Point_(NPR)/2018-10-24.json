guns I knew them from TB watch one movie a listen to a lot of rap music\nBut there where they weren't really a part of my childhood\nAnd they weren't really a part of my adult life either but this was the first gun that I'd help because it was presented to me\nIt was something that Charles was very proud of and it was also presented me in such a way that you might present a plaque or a trophy or an heirloom like\nI'm a huge football fan right so if I had a football that with autographed by Bob Stoops decent white sand Bradford I Would present in much the same way and that's how\nIt came off

author of the new memoir titled\nLed bang a young black man's reluctant odyssey into guns and we have a a excerpt of that book at our website on point radio\nDot org and in our gate and just just before the break you were telling us about your your first experience and it's of this massive gun show\nIn in Tulsa, Oklahoma uh but ... there's so much detail that you write about the justice one experience we could spend the whole hour talking about it um but I but I Want to just kind of fast forward to the key moment here is that\nA is that Charles your your uh your one time father in law are uh he ended up actually buying you know at the un chosen that right\nYeah and I think\nWhat people don't take from that is that where I'm from Oklahoma guns or a way of life and not always for the reasons that we might think were the reasons that we might read about they are integral to the way that fathers\nGet to know their son yeah and in some instances when you're much younger that father might buy you a twenty two rifles so you can\nGo on the Web it's a word you know squirrels or what have you and this was him doing something fatherly for me which was I mean my first gun\n... what kind of gun was it like twenty six color they block ... why did you choose that one because I was interested in self defense\nAs much as any other part of marketing ship came later but at that moment you know we're talking about curing we're talking about firing weapon we're talking about understanding what lethal force is we're talking about um\nThe mechanics of self defense shooting up since the shooting a and we're talking about why some people had been gun buying firearms and a even as far back as twenty seven twenty twelve\nAnd what that meant that was where many of the conversations that I was having I Will not having conversations about shooting better than any ugly I was having conversations about staying alive\nOkay so what was so what was these are conversations you're having with Charles yes\nYeah so what was he telling you about why what was his his thoughts about why some people were buying firearms in twenty ten twenty eleven\nPeople want to protect what's there's people\nFeel that that is their right and it is I mean we have laws that say this and people are very very interested and letting everyone else no if you come over here you might not walk away and that for many is a deterrent\nUh-huh\n[noise] I I mean I guess one thing I was wondering is um ... uh just before a un after President Obama was first elected we saw a a surgeon gun sales did that ever enter the conversations with you and Charles\nOh yeah and also when I approached this topic with other folks um it was always a question of how much ammunition might cost right and this is the state where you can buy ammunition sporting goods store you know like we have\nAre called um [noise] at the time or academy sports and you can walk in there and buy any real caliber of handgun ammunition and how much of it people would buy a relates to who's president\nSo for instance now there's there's kind of a surplus in people can't really move firearms is as much as they could win a President Obama was in office because a lot of people still harbor to fear\nThat somehow the president was going to round up your guns and try to take them from you or limit the kind of firearm that you might be able to buy so you should buy this kind of salt right for this kind of handgun a and those while you know\nThe dishes were also real fears and I've always said this and I I Wish people would really take it to heart because I Do it does not matter\nIf what you believe in what someone else believes it matters that you believe that they believe it\nSo if someone tells you they're afraid take them at their word don't tell them to their face that they're wrong to irritate them and make them mad\nNow make there for your your fear and then walk through it you know walk walk that out and that's where I was trying to take this conversation or even before you know I I even thought that I might\nPistol and I we get stymied mostly for the reasons that we've already spoken about yeah\nYou know uh I was wondering if you might be able to read to us the section of the memoir where you talk about uh the day that you got home\nOr or ... or what what you did after you got home with that new clock that Charles your father in law had had purchased for you could you read that part of the demand more to us\n[noise] yes ma'am it's gotta lotta Oxford comma isn't it\nUm [noise] that day I got back home with my new gun still in its box set it on my bed and looked at it for some time I had an open to that the gun show I knew the gun inside the box and never been fired and I knew it was mine I didn't feel proud\nWhat I felt was something more like fear like the fear I was taught to have for the God of the Old Testament the being who was so much trouble he drowned the planet cast out a favorite son and told her father to murder his son to prove his love fear the way I was taught\nTo feel it as a black man trying to earn an education navigate among the police stay out of jail and stay alive I knew that the first time I lost respect for that pistol no larger than life just it could kill me or get me killed\nOpen the box and picked up the Gluck I was amazed at how intrude as it was the process of removing the empty magazine putting it back and wrecking the slide was it really that easy\nA person with a gun tends to feel a lot like Superman with X ray vision laser site and hope smash strength\nWhich is why telling that person to use those super powers will generally result in the person looking at you like your lunatic\nAppointed a gun at the blank white bedroom wall and my second storey apartment and squeezed feeling the hard click the trigger the soft tap the hammer and an empty chamber\nI put the gun back in its case knowing that next week the chamber would no longer be empty and that this bit of polymer plastic and metal would no longer be inexpensive paper wait what a weapon so lethal I Wish we could invent it\nIt's RJ young reading an excerpt of his new memoir let it bang a young black man's reluctance odyssey into guns\nAre gay I you know I Wonder if you could explain to folks who are listening to that that X or do you do you showed this deep respect for the power of the weapon in your hands uh some\nUh definitely conflicted feelings about having it at all so how is it that you got from that to being a certified NRA shooting instructor\n[noise] I got to a point in my journey that I wanted to answer one fundamental question that was present it to me over and over and over again as a truism the truism was\nA good guy with a gun is better than a bad guy with a gun and I put a question mark at the end of that statement and wanted to find out for myself if that was true and us yen countless rounds and trips to the gun\nRange to get good really really good light master Yoda ... this is how you use the force good\nYeah [noise] and and you did it\n... yeah yeah I did but use your heart rate when given ...\n[laughter] but you know I mean so the thing is is that you have\nYou just you you tell in the memoir and you're describing to us now how you know in order to connect with your ... your father in law and you're just owned passionate really throw yourself in understanding this culture that he's so much a part of the ... you become as you said like you you're pursuing a jet I Dream\nFollowing

resist\nIndivisible politics we'll broadcast from Tallahassee next time around here and now tomorrow\nAt noon Ninety nine WVU are Boston nprmontagne [noise]\n\nOn point I'm making it took her body we're speaking this hour with RJ young he's author of the new memoir let it bang a young black man's reluctance odyssey\nInto guns and arcane just before the break we heard Douglas Jefferson their vice president of the national African American gun association I I'm just what you thought of what he had to say that ... that there is a multi ... there were a bunch of reasons why the association was formed\nOur for self protection amongst African Americans and he was also talking about trying to get the word out about a African Americans and gun history in America\nYeah and I got the profile dug for the book and so that was cool and heard his voice in quite some time it's been on tape but that's that's the message messages there is a responsible way to use this there are folks like myself\nWho believe that they should be armed for self defense and there is the historical aspect of\nGuns were taken from people who look like you and that is not something that you get to dismiss out of hand and I take that part a straight to the heart\nSo I'm just wondering I [noise] I\nI hear Douglas Jefferson saying that a lot of African Americans maybe there's increasing interest in gun ownership because of the concern about self protection and perhaps ... especially in recent years [noise]\nBut [noise] R D did you ever feel like you were actually potentially making yourself less safe by carrying a weapon especially open carry because of the fact of\nImplicit bias or racism in America and I mean I'm dancing around a question but I cannot help but to think of what happened to Philando Castile who was illegal gun owner in America and disclose to an officer that he had a weapon and was shot dead\nIn that incident speech more to what the NRA should have done in an opportunity for them to stand up for folks like ... and like Doug Jefferson and the people for which that organization represents but in regard to me\nI'm going to help me man a magnet let me\nLet let me let me break it down a I Walk into studio right where I'm a member chaos you shut up and I have on a Black Panther shirt it's got ... on it because that's what the movie's really about I have on a Black Panther ...\nWhat kinda stand up I wear jumper genes I wear Jordan's I have locks that are rated up if I have a nine millimeter Gluck Seventeen on my hip\nThat ain't gonna be the kind of thing that makes people at home and at ease and that has a lot to do with the way that I'm dressed and also has a lot to do with my skin color believe it or not um I Know people don't necessarily want to believe that but I still encounter rooms where I Am not welcome\nSo I don't get to go round is if that doesn't matter but I also don't get to go around as if a gun in a room\nIs not bigger than any elephant you can walk in there you're not going to have an open and honest conversation with someone if you know that they have a firearm because that is the threat of hurting you because they don't like what you have to say and that's not correct and that's not right but it is true it is a fear\nSo in the course of getting really good with a firearm I'm also a journalist and I am asking questions and I'm looking at data and I'm looking at statistics and I'm taking account of my own experience\nAnd what I come to find out is not only am I not safer I'm In more danger if I have a gun on my person and if I have a gun within reach\nHey I'm thinking about your former father in law Charles now did did you ever have did you ever tell them this that that the the very same\nDesire for self protection that made it made him such a firearms enthusiast or even if you shared that desire you actually felt less safe a\n... because of the fact of race in America when you had the weapon then before you didn't is that something that he he he understood\nLater later as we continue to go through this and later as I had my credentials as I had a standing firm which do you have to continue this discussion like we had spoken about I hadn't fired a gun but I also was able to outline this in the book\nWith a use of force attorney here in Oklahoma and he had a similar discussion with a friend of his uh his attorney was white his friend is black and his friend who he was\nReally respect for for ... and was reading about said hey man when I get pulled over and you get pulled over it's just different and I don't need you to tell me that it's not I don't need you to tell me that people should not\nJudge me by the color of my skin I Need you to recognize that it does happen and to support me in a way you can support me is to speak up for me and the rooms that I'm not in that I'm not allowed in that I might not ever walk into and I thought that was where I got to with Charles I could see that toward the end\nWell our Jay hang on here for just a second so many interesting people about this conversation or or or about this issue I should say\nI Want to bring in one more voice Tiffany where joins us now she is joining us from Cincinnati, Ohio and she's founder of the brown girls project to a group that offers makeup workshops and other activities for building self is\nTraining classes for African American women Tiffany where welcome to appoint\nHello hello hello thank you from me\nSo so how long have you been a gun owner and and teaching the organizing firearms classes\nI'm organizing the fire on classes and side December twenty six ... a couple of years I'm owning one for about a year\nOkay and so and before that and guns and your family\nI'm not really a I have a grandfather from ... Georgia so he's a hunter um so you know he uh oh shot gun that he kept in the house the at five dollars and two granddaughters and we knew that what that one but there was a trainee no interacting with it\nI see so what what uh what was the reason it took you to buy a gun\n[noise] um actually it it it was the new\nI don't want to say new but this heightened racial climate in the area that I live in um that made me say I need to be able to protect myself and as a single mother be able to protect my children um during the Trump campaigning at\nMy children were very very\nUm tuned in to what was happening but have a new uh politics and they were able to feel the tension drive as well um and they were very concerned\nAnd when a Trump gotten off as my son who was Fifteen at the time was very emotional about it and he he was concerned\nNow what was going to happen to us people were being I'm feeling okay to be more aggressive to say things that they didn't say before\nWho are either they invade your your personal space and he'd heard all these stories what if somebody does something to us and him being you know I have a son and daughter and then it myself you've got to go I have to protect you that and I'm like no wait a that's my job and then I thought about it like how would I really like that\nDo do you ... I'm ... I'm Sorry I didn't I didn't mean to interrupt there but do you really\nYou feel now that having a gun has made you and your family safer\n[noise] um [noise] I feel protected I feel that if someone crosses my threshold I have something other than my fifth and iron to throw\n'em I feel that at night when my kids were coming home for extra curricular activities and the seasons change and it's gotten darker um if someone were to approach it I definitely feel like I'm I can handle myself and and make my kids safe\nYeah uh ... what do you what do you have to say the Tiffany 'cause I I I hear her and I hear the voice of someone who feels\nThat ah that the places that we usually look for protection in society\nGovernment law enforcement et cetera than our fellow citizens that there was a failure there which is why she felt like she she needed to to buy a firearm a to protect her and her kids\nThat perhaps a sense of society feeling us is also a reason why a lot of white gun owners buy a gun and it just to me feels understand Tiffany's desire of course every parent wants to protect their child but it feels like we've we've all we're all feeling each other if we're turning to weapons\nAs a means it means for protection\nI had this very discussion I'm with my girlfriend here recently who is in charge of a five year old and a three year old both girls and she's a single mom so yeah she's going to do everything in her power\nW.

incidences of some in some cases extreme incidences of alleged pregnancy discrimination and what happened and why that series was co reported by Jessica silver Greenberg and Natalie ... and they they joined us today and we also want to hear from\nFrom you do you think that were placed accommodations for expecting mothers have gotten better in the forty years since the first law about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace was passed did you ask recombination from your employer uh and got them or were you even afraid to ask concerned about whether or not I'm\nHaving your work changed because of your pregnancy it might affect your job or possibly even lead\nTo your dismissal were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five this eight hundred for two three talk also want to hear from employers about uh the situation from from your point of view if you're an employer how much combination can you make and what are the realistic concerns that employers have about the limits too accommodating employees during pregnancy again what eight hundred\nForty three eight to five five\nNow I just want to play a little tape for you because there are a lot of stories out there you're going to hear from Heather Myers she was working at a Wal Mart in Kansas and two thousand six when she discovered she was pregnant she talked to NPR in twenty fourteen about it\nAnd she said that while her doctor had recommended that she keep a water bottle with her on the wall Mart sales for\nHer supervisor did not approve so Myers went back to her doctor and got a note to give to a supervisor\nSaid I'm Sorry that we can't accept your doctor's no because we have\nWater I don't see the kids you have the water fountains available to you\nI was just a little shocked that this water bottle is kind of becoming this big deal and they read and scrutinizing my doctor I decided to go against what my supervisor suggested and listened to my doctor and to my body\nAnd decided to keep the water bottle and one day that they provide your came up to me and she said either the water bottle has to go or you'd have to go\nThat's Heather Myers she spoke with NPR in two thousand fourteen now just because silver Greenberg ... ah in the course of your reporting\nHow did you were you surprised by um the number of stories that you've found or was it still difficult to get women to come forward to talk about discrimination that they felt they had experience in the workplace while they were pregnant\nSo I think we were surprised when we first started reporting this story by just how common experience was when you start something like this we had been looking for something that might be impacting women the way that me too\nHas and we were shocked at the outpouring of\nSort of very similar\nAll the way up and down the economic ladder and blue collar jobs in low wage jobs in office jobs for this most recent story and miscarriage I can say that uh we went to Texas together I mean to Texas to to Memphis together um\nAnd uh we had\nTo in many cases go back to the same women over and over and over again and really gain their trust because what we were talking about here was one of the most personal and devastating experiences of their life\nSo in the case of a miscarriage or really deeply affecting health experience it was difficult to get people to talk to us yeah and and I imagine the the extreme difficulty that the women who were you know ultimately willing to speak to you\nThat there are extreme difficulty with compounded by the fact that I Would guess almost all of them really needed the jobs they were in right it wasn't as if they had\nA the freedom or the means to just say okay well if you're not going to accommodate me I'll go find another employer\nRight and they also needed the health insurance that came with those jobs they were there ... yeah\nExactly um so it was a paycheck and it was also health insurance and again just and I talk to people who were still working at the warehouse so these are folks who are at again great personal risk\nComing forward to tell their stories um when you know it could risk their job\nRight now I Want to get to the bigger picture here but it but I should note that uh the the warehouse company that use that many of these women are all the women in their ... ... your second story most of them that where they work\nDid the company not also see that the dispute the allegations because of uh currently do their attempts to unionize uh employees at the warehouse\nYes they they did say that they said that um they said they believe that these allegations were\nManufactured drummed out an exaggerated by the Teamsters Union which is currently trying to organize a the warehouse what we found so there's a couple of points to kind of mentioned yeah\nNone of so with the exception of one woman's\nI'm Tasha morale who ultimately left to the warehouse on and has become an an organizer with the Teamsters none of the women were affiliated with the union at all so none of the women who use their names were affiliated with the union at all and\nYou have to put the denial 'em by X piano and pointing to the teen stars in a broader context which is they made a lot of denials some of which we included on the record so\nWe and it comes down to a pretty basic I'm a pretty basic set of disputed facts so for instance\nWe describes the warehouse at the beginning of the story as ... and window is they just beat the company disputed the description of window is pointing out that while the warehouse has no exterior windows it has a number of interior windows\nSo they don't ... the sunlight or daylight there just inside the building\nRight there are windows that I'm I'm not exactly sure what interior windows they're describing I Believe that those exist but when you're when you're evaluating the credibility of a statement I think you need and the credibility of denial I Do think you have to look at the facts that they are disputing that are smaller than\nSay you know whether or not a woman had a miscarriage on the floor\nI mean I'm sitting in a radio studio right now there's an interior window I can see out into the hallway of our radio station but\nYes I I'm In a similar to the eyes you can also see hot into a into a room okay I'm In is working\nSo you know what I Want to get into sort of the uh the legal framework that all of this is going on in you know across the country here and just a minute with both of you Jessica ... but we have a lot of callers who want to join us let me just let's get some of their stories and if I can so let's go to Joanna who's calling from Edmond, Oklahoma during a year on the air\nYes Hi Hi go ahead [noise]\nUm well my experience was I just wanted to kind of share because it hit home um I was working for oil and gas about six years ago when I became pregnant with our first son\nAnd um because I was I'm a private contractor I couldn't well I wasn't fired but I was let go as soon as it I'm kind of became known that I was pregnant and um\nI guess the only the biggest thing was it was the only other girl and the woman in the office was the only one to help me bring my chair down like two or three ... three stories as well as all my other things and all these other\nUsed her workers like a friend level on that level\nIt it didn't prove to be and it just makes me so sad that actually I just saw that friend of mine and she's pregnant and she's now an attorney a title attorney and she's having the same problems and so it's still very relevant and I don't know if it's just oil and gas the good old boy kind of thing but\nMore information is available at a U.

talking about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace today and the New York times recently had a special investigative series on this topic it was reported by Jessica silver Greenberg and Natalie ... joined us today\nFrom New York I'm also joined by Joan Williams she's a professor of law at the University of California Hastings and director of the center for work life law\nThere and let's go to the to the phones once again and take a call from ... who's calling from Fort Mill South Carolina Lee you're on the air\nI I figured I could be the same token male I was a nurse or Fifteen Years working in a profession that is only three to four percent male wanted three of the people that you've had speak each one of them went beyond accommodation which\nOf a disability however temporary\nTo a plea for preferential treatment on specifically talking about one of the ladies\nWho mentioned that people didn't understand she had children and that they assigned her shift that could have been assigned to the child was the single but that they didn't accommodate that she had children\nThat goes way beyond any workplace accommodation I was also a paralegal for one worker's comp and then\nIf there are there's a lot of requests for understanding in a situation in which accommodating\nPhysical disability which is simply simplifies ... aren't being pregnant\nIs I've stood on fours on watch and it's one thing to say well you don't have to do X Y or Z because you're having morning sickness or accommodating some you know they're going to come get me when I was a male nurse like pick somebody up didn't matter just because she weighs Ninety eight pounds\nShe can't lift like I can get some of those are simple mhm when you start moving into it you shouldn't have to work nights they ... on the single people don't have children that's a different basis for outright discrimination\nYeah Lee I I sure you actually and I I Want to turn your a call back to our guest here but at least call actually makes me think um and Joe Millionaire turn this to you but a least call makes me think of the two thousand Fifteen Supreme Court case a young versus UPS\nOr and give me a second here to set this up right because I think it was the last time or one of the more recent times that uh that we as a nation sort of talked about actively about a pregnancy in the workplace so this is when a a UPS driver Peggy young doctors said she shouldn't be lifting heavy packages because it put her at risk of miscarriage\nA so she was told to stay home a meaning she lost her medical coverage and so she sued UPS the case went all the way it is up to the Supreme Court and then a twenty fourteen interview with MSNBC Peggy young described what happened\nTo the doctor and got into it with my restrictions and I turned out and and basically they said you know we don't have I live day for paying I think I'll honk ...\nAs you say in two thousand Fifteen the Supreme Court actually ruled in her favor six three in her favor but generally is my question comes to you because I was looking at the dissent in that Supreme Court case it was written by Justice Scalia\nOr it's a really interesting descent and I think leaves call echoes a lot of what Justice Scalia said back then he he wrote for example that\nProhibiting employers from making any distinctions between pregnant workers and others have similar ability would elevate pregnant workers to most favorite employees and then it gives an example theoretically if Boeing offered chauffeur's to injure directors that would have to offer to first a pregnant mechanics\nAnd if Disney paid pensions to workers who can no longer work because of old age it would have to pay pensions to workers who cannot work because of childbirth so it's he said it's impossible but current federal law\nWhich elsewhere creates a guarantee of equal treatment here alone creates a guaranteed a fever treatment what do you think about that\nUm well that's not true I'm Lee does have a good point on its nights\nUm two Everytime you have an undesirable shift to give it to somebody who's single doesn't have to wear it doesn't have kids in order to accommodate parents\nOn the other hand um that's not typically that discrimination in the workplace is very very strong against pregnant women and mothers on and the um the the fact is there a lot of situations for example someone with diabetes\nTo take breaks to eat well somebody who is extremely nauseated because a pregnancy needs to take breaks to eat what's the difference\nAnd what we have seen is that employers to accommodate the person with diabetes often don't accommodate the person I'm with a with the pregnancy\nAnd blue collar contacts and I think about what Joanna said\nShe said we can do the work I remember reading of one woman saying oh I can do the work it's the men I Can't take and that's exactly what Joe in thing um that often and blue collar contexts women can do the work but the employer my sense in reading hundreds of these cases\nIs um the employer didn't want to hire these women and the first place and so I figure it's great I'm just going to wait until they're pregnant then I can force them out on the eve and fire them and that's what the young versus UPS decision a began to put an end to\n... know Jessica silver Greenberg and Natalie ... how there there have been attempts though since at least twenty twelve right to provide some kind of upgraded modernization of laws around pregnancy in the workplace\nThere there have been um so Jones mentioned the pregnant workers Fairness Act you know and that's been a kind of center piece of um efforts to\nStrengthen the federal law and filling the gaps that the that exist in the pregnancy discrimination that there's been effort since so every congressional sessions since twenty twelve\nUm lawmakers have introduced to the pregnant workers Fairness Act so far it has not made it out of committee so it has not made it out of the\nUm help committee which stands for house and labor and pensions\nI'm not going to ... ... terms right but um it's never had a hearing and um it has bipartisan support it now has bipartisan support I'm kind of not ironically but interestingly the chairman of that committee Lamar Alexander\nI'm he's home state is um where ex PO a where that X. P. O. warehouses made of Tennessee\nAnd and so you're saying that it hasn't actually sort of advance to any ... you'd have there's never even advance to a voter debate\nIt's never been put on the floor no you're right it's never it's never had a a hearing\nOkay so Joan Williams let me just hop back to you here I mean is what you see uh in in in this proposal even if it's not going anywhere in Congress yet is it taking us in the right direction\nIt's taken us in the right direction and in fact somebody like twenty two states already have similar provisions there should be a national law that says I'm ... workers you're sometimes women women sometimes get pregnant and you have to accommodate them when they do\nAnd the other hand I think it's really important to recognize that pregnant women already do have sweeping rights and they actually have rights\nEven if the employer has accommodated nobody else\nI'm potentially under the Americans with Disabilities Act so\nAny pregnant worker who was in a situation like those described in the article or listening on please go to pregnant at work to to ensure that you can exercise the legal rights that you have because pregnant workers already have a lot of rights under existing law\nThat doesn't mean we don't need a new law because situation is very complicated to simplify it for employers and employees\nSo just go to Natalie though I Wonder I mean you spoke just so many women are in the process of reporting this story even with what Joan Williams just said that the ADA might cover a lot of women in in the accommodations they could need while pregnant\nI imagine that you rented to folks who were saying well I'm of hesitant to ask\nBecause of how my employer might see me I'm hesitant in terms of I don't want them to ah to reduce my pay or limit my future advancement or just did it would change sort of how they're seen in the workplace which then could have a future effects even after their children are born so\nRight so the women that we talk to 'em were overwhelmingly women who as you point out magna there in a jobs that they need desperately they're making close to minimum wage they have very little resources\nW.

E.\nShot [noise]\nIs on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about the Trump Administration signaling its desire to pull the U.S out of the INS treaty that the Cold War era treaty\nThat limited or ended the use of me medium range of middle range land based nuclear missiles and we're speaking today with just ... he's president of Ploughshares Fund a foundation focused on nuclear weapons policy and conflict resolution\nIt himself about why he wants to do this here's President Trump after a rally in Elkhart County Nevada on Saturday telling reporters that he's ready to pull out of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty or as we've been taught calling it the I. N. F. treaty\nWith Russia China was and they all got to do is they say let's really get smart let's none of us develop those less Russia's doing is China's doing is we're hearing today agreement unacceptable\nSo president Donald Trump's they're saying that maybe we can and proliferation of Russia China in the U.S all come together and desire to stop it\nHere's national security adviser John Bolton during a press conference in Moscow yesterday where he met Russian President Vladimir ... and both said there's just one point on which Russia and the U.S agreed\nThat other countries with nuclear arsenal in the world aren't restricted by the INS it's a bilateral agreement between the United states and Russia and that's a problem\nSo there's a new strategic reality half there this was a Cold War five lateral ballistic missile related treaty in a multi polar\nI think on this latter point of the for half of global a strategic environment for something that concerns the Russians a very substantial and we talked about\n... how do you react to what you just heard John Bolton say\nJohn Bolton is on a mission to kill all arms control agreements he believes in a world of power and might of\nA world of us dominance he believes that these kinds of treaties with strict military the military power the United states he wants a world where there are no restraints whatsoever on US military ... freedom of action he seems to have convinced\nA Donald Trump to ... to follow the course of action that fear of our allies the fear of many national security experts around the world than just you you take down this treaty which is working but just in place which is restricted the arms race in Europe than the next on his target list is the start treaty that had reduced\nOr the U.S and Soviet arsons not rushing arsenals\nBy over fifty percent and if you take a nap will bent toppled that seems to be his goal and then you for the rest of the entire non proliferation\nTreaty regime in other words all the rules of the road that Republicans and Democrats liberals and conservatives have built up over the last forty fifty years would come tumbling down and it's a a dog eat dog nuclear world that\nIs a road instability and war\nSo I mean we have seen though uh for at least a year now that America's nuclear arsenal\nOr the ... for it to play a bigger role in the in the defense of the nation I mean I was looking at the the most recent nuclear posture review and it's and and it talks about these exact risks that that's a\nBit of Russia or China of a ... a a non bilateral world here and that in order to counter\nOr these other countries that are that are enhancing and modernizing their nuclear arsenals that the Pentagon and the national Security Council say well the United states must do the same thing so I'm just wondering I mean earlier you you were saying that that stepping out are pulling out of the INS though\nYou say America loses some leverage them to over Russia I didn't quite understand how\nAbsolutely look the first thing you do when you want to build new weapons inflate the threat is provide some justification for why you need even more than the thousands of nuclear weapons are already have\nAnd in this case it did Bolton is pulling out an old trek he's he's using a technical violation to kill the whole treaty that he disagrees with for ideological grounds what are we talking about here we're talking about the Russians who are modified an existing weapon to give you a greater range larger fuel tank\nAnd they put a few of them and one of their test sites and European Russia and apparently in one of the site\nWe're talking about a handful of weapons that are technically in violation and we've been detecting this is about twenty four chain\nThere are mechanisms for dealing with these kinds of violations they happen frequently and arms control treaty their resolution measures but instead of fixing it\nInstead of enforcing it instead of going and insisting that they take those weapons down he's killing the whole mechanism if somebody breaks into your house that's a violation of the laws against burglary you don't like repeal the burglary laws you enforce them\nBy repealing this treaty you're allowing pollutant to do whatever he wants now there'll be no restraint on him deploying weapons whatever kind do you want\nIn Europe and here's the really bad part\nIt's unlikely that we can match it of course for us to put these ground based systems in Europe we'd have to have a country that watch them but no European ally wants them yes why you're seeing howls of complaint\nFrom France from from Germany from the European Union who warn that you're taking down and these are the words a pillar of European security no one needs a new arms race as the foreign minister of the European Union\nAre among among others that's what they're afraid of that Trump is citing an arms race\nMorning as both the U.S and Russia are building other nuclear arms and now they're afraid to Europe or once again be the battleground for these two nuclear giants battle\nRight I mean Europe is signaling as loudly as it can it's discomfort with the possibility of an end of the IMF treaty I mean I'm seeing here the sigma Gabriel who just stepped down in March of German foreign minister this week said that the demise of the IMF\nThreatens to quote again turn us in central Europe and here in Germany into a venue of nuclear\nMadness I mean we should recall that in ... at one time a million Germans marched against nuclear war a weaponry and Europe which is one of the things that led to a the the INS to begin with now just hurts you and I know you have a lot more to say but I Want to welcome in one more uh ... voice into this conversation Evelyn focus joins us now she joined us today from Washington\nShe's a fellow at the Atlantic council future Europe initiative Eurasia center and the ... Center for strategy and security she also served from two thousand twelve to twenty Fifteen in the Obama administration\nAs deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia Ukraine and Eurasia\nAnd one fourth is welcome to you thank you magnify great to be here so I'm very eager to hear your take on this given your experience here do you think the Trump Administration is a is doing is on the right track here in terms of its desire to pull out of the INS well\n... unfortunately I don't really see\nA better option right now because the Russians essentially put our back to the wall this is really like going back to Nineteen eighty seven where\nActually our European allies the Germans asked us to step in and counter the Russian short short range or medium range missiles that were deployed and threatening Europe at the time\nWith our own missiles so in that case the Europeans wanted us to help them out and President Reagan did so but did so\nI think ... largely in a way that he was able to use it to negotiate the Russians\nOut of their own missiles and that's how we got the intermediate nuclear forces treaty\nAnd I having been in the administration [laughter]\nI Know that we tried very hard to confront the Russians to convince the Russians um to do what we could using words to deter them from continuing to violate the agreement but they did not stop\n'em as you noted in the beginning this has been public since two thousand fourteen I'm the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff testified openly that the Russians have deployed this capability these missiles and\nSo what are we going to do I think that for the U.S government the best option unfortunately at this point is to do what we did in eighty seven which is to threaten to counter so the burglars burglar at us\nWe then send another burglar outside of their house have that burglar stand there and say if you don't stop we're going to send our burger and\nThe problem is the way I think the Trump Administration went about it that doesn't sound like they consulted it doesn't sound like they had a plan that included our NATO allies\nUm or or the issue of how to deal with the Asian theater so that's that's the issue I think today\nWell I wouldn't focus a couple of quick questions here um you first of all you heard Joe ... just a few minutes ago saying that he sees the way to counter the

and we're joined today by Evelyn ... she's a fellow at the Atlantic council future Europe initiative\nAnd also served from two thousand twelve to two thousand Fifteen and the Obama administration as deputy assistant secretary of defense\nFor Russia Ukraine and Eurasia Joe certain cod joined us as well he's president of Ploughshares Fund a foundation focused on nuclear weapons policy and conflict resolution and Evelyn and Joe if I may we've had a lot of patient colors waiting so let me just get to some of them right now Calvin\nIs calling from Charleston, Missouri Calvin you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call um I Am a former well better Thirty Years' old African American\nAs far as the U.S goes as far as our our military and our nuclear arms basically are on I think\nThe way President Trump went about it is not necessarily the right way but I Do think he's going to go right I'm as your first got there you know a lot of the\n... went to a lot of people for too long and a lot of the the President Trump has done has shown no food no longer\nTake this role on the global stage for is all but instead of the nation that is or like\nLack of better words I think we've been to sleep in the military teachers that they all got all the way because when you fall asleep at the yearly attacks or break like Russia's I think he's doing the right thing we can be asleep or I watch as far as our allies are on the issue though we have\nYou know right now I feel like we're behind the eight ball Russia is I\nCan't even take back from there and thank you so much for your call let's go to Margaret who's calling from ... Virginia Margaret you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call I find the whole idea of pulling out of yet another nuclear\nA treaty buying and logical to think that once we get out of it and we increase our production of nuclear weapons [laughter] it's just going to make the safer we already have more than seven thousand new believe\nAnd I don't see how the idea of increasing that number is going to make the world and they said for we have enough to destroy the world many times over already it's only a bone in my opinion to the war industry\nMargaret thank you so much for your call Evelyn how would you like to respond to Margaret um well first to um ... and if I could just quickly um I Do agree that we need to be\nFrom with our adversaries and\nI guess my thinking with regard to this move is that it's a deterrent move and hopefully move that will ultimately strength and arms control because\nI'm going to right now give the administration that chance I'm not going to assume that John Bolton has the lead and we're going to tear up the treaty entirely and we're going to drop all nuclear talks oh I'm maybe a little bit giving them too much benefit of the doubt that that's where I Am\nI Do however disagree with President Trump's approach to the allies and again as I said before we have to be more collaborative with our friends and from these heavier enemies through gotcha Margaret's point I agree I mean I Do not think we should be wasting money on developing nuclear weapons that we don't need\nAnd that's the whole point of being from and standing up to the Russians and getting them to\nStep back and think about what they're doing 'cause this is also part of the bigger picture which has to do with Russia's military doctrine there over reliance on nuclear weapons as part of their war strategy\nNow which I think is highly alarming and you could have a whole nother show on that\nJust during the only way to turn back to you here because of course uh we we could also continue to spend the rest of the hour talking about Russia and we will return to it but China has been lurking here uh a as a major part of why President Trump says he wants to pull out of the I N F here I mean I'm I'm seeing that part of the thinking is that\nFor ... were the U.S has constrained by the ins and not able to\nDeploy strategic weaponry in the in the Asia theater as Evelyn pointed out earlier\nBecause of this and that that's putting us ... Kelvin term behind the eight ball in Asia\nYou always have to be very careful when you hear people who are who want new nuclear weapons in the language they use so John Bolton says you know an out outmoded treaty violation ignored were constrained\nAnd so you know it feeds into that feeling that we're ... we're the suckers and the other countries are stealing a march on us as one of your callers pointed out we have a six thousand five hundred and fifty nuclear weapons that is about a several hundred times more weapons and you need to destroy every\nHuman being on the face of the earth we have plenty of nuclear weapons and you don't want to fall into the trap\nOf nuclear war planters planners who who see this or some kind of board game where you have to match piece for peace so on China what they're talking about is the China a land power doesn't have much of a navy doesn't have much of a\nAn air force that can reach beyond us borders they have new for now [laughter] okay for now they they they have\nA nuclear weapons or about about two hundred three hundred so nuclear weapons compared to a seven thousand and their land based and they can reach targets like Japan like we're like one or in like the United states have about forty that can reach us\nAnd we don't necessarily have those we don't have those ground based missiles that match their capability exactly and that's what they mean by were constrained you know where the treaty stops us from building those but we have see based missile reach them just [noise]\nWe have strategic submarine surprised the ocean second which just fine in other words we have dozens of nuclear weapons\n... that can hit them for every one they have the can hit us we don't need to match 'em and here's the other off underlying realities of their ... does nobody you know one of our allies want these weapons Japan just yesterday said that\nThey do not want us to pull out of the IMF treaty they don't they're not looking for us to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan which is one of the places you would do to deploy them if you want to match up\nWell everyone versus a ... I think the the deeper one of the deepest points that Joe is making here uh it's worthy of of some of this discussion here further discussion because\nIn and I think he's right that that there is\nA sense when you hear I'm certain members of the administration talk now that the United states is weaker than it actually is I mean what's your response to to Joe's point that what there is no need for land based I'm intermediate range missiles when we have such a a overpowering sea bass nuclear arsenal that we could use\nNo one wants us to use them but that that are there for a for U.S Strategic purposes in the Asia theater\n[noise] well I mean I I have to confess here I'm not a military planner so I it's a little bit out of my week to say definitively that we don't need those weapons um I Will say however that it is true that\nOur president and I wouldn't say members of his administration necessarily better president does speak of America is that for a declining power as if we're not the the strongest military power on the globe right now the strongest diplomatic power at least potentially were squandering that every day\nUm and of course still the strongest economic power so I Do think it's worth bearing in mind that we do have the upper hand and the reason the Russians are developing the capabilities that they're developing has to do with the fact that they can't go head to head with us or the Chinese they have to develop asymmetric means\nAnd I think the real issue here has to do with Russia has\nThe feeling of vulnerability the lack of what they call strategic stability in our defense relationship\nAnd their desire to do something to correct that and I think this administration needs to sit down and have some real\nBlonde conversations with the Russians about the state of our defense relationship about the various dangerous asymmetric asymmetric things the Russians are doing to try to get an edge on us like developing missiles not just these missiles but other missiles um like their cyber\nCapabilities the fact that they have inserted a boss or other um cyber weapons into our energy grid that they could activate in time of war if necessary things like that are actually\nAnd streaming or W.

Bertie we're talking about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace there was a special New York times investigative series that took a look into\nA incidences of some some in some cases extreme incidents of alleged pregnancy discrimination and what happened and why that series was co reported by Jessica silver Greenberg and ... and they they\nHere from from you do you think that's a workplace accommodations for expecting mothers have gotten better in the forty years since the first law about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace was passed did you ask for combinations from your employer uh and got them\nOr were you even afraid to ask concerned about whether or not I'm\nHaving your work changed because of your pregnancy might affect your job or possibly even lead\nTo your dismissal were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk also want to hear from employers about uh the situation from from your point of view\nIf you're an employer how much combination can you make and what are the realistic concerns that employers have about the limits too accommodating uh employees during pregnancy again where it eight hundred for two or three to five five\nNow I just want to play a little tape for you because there are a lot of stories out there you're going to hear from Heather Myers she was working at a Wal Mart in Kansas in two thousand six when she discovered she was pregnant\nShe talked to NPR in twenty fourteen about it and she said that while her doctor had recommended that she keep a water bottle with her on the wall Mart sales for\nHer supervisor did not approve so Myers went back to her doctor and got a note to give to her supervisor\nShe said I'm Sorry that we can't accept your doctor's no because we have water I don't see because you have the water fountains available to you\nI was just a little shocked that this water bottle is kind of becoming this big deal and they read and scrutinizing my doctor isn't it I decided to go against what my supervisor suggested and listen to my doctor and to my body\nAnd decided to keep the water bottle and one day that they provide your came up to me and she said either the water bottle has to go or you'd have to go\nThat's how they're Myers she spoke with NPR in two thousand fourteen now just silver Greenberg and Natalie ... ah in the course of your reporting\nHow did you were you surprised by um the number of stories that you found or was it still difficult to get women to come forward to talk about discrimination that they felt they had experience in the workplace while they were pregnant\nSo I think\nWe were surprised when we first started reporting this story by just how common just experience was when you start something like this we had been looking for something that might be impacting women the wave at me to\nHave and we were shocked at the outpouring of\nSort of very similar experiences from women all the way up and down the economic ladder and blue collar jobs in low wage jobs in office jobs for this most recent story and miscarriage\nI can say that uh we went to Texas together I mean to Texas to to Memphis together um\nAnd uh we had\nTo in many cases go back to the same women over and over and over again and really gain their trust because what we were talking about here was one of the most personal and devastating experiences of their life\nSo in the case of a miscarriage or really deeply affecting health experience it was difficult to get people to talk to us yeah\nAnd and I imagine that the extreme difficulty that the women who were you know ultimately willing to speak to you that there are extreme difficulty was compounded by the fact that I Would guess almost all of them really needed the jobs they were in right it wasn't as if they had\nA the freedom or the means to just say okay well if you're not going to accommodate me I'll go find another employer\nRight and they also needed the health insurance that came with those jobs they were there ... yeah\nExactly um so it was a paycheck and I was also health insurance and again just and I talk to people who were still working at the warehouse so these are folks who are at again great personal risk\nComing forward to tell their stories um when you know it could risk their job\nRight now I Want to get to the bigger picture here but it but I should note that uh the the warehouse company that use that many of these women or all the women in their ... major second story most of them that where they work\nDid the company not also said that the dispute the allegations because of uh currently their their attempts to unionize uh employees at the warehouse\n... yes I think they did say that they said that um they said they believed that these allegations were\nManufactured drummed up an exaggerated by the Teamsters Union which is currently trying to organize a the warehouse what we found so there's a couple of points to kind of mentioned that\nNone of so with the exception of one\nOh who ultimately left the warehouse and has become an an organizer with the Teamsters none of the women were affiliated with the union at all so none of the women who use their names were affiliated with the union at all and\nYou have to put the denial 'em by X piano and pointing to the Teamsters in a broader context which is they made a lot of denials some of which we included on the record so\nWe and it comes down to a pretty basic I'm a pretty basic set of\nDisputed facts so for instance we describes the warehouse at the beginning of the story and ... and window is they just eat the company disputed the description of window is pointing out that\nWhile the warehouse has no exterior windows it has a number of interior windows\nSo they don't usually see sunlight or do they are just inside the building\nRight there are windows that I'm I'm not exactly sure what interior windows they're describing I Believe that those exist but when you're when you're evaluating the credibility of a statement I think you need and the credibility of a denial I Do think you have to look at the facts that they are disputing that are smaller than\nShame you know whether or not a woman had a miscarriage on the floor\nI mean I'm sitting in a radio studio right now there's an interior window I can see out into the whole way of our radio station but\nYes I I'm In a similar studio I can also see hot into a into a room or a man is working\nSo you know what I Want to get into sort of the uh the legal framework that all of this is going on in you know across the country here and just a minute with both of you Jessica and Italy but we have a lot of callers who want to join us let me just let's get some of their stories and if I can so let's go to Joanna who's calling from Edmond, Oklahoma during a year on the air\nYes Hi Hi go ahead [noise]\nUm well my experience was I just wanted to kind of share because it hit home um I was working for oil and gas about six years ago when I became pregnant with our first son\nAnd um because I was I'm a private contractor I couldn't well I wasn't fired but I was let go as soon as it's I'm kind of became known that I was pregnant and um\nI guess the only the biggest thing was it was the only other girl and the woman in the office was the only one to help me bring my chair down like two or three ... three stories as well as all my other things\nAnd all these other men were just sitting there and what I thought were like at least coworkers like a friend level on that level\nIt it didn't prove to be and it just makes me so sad that actually I just saw that friend of mine and she's pregnant and she's now an attorney a title attorney and she's having the same problems and so it's still very relevant and I don't know if it's just oil and gas the good old boy kind of thing but\nI just really hope and pray that\nWell you know you see the day that men really want to look out for their women to help us\nWill do anything to do the work [laughter] you know\nYeah Joanna thank you so much for your call and thank you for sharing your story let's get another story and hear Erin is calling from Des Moines Iowa Aaron you're on the air\nHello Hi go ahead and\nAnd we'll schooling studios preschools who raised swelled with campuses in Washington DC in China

Yorker radio\nTonight at nine point nine WB you are Boston is NPR News station\nThis is on point I'm making a talker body we're talking about pregnancy discrimination in the\nWorkplace today and the New York times recently had a special investigative series on this topic it was reported by Jessica silver Greenberg ... joined us today from New York I'm also joined by June Williams she's a professor of law at the University of California Hastings and director of the center for work life law\nThere and let's go to the to the phones once again and take a call from ... who's calling from Fort Mill South Carolina we you're on the air\n\nI I figured I could be the same token male I was a nurse or Fifteen Years working in a profession that is only three to four percent male wanted three of the people that you speak each one of them went beyond accommodation which kind\nOf a disability however temporary to a plea for preferential treatment on specifically talking about one of the ladies who mentioned that people didn't understand she had children\nThat could have been assigned to the child was the single but the they did an accommodate achieve a ... a goes way beyond any workplace accommodation I was also a or a legal for one worker's comp and then\nThere there's a lot of requests for understanding in a situation in which accommodating physical disability which is simply simplifies Marge aren't getting pregnant\nIs on stood on fours on watch and it's one thing to say well you don't have to do X Y or Z because you're every morning it was or accommodating some you know they're going to come get me when I was a male nurse like somebody up didn't matter just because she weighs ... pounds\nShe can't live like a camp okay but some of those simple mhm when you start moving into it you shouldn't have to work nights this group on the single people don't have children that's a different basis for outright discrimination\nYeah Lee I assure you actually in and I I Want to turn your a call back to our guest here but at least call actually makes me think um and Joe Millionaire turn this to you but a least call makes me think of the two thousand Fifteen Supreme Court case a young versus UPS\nOr give me a second you to set this up right because I think it was the last time or one of the more recent times that uh that we as a nation sort of talked about actively about a pregnancy in the workplace so this is when a a UPS driver Peggy Young's doctors said she shouldn't be lifting heavy packages because it put her at risk of miscarriage\nAh so she was told to stay home I mean she lost her medical coverage and so she sued UPS the case went all the way it is up to the Supreme Court and in a twenty fourteen interview with MSNBC Peggy young described what happened\nTo the doctor and got into it with my restrictions and I turned out and and basically they said you know we don't provide lightning are paying a faith I'll honk along are pregnant\nAnd she was in two thousand Fifteen the Supreme Court actually ruled in her favor six three in her favor but Joe Williams my question comes to you because I was looking at the dissent in that Supreme Court case it was written by Justice Scalia\nOr some really interesting descent and I think leaves call echoes a lot of what Justice Scalia said back then he he wrote for example that\nProhibiting employers from making any distinctions between pregnant workers and others have similar ability would elevate pregnant workers to most favorite employees then he gives an example theoretically if Boeing offered chauffeur's to injure directors it would have to offer she refers to pregnant mechanics\nAnd if Disney paid pensions to workers who can no longer work because of old age it would have to pay pensions\nTo workers who cannot work because of childbirth which he says it's implausible that current federal law\nWhich elsewhere create the guarantees of equal treatment here alone creates a guarantee of seabird treatment what do you think about that [noise]\nUm well that's not true I'm ... ... does have a good point on it's not illegal but it's very bad practice um two Everytime you have an undesirable shift give it to somebody who's single who doesn't have or doesn't have kids in order to accommodate parents\nOn the other hand um that's not typically that discrimination in the workplace is very very strong against pregnant women and mothers\nOn and the um the the fact is there a lot of situations for example someone with diabetes\nNeeds to take breaks to eat well somebody who is extremely nauseated because a pregnancy needs to take breaks to eat what's the difference\nAnd what we have seen is that employers who accommodate the person with diabetes often don't accommodate the person I'm with a with a pregnancy\nAnd blue collar contacts and I think about what Joanna said she said we can do the work I remember reading of one woman thing uh I can do the work it's the men I Can't take and that's exactly what you know when I was saying\nUm that often and blue collar contexts women can do the work but the employer my sense and reading hundreds of these cases\nIs um the employer didn't want to hire these women and the first place and so I figure it's great I'm just going to wait until they're pregnant then I can force them out on the eve and fire them and that's what the young versus UPS decision um began to put an end to\n... know Jessica silver Greenberg and Natalie ... how there there have been attempts though since at least twenty twelve right to provide some kind of upgraded modernization of uh laws around pregnancy in the workplace\nThere there have been um so Jones mentioned the pregnant workers Fairness Act and that's been a kind of a centerpiece of um efforts to strengthen the federal law selling the ...\nCan see discrimination act there's been effort since so every congressional sessions twenty twelve\nUm lawmakers have introduced to the pregnant workers Fairness Act so far it has not made it out of committee so it has not made it out of the\nUm help committee which stands for health than labor and pensions\nI'm not going to ... ... right but um it's never had a hearing and um it has bipartisan support it now has bipartisan support I'm kind of not ironically but interestingly the chairman of that committee Lamar Alexander\nI'm he's home state is um where ex CEO or where that X. P. O. warehouses bases of Tennessee\nAnd and so you but you're saying that it hasn't actually sort of advance to any new it hasn't it never even advance to a voter debate\nIt's never been put on the floor and now it's your right it's never it's never had a a hearing\nOkay so Joan Williams let me just hop back to you here I mean is what you see uh in in in this proposal even if it's not going anywhere in Congress yet is it taking us in the right direction\nIt's taking us in the right direction and in fact something like twenty two states already have similar provisions there should be a national law that says um workers are sometimes women women sometimes get pregnant and you have to accommodate them when they do\nOn the other hand I think it's really important to recognize that pregnant women already do have sweeping rights and they actually have rights\nEven if the employer has accommodated nobody else\nI'm potentially under the Americans with Disabilities Act so\nAny pregnant worker who was in a situation like those described in the article or listening on please go to pregnant at work to to ensure that you can exercise the legal rights that you have because pregnant workers already have a lot of rights under existing law\nThat doesn't mean we don't need a new law because situation is very complicated to simplify it for employers and employees\nSome just get Natalie though I Wonder I mean you spoke to so many women are in the process of reporting this story even with what Joan Williams just said that the ADA might cover a lot of women in in the accommodations they could need a while pregnant\nI imagine that you ran into folks who are saying well I'm of hesitant to ask\nBecause of how my employer might see me I'm hesitant in terms of I don't want them to uh to reduce my pay or limit my future advancement or just that it would change sort of how they're seen in the workplace which then could have a future effects even after their children are\nBorn so right so the women that we talk to 'em were overwhelmingly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "24"}
