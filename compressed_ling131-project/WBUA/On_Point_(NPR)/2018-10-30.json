Michigan ... you're on the air\nThey grabbing the automatic now thank you a panel for taking time to meet today and I I wanted to bring up something here quickly because I Do live in a state of Michigan which obviously would read for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and\nYou know our neighbor one of the counties that helped Donald Trump won the election and I find too interesting thing or one interesting thing here in this day and then I have a question for you as well to um one thing I find interesting here in the state of Michigan is that there seems to be\nThis consensus of white is Donald Trump's economic policy going to be moving forward obviously it's heavy manufacturing state this is a state that kind of gone through with a lot of the the deregulation that Donald Trump had gone through the previous governor Rick Snyder but again he wasn't the kind of fiery personality that Donald Trump was and he was more so\nJust as a progressive guy who was in office there but I Want to ask you this question and in terms of\nYou know what does potentially what looked like in the state of Michigan to be a wave coming in a what the impact and what that leads on the state and local level here meaning for Donald Trump and the Republican Party in Michigan and twenty twenty you know this was one of the state the guy that was Dover\nAll there is a proposal ballot your that will potentially\nUm you know changed the district of the voting districts which could blend in favor the Democrats in this in in the house especially in the state of Michigan and so I find it to be a very perplexing yea which you know not many people seem to talk about when it comes to a battleground\nState Garrett actually thank you so much for your call Janet Hook what do you think I mean if if indeed there is sort of a a good democratic showing and twenty Eighteen Michigan could that have an impact on twenty twenty\nOh for sure and actually there if there's one state of consequence that that seems poised to have a ... it's probably Michigan it's only because\nUh the governor's race there is so clearly going in the Democrats' favor Gretchen which were Widmer seems to have a pretty sizable\nUm dance leading the polls and they're sort of miscellaneous house races down ballot the incumbent senator there I'm Debbie Stabenow ... is pretty safe for reelection\nUm and in Michigan as in the other Midwestern states that gave tempted margin that it was such a narrow margin ahead it doesn't take much to tip it against I'm up against President Trump and twenty twenty\nYeah and then and if it was asking uh it seems a question that he's hearing a lot in Michigan are is what are going to be the next steps for the president's economic policy in the next two years and how that might that have an impact on a ... on on Michigan on on Michigan and Michigan\nWorkers well it depends a lot on what happens with the terrorists that he opposed and imposed because it's just it's the economic impact of that is sort of uncertain and he alternates between\nA talking about imposing more ... more tariffs on the one hand or using them as a bargaining chip it probably um help stabilize the the\nNew NAFTA style agreement but um if there's one thing about Donald Trump in his policy that's safe to say it's I kinda don't know what's next\n... or or I'm not sure I'm not sure how many policies the president hold near and dear to his heart I mean I think\nIf it's if it's not working and you know there's two years before the next presidential election of\nIf something's not working you can just turn them do one eighty into All right we're going to we're going to do something else and when it comes to Michigan or just the presidential race the twenty twenty race in general I think a lot depends on who you who is the Democratic nominee and what is it the contrast between approaches and styles and in their view on the economy as well as\nHow people feel like the the country's headed in the right direction when we get that far\nRight you know and and I definitely understand how a twenty Eighteen and the midterms are connected to twenty twenty but my goodness we need to get through next week first of All right\nSo let's say let's go to Georgia because there's a bunch of really interesting races a happening down there and joining us now from Atlanta is Steven salaries political reporter for Georgia Public broadcasting we have\nA link to Stevens reporting on point radio dot org Steven welcome to the program Hi Meg Meg thanks for having me it's great to have you okay so I think the the big headline grabbing race in Georgia right now is that gubernatorial race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the current secretary of state\nFor Georgia what what's the latest polling show how close is this race\nWell it's a very close race there's also a libertarian candidate which matters because if either candidate doesn't get fifty percent plus one vote we couldn't be going to a December fourth run up and polls really have the two neck and neck and have for quite a while now\nAnd so really uh every vote counts and every person counts and by this point there aren't many voters that are undecided it's just whether they're going to decide to vote early or vote on election day okay\nSo this is then one of the reasons why I'm the news over the past several weeks around I'm voting rolls and purging voters from the rules has become such a big deal in\nA ... in Georgia because of course as I just mentioned Brian ... is the current secretary of state for for Georgia so I just want to hear a couple of pieces of sound from\nLast Tuesday's gubernatorial debate in Atlanta uh first of all we're going to hear from democratic candidates Stacey Abrams really a refuting a Brian camps that statement that he has not suppressed voters as secretary of state even though there have been reports that maybe some one hundred thousand Georgians have been purged from the rolls\nThis is a man who had someone who arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot key raided the offices of organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of suppression feed the narrative because that or suppression isn't only about blocking a vote it's also about creating an atmosphere\nOf fear making people worried that their votes don't count\nWell at that gubernatorial debate Republican candidate secretary of state Brian Kemp said that he has quote absolutely not suppressed minority voters\nVoters should look at the numbers and know that this is all a distraction to take away from ... rooms extreme agenda that she has for a government takeover of healthcare wanting to give the scholarship to those that are here illegally in many many other radicalization\nHis current secretary of state for Georgia Brian Kemp Steven Fowler ... give us take a minute here to walk us through this controversy in Georgia what exactly\nHas happened with voter rolls in Georgia and how important of an issue has become and the last week of uh of campaigning before the election\nWill so the two candidates we have here really are the diametrically opposed ends of voting rights and voting access\nSecretary of state camp has done a lot to clean up the role some people say purge the roles of removing people voting there is also a record number of Georgians registered as of yesterday it was six point nine million people\nAnd the early voting numbers are higher than they've ever been before the twenty fourteen midterms were at one point one million people that have cast a ballot early as opposed to about four hundred thousand and twenty fourteen\nBut on the other hand Stacey Abrams has dedicated a lot of her political career to getting more people to vote getting minorities to vote getting younger people to vote who haven't done and so the two have clashed over the years and it's complicated in this gubernatorial race\nAnd commonwealth school and

B. U. R. dot org slash cars and things [noise]\n\nOn point I'm making a chocolate bar the we are talking about the mid term elections in a week and a day\nAway I'm joined today by Nathan Gonzales editor and publisher of inside elections that provides nonpartisan campaign analysis Janet Hook is also with us She's national political reporter for the wall Street Journal and let's go straight to our callers there's a lot of them so Leo calling from Akron, Ohio Leo you're on the air\nTaking my call um we're after voters and I'm among other big top big issues I'm leading up to this election and it it's just so ridiculous to hear these claims that these GOP lawmakers or protecting people with preexisting conditions\nWhen their votes have said just the opposite and I know that they're picking on people not paying attention to everything in the weeds leading up to the election but I mean you have do you have to be asked to not know that these people are attacking people with preexisting condition [noise]\nLeo thank you for your call Janet Hook 'em your your thoughts on what we said well\nIf I needed was right in talking about how central the issue health care issue is for the Democrats and if every wondered whether or not it was an important in winning issue there is nothing quite like the Republican response I think they're really nervous about the power of that issue\nUm in past for the past I don't know six elections the repeal of Obamacare has been the central I'm campaign promise for Republicans they didn't\nCome through with that and now the healthcare system is kind of in a mess again and to the extent that there is one issue that has really broad residence for people it's the protections for people with preexisting condition\nThat pre pre existing conditions that Obamacare provided yeah the Democrats realize that and now the Republicans seem to be realizing it too\nWell this is playing out in so many different races across the country let's go to Nevada here where it in a debate between uh the candidates for Senate in Nevada uh we had democratic representative Jacky Rosen who's running against incumbent Republican senator Dean Heller there\nAnd you're going to hear first a this is representative Rosen a asking senator Heller to tell in a vat of family and their son whose name was dean why Heller who broke his promise to protect people like dean who have pre existing conditions\nYou promise and even protect their health care and that way you would protect our protections for pre existing condition\nAnd then you went back to Washington\nAnd you also promised\nSo I Want to tell you what can the camera\nMe to ask you have to look and then\nReally tell them the truth\nAbout why you broke his promise and why you support slashing protections for pre existing conditions why you want to hurt their son\nThat's representative Jacky Rosen who's running against and Nevada incumbent senator Republican Dean Heller and here's how ... responded to Rosen's assertions at that debate\nYou can fit in times you can say to under jobs you can sort of a thousand times it's just not true\nI wrote I wrote the replacement bill for the Republican Party I Know exactly what's in that building was that bill includes preexisting conditions how has your whole took them in the eye and tell them to try and survive\nThat's at a debate a between Republican incumbent Dean Heller and democratic representative Jacky Rosen in Nevada and joining us now from Las Vegas is Meghan Mr Lee she's political reporter for the Nevada independent and we have links to her reporting don't point radio dot org Megan welcome to the program\nHi thanks for having me so how much is healthcare factoring into this race between senator Heller and representative Rosen well\nAs you just heard during that back but but it's been a huge focal point of the race\nUm you know like like you all are talking about earlier this is something that Jackie rose than that the Democratic a first term congresswoman has been really making an issue of in the race and and what it really comes down to is the fact that there was this sort of now in the ... press conference that happened last summer where\nA Dean Heller stood alongside our Republican governor Brian Sandoval and and they both expressed like never can concerns about\nThe first ... wrote healing replace proposal that Senate Republicans Abroad or worried but then he ended up actually voting in favor of as you know advancing repeal and replace the debate and voted in favor of one of the\nThe repeal bill and so this has been a huge focal point of the campaign she has run\nNumerous ads against him accusing him of flip flopping on the Affordable CARE Act she had that as sort of memorable ad\nAttacking holler as senator spine let me during one of those sort of inflatable two men you might see outside an auto repair shop and accusing him of where to blowing in the way and when it comes to the Affordable CARE Act with it but I it's been a huge issue in the race\nAnd how effective has it been on the campaign trail so far I mean what are the one of the polls in this late stage telling you\nThe this race is still really close and you know if you listen to folk talk about it you know maybe maybe at you know Jacky Rosen should've been a little bit had given that Dean Heller was considered going into that cycle you know the most vulnerable Republican incumbent senator a thing\nAnd in a state that Hillary Clinton won a\nIn twenty sixteen and so you know he was sort of a you know didn't have the edge going into the race but there are still neck and neck um you know if you look at the polls he's been a little bit ahead and some of the old and the most of them within the margin of error so\nYou know everyone is expecting this to be you know an extremely close race and come down to the wires I think you know the big question and and what remains to be seeing as how that message resonates with Nevada is you know non partisan are independent voters here\nUm you know whether they do have a significant concerns about health care and and from what we've seen health care really is a top issue for voters here in Nevada and like all\nWell a nation Gonzales a little earlier in the area you were talking about how there are certain there's a there's a possible outcome where Republicans gained seats in the Senate but this is one of those places where they are looking somewhat vulnerable so what are you seeing in Nevada\nWell I think I'm One of the reasons why Republicans have a chance to gain seats is I'm not convinced the Dean Heller is going to lose so much for much of a cycle and I really you know we had it as a tourist we've I think we've and it's a toss up for the whole\nThe whole reason we're probably G but there are ... in the back of my mind like you know I think he's still going to see just wanted to losing so that matters from up but if he's if he hangs on or maybe Republicans hang on to ... feet in Arizona\nThan you know that increases their ability to actually gain seats but nobody's been interesting in ... Nevada independent from Megan in in her boss John and in the show and the whole team because they know Nevada better than anyone\nWhich which struck me is how Nevada has been more of a slog for Democrats than what I expected you just like well it's a Hillary Clinton state but Republicans have a chance to hold the governorship Dean Heller as a chance to be reelected there's two competitive congressional districts that Democrats are defending jak your Asians third district\nIn the fourth district which is open as well and I think Democrats have had to spend more time and energy to move and money and they would have wanted to hold those seats so it's kind of I think were this was mid term that enough presidential in mid term that that it tends to be more Republican\nMaybe what do you think about that\nI think that's that's exactly right and that's one of the interesting thing we've we've been sort of keeping an eye on so far as you know turn out it is much better for Democrats with early voting which start at a little over a week ago hearing about it than better than it was in twenty fourteen and which we saw\nA complete red weigh ins in Nevada and Republicans swept at you know controlled all of the state's constitutional opposite\nOf the legislature on the competitive house seat I truly was you know a red wave on which which stands in such a stark contrast to what happens in twenty sixteen um but but that point of the ... you know Democrats traditionally don't perform as well during the term elections on so it's really going to come down to you know\nAll that effort they are putting in with their ground game to try and get both to turn out with the help of the powerful coronary union here um which is part of what's known as the Reid machine are started by you know obviously former science are crowded leader Harry Reid um you know under has his tenure\nAt the big question is Ken Ken Democrat you know make this look a little bit more like a presidential year as opposed to to the ... midterm year in which they traditionally don't fare\nSuch it's such an interesting thought that the mid term Nevada mid term any state might be different than president the the ... state in the presidential year but one question for you\nMaking I mean here we are just a week to go before the midterms and I heard you say that you know I'm obviously there's a lot of question around whether what direction certain voters might go independent voters in Nevada et cetera but\nHow much uh it's the uncertainty right now is it is it that like are there are people still out there making up their minds based on certain issues or maybe last minute campaign stops or is it simply a get out the vote question now because I'm just like who out there still doesn't know how they're going to vote in Nevada\nW.

world now is ruled by outright dictatorship horse or Italian governments so this hour on point the age of the strong man and you can join us what's driving the rise of the populist the strong man do you welcome it or fear the consequences\nWhy do you think the goal of democratic consensus is in retreat\nAnd if this feels like the right way to lead now the only way to get things done do you ever worry that the strong man might use his strengths against you were at one eight hundred forty three eight to five I find that eight hundred and forty three talk you can also join us anytime it on ... radio dot org or on Twitter and Facebook and on point radio\nNow we will talk a lot about the Global Trends in democracy and they push back against democracy but first of all let's take stock of what happened in Brazil this weekend and joining me now from the capital Brasilia is re call it Brasilia ... bureau chief for Bloomberg News ray welcome to a point\nThat these are much right now\nSo first of all described how significant is the fact that ... one of the presidential election in Brazil it it does seem to be a profound shift to the right for what what is by far a south America's largest democracy\nIt's a tectonic shift a frankly is the first time that are right wing government comes to power since uh Brazil returned to\nDemocracy in Nineteen eighty five those are the first time that the the left wing party the workers' party of Lula last since two thousand and two\nUm so it it it's clearly a move that takes Brazil or Latin America's largest nation and an entirely different direction what remains to be seen as to what extent um the rest of the country goes along are we also know that your boss and I had a very high\nRejection rate above forty percent um so\nUm because of this huge rejection with the traditional political class um but at the same time not everybody is with them\nYeah tell us a little bit more about both himself he's a former member of the Brazilian military member of the Brazilian Congress but until recently was dismissed as as unelectable because of a you know his long history of of seeing the divisive things to say the least\nYes absolutely I mean race a slur as the uh some some despicable comments about about the women\nAre things you don't necessarily want I don't want to repeat um and and what what's particularly odd about him is that for twenty eight years nearly three decades he sat in Congress sort of a venture nobody had heard of any haven't really done anything\nTomorrow mostly sunny as well I live in the mid to upper fifties Thursday far from sunny much warmer ties will be the upper sixties friday cloudy with a few scattered showers high in the mid sixties right about forty five degrees and Boston yes WVU our\nSupport for

Brazil wears a year ... a right wing a Kennedy was elected handily as the new president of Brazil\nAnd we are joined today by Larry Diamond he's professor of sociology and political science at Stanford University\nSounding co editor of the journal of democracy and all throughout the spirit of democracy and Larry before we leave the question of Brazil a behind in in talking about the other nations actually want to get a call in here because we have a Brazilian voter Michael is calling from Boston, Massachusetts Michael you're on the air\nSea bridge a so Michael you there yes Hi go ahead\nYes I Am I got I Lived here in the U.S forever I'm a U.S Senate voted for both of them out of this uh last\nSunday along with a bunch of other presidents that some of them are illegal that suffer under quote unquote Trump's politics\nThe way we see both so NATO is not the way we see Trump uh we see both for NATO as a a a damp against corruption the weight Brazil has been governed in the last\n... knows how many years um it's just it's just not sustainable the government machine there it is massive corruption goes beyond the higher echelons of government spread out throughout society and um unfortunately\nUh there were only two candidates that made it to the run off so I had to pick\nA between you know the work or the the least worst right was the option for many centrists that him as a um you know as a venue for or or you know as a vehicle for ah to lead this nation\nIn Michael ... I just wanted to echo your point here is reading a you know for example I'm a quote in a in the Washington Post's from a a polo dentist saying if there had been another decent candidate and he wouldn't have voted for a ... knows a lot of garbage but quote he's the lesser of the evil thing exactly what you said there Michael\nBut I've got another coming here from a different listener Michael Gaskins says on Facebook to us why do people feel that they must give a green light to racism sexism homophobia and anti environmentalism in order to fight crime and corruption ... brings all of the above to say nothing of its fondness for state sponsored murder\nWhat's your response to this other listener Michael\nI come from an African Brazilian descent so you know from black\nGrandparents I have many gay friends that voted for both of them out of the the uh feminism a\nQuote unquote argument against us without you know there are so many I was just so many things yeah it has a path for example when you're you mentioned that lady that he talked about that particular that'd be arguing against she was defending the gentler that'd be headed and raped a girl you\nLive it against that situation so he was he was he was so limited\nThat a woman was not sending another fellow woman that was raped and be headed that is the level of conversation that he had to go against up in Brazil yeah you're looking at people that go to jail that go to jail gets these\nOr things that will get capital punishment here that us\nThey'll go to jail they'll START I don't know three four years and then they'll leave right just just a young young lady that killed her parents uh she was able to get out of jail for a for a Mother's Day walk\nMichael thank you for your call your passion there and I want to hear Larry diamonds response to that a living\nOverwhelming that both the ... distasteful parts that he may not approve of in both narrow fall by the wayside\nWell I think it's great to Michael called them because we now have a direct expression of the frustration and anger that produced the victory for this extreme right and I'd say fairly explicitly authoritarian candidate\nAnd the problem is that when you as a voter a turn to feel that you have little choice but to turn to such a blunt and Savage against them or as someone who has been so explicitly authoritarian and has expressed over\nThe entire quarter century trajectory of his political career such frequent contempt for democracy\nYou're putting the whole democratic system you know on the operating table\nAnd we need to keep something in mind magna uh when we look at what's going on in the world now but also the history of democratic failure in the world frequently when you put in office they know failing or miss performing democratic system someone who has been\nAbundantly clear about is authoritarian intentions he acts on them and I'd say Brazilian democracy is that severe risk right now\nI'm I'm going to play a little tape that may or support exactly the point that you're saying ah Larry Diamond this takes us to the Philippines with President Rodrigo due to ... their ... who was it has been very outspoken about his crackdown on um drugs and violence there\nOr to the point where you know he advocates extrajudicial killings in the Philippines and in twenty sixteen\nHe actually compared himself favorably to Adolf Hitler saying that he would like to kill millions of drug dealers ...\nAfter the million you know these things that are [noise] that'd be up to snuff\nAt Philippine president Rodrigo de ... saying Hitler massacred three million Jews now there is three million drug dealers I'd\nBe happy to slaughter them a long time and I said we've got some comments coming here from listeners um that wonder you know you said that democracy may be on the high end up on the operating table\nIn these countries but\nSean me and says I think more than a little tongue in cheek he says I'm outraged that citizens of the foreign country can vote their free will and someone calling themselves ... is it really a pushback on democracy if the strong man in question if democratically elected in a legitimate election what do you think what\nI'd say a few things I'm number one uh ... actually has presided over the extrajudicial killing of well over twelve thousand people on the streets of the Philippines\nSo um when autocrats signal their intentions are we we have to take them seriously\nSecondly although there is rising despair and cynicism about democracy and Brazil\nThere is not a majority sentiment to end democracy in Brazil and that is certainly not\nWhat Brazilian voters want I don't think it is what our previous caller Michael wanted they just want decisive action to reform and cleanse the system so you can say yes they voted for change they certainly did\nThey voted for what they perceived to be\nIn the runoff election the only option for real change that they hide but that doesn't give both in our license to close down the Congress to close down the Supreme Court\nAs his son who is also a congressman suggested they might have to do or to violate civil liberties and I think Brazilians now need to be very organized and very vigilant\nOr as we should be a from the international community and ensuring that both in our address is Brazil's problems in a way that don't violate the constitution and the rule of law\nYeah well Larry Diamond let me just bring in another voice into the conversation Laura king joins us today from Washington She's global

global affairs correspondent for the Los Angeles\nTimes and we're one eight hundred and forty three eight to five five it's eight hundred forty three talk lots of people uh want to join us Larry and Laura let me just get some callers in here Alice is calling from Norwalk, Connecticut Alice you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em it's been reported that Steve Bannon was an advisor to both in our own his bid for the presidency and as you know he was chief strategist for Donald Trump in his twenties sixteen presidential election\nA kind of appalled by uh the fact that Trump utilized him a given the fact that\nBannon is as he says the populace but in my in is is actually a white nationalism and I'm Wondering what your guest thought about his influence on in this election um it's disturbing to me that he also supported Marine Le pen I'm In\n... you know her bid for for a her election in France\nWill Alice at me just let me let the since you asked a good question let me a letter panelist respond thank you for your call a lawyer a king of Steve Bannon is still working to spread populism throughout the world what influence or ruled that he has to play any in Brazil\nWell in terms of Brazil I'm not I'm not I'm not so well versed in that but I Would I Would say that one thing that's been interesting about Mr Bannon is that he's he's encountered some some rejection and some resistance from even some of the European nationalist with\nWith him he's seeking to make an alliance um some of them are in effect just telling him to to stay out of it and and uh and that does kind of reflect their their sense of of\nAs a homegrown homegrown um tradition that didn't make you take the test it and\nDidn't they just read though that material solving any uh Italy's deputy prime minister I'm actually joined a band in his organization called the movement that he founded to spread populous politics and basically undermine the European Union does that have happened recently right\nWill Mr Bannon I think has has sought actively to to export is what he did for Mr Trump to to Europe and that has that has pretty much been a driving force behind what he's been doing since the since he left the White House let's\nSo let's go to Jill who's calling from St Helena island South Carolina Julie you're on the air\nI make now I just wanted to say that a strong arm tactics and they work in the short term\nHowever they are not sustainable over a long time you may get a few quick win but the only way to move forward and not end up and down Nate is to actually put the time and build relationships with people you need to work with\nUm even if you look in in business you're dealing up process redesign you need to get by on on that that the team\nAnd if you don't own any you skip that work of relationship building you're always going to have people working to undermine progress\nEven at the progress benefit every one\nMm Jill thank you for your call Larry Diamond um do do people do politicians have the time though to ... to build those those relationships to garner that consensus that Joe was talking about its requisite for a successful democracy\nUm will ... look to take it back to Brazil or marry I think the question is smoke time but a structural on some of those particularly if you want to make government work which really import requires making Congress work\nWe have our own challenges here in the United states but it's important that we not close the hour without noting a fundamental structural impediments\nTo a decent governance and Brazil which is the you've got now Twenty one party's sitting in the Senate thirty parties sitting in the Congress bows or ...\nAnd the current era and because of the six dream system of proportional representation\nOne reason why you had so much corruption in Brazil is the president's need to ... throw around money currently in order to set a symbol congressional majorities out of this mix\nAnd as the former president Fernando Enrique car do so said they've got to fix the system and create a more rational\nSmaller party Congress Mm\nOh Laura king sued just if I if I can I mean we've been focusing on Brazil up because it's a very rightly points out it's just happened and there's a lot of specific things to talk about\nAh regarding of Brazil at the moment but you know should have done this earlier Loren I'm Sorry that I didn't but I don't know if you could just sort of briefly tell us what countries you would consider\nUm you know part of this rise of uh the strongman trend we've we've seen we've talked about the Philippines and talked about Brazil um we you know mentioned the United states even Russia China what else would you would you include in that list\nWell I did have a chance to spend time recently in Poland and Hungary and I would certainly count them among among this trend and I would say I'm Still in touch with some people in Egypt and turkey from the time that I spent there when I when I Lived in those countries and\nThere's a there's a sense of of real a real alarm in a real sense that things are getting worse and worse\nTo turkey in Egypt as well okay no Larry earlier in the hour mentioned a Modi in India does he fall into this category oh I think so definitely and Larry what do you think\nI spent a motor used in no way a as blatant a full of democracy ... you know really ... believes\nI'm invested in elections and has never spoken about closing down democracy but he's certainly leaning hard on opposition and on civil liberties and that's a warning sign to really watch carefully\nMm well let's go to Tony who's calling from Seattle, Washington county you're on the air\nHigh that that I was wondering how much of this might be a reaction to the global women's isn't it that way than thing recently um I Know in central and South America quite a macho culture I don't know if there's some anxiety\nAround which I'm a women's movement I Know when it's and then also um advocates for other civil rights causes and be a threat to our ... year authoritarian strongman dictatorships\nSo I didn't know you have a I'm a sociologist there\nOr is he saying anything from his face them kind of a lick reaction to that level a county thanks for your call Larry Diamond what do you think\nI think the ...\nOr earlier there was a reference to the threat from cultural and social change the driving a lot of the some authoritarian reaction\nAnd it's not only three decades or more of the women's uh rights movement but gay rights from a immigrant rights and so on\nBut I don't think this can explain the immediate uh six or ... or other right wing alternatives it's very much response as well to economic distress economic and security\nAnd the general failure of government so ... what the caller described as just one of many strands of unease and reaction\n... let's go to Peggy who's calling from Springfield, Illinois Peggy are on the air\nYes I'm I'm hearing people talk about this illusion with globalization\nAnd from my observation I think we've made a terrible terrible mistake in equating our democracy with the kind of hard edge capitalism that we are now living under when it's operates globally\n... ... I think that this solution has been terrible because democracy is something everyone was but then when we say we've got it and it's causing chaos and inequality people get very disillusioned yeah ...\nW.

percent not like learning\nOrganic gardening or building rockets or just watching TV what ever it is one hundred percent the child's choice but is it a good choice this hour on point getting schools on the on schooling movement\nAnd you can join us do have experience with an schooling what does it look like for you as a parent what was it like as a kid why do you do it does it work and and then there's this what about all those things that\nTypical schools offer socialization exposure to new ideas and subjects even if a kid isn't interested at first but about focused and rigor and discipline what's wrong with all that and can you get that in an schooling where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nYou can also join us anytime it on point radio dot org or on Twitter and Facebook and on point radio and before we START I just want to give a tip of the hat to the Boston Globe magazine they recently wrote a piece about on schooling where the inspiration for this hour came from the author that piece of fortunately was unable to join us today but we've got a link\nTo the globe story at one point radio dot org do check it out\nWell joining me first today from Philadelphia is Millie could dig she on schools her eleven and Thirteen year old daughter's neither of whom have ever attended a brick and mortar school she's also the founder of eclectic learning network a secular black and brown centered home education network where we can do welcome to on point\nOh thank you magnify thank you so much for having me today\nIt's great to have you so so first of all walk us through a typical day for your daughter's what does ... what do they do when they're being an schooled\nYou know for me the the short answer is everything and nothing um\nEvery day has a different one and for for our family an schooling are self directed learning is something that we've embraced over the years and it allows them the freedom to be able to explore ideas thoughts or whether it be read a book\nOr maybe start off and kick off today watching television either way it's their decision and my focus becomes to guide them through whatever decisions that they make to ensure that their experiences as fruitful as they would like to be\nYeah so I think that sounds a quite revolutionary and or at least very unfamiliar to a lot of people who might be listening so I mean if you could just sort of take us down to the level of what you do starting in the morning when when your girls wake up how does the un schooling day began\nIt it totally begins with freedom I mean they are mourning their morning folks I Am not\nA at eleven and Thirteen they are able to prepare their own\nFood so I don't have to have that stick of oh let me get up and

talking about the ... schooling movement or the totally so are a lot of kids to be one hundred percent self directed in what they learn and how they learn it and I'm joined today by ... she's a mother who an schools her eleven and Thirteen year old daughter she's founder of eclectic learning network\nAnd she joined us today from Philadelphia also with us is Peter gray he is a professor of psychology at Boston College co founder and president of the nonprofit alliance for self directed education and the author of free to learn\nA no Peter great I I still have some sort of basic questions about how a an schooling or self directed learning really work because it seems as if it requires or perhaps ... success is based on how self directed a child is and um you know I'm Wondering what about all those kids who if the\nThing they want all day long would just up to turn on the TV and sit there for eight hours\nRight [noise] well you know the kids that we see who uh sit there for eight hours turning on the TV are largely kids who are going to public school they're coming home and sit and watch on TV right [laughter]\nSo this issue of self directed what is it being to be self directed um [noise]\nI uh I'm an evolutionary psychologist so I'm interested in human nature and the nature of children [noise]\nLook at little kids have you ever see the little kid who hasn't yet gone to school who's not self directed who's not just curious playful and eagerly\nDoing things they're exploring the world almost from the moment they're born there looking around what's out there with new what can I learn about\n... think of all the things that children learn before they ever go to school and this is not this is not just some children that learn that this is essentially all the children they learn their native language from scratch [noise]\nThey learn an enormous amount about the physical world around them and the social world around them so I'm schooling is this what if we just left them continue to do that instead of put them away where their own questions don't count anymore\nWhere their own play is considered at best recess which is increasingly being taken away rather than a way of learning\nWhere socialization is almost cut off because they're not really allowed to talk to one another or to cooperate people talk about socialization being missing if you're not going to school or what kind of socialization truly is occurring there [noise]\nSo we send them to school and then we wonder why there are no longer self motivated right [laughter] because we've taken away the basic motives for learning curiosity playfulness who has the ability\nTo something here for a second I I thought I had read that a quote from you I'm perhaps it was actually in the Boston Globe peace where how did you said before that you believe that really basically all all kids should be made to learn is to learn how to read and maybe some ... some arithmetic and then leave the rest of it up to them\nYou know this was a miss quote okay I tried to get them to change that [laughter] and I sent a correction that was published two weeks later that was a complete mess quote\nOne of my own research has shown that children learn to read with out direct instruction when they are allowed to learn to read in their own ways at the time that they are motivated to do it they may ask for some help but nothing like the kind of structure and\nUh I have yet to see a child who's been self directed education who hasn't eventually learn to read they learned to read it very different ages right\nWell so here's limb asking that question because if we're leaving a hundred percent of what a child learns up to that kid\nDon't we take the very grave risk that they're going to choose things that might well it might fulfilled them or it isn't the entire suite of what they need to be successful happy citizens of the modern world I mean I'm thinking what if the kid doesn't [noise]\nWe can make an argument that they're not learning these things in school right now but I'm going to set that aside but what if they don't want to learn things like civics or how government works or they don't want to learn about history or they don't want to learn about uh\nYou know financial issues et cetera all things that I Would argue are really ... you know really important\nUh to to living in the modern world aren't we sort of sending them back by not giving them at least the opening the door to these things to them\nWell you know ... if we make people learn things if we if we require them to learn things the first question is are they really learning it hardly learning it in a way that is meaningful to that stays with them so let's take civics for example\nSo in schools we deprive children of all their civil rights literally we deprive them of their civil rights and then we lecture to them about civics Elana real civics lesson whereas a better civics lesson to say\nHey you're growing up in a democracy you're growing up in a world where you are responsible for your own life you are also responsible for other people\nYou you are also free to choose your own path and happiness isn't that a better civics lesson [laughter] than a lecture on it you are living it\nYou are limited in what in what does that that you'll have ultimate than total freedom for your entire life which is not true we'll have to live in a society\nBut you know something yes we do have to live in a society and children who are growing up in charge of their own lives are experiencing what it is to live in a society they are\nThe case that there nobody has totally free nobody can do things that break the law\nYou know there are many many students who are in self directed education are going to learning centers or school learning stuff and they make rules they make the rules democratically there are lots of rules you can't literally you can't if you take out toys you have to put them away\nYou can't there are rules against bullying and so forth but they're democratically made rules and isn't that a better civics lesson\n... been patiently listening here and I want to get your view what what's your response to my question here that perhaps where we're at risk of not introducing important lessons or a or subjects to children if they're totally self directed\nWell I'm from me I I question with the word introduced me\nIn in this context because introducing if I'm looking at it from a school perspective there there's an indoctrination that comes from that and for me as a self directed in an schooling parent we can introduce but there is no indoctrination there is no forced to take that on so\nThe idea that these things will not be introduced or seen or felt is something that I don't necessarily agree with that goes to the amusement park and that's physics\nAnd its best happening in motion for them to experience what that is for them when they're ready\nAnd whether politics all of these things are very much important but that happens at the playground a there's issues of race that happen everywhere we go that is not something that is specific to\nGoing to a traditional schooling setting that's everywhere so my daughters are huge into making sure that their identity is affirmed everywhere that they go and they also participate and actions that create inclusion and diversity and equity so that has nothing to do with school\nWell a ... and Peter you can imagine that we have a lot of lot of joy nuts so let me just get a couple of

I. capable of allowing my child to learn what my child wants to learn even if it's not\nWhat I think my child should be learning at this point you have to give up a certain amount of sense of control you know the truth is a matter\nOf terror and my heart and later as there is just gonna have\nTo give up a certain amount of sense of control you have to trust the nature of children I have learned over the years to do that because of my research not just because of my own experience with my own child but because of my research with many children [noise]\nAnd because of my research into the history of humanity throughout\nAlmost all of human history children always self educated we never had schools we never had\nAs so children come into the world burning to educate themselves we can't stop them from it unless we lock them away and closets and so on but here's what we have to understand we are now living in a world where there's way more knowledge out there\nThat any of us can possibly learn\nAnd who's to decide what's most important for any given child don't we want people to grow up learning different aspects of that now why should everybody learn the same little slice of all the knowledge and skills and the information\nThat schools have decided that the slice everybody should learn yeah you have to trust your child your child may not study physics maybe your child will study art history or whatever else meeting\nWill never learn how the old habits may driving isn't that a lot of the matter is Aaron\nYour child will have a job and the reason your child will have a job is because your child has learned to take control of his or her own life my what my research shows is that the graduates of self directed education are doing very well in adult life there and not having difficulty getting jobs\nLet me get a response your Michael Apple what do you think\nWell first I I I appreciate what's been said that I Want to ask one of the characteristics of children would have a parent you really want to society in which we should um the children are simply the property of their parents when there's a growing movement in the United states for\nInstance of anti Semitism of anti clearly racist trying to change and\nI don't want to romanticize parents at all I Want to be very cautious about this because again I think parents have an ethical responsibility to be the best\nFor their children but I Do think we want to look around us right now and ask very serious questions about what is being taught are there any any limits are we romanticizing the situations that\n... seconds is um ...\nDo we want or simply to have a society enrich her children are simply ... parents having no responsibility whatsoever for a larger society what can we do\nTo make it more certain that the vast majority of children who will go to ... actually you have to kind of education that of many of the characters which the movie theater and Peter want right\nWell Michael let me let the Peter Graham illegal responded that Peter go\nAhead I I think that's a wonderful point Michael that you've made and it's something that I've given a lot of thought to and concern to let me be clear I Do not think that home based on schooling is the solution to our national educational problem\nI think it's a great solution for many many families it's clearly a great solution as far as I can tell her for a multi ... and her daughter is is clearly a great solution for the many families that I have studied it works very well for them and that works very well for their children [noise]\nBut I don't think is the solution for everybody I think is probably even a minority of parents who should be doing this but what is happening and what is I think going to be that eventually the educational solution\nIs we're developing more and more learning centers and schools for self directed education is not happening within the public school system because the public school system has too many constraints you can move a certain direct a certain amount and the progressive direction\nBut then there's always the pushback to go back to the other way ever since schools have become compulsory we've had progressive educators trying to push it one way and then it gets pushed back the other way this\nIs happening outside of the public school system but it's happening in a way that it could eventually become affordable to everybody and I would love to see public support for this right now the alliance for self directed education is trying to bring public support\nFor Centers for self directed education so that children can be away from their parents they could be in the center\nWhere they have to learn the kind of community skills how to make rules how to live by rules how to get along with people who are different from you and have different ideas from yours different ideas from your parents I think this is all part of education very important part of education\nNow did you boys seven WVU ages break eighty nine boy one WB UH Brewster and streaming or W.

I just wanted to echo your point here I was reading a you know for example I'm a quote in a in the Washington Post's from a polo dentist staying there had been another decent Kennedy he wouldn't have voted for a little scenario that both of those a lot of garbage but quote he's the lesser of the evil thing exactly what you said there Michael\nBut I've got another comment here from the different listener Michael Gaskins says on Facebook to us why do people feel that they must give a green light to racism sexism homophobia an anti environmental isn't in order to fight crime and corruption both ... brings all of the above just say nothing of his fondness for state sponsored murder\nWhat's your response to this other listener Michael\nI come from an African Brazilian descent so you know from black the grandparents I have many gay friends that voted for both of them out of the the uh feminism a\nQuote unquote a argument against was what do you know there are so many I go to so many things yeah it has a path for example when you're you mentioned that lady that he you know talk about that particular Wu was arguing against\nShe was defending the gentler that'd be headed and raped a girl you was livid against that situation so he was he was he was so limited\nThat a woman was not sending another fellow woman that was raped and be headed that is the level of conversation that he had to go against up in Brazil yeah you're looking at people that go to jail that go to jail against these\nOr things that will get capital punishment here and the U.S\nThey'll go to jail they'll surf I don't know three four years and then they'll leave right is this a young that's young lady that killed their parents or she was able to get out of jail for a for a Mother's Day walk\nMichael thank you for your call your passion there and I want to hear Larry diamonds response to that uh Larry Diamond Michael very clearly saying that the problems in Brazil so overwhelming that\nBoth the ... distasteful parts that he may not approve of in both in our early fall by the wayside well\nI think it's great to Michael called them because we now have a direct expression\nOf the frustration and anger that produced the victory for the extreme right and I'd say truly exclusively authoritarian candidate\nAnd the problem is that when you as a voter turn to or feel that you have little choice but to turn to such a blunt and Savage against them or as someone who has been so explicitly authoritarian and has expressed over\nThe entire quarter century trajectory of his political career such frequent contempt for democracy\nYou're putting the whole democratic system you know on the operating table and we need to keep something in mind magna or when we look at what's going on in the world now but also\nThe history of democratic failure in the world frequently when you put in office and failing or miss performing democratic system someone who has been\nAbundantly clear about is authoritarian intentions he acts on them and I'd say Brazilian democracy is a severe risk right now\nI'm I'm when I play a little tape that may or support exactly the point that you're saying a diamond this takes us to the Philippines with President Rodrigo ... their ... who was ...\nHis crackdown on drugs and violence there or to the point where you know he advocates extrajudicial killings in the Philippines and in twenty sixteen\nHe actually compared himself favorably to Adolf Hitler saying that he would like to kill millions of drug dealers your\nMuscles are three million you notice the meal was assuming that are [noise] that was our people smoke in the\nPhilippine president Rodrigo Duterte chasing Hitler massacred three million Jews now there is three million drug dealers I'd be happy to slaughter them\nA butler diamond I said we've got some comments coming here from listeners um that wonder you know you said that democracy may be on the ... end up on the operating table\nIn these countries but\nSean Miguelina says I think more than a little tongue in cheek he says I'm outraged that citizens of a foreign country can vote their free will and someone calling themselves ... says is it really a pushback on democracy if the strong man in question if democratically elected in a legitimate election what do you think what\nI'd say a few things I'm number one a\nDetour to actually has presided over the extrajudicial\nKilling of well over twelve thousand people on the streets of the Philippines so um when autocrats\nSignal their intentions are we we have to take them seriously certainly although there is rising\nDespair and cynicism about democracy and Brazil\nThere is not a majority sentiment to end democracy in Brazil and that is certainly not\nWhat Brazilian voters want or I don't think it is what our previous caller Michael wanted they just want decisive action to reform and climbs the system so you can say yes they voted for change they certainly did\nThey voted for what they perceived to be\nIn the runoff election the only option for real change that they are but that doesn't give both in our lives since closed down the Congress to closed on the Supreme Court as his son who is also a congressman suggested they might have to do or to violate civil liberties\nAnd I've been Brazilians now need to be very organized and very vigilant uh as we should be a from the international community in ensuring that both in our addresses Brazil's problems in a way that don't violate the constitution and the rule of law\nYeah we'll Larry Diamond let me just bring in another voice into the conversation Laura king joins us today from Washington She's global affairs correspondent for the Los Angeles times lurking welcome to on point\nHigh maintenance it's great to have you ... let me just ask you I mean you you've heard Larry or talk about what he sees as some of the threats to ... to democracy long term threat to democracy with the\nRise of these authoritarian leaders around the world\nUh I'm just wondering if you see any sort of you or what are the unifying features that you see in what brought them to power I mean I I ... the situation on the ground in each of these countries are slightly different but it seems to be that to me that one of the things that defines all of these leaders and I would include Donald Trump among them\nIs this cold is strong coal to an us versus them\nI'd rather young to go before the midterm elections in Trump rallies just days in town\nWe gave you the biggest tax and the history of our yard\nLine isn't

arrow who run one the Brazilian elections on Sunday he\nHandily we're joined today by Larry Diamond he's professor of sociology and political science at Stanford University also a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and author of the forthcoming book ill wins saving democracy from Russia rage Chinese ambition and American complacency that's due out next year\nLaura king also joined us She's global affairs correspondent for the Los Angeles\nTimes and we're at one eight hundred forty three eight to five five at eight hundred forty three talk\nLots of people uh want to join us Larry and Laura's let me just get some callers in here Alice is calling from Norwalk, Connecticut Alice you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em it's been reported that he's Bannon was an advisor to both an arrow in his bid for the presidency and as you know he was chief strategist for Donald Trump\nElection are kind of appalled by uh the fact that Trump utilized him\nA given the fact that Bannon is as he says a populist but in my opinion is is actually a white nationalist and I'm Wondering what your guest thought about his influence on in this election\nUm it's disturbing to me that he also supported Marine Le pen um and\n... you know her bid for for a her election in France\nWill elephant me just let me let the since you asked a good question let me let our panelists respond thank you for your call a lawyer a king us Steve Bannon is uh still working to spread populism throughout the world what influence or role did he have to play if any in Brazil well\nIn terms of Brazil I'm not I'm not I'm not so well versed in that but I Would I Would say that one thing that's been interesting about Mr Bannon is that he's he's encountered some some rejection and some resistance from even some of the European national is with\nWith him he's seeking to make an alliance um some of them are in effect just telling him to to stay out of it and and uh and that that's kind of reflect their their sense of of\nOf a ... a homegrown homegrown um tradition that\nDidn't pass it and didn't they just read though that a ... a Italy's deputy prime minister I'm actually joined a band and his organization called the movement that he founded to spread populous politics in basically undermine the European Union ... that you happened recently right\nWill Mr Bannon I think has has sought actively to to export his what he did for Mr Trump to to Europe and that has that has pretty much been a driving force behind what he's been doing since the since he left the White House let's\nSo let's go to Jill who's calling from St Helena island South Carolina Julie you're on the air\nLike now I just wanted to say that a strong arm tactics\nAnd they work in the short term\nHowever they're not sustainable over a long time you may get if you click when but the only way to move forward and not end up and down Nate is to actually ... and ... relationship with the people you need to work with\nOn even if you look in in the business you're dealing a process redesign you need to get by on on that part of the team\nAnd if you don't own any you skip that work of relationship building you're always going to have people working to undermine progress\nEven at the progress benefit every one\nMm Jill thank you for your call Larry Diamond um do do people do politicians have the time though to ... to build those those relationships to garner that consensus that Joe was talking about the requisite for a successful democracy\nUm will magna I'd like to take it back to Brazil or I may I think uh the question is not time but a structural and some of those particularly if you want to make government work which really import requires making Congress work\nWe have our own challenges here in the United states but it's important that we not close the hour without noting of fundamental structural impediments\nTo a decent governance in Brazil which is the you've got now Twenty one party's sitting in the Senate thirty parties sitting in the Congress bows or records for Brazilian democracy at least in the current era\nAnd because of this extreme system of proportional representation\nOne reason why you had so much corruption in Brazil is the president's need the ... throw around money corrupt away in order to set a symbol congressional majorities out of this mix\nAnd as the former president Fernando Enrique ... said they've got to fix the system and create a more rational smaller party Congress\nMm oh Laura king sued just if I if I can I mean we've been focusing on Brazil up because it's a very rightly points out it's just happened and there's a lot of specific things to talk about\nAh regarding of Brazil at the moment but you know should have done this earlier Loren I'm Sorry that I didn't but I Wonder if you could just sort of briefly tell us what countries you would consider\nUm you know part of this rise of uh the strongman trend we should be saying we've talked about the Philippines and talked about Brazil um we you know you mentioned the United states even Russia China what else would you would you include in that list\nI did have a chance to spend time recently in Poland and Hungary and I would certainly count them among among this trend and I would say I'm Still in touch with some people in Egypt and turkey from the time that I spent there when I when I Lived in those countries and there's a there's a ...\nSense that things are getting worse and worse\nTo turkey in Egypt as well okay no Larry earlier in the hour mentioned a Modi in India does he fall into this category\nOh I think so definitely\nAnd Larry what do you think\nI think a Modi is in no way a as blatant a full of democracy is ... ... you know really ... believes\nHum invests in elections and is never spoken about closing down democracy but he's certainly leaning hard on opposition\nAnd on civil liberties and that's a warning sign to really watch
