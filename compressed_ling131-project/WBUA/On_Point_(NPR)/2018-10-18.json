Want to actually read uh just the the lead for a recent article that you wrote a ... and you begin quote it has felt practically inevitable for years that I'd have to write the following sentence Sears Holdings Corp wants towering force in American moles that was essential in creating the blueprint for the twenty century retail\nIs preparing to file for bankruptcy\nWhy did it feel inevitable well\nBecause this was the result of a very very long slow decline and I sort of break it into two parts I Sears in two thousand for a a financier named Eddie Lambert orchestrated it's merger with Kmart\nAnd that has been quite disastrous chapter I he's mismanaged the company and a number of ways that I'm sure we can delve into in more detail and now has played a key role in bringing it to this point of bankruptcy but long before that throughout the nineties in the eighties\nSears the missteps for just piling up that left it not well positioned to compete in today's retail environment\nOkay so let's talk about some of those missteps because I think at first blush people when they see a major retailer or have to declare bankruptcy these days\nThey think it's because they haven't been able to keep up with a you know online shopping and the the the major changes in the way Americans are shopping is that the case or I mean it sounds like you're saying that the missteps came along before Amazon came along\nYes exactly so we can we can relate to the Nineteen eighties when\nSears was sort of just cutting off of it but I think of it ... it didn't puerile period that postwar post World war two I threw the seventies when it was in you know just this really dominant retailer and in the eighties I think it had a bit of hubris\nOn and it started to get distracted by adding different the minds of business so it acquired Caldwell banker acquired a finance firm called dean Witter just started taking its I off the ball of what it knew how to do best was which was to sell people stuff\nAnd then also some pre Internet changes started happening this year's didn't quite know how to grapple with and that was mainly in the form of these so called category killers these big box

in America in two thousand Eighteen the once dominant perhaps the dominant retailer in the United states for more than a century\nCan't hold on and is going into chapter eleven we're talking this hour with Sarah holes actually the Bloomberg opinion columnist covering the consumer in retail industry is\nVicky Howard is also with us She's a business and cultural historian and a professor at the University of ... ethics and author of from main street to mold the rise and fall the American department store\nAnd and Vicki Howard before the break we were talking about how fears a century ago really changed the way Americans shopped particularly in rural parts of the country you know was that because of ah the catalog\nOh yes I I mean before Nineteen twenty five it was a huge mail order from you know and it's competition was um Montgomery Ward it also had a catalog in the late Nineteen century uh but uh I just was a way that um\nRural people could access all of the goods that were manufactured in in the United states that were um manufactured in northern factories and shipped out on a railroad cars you know across the country\nAnd you could order your your clothes or your your um equipment for your farm or a you know everything under the sun was available in these catalogues\nOkay so the company was founded I mean as the years as we know it was about was created an Eighteen Ninety three by Richard war in the years and a hell of a Curtis Roebuck what was it about them and how they approach business did all that I was allowed them to see this opportunity that there were all these ... customers in rural parts of the country\nUm I mean I think the ah they started out as a selling watches so it was just a sort of limited uh\nFor him in terms of what it would have had offered to begin with but it really grew later when Julius real civil got on board um\nAnd he took the company into it sort of a modern day for us so I I think that this was the gilded age you know it was an era of you know big gap between the rich and the poor and but you know it was a time of industrialization and I'm\nAlso movement into cities and\nA growing consumer culture at the time I was focused on cities but you know lots of people in the country also um wanted access to some of these goods and this was a way for them to have it on other otherwise they would have had to travel long distances to go into cities to to shop in the department stores or\nMaybe they would have just been able to shop in their country store their general store in their area in a rural area so it really was about I'm reaching those segments and then when it became a department store in the Nineteen twenties then it shifted gears and became a more of a main street an entrepreneur um a sort of\nGoing to get small towns across the country and then eventually you know moving into his later section in after World War two\nWas Sarah ... isn't as one of the most interesting things about seniors as a major American Company that over the course of several decades was able to open up\nMarkets and opportunities for a for consumers in rural areas and this is Vicky how are just saying you know also in suburban areas becoming becoming the store that had the catalog and was an anchor store in so many moles in America\nYeah I think in some ways the story is yours is the story of the American economy right that you can see those clear links from and adapting to a largely still girl in agrarian society to seeing what the automobile would do to change the patterns in shopping patterns and and making that adaptation so quickly\nI mean you think about that they didn't start stores still Nineteen twenty five and I believe\nA within a decade stores where the majority of their business compared to at the catalog and so the fact that it was so nimble you know we talk now about the extraordinary changes the Amazon has been able to bring to bear and Steve is mentioned even able to disrupt the market well that's pretty speedy disruption too and that's why I think fears occupies\nSuch an important place in retailing history in Congress yeah\nSo we'll talk more about the uh the effects of online retail a little later in the program but we've got callers who want to join us 'cause I mean most Americans have interacted with a series of shocked as the years perhaps at least was in their lives so lots of lots of memories you go to Deborah who's calling from Watertown, Connecticut Deborah you're on the air\nYes making great show I I'm I have worked for two great American institutions feared and potential um and potential continues to thrive and fears of course is not I started my race furious when I was a kid during the Vietnam War um my father was military surgeons\nWe needed\nI Would core over it for hours [laughter] um I think fear has been off to fight and heading for trouble for a long time I worked for years in the Nineteen seventies when I was in high school and housewares\nI'm the guy I worked for his name was John man I Hope his kids here this he was the top housewares manager in the entire country he was very innovative very\nSuccessful very aggressive he he was there about knowing the merchandise send me on spying missions to see what other stores were charging so he could set prices and sales based on that information he had made cooking chicken and ham inside\nThe store grilling it so that the smell would attract customers who might not be thinking about\nI Love to see sounds like a really creative manager\nHe was totally like that and he never ever ever got promoted the owner and manager of one department in one store because he didn't have a high school that I mean he had a high school degree but nothing beyond that and and you know and\nI especially remember just one story that I'd love to share from those days about I'm an old style manager here I was sixteen years old and I was on the phone with the customer who wanted to order a replacement parts for his Webber grill which was not hard but he was really really difficult and really unhappy\nIn part to help well it turned out that the reason he was so unhappy with that his wife had left him\nAnd she had I'm\nTaking the parts but not the grill uh-huh and and I and I didn't I couldn't handle and when I finally said to him excuse me sir it's not my fault that your wife left you and I hung up on it\nAnd he called store manager and demanded that I'd be fired yeah and the store manager who we never saw on the floor who was a you know young man college educated wore suits came down to you know get\nMy head on a platter and John stuck up for me uh-huh he had she shouldn't have done it she's young it's her first job she's a good worker and then he sat me down and he gave me you know the coffee is always right lecture but he stuck up for me\nWe'll Debra thank you so much for your call and for your memories there and and a really wonderful example about or perhaps hope more qualified people that you weren't at least in this case weren't getting promoted thank you Deborah let's go quickly to Chris who's calling from state College Pennsylvania Chris you're on the air\nAre great program or what but not just ... ... ... ... the role of the vulture capital of the ... you know the hedge love the bar these corporations are the\nLeverage up till the hill to table so back to the purchase price of the trip all the assets all ... all the\nRabbit out of the authors pocket all Catholic now they're just going back and we're we're a load the all of the corporation of all the debt on somebody else\nI see Chris thank you for your call Sarah ... ah did that happen to Sears were they were they purchased by hedge fund or or a private equity business at one time\nAh so anyway and birds that who just stepped down as CEO and who orchestrated it's merger with Kmart he is a hedge fund guy\nOn and he has used a lot of those hedge fund tactics to try to keep here's a flow in recent years so and this is one of the main knocks of his tenure is that he didn't really have emergency ... he wasn't running series like a retailer he was running it was sort of his hedge fund guys had on and so he has and\nYou know doing things like spinning off it's real estate providing loans are selling things like that crashed into a brand sort of moving around financial chess pieces to keep it alive but he wasn't really making it a better retailer\nWill so should we talk more about this then because we think the presumption when you hear that a retailer goes into bankruptcy as it somehow they were doing business wrong but it may have nothing to do with that I mean\nAs a as our caller pointed out we have so many examples Toys R us he's right is another one ... who's a hedge funds were private equity managers using these companies are as credit cards and then you know letting letting him drowned and all that leverage\nAnd in many ways this massage therapy and hot tub

point I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking this hour about fears declaring bankruptcy on Monday and what that means for this major American retailer it's been a retailer at the heart of American Life for more than a hundred years and ah what that means for retail as we move forward in the digital age\nI mean let's listen here to a clip from his ears ad from the Nineteen nineties featuring\nAlso a Sears commercials spokesperson\nTalking about all the things you could accomplish with your products\nRemodeling a kitchen or bathroom such a big draw\nRuin you for us to do it all and do it right Hi, Bob\nVila procedures home improvement professionals maybe you've been dreaming about a beautiful new kitchen or updating your um well if it's too big a job to do yourself rushed the job the Sears they've been in business for over a hundred years\nBut we lived there in the Nineteen nineties wanting fears long history in the retail business we got comments coming in on our website a debit says Sears was our parents and our parents parents store when I think as the years I think of craftsmen Kenmore the only two brands I ever bought there\nThere are still manufactured and can be bought elsewhere uh so that's a comment from our website on point radio dot org let's go to Dave who's calling from Buffalo New York Dave you're on the air\nHow are you doing doing great day what's your thoughts are taking my call yeah go ahead [noise]\n[noise] okay yeah you know I'm a ... it said I'm a I'm a current year employee [noise] um I'm a service technician and you know what I'm we're just getting bigger and bigger\nOr not actually attached to that or the outlet uh-huh fears is always going to be there as they explained it to us if you think of it this way\nLet's go full circle years it was a catalogue company like I look for them to you guys are very interesting and you know Sears catalog company and then they started having sport more and more everywhere\nSo that now that the the digital age is here in the millennial vi everything on line just about and a llama I'm the father of than kids and I and I will watch your over Twenty years yeah you know a great place to work\nAnd I read and I'm going full circle\nSo they can just jump in here for like do you mean first full circle what do you mean by that because if you see your service technician in ... your your business is is is as busy as ever\nUm yeah they don't have your you know what we're on fears and the fact groups or are they said for appliance electronic because we do other I'm\nLike we do flows Home Depot or rules um that's why we do all the service\nI see Steve along with all the store\nYou know wherever wherever appliance just sold we do the orange juice or\nDave I'm going to take it back from your thank you so much for your call Sarah ... a with a Bloomberg opinion columnist Dave said he's feeling confident lease for his part of Syria's business and he's he's the company's coming full circle what do you think\nSo I think there's something to the fact that the services area is if if you had to call out some bright spots at Sears services would be one and that's a key part of their strategy of trying to revitalize the company as counting on that you trust them for those issues and so you buy your appliances with then\nBecause uh they had this relationship with you via their services business so there is something to that that this idea than coming full circle I think they would have to have a more robust e commerce business for that to be a plausible outcome and we just don't see them as a formidable competitor in that space and\nLook at the labor's been saying for years that Sears is going to shrink to profitability and that just hasn't happened they keeps shrinking they keep closing stores they keep investing in the e commerce business and they've had seven straight years of ... okay\nSo since you mentioned e commerce just just remind us broadly how much overall of American retail right now he's done online it it it actually maybe less than we think\nThat's right ah we're at the point now where I Believe the most recent figures show nine point five percent of all commerce has done online and certainly I it's it varies a lot by category right in categories like grocery it's probably more around one to two percent in categories like apparently it's probably more around twenty or thirty percent\nTwenty or thirty percent in a pair okay but overall less than ten percent correct instill in an even with Ninety percent of of overall shopping done in brick and mortar stores fears couldn't capitalize on that are having problems doing\nExactly and I think that's right yes this is definitely a story as Amazon and its disruption but it's also a story and so you're getting hammered by its traditional retailing counterparts I we we mentioned briefly before Home Depot and Lowe's ah those are two extraordinarily well run retailers that have taken share from Sears\nA best buy stock isn't your all time high is that is as it has staged a remarkable turnaround in his taking share from Sears and on the apparel side of the business a lot of the disruption there has been from off price stores like T. J. max and Ross which has been on a chair in recent years and taking share away from traditional department stores like seers\nWell let's go to John who's calling from Detroit Michigan John you're on the air\nSo I've had my first craftsman set of tools back when I was a teenager in the seventies and I was a you know no pun intended ... um and then when\nI got involved in the communities of Detroit and found out that there is actually catalog houses are right down the street from me that were built in the forties that were purchased right out of the catalog\nUnfortunately a Sears is kind of waned on the east side of Detroit or the last Twenty years and it's probably been done years since I've been in a series store because\nI they just don't cost like they used to\nYeah well John thank you for your call Vicky how are you the the business and cultural historian John reminding us that you could ... there was a time you could buy a house out of a Sears catalog\nYeah I think I might have lived in one of my cells are from the Nineteen twenties I'm In um upstate New York so I I'm familiar with them they're\nThey're lovely homes and um\nIt I think that they had their special special catalog devoted to to them that closed down I think right around the Nineteen forties I Believe on but you know you you can see homes from the turn of the century Nineteen twenties in any community in the U.S that he might possibly be able to identify them as a serious home yeah\nWell so they can hurt a minute ago a Sarah ... talked about how\nUh in two thousand Eighteen yes e commerce is huge and getting bigger but we're still doing Ninety percent of our shopping in brick and mortar stores and you've written about the rise and fall of the American department store so\nSo why is there seeming disconnect between how much we shop and where we shop and why some department stores in the years among them are having trouble hanging on\nI mean we haven't really talked much about Walmart and Amazon is sort of taking over our in our thoughts of you know as the as the big competitor for these brick and mortar stores but you know when I was writing my book I I thought mostly about Wal Mart as as a competitor for the traditional department store um\nAnd you know fears you to occupy a space that Wal Mart to I'm a I'm now does a as the largest retailer in the country a Wal Mart be overtook Sears and I'm In the early Nineteen nineties so I think that it\nNeeds to be seen it it's that longer um trajectory of it Sarah a signal or you know her early comments that's\nWhat happened to Sears not just about the last few years it's about sort of long term trend I'm going back to the Nineteen eighties and it it's it's it\nIsn't inevitable um I I Do believe that um\n[noise] uh that all of those uh missteps a might have made a difference you know in the short term of survival of a from like like Sears\nBut I Do think that if you look at the department store industry as a whole that that\nSector has been a losing out to the big box stores to just before them even a even before them the discounters target a K. Mart Walmart all all founded in Nineteen I'm sixty two and a growing up going through the Nineteen seventies\nThat uh the traditional department store of which Sears is it a\nPlays a part is more of a staple goods um standard where sort of chain right we got sector's been losing out\nYou know so I'm hearing over and over again through this hour uh Sarah ... a leadership matters right vision and an executive or\nW.

L. E. Y. travel dot com [noise]\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate bar ... we're talking this hour about a Trump Administration proposal to require pharmaceutical companies to disclose the list price\nOf their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising the hope the idea is that that kind of price transparency could eventually bring costs down but there is significant debate about whether or not that is indeed what would happen\nAnd we are joined today by Dr Michael ... he is vice president of medical affairs at pharma that is the trade and lobbying group representing the pharmaceutical industry in America he's also an emergency room physician and he's with us from washing today and we definitely want to hear from you were at one eight hundred\nForty three eighty five that eight hundred and four to three talk uh Mike Lee ... there's\nThis is kind of a basic question I Want to ask when they need to provide a little bit of background for listeners who are to do that so first of all I'm saying here that uh the department of health and Human Services says that the drug industry has spent more than five and a half billion dollars on advertising in two thousand and Seventeen nearly four point two billion of that on television ads\nAnd ha just also says that that advertising can result in increased utilization through patients demanding costly drugs and products based on messaging which increased government costs\nSo I'm going to presume that is pharmaceutical companies are spending more than four billion dollars on television advertising that perhaps there's some truth to what age age as to say that it can influence patient\nChoices so if they if the advertising is that effective\nI I just want to get to why the ... the farm industry is is resisting the idea of having some price trans transparency in those ads isn't it one of the best ways to inform patients I mean you're informing them about all the potential benefits of the drug why not informed them of\nThe material cost shirt\nSo I think two things number one I don't think it impacts per se choices I think it does impact awareness though what I think ads are meant to do\nIs raise awareness about a particular disease and lead a patient to have a conversation with their physician\nAnd I can say direct to consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals is one thing that brings patients to the physician's office but in the emergency department people come you know after seeking information from a wide array of sources I mean folks Google you know symptoms folks are reading Web MD they're getting information from a wide variety of sources\nSo I think all of the kind of mass media that we have today you know leads to increased awareness doesn't necessarily lead to that might not be the right medicine for the patient you know it may just be the start of a conversation and at the end of the day it's really up to the to the physician you know working with the patient understanding their concerns making the best decision for the patient\nSo that's kind of number one the second thing I'll say is that you know we do agree that transparency is important\nI think the point I'm I just would like to make is it really needs to be paired with with the help literacy effort which is why the company's I'm a agreed voluntarily to join the updated direct to consumer advertising principals\nSo that it's not just a list price that does not out of context and also has information on potential out of pocket costs for that patient as well as where they can go to get financial assistance or they need it and that was the point I was trying to make just about you know patients when they are um basically situation stressful situations\nUm if you're diagnosed with a serious illness cancer hepatitis are HIV we don't want people to be making decisions solely based on a list price that really doesn't reflect the complexity of the system\nUm there are tremendous amount of discounts that are negotiate and in fact there are some discounts that are written into law a Medicaid has a required just kind of mandatory discount that has to be given\nUm how would that be reflected in the TV I Would that lead a medication to to delay care when when there's discounts built into law there yeah there's a the VA has discounts there's discounts negotiated between private insurance companies\nAnd there's you know other discount programs there was a three forty discount program so\nThere's no doubt [laughter] there's no doubt that the complexity of the system is very interesting [laughter] ah but I've just I've just got a comment here from a listener or Facebook or Betty and sharp who says transparency is a good start but it is not enough what will work is if we stop marketing to the public would you agree\nWell I I go back to what I said before I think advertising you know well not everyone is going to like every single out that they see I think that overall moves the health literacy conversation in the right direction\nOr you think about an illness um like like depression to be honest folks didn't talk about depression Twenty years ago\nUm the the advertising that occurred to raise awareness about antidepressant medications let a number of folks to start talking about in terms of depression or you think about uh you know all sorts of diseases where folks just didn't talk about it it it wasn't um you know it was perhaps stigmatize the variety of reasons and maybe they weren't brought up\nUm and so while you may not like a specific advertisements um overall for raising awareness about serious illnesses like depression HIV hepatitis um you know infectious diseases vaccines\nAre there are all sorts of reasons why we want people to seek medical\nCare if I if I may I really you you're not really taking credit for increased awareness around mental illnesses like depression but you're not you're not letting advertising from pharmaceutical companies take credit for that are you\nI wouldn't say well we certainly wouldn't take full credit but I Would say that talking about things are putting things on television I'm raising awareness of what symptoms for things for diseases might be can certainly be helpful and moving the needle on illnesses maybe weren't talked about or somebody may not have wanted to talk to their doctor about\nIt well Dr Michael you bought standby here for just a second uh because I Want to bring in a couple of other voices\nInto this really interesting conversation joining us now also from Washington is Gail Wilensky she's an economist in senior fellow at the health foundation project hope she was the director of Medicare and Medicaid those programs during the administration of George H W. Bush\nAlso an adviser to John McCain's two thousand eight presidential campaign guild Lenski welcome to on point needs to be here with you it's great to have you and also with us joining us is David mitchell he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs and national bipartisan\nNonprofit group that's focused on drug prices David mitchell welcome to you\nThank you for having me to get a little empty you have an extended experience as the head of Medicare and Medicaid in America\nOr I just wanted to kind of get to the bottom line question first with you do you think that list price transparency in pharmaceutical advertising will lead to or could lead to reduced or reduce costs overall that's the goal would have happened\nProbably not a I think having awareness of the list price is not inherently a bad thing that people will make their decisions about drugs based on what it will cost them\nNow what the drug costs is in general if anything you could imagine a perverse situation where people think oh that's a really expensive dropped\nIt must be new and special and and very powerful maybe I should check into that so I I think that if you're actually trying to influence the behavior\nAccording to what something cost the relevant information is between the physician and the patient at the time when a drug is being considered and then the relevant question for patients is what will it cost me if I take this drug or another drug that's really what's relevant patients\nRight and and because of the way the American health care system a is right there are so many different answers to that question of what it could cost me and there's\nI mean other than calling your insurer directly there's there's no ... what's the best way to find that out because there's so many different plans are so many different insurers it's not a simple answer\nIt isn't as simple answer but usually there are some pretty general guidelines so if you are\nMedicare and have a winner is called a um a supplementary policy they'll be general rules it's something that you want to speak to your physician about it's important information because there is a lot of variability\nBut it doesn't really help people to have information about what the list price is for a drug that they're probably never going to you know\nWe'll do that just information that's not going to be helpful to the\nDavid mitchell is it possible though that the shock value of seeing these high high numbers for certain certain drugs could I don't know produce public pressure or on the pharmaceutical companies to bring their ... their prices down\nWell first I agree with what's been set already that are putting the list prices on me as if you're not going to lower the prices of prescription drugs in this country I also don't think that uh by forcing companies to put the prices on that they will be shamed\nThis country have shown that they're willing to be shamed all the way to the bank\nUm they continue to raise prices way beyond as you said at the top of the show a rate of inflation or health cost inflation these take a toll on patients like me I have an incurable blood cancer my drugs cost twenty four thousand dollars every time they'd given to me\nAre apparel making the New England or rain jackets since Nineteen eighty three committed to designing apparel to prepare for home whenever they have in store the new fall collection is on view at Charles River of heroin dot com\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions is a defender of religious liberty but his his support for one and\nThen there's a public face some government which are very protective of religious liberty and then the real world that they're doing is only protecting the religious liberty rights of those who are religious conservative\nI'm Mary Louise Kelly when the administration's views on religious liberty conflict with other priorities in the afternoon on all things considered from NPR News it's all things considered today from four to six thirty ... point nine WB you are\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking today about a Trump Administration proposal to require drug companies to disclose the list prices for their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising and I'm joined today by Dr Michael you borrowed he's vice president of medical affairs that farmer\nThat's the trade and lobbying group of the American pharmaceutical industry he's also an emergency room physician David mitchell joins us he's president and founder of patients were affordable drugs\nAnd Lenski is with us as well she's an economist is senior fellow at the health foundation project hope and she's also a former director of Medicare and Medicaid she served in that position or in the administration of President George W. Bush\nOr no deal if you want to ask him want to just get your view on what kind of an elephant in the room although David mitchell really just he he hit the nail on the head and the previous\nA segment and that is why isn't it that the the United States government or Medicare it has been given the power to negotiate on behalf of all the people who who rely on Medicare and\nAgain I Want to offer some some contacts you're on the differences that might make David had mentioned human era a as a very successful drug for it for its corporation or Abbey pharmaceuticals and in twenty Fifteen\nFourteen billion dollars patients around the world spent fourteen billion dollars in one year on this one drug uh and then the United states\nFolks are paying the price I'm from ... prescription per month was about twenty seven hundred dollars that same drug cost Thirteen hundred dollars in the United kingdom and eight hundred dollars and Switzerland the only difference there being is that we've got governments negotiate on the on the behalf of patients in those other countries to why aren't we doing that here\nWhen you need to stop using a word that you're using incorrectly as frequently done and that is governments negotiating prices are governments don't negotiate a price when I ran Medicare\nI helped set through the Congress that's actually does it a set prices or they don't have any negotiations going on with the physician community and the hospitals is to take or leave it here's what we're paying a you can participate in Medicare or not\nOr as you choose um there is true the federal government could set prices for pharmaceuticals that is what happens in many other countries\nThere's ... has been concern\nThat because of the very long pipeline between at the time a drug is first thought about and by the time it gets to market are estimated to be about ten years\nThat that very long pipeline makes it quite different than other drugs or if you have government I set the price uh unless there's issues is too low you tend to know right away because you start having access problems to physicians and the concern has been\nThat if the federal government said some of the prices too low you would not feel any of the effects in the pharmaceutical area\nFor six to ten years because of this long lead time uh that it takes a there was over they\nEnd up in your gas you a quick question about that so is is then are you saying that we need to just face the reality that the American patient the American consumer will forever have to be subsidizing the cost of this research while patients in other countries and enjoy the benefits at lower costs we definitely\nDo subsidize research for the rest of the world and we could stop that and it would have a disproportionately large effect because as long as we're willing to do it as a country other countries I get to benefit from that\nBut we can do things to make it a more competitive environment anytime there is a competing drug\nThat is coming along handling the FDA do everything it can to expedite the availability of that competing drug has been shown to really have an impact what we saw that for example with hepatitis C\nWhen there was one drug by gilly ad out of the price was extremely high when you had a second proud and come out by ... v\nTo a very comparable level to the u._k. now that is something we can control okay Judy either it will have a disproportionate I had done the amount of research people have to decide if that's what they want and that's what they're willing to live with\nDavid mentioned we like to respond to that I mean 'cause I've heard this again and again from you know from people like you who are experts in this that the cost of reducing prices meaningfully in the United states would be perhaps not as many new drugs coming down the pipeline ten years from now does that sound realistic to you\nKnow I'm\nA first of all I had an incurable blood cancer it's incurable because it mutates and finds its way around drugs I Will fail the drug regimen I'm On I'm already relapsed and then the second line of drugs so\nThe need for innovation and new drugs is not theoretical for me it's literally life and death but secretary of health and Human Services and former head of a CEO of Louis in the U.S Alex days are said recently\nDrug companies have tried to tell us we can't have innovation and affordable prices at the same time\nThat if we cut one penny of profits from the pharmaceutical industry that the innovation in America will grind to a halt\nI was a pharmacy EEO he said and I'm tired of those old talking points and the president is to\nAlex Caesar who worked at age age as maybe when Gail Wilensky was there um and ran a major drug company is telling us that this is a myth that we can't lower prices and still have innovation and new drug development and\nOne of the reasons is that increasingly it's taxpayers are paying or paying for the new driver with a member of the research budget event ... next year is going to be thirty nine billion dollars and they do the basic science there and increasingly they actually do drug development\nAnd then when the drug shows promise the drug companies swoop in and require the intellectual property and then president four hundred five hundred eight hundred thousand dollars a year so I Believe we can have both a and we need to return to balance from\nMaximizing profit for the drug companies to maximizing the public health while maintaining fair returns for the drug companies and a robust aren't the pipeline we can do that as a country\nMike Lee by was that you I heard there yeah go ahead yeah well I wanted to just jump in because you know I think you have to recognize the amount of of investment that is being done by industry\nTo bring these new treatments market David Was right to an age budget as close to forty billion dollars are member companies and the pharmaceutical industry spent over Seventy billion dollars last year on research and development cc almost twice as much money spent on are indeed by the private sector by the by pharmaceutical industry to bring new treatments to market and the way I think about it is\nThen age is necessary but not sufficient and I and I can't say that the U.S has this really incredible rich ecosystem\nI'm from the standpoint of just so much research that's occurring here you look at scientists from around the world that want to do their training here\nUm folks that apply to medical schools I'm from outside the U. S. they want to do their residency if they want to do research\nUh here and that's because of this rich ecosystem that we have the balance between a investment made by an age and then the tremendous investment it's made on behalf by the by pharmaceutical industry\nAnd I think it's it's also important to note that our country incentivize as innovative therapies it it it is a different system and the U.S than in other countries we balance um we balance that out by bringing\nA generic to market um a patent is so long at the end of a pat and life\nI'm two or three new um medicines comes to marketing the price drop sometimes as much as Ninety percent\nUm and you don't see that in other countries and other countries you see that they um pay more for generics than we do here\nUm they they don't value new innovative therapies the same way that we do and one other interesting point that I'll just note as most other countries\nAs a percentage of their budget spent about the same on medicines as we do so it's not that I'm if not the just medicines are more expensive and the U.S [noise]\nUm but you actually see the just health care in general is more expensive and so I think if you focus on medicines exclusively you miss the bigger picture and you miss the fact that there are tremendous numbers of inefficiencies in the U.S health care system that we could do a better job of a you know we can address and we can lower overall cost hot though costs\nMike Lee but a couple of quick things there so you you said that uh\nThat wants to drugs come off patented generics pop up and costs drop by Ninety percent but it is true though that that that a lot of pharmaceutical companies do what they can they're not always successful but they do what they can to extend those Athens I mean we've seen that over and over again with with different kinds of drugs that I think we have to at least acknowledge that\nW.

immortal words one small step for man one giant leap for mankind it that Neil Armstrong said when he first step foot on the moon\nIn two thousand five uh to sixty minutes Armstrong explained what was going through his mind at the moment he said those words\nI thought well when I step off I'm just going to be a little\nSteps and ... they're down to a fair but then I thought about all those four hundred thousand people that are given me the opportunity to make that staff and [noise]\nIt's gonna be a big something for all those folks and indeed a lot of others that even worthy involved in the projects so there was a kind of a simple correlation thoughts\nNeil Armstrong in two thousand and five and how\nJames hands and saying yeah I kinda thought it was going to be something big for people who weren't even involved in that kind of a simple correlation saving is he really ...\nDon't you love at first simple correlation I mean that that that comes from an engineer I think that this\nBut uh yeah I mean as I said and one thing that I I get this question what and you know did he come up with that phrase long before they landed meals answer always was that he you know there was some dance and work on the land I mean there were lots of things that had to go right before they actually could\nLand in why think about what you're going to say when you step out and if you're not even going to do it\nSo he's you know he told me and he's told everyone told everyone is whenever he was asked if he didn't really come up with the phrase until after they had landed and we had a few you know there were a few hours before they to get ready ensued up and that he composed it in his head while you know after the landing yeah very much\nTo say I mean it was supposed to say one small step for man\nWell that's what he thought he did say into you know to his dying day that's what he thought and there's actually been a lot of acoustical analysis has been done by different experts to see and I I was actually at the Smithsonian demonstration were NASA officials are and then Neal back in two thousand four I think it was\nIn and there was an Australian acoustics a guy who played uh in ... and he had evidence he thought that in the electronic register of the the sound waves that you could you saw something there that\nWas apparently an attempt to make the aid but it was an audible so I don't know I mean there's no way really I don't think to resolve this completely meal you know Neal in the middle way told me said well just put you in parentheses\nWill James Hansen hold on here for just a second because I have to say this this moment\nAh for those people who witness the launching of the Saturn five rocket who saw those grainy TV images of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin a walking on the moon and also by the way we should note Michael collins or as well\nUh orbiting around the moon alone has Armstrong and older and we're on the lunar surface it really left a as just a lasting impact on the millions of people who remember it because\nSomething totally delightful happened to us this morning we uh got an email out of the blue from Maria lanes she's in Watertown, Massachusetts 'cause she had heard one of our our little promos that we were going to talk to you today about Neil Armstrong said Maria send us email out of the blue\nAnd along with some pictures that she took in Hawaii when um when the Apollo eleven cruel returned to earth and it's just such a wonderful story that we've invited Maria to be on the show with us as she joins us now real welcome to um point\nI'm making a thank you so much it's it's my great pleasure it'd be with you\nIt is wonderful to have you and I want everyone to go to on point radio dot org and check out these photographs that Maria sent us because there are these beautiful black and white pictures of the ... the air stream of a lie a vehicle that\nUh Armstrong an older than Collins we're in after they came back to earth what were you doing in in Hawaii first of all what happened on that day\nWell I was visiting my uncle Frank uh who and his family we were very close and um I was Thirteen\nAnd he was on hit them air force base is commander of a large see one twenty four cargo plane and that was during Vietnam of course the Vietnam War yeah ah so um we were we got word that the NASA mobile\nQuarantine facility a streamlined trailer a would be traveling behind my uncle's house with the astronauts after they touched down in the ocean and were picked up by a ship\nUh-huh and so the pictures that you sent us a ... there's one in particular we used to you and your uncle standing there with with the uh the streamlined trailer going by and there's another photograph were Buzz Aldrin is in the window and kinda waving ... yes\nYes\nAnd the feeling was you know that he was just overjoyed to be home I mean yeah it was a giant step for mankind and they actually returned from the moon\nYeah well so all these years later a Maria ... why is it to that you still feel such like a powerful residents to to that moment\nWell uh you know I'm Still astonished at the courage of the astronaut their families the ingenuity of the enormous team that made it all happened\nUh and it was some discussion about the movie and uh the book um and that they went up in the space capsule that looks like\nYou know maybe a little bit rickety compared to that today's sophisticated spaceships it looks like a tin can to be perfectly honest [laughter]\nExactly exactly yeah so it's still so so moving and I'm so astonishing\nWell Murray Elaine from Watertown, Massachusetts a thank you\nCue for sending us does remarkable photographs were gonna share them with everyone who wants to see them on point radio dot org again it's images that Maria took a whole way of the mass NASA mobile quarantine unit to streamline trailer with Buzz Aldrin waste from the window after he returned from the moon Maria thank you so much\nOh thank you I'm so thrilled well let's go now to Margot who's calling from Portland Maine Margot you're on the air\nI ...

to require pharmaceutical companies to disclose the list price\nOf their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising the hope the idea is that that kind of price transparency could eventually bring costs down but there is significant debate about whether or not that is indeed what would happen and we are joined today by Dr Michael ...\nAt farmers that is the trade and lobbying group representing the pharmaceutical industry in America he's also an emergency room physician and he's with us from washing today and we definitely want to hear from you about one eight hundred forty three eighty five that eight hundred for two three\nTalk uh Mike Lee by there's this is kind of a basic question I Want to ask but I Need to provide a little bit of background for listeners who are to do that so first of all I'm saying here that uh the department of health and Human Services says that the drug industry has spent more than five and a half a billion dollars on advertising in two thousand Seventeen\nNearly four point two billion of that on television ads and ha just also says that that advertising can result in increased utilization through patients demanding costly drugs and products based on messaging\nWhich increased government costs so I'm going to presume that is pharmaceutical companies are spending more than four billion dollars on television advertising that perhaps there's some truth to what age age as to say that it can influence patient choices so\nIf they if the advertising is that effective I I just want to get to why the ... the farm industry is is resisting the idea of having some price trans transparency in those ads isn't one of the best ways to inform\nPatients I mean you're informing them about all the potential benefits of the drug why not informed them of the material cost\nShirt so I think two things number one I don't think it impacts per se choices I think it does impact awareness though what I think ads are meant to do is raising awareness about a particular disease and lead a patient to have a conversation with their physician\nAnd I can say direct to consumer advertising pharmaceuticals is one thing that brings patients to the physician's office but in the emergency department people come you know after seeking information from a wide array of sources I mean folks at Google you know symptoms folks are reading Web MD they're getting information from a wide variety of sources\nSo I think all of the kind of mass media that we have today you know leads to increased awareness and doesn't necessarily lead to that might not be the right medicine for the patient you know it may just be the start of a conversation and at the end of the day it's really up to the to the physician you know working with the patient understanding their concerns making the best decision for the patient\nSo that's kind of number one that the the second thing I'll say is that you know we do agree that transparency is important\nI think the point I I just would like to make it really needs to be paired with with the health literacy efforts which is why the company's I'm a agreed voluntarily to join the updated direct to consumer advertising principals\nSo that it's not just the list price that doesn't have added context and also has information on potential out of pocket costs for that patient as well as where they can go to get financial assistance or they need it and that was the point I was trying to make just about you know patients when they are um basically situation stressful situations\nUm if you're diagnosed with a serious illness like cancer hepatitis are HIV ... we don't want people to be making decisions solely based on a list price that really doesn't reflect the complexity of the system um there are tremendous amount of discounts that are negotiated in fact there are some discounts that are written into the law on Medicaid has a required just kind of mandatory discount that has to be given\nUm how would that be reflected in the TV I Would that lead to medicate mission to to delay care when when there's discounts built into law there yeah there's the VA has discounts there's discounts negotiated between private insurance companies pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers and there's you know other discount programs there was a three forty discount programs so\nThere's no doubt [laughter] there's no doubt that the complexity of the system is satirist a but I've just I've just got a comment here from a listener or Facebook or Betty and sharp who says transparency is a good start but it is not enough what will work is if we stop marketing to the public would you agree well\nI I go back to what I said before I think advertising you know well not everyone is going to like every single ad that they see I think that overall and moves the health literacy conversation in the right direction or you think about an illness um like like depression to be honest folks didn't talk about depression Twenty years ago\nUm the the advertising that occurred to raise awareness about antidepressant medications let a number of folks to start talking about the symptoms of depression or you think about uh you know all sorts of diseases where folks just didn't talk about it it it wasn't um you know it was perhaps stigmatize the variety of reasons that maybe they weren't brought up\nUm and so while you may not like a specific advertisements um overall for raising awareness about serious illnesses like depression HIV hepatitis um you know infectious diseases vaccines\nAre there are all sorts of reasons why we want people to seek medical care\nIf I if I may I really you you're not really taking credit for increased awareness around mental illnesses like depression but you're not you're not letting advertising from pharmaceutical companies take credit for that are you\nI wouldn't say well we certainly wouldn't take full credit but I Would say that talking about things are putting things on television I'm raising awareness of what symptoms for things for diseases might be can certainly be helpful and moving the needle on illnesses maybe weren't talked about or somebody may not have wanted to talk to their doctor about\nIt well Dr Michael uber has standby here for just a second uh 'cause I Want to bring in a couple of other voices into this really interesting conversation joining us now also from Washington is Gail Wilensky she\nProject hope she was the director of Medicare and Medicaid those programs during the administration of George H W. Bush\nAlso an adviser to John McCain's two thousand eight presidential campaign Gail Wilensky welcome to on point needs to be here with you it's great to have you and also with us or joining us is David mitchell he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs and national bipartisan\nNonprofit group that's focused on drug prices David mitchell welcome to you\nThank you for having to get a little empty you have an extended experience as the head of Medicare and Medicaid in America [noise]\nUh I just want to kind of get to the bottom line question first with you do you think that list price transparency in pharmaceutical advertising will lead to or could lead to reduced or reduce costs overall that's the goal would have happened\nProbably not a I think having awareness of the list price is not inherently a bad thing that people will make their decisions about drugs based on what it will cost them\nNow with the drug costs is in general if anything you could imagine a perverse situation\nWhere people think oh that's a really expensive drop it must be new and special and and very powerful maybe I should check into that so I I think that if you're actually trying to influence the behavior\nAccording to what something costs the relevant information is between the physician and the patient at the time when a drug is being considered and then the relevant question for patients is what will it cost me if I take this drug or another drug that's really what's relevant patients\nRight and and because of the way the American health care system a is right there are so many different answers to that question of what it could cost me and there's\nI mean other than calling your insurer directly there's there's no ... what's the best way to find that out because there's so many different plans are so many different insurers it's not a simple answer\nIt isn't as simple answer but usually there's some pretty general guidelines so if you are\nMedicare and have a what is called a um a supplementary policy they'll be general rules it's something that you want to speak to your physician about it's important information because there is a lot of variability\nBut it doesn't really help people to have information about what the list price is for a drug that they're probably never get any you know well David just information that's not going to be helpful to\nThe David mitchell is it possible though that the shock value of seeing these high high numbers for certain drugs could I don't know produce public pressure or on the pharmaceutical companies to bring their ... their prices down\nWell first I agree with what's been set already that are putting all this president as it's not going to lower the prices of prescription drugs in this country I also don't think that ah by forcing companies to put the list prices on that they will be shame and\nBecause the big drug companies in this country have shown that they're willing to be shamed all the way to the bank\nUm they continue to raise prices way beyond as you said at the top of the show a rate of inflation or health costs inflation these take a toll on patients like me I haven't a curable blood cancer my drugs cost twenty four thousand dollars every time it given to me\nClouds maybe a grudge our could be some sudden John you know low sixties\nWVU our supporters include Cisco presenting their new Web ex meetings used by fortune five hundred companies Web ex allows users to connect on video meetings in real time with a single quick more Cisco dot com slash go slash ...\nImmigration authorities are reading more and more American businesses\nIt looked like something that you typically with the to the movies not something you ever find on living a real life\nThe Trump Administration is going out for employers who hire undocumented workers\nThis country will not sure if we don't ... the way we can go over and we're\nThe immigrant labor on the next MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nTomorrow morning at five or ... students NPR News station\n\nFor their drugs in pharmaceutical advertising and I'm joined today by Dr Michael you borrowed he's vice president of medical affairs at pharma\nThat's the trade and lobbying group of the American pharmaceutical industry he's also an emergency room physician David mitchell joins us he's president and founder of patience for affordable drugs and ... is with us as well she's an economist is senior fellow at the health foundation project hope and she's also a former director of Medicare and Medicaid she served in that position\nOr in the administration of President George W. Bush\nOr no deal if you want to ask and want to just get your view on what kind of an elephant in the room although David mitchell really just he he hit the nail on the head and the previous\nA segment and that is why isn't it that the the United States government\nOr Medicare it has been given the power to negotiate on behalf of all the people who who rely on Medicare and against want an offer\nMake David had mentioned she mayor or a as a very successful drug for it for its corporation or Abbey pharmaceuticals and in twenty Fifteen\nFourteen billion dollars patients around the world spent fourteen billion dollars in one year on this one drug uh and then the United states\nFolks are paying the price um ... prescription per month was about twenty seven hundred dollars that same drug cost Thirteen hundred dollars in the United kingdom and eight hundred dollars and Switzerland the only difference there being is that we've got governments negotiate on the other half of patients in those other countries so why aren't we doing that here\nWhen you need to stop using a word that you're using incorrectly as frequently done and that is governments negotiating prices are governments don't negotiate a price when I ran Medicare\nI helped set through the Congress has actually does it a set prices or they don't have any negotiations going on with the physician community and the hospitals is to take or leave it here's what we're paying a you can participate in Medicare or not\nOr as you choose um there is true the federal government could set prices for pharmaceuticals that is what happens in many other countries\nThere's a lot has been concern that because of the very long\nPipeline between at the time a drug is first thought about and by the time it gets to market are estimated to be about ten years\nThat that very long pipeline makes it quite different than other drugs or if you have government I set the price uh unless there's issues as a too low you tend to know right away because you start having access problems to physicians and the concern has been\nThat if the federal government said some of the prices too low you would not feel any of the effects in the pharmaceutical area\nFor six to ten years because of this long lead time or that it takes a there was\nAlso an edge I end up in your in your quick question about that so is is then are you saying that we need to just face the reality that the American patient the American consumer will forever have to be subsidizing the cost of this research while patients in other countries and enjoy the benefits at lower cost we definitely\nDo subsidize a research for the rest of the world and we could stop that and it would have a disproportionately large effect because as long as we're willing to do it as a country other countries I get to benefit from that\nBut we can do things to make it a more competitive environment anytime there is a competing drug\nThat is coming along handling the FDA do everything it can\nTo expedite uh the availability of that competing drug has been shown to really have an impact what we saw that for example with hepatitis C when there was one drug by gilly ad out of the price was extremely high when you had a second proud and come out by ... the\nThe ... price of the drug dropped to a very comparable level to the u._k. now that is something we can control okay we can do the other it will have a disproportionate effect on the amount of research people have to decide if that's what they want a and that's what they're willing to live with\nDavid mitchell would you like to respond to that I mean because I've heard this again and again from you know for people like you who are experts in this that the cost of reducing prices meaningfully in the United states would be perhaps not as many new drugs coming down the pipeline ten years from now does that sound realistic to you\nKnow um\nFirst of all I had an incurable blood cancer or it's incurable because it mutates and finds its way around drugs I Will fail the drug regimen I'm On I'm already relapsed and then the second line drugs so the need for innovation a new drugs is not theoretical for me it's literally life and death but\nSecretary of health and Human Services and former head of a CEO of Louis in the U.S Alex those are said recently drug companies have tried to tell us we can't have innovation and affordable prices at the same time\nThat if we caught one pending of profits from the pharmaceutical industry that the innovation that America will grind to a halt\nI was a pharmacy EEO he said and I'm tired of those old talking points and the president is to\nAlex Caesar who worked at age I just maybe when Gail Wilensky was there um and ran a major drug company is telling us that this was a myth that we can't lower prices and still have innovation and drug development and\nOne of the reasons is that increasingly it's\nNew driver with a member of the research budget event ... next year is going to be thirty nine billion dollars and they do the basic science there and increasingly they actually do drug development\nAnd then when the drug shows promise the drug companies swoop in and require the intellectual property and then president four hundred five hundred eight hundred thousand dollars a year so I Believe we can have both a and we need to return a balance from maximizing profit for the drug companies to\nMaximizing the public health while maintaining fair returns for the drug companies and a robust started the pipeline we can do that as a country\nMike Lee boy was that you I heard there yeah go ahead yeah well\nI wanted to just jump in because you know I think you have to recognize the amount of of investment that is being done by industry\nTo bring these new treatments market David Was right to an age budget as close to forty billion dollars are member companies in the pharmaceutical industry spent over Seventy billion dollars last year our research and development so you see almost twice as much money spent on are indeed by the private sector by the pharmaceutical industry to bring new treatments to market and the way I think about it is\nThen age is necessary but not sufficient and I and I can't say that the U.S has this really incredible rich ecosystem\nI'm from the standpoint of just so much research that's occurring here you look at scientists from around the world that want to do their training here\nUm folks that apply to medical schools I'm from outside the u._s. they want to do their residency they want to do research\nUh here and that's because of this rich ecosystem that we have the balance between a investment made by an age and then the tremendous investment it's made on behalf by the pharmaceutical industry\nAnd I think it's it's also important to note that our country incentivize as innovative therapies it it it is a different system in the U.S than in other countries we balance a balance that out by bringing\nA generic to market um a patent is so long at the end of a pat and life\nI'm two or three new uh medicines come to market and the price drops sometimes as much as Ninety percent\nUm and you don't see that in other countries and other countries you see that they um pay more for generics than we do here um they they don't value new innovative therapies in the same way that we do and one other interesting point that I'll just note as most other countries\nAs a percentage of their budget spent about the same on medicines as we do so it's not that um it's not
