covering the Justice Department the White House and legal affairs\nAnd also in Washington is ... where he is national political reporter for Bloomberg Politics\nA and everyone you can imagine there's a lot of people who already wanna uh tell us what they think and and what they have to say about the cabinet confirmations so I'm just going to get a couple of calls in here let's go to William who's calling from Berkeley Michigan you're on the air William\nHow are you I'm doing well how are you\nGood thank you um\nYeah you know the whole process was disturbing I've done a ... an independent swinging mostly Democrat lost my wife and I and I thought it there's just so much negativity and what's feels like a\nIt's just constant constant negative energy that I'm I'm I'm bowling the red levels and leverage this time be\nGoing to vote Republican in the midterms\nYes yes and I and I and to be going on I was with you it besides a few off here and there I've never done that before no it's it's it's really amazing how um I'll just all the big at your back and forth to just to just to back it up\nOr at William thank you so much for your call let's go to Kathleen who's calling from Dayton, Ohio Kathleen you're on the air\nHeight and wanting things that I mean sorry [laughter] thanks for taking my call a anyway I I I was shocked that Centre College quite frankly because you know she clearly she voted lake and\nI'm Sorry ETT an arrogant privilege sexist old white Republican man and how Republicans couldn't be concerned about Kavanaugh prior to the sexual assault\nUp you know claims ... you know based on you know the questions lay he asked him about lying you know under oath and and and receiving a stolen emails and and then we have all these uh\nA law professor across the country coming out against him and and the former justice but here's how I got my weekend which I'd already been doing I went down into the some of the poorest neighborhoods in Dayton, Ohio on Clinton in St on little street\nOld industrial a parts in Dayton where I Am familiar with the secrets or fifty years ago and now these areas you know where it was white you know mostly white a\nMiddle class uh being able to work in the manufacturing plant the downtown dating and now it's very poor Hispanic black\nWhites and the majority of the homes are either in shambles or boarded off so\nSo we can I you know ... or I'm Sorry to jump in here but but are you telling me that like you you're out trying to turn to turn out the vote for the midterms\nYou got it and you got it and I was doing it prior to but\nCourage ever been I don't care whether Republican a damning independent get out and get into the neighborhoods neighborhoods where people are really suffering and and you know come on the Republican Dems need to get down into these neighborhoods and see what's going on for these people who can't access jobs\nWho who are living in ... homes which in shambles\nWho prior Kathleen I'm going to\nUm I Want to turn what you're saying to to our guest here a polar read your hearing a lot of energy there just from you know two of our callers one of whom saying he's going to vote Republican almost entirely across is out for the first time in his life and then you heard Kathleen there in Ohio saying she's going to try and turn out democratic votes so I mean how\nMuch can we tell how much\nHas this fight over just as having a really further energized I'm a voter's going into the midterms well\nIt is certainly energized voters going to the midterms to question is whether or not the GOP can sustain this\nOver the next month because well I said look better the cabinet confirmation process did not go how the White House had hoped but the one outside for that is that it was mobilizing voters ahead of this critical midterm election the poll showed that it was helping them sort of closes enthusiasm gap there were having trouble closing\nOn their own mentality has been confirmed now that they sort of solidified have solidified\nHonest conservative majority on the Supreme Court the question is whether or not they'll be able to continue this momentum she heard the president I'm Kansas over the weekend I think you'll hear him say this again him and his allies trying to sort of frame this as it's all Democrats trying to obstruct their agenda with vendors for the Trump\nUm that the Trump victory in a presidential campaign to try to continue to get people are angry enough to get up and vote in November now there's no question that that folks on the other side Democrat in the progressive and they are certainly mobilize and this has been a catalyst for many of them to vote aren't card others to vote\nBut again the big challenge for the president is allies and can you sustain this yet another month now Dick Pullman a here in\nPennsylvania we've got a brand new district map congressional district map and so there we have a lot of races that are newly competitive that weren't uh Israel in the last cycle here so how much might major issues like a you know the confirmation battle over justice Kavanaugh affect what's going to happen here no\nWell I think you know the capital things really in some ways for a lot of these new districts which are a lot more democratic friendly than the old when this when the new districts were by court ah\nAnd um they're much more sort of a ... they're much more of a sort of appropriate mix of democratic independent and Republican voters and the old district um and the but the Kavanaugh\nThing the kennel things relaxed and go to just sort of be a cap or on a lot of the energy that has driven a lot of suburban white women suburban white educated women\nAre toward the Democrats uh we've been talking about a blue wave for months uh I don't necessarily think that just because there's reports now increased Republican enthusiasm here and elsewhere that that blue wave narrative should go away because I think what's gonna happen is all depends how to do something\nIs going to land just proportionally in different places so a lot of the house districts where would you are strong suburban districts like a lot of the ones in and around Philadelphia\nAh our um aren't being energized by by women who are really fed up with Trump over a lot of Republicans over a lot of things Kevin are being nearly the latest\nSo you know it's hard for me to imagine that the Republicans excuse me the Democrats won't win the house and we need a net gain of twenty three they're probably going to pick up five or so in Pennsylvania alone at home there's twenty three twenty four districts nationwide that are that Republicans have that Hillary Clinton won the presidential vote\nIn in twenty sixteen those are very vulnerable so I think this whole thing about enthusiasm is going to it's going to fall different different places the red state Senate\nRed state Senate seats the Democrats have now that's where I can see a lot more\nRepublican enthusiasm may be making a difference from some of the year thing\nYou learn that code and Heidi Heitkamp\nOf rice you she might she might be tossed McConnell ... Mitch McConnell may be right when he says this is going to energize Republicans to keep the Senate the house I'm sure we'll\nSit he'll couple I'm going to come to you here in a second but uh since the Pullman ... mentioned the Senate and we had that caller Kathleen from Ohio expressing her distaste for Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her vote to confirm justice Kevin ... we have a U.S some tape here from Senator college she spoke with Scott Kelly on CBS is sixty minutes last night\nAnd said she felt very comfortable with her says her decision to support cabinet despite the testimony given by professor Christine Blasey Ford\nShe was clearly terrified traumatized and I believed that a sexual assault had happened to her what\nI think she's mistaken about is who the perpetrator flats I Do not believe her assailant was Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that's the ... center to call his also spoke extensively on the floor of the Senate explaining why she was going to cast that affirmative vote for Kavanaugh and then we have this strange happening\nOn Twitter where Susan Rice apparently hints that she might dip into into a race against Susan Collins wouldn't hold up for re election in a couple of years I mean what's going on there\nSwing votes it's arguable that if she voted the other way than Joe Manchin the Democratic came out almost within moments of her announcing her vote I Would have gone the other way and the cabinet nominations would have would have sunk\nNow progressive activists have already worked on a campaign to raise a lot of money\nMore in college fine dot com and Geico celebrating over Seventy five years of providing auto insurance for drivers across America more information on auto insurance available at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine forced to have an auto [noise]\nLove a good laugh team that you kind of cat to W. B. R. and the Boston Globe investigated\nThe largest industry I'm Kelly joined me and my car tomorrow night at seven pet how bleak in Boston for a life of a new methods that we'll go behind the scenes for\nThe latest in a search for their missing masterpieces detail that doubles the lie that was last seen on the entire thing a deep mishandled at\n\nThis point I'm making a trucker Bertie we've got a special broadcast today from member station W H y y in Philadelphia and we are joined today by Dick Pullman he's national political reporter and writer of the national interest blog at WHYY polar read is also with us She's CBS News correspondent covering the Justice Department the White House and legal affairs\nAnd it's a huge ... poor joins us as well as national political reporter for Bloomberg\nPolitics and so he only wanted to turn something to you here because we heard Paul uh especially talked about before the break that the president wants to talk about things like NAFTA or when he's out there on on rallies but perhaps the news about justice Kavanaugh has kind of around a lot of that out\nI mean there were some other issues as well that lots of folks were campaigning on him I guess primarily healthcare is has that whole sort of been temporarily set aside or do you think that that will will come back to voters and and candidates are going to come back to focus on these persistent\nIssues are that the the the country still grappling with\nYes healthcare certainly has not subsided now whatever happens in Washington you know what whatever kind of a a heated Supreme Court confirmation battle is happening healthcare has remained\nIn more polls than not that I've seen the number one issue for voters throughout this election it's deeply personal to them and I think the uh the efforts to the repeal and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act inflamed that debate\nIn kind of a unique way that we haven't seen but the bottom line here that the mid term elections usually come down to a set of basic fundamentals in that as\nPresidential approval rating and the generic congressional ballot and the last we've seen the president's approval as\nSome we're hovering around forty percent uh it's historically not good usually uh the president's party suffers big losses especially when they're Provo is at that level and the generic ballot we've seen it fluctuate a little bit but Democrats have him more and more polls and not enough of an advantage to take the house now for the president campaigning\nHis efforts on the campaign trail are likely to hurt Republicans in the house and help Republicans and the Senate he is very he's in a very good position to help the Senate Republican candidates who are trying to defeat a red state Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia Jon Tester in Montana\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota who is probably the most endangered Democrats so it breaks down differently in different places that Republicans have kind of a dream of a Senate map where\nYou know twelve out of the Thirteen most competitive races are in states that President Trump won in about half of them by massive margins\nRight well I mean as you mentioned in and Dick actually mentioned before the break that mid term generally are seen as a referendum on on the sitting president which you know could\nMake it a tough a tough challenge for Republicans a this coming November but on the other hand because of the acrimony over the cabinet a confirmation and nomination we are hearing Republican leaders talking about a re energized the base I mean Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on CBS his face the nation just yesterday\nSaying that democratic protest over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation had actually reinvigorated Republican voters\nIronically the ... first Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee and then\nThe overreach of the protesters at the Capitol is actually energize the Republican voters oh particularly in a red stage where we're trying to pick up seats out across America so I Want to thank I Want to buy the other side for the doctor it sort of allowed us to got to energize and get involved all of voters\nDick Pullman do you think that's enough to sort of overwhelmed the negative ratings or the or the low approval ratings that we have the president\nWhile you may be on the Senate side like we've been talking about but um you know\nHe's doing that in part because uh I don't know much else they they really have I mean you know we just talked to a few minutes ago about you know they pass tax reform but if you look at how tax reform as pulling most Americans don't think it's really making much of a of a bite or not by much of a boost to their income so that really has been going very well\nOr they did promise to a ... a abolishing obliterate Obamacare Obamacare is still there and as a matter of fact where Democrats used to run away from Obamacare as a campaign issue this year particularly on the house side they're bracing it and it's not just I just see it around here\nHere in South New Jersey a there's a long time Republican congressional seat that is a very uh it may took to the Democrats this time because the Democratic candidates by the name of Andy Kim\nA is every day he's stressing healthcare a and they don't talk about you know they're not talking ... aren't really talking that much about cabinet are much less about impeaching a Trump or anything like that they're trying to stick with what they think are sort of\nFundamental kitchen table stuff uh that um you know is going to sort of a you know cancel out any a protest but potentially temporary spikes\nIn Republican enthusiasm so I think with McConnell is doing is you know he's driving what he hopes happens he figures you know if they said enough and they still get up enough you know the hoping to believe becomes reality but I think they have a ... a ways to go on closing the gap\nWill probably read I'm going to go to a couple of callers here but I just wanted to give you a quick shot at this um you know issues like health care a persistent issues and and and Dick's right I mean we were out in a Pennsylvania's new seventh district or just this weekend and a lot of talk\nAbout health care and actually relatively less about Kavanaugh himself all the women across the board were very energized\nI think that's right you know having all certainly something that's that's fantastic that's here in the beltway and obviously to the hearings got enormous viewership there what interests but I don't know\nUnnecessarily how much that will really got into the polls even President Trump's election edited come down to issues like health care immigration I'd infrastructure these kinds of things and I'm surprised that Democrats haven't hammer the president a harder on the Affordable healthcare act in there a promise that need and and not kept yet\nYeah stick Pullman actually there's something you said earlier in the show they wanted to circle back to a little bit because yeah we can we can talk about health care we can talk about immigration et cetera but you made the point\nThat you didn't quite understand why Democrats haven't yet made mhm long term changes like that can that can come with things like Supreme Court justice appointments more central to their argument or they're you know the sale to just try to do with voters here do you think they should now\nWell I yeah I think they should I think they should have I think they should have a long time ago uh uh\nYou know maybe there's this whole notion maybe a lot of Democrats hold on to this notion that\nUh the courts are uh are impartial and independent and people and voters don't like to think of them as being part of the ... battlegrounds\nAh but the Republicans have successfully a campaign that way for years I mean you can go back to even the nineties late Nineteen sixties when President Nixon a ... then candidate Nixon in Nineteen sixty eight was talking about\nThe ah the warranty Earl Warren court and how the law you know we did more law and order campaign against the court in sixty eight successfully and so so for years Democrats of not\nThey have not stress the court uh uh and I thought that the ... what happened with the\nMerrick Garland in twenty six you know I think if you flip the parties around\nAnd and a Republican ... Republican president that an office\nAnd had nominated in February of an election year a well qualified Court nominee\nAnd who did you use and get ahead and you can get a hearing say from a democratic candidate I think it would have been stolen seat would have been a hash tag the entire year and I said I don't understand why they don't read yet so he'll go ahead\nSo yeah I just wanted to add a it's a great point that that makes because it was you know the decisions of the Warren Court from the fifties and and the Berger court through the seventies things like\nMiranda rights for criminal suspects brown versus board of education and and the backlash from the south you know to the Supreme Court banning racial segregation roe versus Wade that galvanized the conservative movement and they built a very very successful and very effective movement\nA messaging with voter mobilization with millions and millions of dollars to a vet Supreme Court candidates were were solidly conservative you know who would vote with them and with an advance their goals\nThey did that as a ... you know and and they were able to do that partly as a result of a backlash to these liberal decisions at the Supreme Court made in that time a ... a question I have now is whether the left can catapult\nOr you can do a similar thing now in an era where the Supreme Court has made decisions like Bush Gore on Citizens United which you know the the pro or anti campaign finance regulation ruling\nThat paved the way for a lot of dark money in politics to the Supreme Court decision and got the voting rights act and and uh they mentioned the\nBlockade of a President Obama Supreme Court vacancy with Merrick Garland by Republican leaders in the Senate\nKent liberal use that to motivate their base to care about the Supreme Court because right now the ... the conservative movement the conservative base has a massive advantage on this issue\nWill get a couple more calls here before we switch gears so

of the old seventh district looks like a Disney brawl were standing outside creed seafood and steaks squeezed between the Pennsylvania Turnpike and county line expressway\nAnd we're here with Kate Doyle Montgomery County lead for fair districts Pennsylvania\nNonpartisan group that's pushing for permanent change in the states district the rules\nWill live parking lot is little infants when it comes to the previous seven fish to Pennsylvania it is a connecting points it is approximately a hundred and Seventy meters long for\nAbout five hundred and fifty feet the old seven spread along contorted twists and turns for some fifty miles from the Pennsylvania suburbs to Amish country but at this pinch point you're saying bold could cross the seventh district in about sixteen seconds\nSo we feel it's really just as white as the first thing I mean why did they do that has to be configured\nIn other words no matter how strange the shape the district has to be a single unit that has been a long standing ruin Pennsylvania says fair districts ... who's also with us\nReferee ... both emphasize that gerrymandering has been a practice but loved by both parties but the huge difference now the availability of voter records and vast amounts of consumer information\n... says the combination of big data and sophisticated mapping technology allows district lines to ... from house to house

gerrymandering and Pennsylvania is adventures in redistricting and really what effort or what impact that had on Pennsylvania politics on representation here in the Keystone State what impact it could have\nAs the discussion about gerrymandering and redistricting is taken to\nBy Lindsey lives our species a multi media journalists were WHYY and also for Keystone crosswords and media nonprofit that's really focused on the state's political challenges\nWe're also joined by Terry Madonna he's a professor of public affairs and the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin and Marshall College as well now Lindsay and Terry ah I just want to play a little bit of tape for you because uh we were talking about at the very beginning of the conversation how\nPennsylvania's gerrymandered districts were struck down in January of this year by the state Supreme Court\nAh and this weekend we actually caught up with Valentino to Georgia oh he's the chairman of the Republican Party for the state of Pennsylvania and you know he's previously called and I've seen this in your reporting a ... he's called he called the January twenty Eighteen really a hyper partisan decision by an activist judicial bench and he\nFollowed that up with us this weekend and here's what he said\nThere's nothing in the hands of the constitution which says and not have to be fair whatever fair means to these judges took it upon themselves to say fairness means [noise] now what we think it means and they drew in the process what was for one analyst called the Democrats dream map\nSo it was that was just such a huge just to take and unconstitutional taking of a power by the ...\nThe Valentino to Georgia the chairman of the Pennsylvania GOP now lives he lives are ski let me just get a some impressions hear from you because first of all when did Georgia talks about this new map that the state Supreme Court drew they didn't actually want to have to do that they want they sent it back to the legislature\nTo draw new map but that didn't work out yes and so the timeline here was it was pretty much a crunch so around ... well on January twenty second ah the decision came down that the two thousand eleven map deprived Pennsylvania voters of their right to free an equal elections\nAnd basically it gave Republicans an unfair advantage and diluted the Democrats votes and basically they gave about a month\nI'm In between that time to come up with a new map so they kicked it back to the legislatures that OK guys you know give us your best shot that didn't happen and we saw these\nThese contingencies of different groups handing in math and just those Republican controlled legislature but Pennsylvania has democratic governor now they were supposed to agree on a new about the could it yes the governor was supposed to approve 'em the matter that the legislature um came up with it didn't have that didn't have\nThe first of all the legislature didn't do it the legislative leaders there there was never pass by the general assembly uniform of a law which is what is required and the Supreme Court in all fairness to both sides of the Supreme Court did not give the legislature\nI think adequate time to come up with a map even from the legislature could have come up with a map\nWhen when I met him and they went back to there's a clause in the constitution known as free in equal yeah which had never been applied in that way before I'm not suggesting what the court did was wrong or merely suggesting that they went back into\nA the Eighteenth century for the original constitution to find that\nThey're yeah they're living you both about that because you know we've had other cases that have worked their way through the federal system to the United States Supreme court but Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's who brought this case deliberately chose not to do that because\nThey saw the Pennsylvania state constitutions having stronger voter protections that even the U.S constitution but but Terry is indicating here that that this was a a novel reading overly ... well I think you also have to look at\nThe makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court there are five Democrats on the court and two Republicans on the court so we also see this change in the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court I'm so who are ultimately making the decision\nYeah that's exactly right I mean are they ... part of it was a political calculation on the part and are going into the federal court it could have going on and on and on for a relatively long period of time has it worked its way up through the through the Supreme Court\nAnd as that state court challenge was going on there was a parallel challenge off of you know different theory in federal court that ended up going nowhere and actually that the federal judges decided that no it's not they can't say that it's a a gerrymandered map\nSo there's a lot of detail in terms of what's going to happen next in Pennsylvania about these new districts that have been drawn and many of them swing quite dramatically from Republican to a balanced\nA Republican Democrat or into the Democratic category or um some of them become profoundly more Republican I mean we'll talk about that in a minute but the the point is is that a lot more of the districts are competitive now\nOn that could have a big effect nationally because the Democrats need to pick up some twenty something seats and they're looking for anywhere from four to eight of them right here in this one state\nYou know the reason why I wanted to come here 'cause I actually I'm also curious about a deeper question and that is sort of the divide in American politics and whether new gerrymandering is helping to drive that divide and if we reduce German\nVoices so so we actually went to the Lehigh Valley uh this weekend to to ask that question now of course ... not the only driver of hyper\nPolarized politics now but it does tend to drown out moderate voices so I just asked voters up there what do they think about Pennsylvania's new districts and here's what some voters even the ... valley told us about what they see\nI read the paper place for you for the church and uh\nThere's pumpkin pastry and pulled pork on the table at the ... United Methodist church it's in Pennsylvania is brand new seventh district in the Lehigh Valley on this day there's a meet and greet going on for Republican candidate Marty Nothstein\nA bulletin board hangs on one of the wood paneled walls reminding members to keep Jesus at their core\nIn the middle of the room as a volunteer has set up a life sized cut out of President Trump giving us arms up Brian Rodgers takes a quick break from the meet and greet he's a grassroots coordinator for the new Stein campaign\nOf a campaign staffer a lot of quick meals\nThe Lehigh Valley was previously split into a long lobster shapes district that captured heavily Republican areas to the west near Harrisburg\nThat made it safe for former Republican Congressman Charlie dent a moderate who never faced a serious challenge ... retired this year saying basic governing had become far too difficult in Washington\nIs old district voted for Donald Trump by a margin of eight points Rogers says the newly drawn district favored Hillary Clinton by just one point making it one of the most competitive races in this year's midterms\nI like to think of the valley as a microcosm of the United states blue dog Democrats to Trump Republican voters rural areas suburban areas urban areas and it's it's just going to be a battle and we know that we really try to better\nRogers calls no Stein a different kind of conservative primarily because his candidate won a cycling gold medal at the Sydney Olympics no Stein also advocates were strict term limits\nBut he falls in line with a GOP on key issues low taxes anti abortion pro Second Amendment rights also calling for an end to the Affordable CARE Act\nNew Stein is also a farmer and a small business owner and that's what excites Dorothy Nicholas she organized the church meet and greet\nHe's not a pie in the sky conservative there's people who are just the idea logs and he is not an ideologue he is a working\nMan ask Nicholas question does she think political compromise may be possible in her new balance district\nYou will always have a divide there because you're having the\nPatriots versus the socialists and\nAnd the global Nichols says there's another divide she thinks Democrats are encouraging a sense of victimization and women and other women at the table not in agreement\nForward I think she was victimized but she came across as poor me that would not have been our response not by any means we refused to be victims we we would have been angry and yet\nWhen he closed does not approve of the fact that millions of women and men are angry right now and they're taking action they're marching in the streets and protesting on Capitol Hill but to Nicholas that kind of anger isn't becoming it's not viable she says\nRyan Rogers Marty no signs campaign staffer puts it this way\nI think ultimately will come down to just the contrast of candidates are old thing has been results versus resistance\nWith us then gauge unlimited subscription students can access over twenty two thousand each text books online homework access codes and Buddy Guy's age unlimited P.

Pennsylvania Jason you're on the air\nFor taking my call um I I'm from law you love the district in Pennsylvania just getting is running\nAnd um I also helped I also did some volunteer work for a short Scott in the district\nHappy to see these two districts are now competitive\nEspecially the the ... district but um I'd really like to say I'm so vain you move further in this direction and make it more fair mhm and I really wonder why shouldn't this be more of a mathematical\nModel a procedure rather than a political procedure you know start are starting to top left or the state sort of mathematically work your way through the population and the counties in Kenya boundaries\nRight it's a good question Jason and I mean ... even falling this issue for a long time what do you think\nYeah I think you've got a great point there and I'm under the ah Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling um you know they they kinda borrowed from the state legislature or the state legislative district rules that\nYou know a congressional districts needs to be ... compact they need to be contiguous they need to split as few counties municipalities as possible and\nThat part is in consideration cannot supersede those neutral criteria so I think that\nYou know I'm going forward or the ruling does say that there are these neutral criteria that needs to be considered before partisan concern but you know the quick didn't go so far and say that here's where you can you know a draw the line as far as when a\nDrawing districts becomes to part is and so there's it's day but there there are some guidelines that you know or the legislature can use\nGoing forward but I'm Terry Madonna to to the point that the caller was making about you know are there algorithmic ways to get fairness out of out of district ... throwers or politics always going to be a part of this process\nOr I don't think you can ... I don't think you can remove politics Democrats and Republicans were both tried to advantage themselves and actually because of the algorithms and these are in these models that they now have they can be more skillful added there actually can be better a jury may during because of\nThe nature of they they can literally get down to the precinct level you and I just said not the district or the ward level the precinct level and divide and divided up the electorate in a way that benefits one party or the\nOther one's still is is that the rules for the algorithm and when I was think computers can do a better outlook on the call here Jim is calling from Akron, Ohio Jim you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call I live in northern Sonoma County up the Akron Ohio area and we of course of a ... a Republican governor and a Republican Congress and they\nAre about three years ago they came over in ... northern summit county which was a democratic area and we now have a Republican congressman ... when they see and ah it was all gerrymandered that's how they got us and we lost our our Democratic Congress\n... you may I made a thanks go ahead here even harder to make a point about this elections have consequences\nAnd what happened in two thousand and ten in the Tea Party election was not just that the\nRepublicans picked up sixty three house seats are put in another way the Democrats lost sixty three house seats [noise]\nBut then they took over state legislatures I think the number now and I may be off is thirty six state legislatures in which the Republicans control the state legislatures\nBoth houses and you can see what that means in states not every state does has done by law\nBut when you get all these Republican governors and Republican state lawmakers in state after state after state\nThat has a huge difference on writing the laws each day you know that govern redistricting yeah exactly and the actual process itself so the two thousand and ten election\nWas huge not just in terms of the\nBringing the Tea Party to power the radiological conservatism that represents\nGo ahead Lindsey yeah just to piggyback on that just one thing that I think we saw with Pennsylvania is you know\nUh you know one of the most egregious gerrymandered maps in the country we see one party control right we see that the Republicans control the house the Senate that the governor's office and you know they made the was they made the rules and there was no really check\nCombined the Democrats would do ... let's see if it's being nonpartisan about I Know you're not parties and but the Democrats have done that already pointed out there's a district in Maryland yeah so this is not part is in both parties will do that\nThat's exactly the point I wanted to go to because if if the regardless of party if the party has the power it seems very natural in terms of American politics try to consolidate that power but but\nYou know when Republicans do it and there have they have done here in Pennsylvania Democrats have done it elsewhere people keep talking to me about Marilyn a California back in the eighties\nHe is is that ... is there a way to come up with a fair system that does mostly remove politics from the equation and and I'm here let me just limited to them and let me let me play for you I'm\nA a little bit of tape here this is again Valentino de Georgia oh he's the GOP chairman of Pennsylvania\nAnd he basically just take he takes issue with that entire question because he says it's perfectly fine with legislators creating districts um\nAnd he really opposes the idea of any other system specifically an independent citizens commission or which we'll talk about here the second\nHe poses other systems to drop future congressional maps and here's what he said\nThe legislators are in the best position to draw a line than they are today heaven forbid politics should enter into a piece of legislation\nThat draws party you know political maps done all over the country Democrats have drawn maps of their favors and others they look at Merrill [noise] so [noise] you know this is nonsense this was part of a rock Obama Eric Holder fair disturbing\nPlan they call them to take back the rational seats and they've done it here in Pennsylvania that\nSmell the Georgia Pennsylvania GOP chair citizens' lives are ... basically says we know the state the best we should draw the maps but there is this other idea about an independent citizens commission what would that look like in Pennsylvania I just have to say I love that\nUm operatic music behind fail in Columbus Day festival here in Philadelphia is taking me there to south Philly um so you know I'd I'd groups in Pennsylvania fair districts PA um for a number of years now they've been trying to\nChange the Pennsylvania Constitution and to implement and independent citizens commission that would actually draw the lines and they modeled this after California\nAnd and this is really a grass roots organization you see them at street fairs out you see them at events canvassing and you know ah they they ... they're asking the legislators to basically vote against their interests to form this commission\nAs you pointed out it there is a such a commission in California made up of a appointed independent citizens and I think some several other a couple of other states in the west have similar similar commission so who do they work they have they created fair districts\nUm if you talk to the the people on the commission yes if you talk to voters yes I think a key difference between Pennsylvania in California is that in Pennsylvania\nAnd there's no referendum so basically um to get that process in place at the state legislature would have to pass a constitutional amendment and then it would go to the voters in a referendum\nThen there's no guarantee there's no guarantee that an independent commission itself would be truly independent I mean they have to be appointed by somebody yeah that that that that's for or hold positions by virtue\nMajor funding from point is provided by Geico offering auto insurance coverage for cars trucks or SUVs and

I'm Sorry to jump in here but but are you telling me that like your your out trying to turn to turn out the vote for the midterms\nYou got it and you got it and I was doing it prior to but courage ever been I don't care whether Republican the dam and independent get out and get into the neighborhoods neighborhoods where people are really suffering and and you know come on Republicans in Dems need to get down into these neighborhoods and see what's going on for these people who can't access\nJobs who who are living in ... homes which in shambles right\nWho prior Kathleen I'm gonna I'm so sorry to interrupt them and take it back from you there because I Want to turn what you're saying to to our guest here\nA polar read your hearing a lot of energy there just from you know two of our callers one of whom saying he's gonna he's going to vote Republican almost entirely across his ballot for the first time in his life and then you heard Kathleen there in Ohio things she's going to try and turn on democratic vote so I mean how\nMuch can we tell how much has this fight over just as having a really further energized I'm a voter's going into the midterms\nWell it is certainly energized voters going to the midterms the question is whether or not the GOP can sustain this\nOver the next month because well I said look the common are confirmation process did not know how the White House had hoped but the one outside for them is that it was mobilizing voters ahead of this critical midterm elections the poll showed that it was helping them sort of closes enthusiasm gap they were having trouble closing\nOn their own modality has been confirmed now that they sort of solidified have solidified\nOn his conservative majority on the Supreme Court the question is whether or not they'll be able to continue this momentum she heard the president I'm Kansas over the weekend I think you'll hear him say this again him and his allies trying to sort of frame this as it's all Democrats trying to obstruct their gender revenge for the Trump\nUm that the Trump victory in the presidential campaign to try to continue to get people are angry enough to get up and vote in November now there's no question that that folks on the other side democratic progressive that they are certainly mobilized and this has been a catalyst for many of them to vote aren't card others to vote\nBut again the big challenge for the president is allies can you sustain this year in other month now Dick Pullman a here in\nPennsylvania we've got a brand new district map congressional district map and so there we have a lot of races that are newly competitive that weren't a ... in the last cycle here so how much might major issues like a you know the confirmation battle over justice Kavanaugh affect what's gonna happen here in a\nI think [noise] you know the terminals things ... in some ways for a lot of these new districts which are a lot more democratic friendly from your own and this one\nUh and um they're much more sort of a they have a much more of a sort of appropriate mix of democratic independent and Republican voters in the old district um and the but the Kavanaugh\nThing the kennel things ... go to just sort of be a cap or on a lot of the energy that has driven a lot of suburban white women suburban white educated women\nAre toward the Democrats uh we've been talking about a blue wave for months uh I don't necessarily think that just because there's reports now increased Republican enthusiasm here and elsewhere that that blue wave narrative should go away because I think what's gonna happen is all depends how to do is just something\nIs going to land disproportionally in different places so a lot of the house districts were which were are strong suburban districts like a lot of the ones around Philadelphia\nA are um are being energized by by women who are really fed up with Trump over a lot of Republicans over a lot of things Kevin are being nearly\nThe latest so you know it's hard for me to imagine that the Republicans excuse me the Democrats won't win the house and we need a net gain of twenty three they're probably going to pick up five or so in Pennsylvania alone has shown\nThere's twenty three twenty four districts nationwide that are that Republicans have that Hillary Clinton won the presidential vote\nIn in twenty sixteen those are very vulnerable so I think this whole thing about enthusiasm is going to it's going to fall different different places the red state Senate the red state Senate seats the Democrats have now that's where I can see a lot

when he says this is going to energize Republicans to keep the Senate the house unless you're well\nSo you're going to come to you here in a second but ah since Dick Pullman mentioned the Senate and we had that caller Kathleen from Ohio expressing her just tastes for Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her vote to confirm justice Kevin ... we have a U.S some tape here from Senator college she spoke with Scott Kelly on CBS is sixty minutes last night\nAnd said she felt very comfortable with her says her decision to support Kevin ... despite the testimony given by professor Christine Blasey Ford\nShe with clearly terrified traumatized and I believed that a sexual assault had happened to her why\nI think she's mistaken about is who the perpetrator flats I Do not believe her assailant was Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that's the ... center to call it also spoke extensively on the floor of the Senate explaining why she was going to cast that affirmative vote for Kavanaugh and then we have\nThis strange happening on Twitter where Susan Rice apparently hints that she might do perch though into a race against Susan Collins wouldn't hold up for re election in a couple of years I mean what's going on their\nSusan Collins is obviously one of the pivotal swing votes it's arguable that if she voted the other way than Joe Manchin the Democratic came out almost within moments of her announcing her vote I Would have gone the other way and the cabinet nomination would have would have sunk\nNow progressive activists have already worked on a campaign to raise a lot of money\nFor whichever Democrat challenges Susan Collins and twenty twenty she has a sole surviving blue state Republican in the Senate so that makes her a quite a target I think our reason for voting for Kavanaugh was that number one she said ideologically he's acceptable and that the president should have a wide latitude to pick 'em adjusted as long as they're qualified\nWas founded by you our listeners somebody ...

considered from forty nine point nine WVU our boss NPR News\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we've got a special broadcast today from member station W H y y in Philadelphia and we are joined today by Dick Pullman he's national political reporter and writer of the national interest blog at WHYY polar read is also with us She's CBS News correspondent covering the Justice Department the White House and legal affairs\nAnd it's a huge ... joined us as well as national political reporter for Bloomberg\nPolitics and so he didn't want her to turn something to you here because we heard Paul uh especially talked about before the break that the president wants to talk about things like NAFTA or when he's out there on on rallies but perhaps the news about justice Kavanaugh has kind of around a lot of that out\nI mean there were some other big issues as well that lots of folks were campaigning on him I guess primarily healthcare is has that whole sort of been temporarily set aside or do you think that there will will come back to voters and and candidates are going to come back to focus on these persistent\nIssues of the the the the country still grappling with\nHealth care certainly has not subsided that whatever happens in Washington you know what whatever kind of a a heated Supreme Court confirmation battle is happening healthcare has remained in more polls than not that I've seen the number one issue for voters throughout this election\nUh the efforts to repeal and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act have inflamed that debate\nA in kind of a unique way that we haven't seen but the bottom line here that the mid term elections usually come down to a set of basic fundamentals in that as\nPresidential approval rating and the generic congressional ballot and lastly seeing the president's approval as\nSome we're hovering around forty percent uh it's historically not good and usually the president's party suffers big losses especially when they're Provo is at that level and the generic ballot we've seen it fluctuate a little bit but Democrats have in more and more polls and not enough of an advantage to take the house now for the president campaigning\nHis efforts on the campaign trail are likely to hurt Republicans in the house and help Republicans in the Senate he is very he's in a very good position to help the Senate Republican candidates or trying to defeat a red state Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia Jon Tester in Montana\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota who is probably the most endangered Democrats so it breaks down differently in different places that Republicans have kind of a dream of the Senate map where\nYou know twelve out of the Thirteen most competitive races aren't states that President Trump won in about half of them by massive margins\nRight well I mean as you mentioned in and Dick actually mentioned before the break that mid term generally are seen as a referendum on on the sitting president which you know could\nMake it a tough tough tough challenge for Republicans a this coming November but on the other hand because of the acrimony over the cabinet or a confirmation and nomination we are hearing Republican leaders talking about re energized the base I mean Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on CBS his face the nation just yesterday\nSaying that democratic protest over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation have actually reinvigorated Republican voters\nIronically the behavior of as first the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee and then\nThe overreach of the protesters of the capital of actually energize the Republican voters a particularly in a red stage where we're trying to pick up seats out across America so I Want to thank I Want to buy the other side for the tactics that have allowed us to got to energize and get involved all of voters\nDick Pullman do you think that's enough to sort of overwhelmed the negative ratings or the or the low approval ratings that we have the president\nWill yeah maybe on the Senate side like we've been talking about but um you know I think\nHe's doing that in part because uh I don't know much else they they really have I mean you know we just talked to a few minutes ago about you know they pass tax reform but if you look at how tax reform as pulling most Americans don't think it's really making much of a of a bite of not by much of a boost to their income so that really has been point very well\nOr they did promise to a ... a abolishing obliterate Obamacare Obamacare is still there and as a matter of fact whereas Democrats used to run away from Obamacare has a campaign issue\nThis year particularly on the house side they're bracing it and it's not just I don't you see it around here in Pennsylvania but over just across the river here in South New Jersey a there's a long time Republican congressional seat that is a very uh it may took to the Democrats this time because the Democrat candidate by the name of Andy Kim\nA is every day he's stressing healthcare a and they don't talk about you know they're not talking ... aren't really talking that much about cabinet are much less about impeaching a Trump or anything like that they're trying to stick with what they think are sort of fundamental kitchen table stuff\nUh that um you know is going to sort of a you know cancel out any a protest but potentially temporary spikes\nIn Republican enthusiasm so I think when McConnell is doing is you know he's driving what he hopes happens he figures you know if they said enough and they still get off enough you know the hoping the belief becomes reality but I think they have a ... a ways to go on closing the gap\nWill polar read I'm going to go to a couple of callers here but I just wanted to give you a quick shot at this um you know issues like health care a persistent issues and and and Dick's right I mean we were out in a Pennsylvania's new seventh district or just this weekend and a lot of talk\nAbout health care and actually relatively less about Kavanaugh himself all the women across the board were very energized\nI think that's right you know having all certainly something that ... here in the beltway and obviously to the hearings got enormous viewership there was interest but I don't know\nNecessarily how much that were like I feel the polls even President Trump's election and it did come down to issues like health care immigration I'd infrastructure these kinds of things and I'm surprised that Democrats haven't hammer the president a harder on there for the health care act in their promise that need and and not kept yet\nStick Pullman actually there's something you said earlier in the show they want to just circle back to a little bit because yeah we can we can talk about health care we can talk about immigration et cetera but you made the point that you didn't quite understand why Democrats haven't yet made mhm long term changes like that can that can come with things like Supreme Court justice appointments more central to their argument or\nTo do with voters here do you think they should know\nWell I yeah I think they should I think they should have well I think they should have a long time ago I'm a ... you know maybe there's this\nWhole notion maybe a lot of Democrats hold on this notion that ah the courts are uh are impartial and independent and people and voters don't like to think of them as being part of the ... battlegrounds\nAh but the Republicans have successfully a campaign that way for years I mean you can go back to even the nineties late Nineteen sixties when President Nixon a ... then candidate Nixon in Nineteen sixty eight was talking about\nThe war on the euro Warren Court and how would the law you know we need more law and order\nHe campaigned against according sixty eight successfully a and so for years Democrats of not they have not stress the court uh uh and I thought that the ... what happened with a mirror Darwin in twenty six you know I think if you flip the parties around and and a Republican ... Republican presidents been in office\nAnd had nominated in February of an election year a well qualified Court nominee and he didn't use and get it didn't get a hearing say from a democratic candidate I think it would have been stolen seat would have been a hash tag the entire year and I don't understand why the ...\nYeah so he'll go ahead\nSorry I I just wanted to add a it's a great point that they can make because it was you know the decisions of the Warren Court from the fifties and then the Berger court through the seventies things like\nMiranda rights for criminal suspects brown versus board of education and and the backlash from the south you know to the Supreme Court banning racial segregation roe versus Wade that galvanized the conservative movement and they built\nA very very successful and very effective movement a messaging with voter mobilization with millions and millions of dollars to a vet Supreme Court candidates were were solidly conservative you know who would vote with them and where to advance their goals\nThey did that as a ... you know and and they were able to do that partly as a result of a backlash to these liberal decisions at the Supreme Court made in that time a ... a question I have now is whether the left can ...\nUh you know can do a similar thing now in an era where the Supreme Court has made decisions like Bush Gore um Citizens United which you know the the pro or anti campaign finance regulation ruling\nA that paved the way for a lot of dark money in politics to the Supreme Court decision to cut the voting rights act and and uh they mentioned the\nBlockade of a President Obama Supreme Court vacancy with Merrick Garland by Republican leaders in the Senate\nKent liberal use that to motivate their base to care about the Supreme Court because right now the ... the conservative a movement the conservative base has a massive advantage on this issue\nWill get a couple more calls here before we switch gears let's go to Amanda who's calling from Charleston South Carolina Amanda you're on the air\nHi I'm ahead go ahead", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "08"}
