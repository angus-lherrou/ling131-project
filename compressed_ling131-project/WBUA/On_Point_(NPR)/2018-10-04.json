cure a medically based treatment plant a pill shot something that can stop the epidemic truth is there's very little that doctors public health officials or the multibillion dollar dieting industry have done so far that slowed the rising obesity rate\nWhich is why one reporter suggest it's time to rethink what we know and presume about obesity it's causes its consequences and its correlation with wellness and if so what would that mean when American culture is as weight obsessed as fat shaming as ever\nThis hour on point rethinking obesity and you can join the conversation have you

radio well joining me now from Seattle is Michael hubs ease reporter at the Huffington Post and author of a new article titled everything you know about obesity is wrong we've got a link to it at on point radio dot org Michael hubs welcome to the program thanks for having me it was great to have you\nUh first of all I Wonder if we can actually start off with your personal story that you tell in in your piece about uh about weight in your own life and amongst your family members and and why you really wanted to write about obesity now\nI mean I Know journals or are they supposed to say that but I've had a chip on my shoulder about this issue for my entire life because\nGrowing up my mother struggled with her weight her entire life and my entire life and what I saw it in public the way that people treated her was you know people in restaurants or people on public transit her friends would make comments about her family members of ours make comments about her\nAnd the message is always that she needed to be trying harder she was unhealthy and then I Would see in private the way that she actually lived she was swimming five times a week she was biking everywhere she would make us meat loaf the whole family and then she'd sit there and she eat a bowl of carrot next door she was always on a diet she was always trying\nAnd even to a five year old that just seemed unfair to me that everyone is telling the person that she's unhealthy\nThat she needs to change but she basically already doing everything that the world is telling her to do and no matter what you doing there always telling her to try harder and once you look into the data on this it's very similar across the country that all of the things that we know about obesity are much more complex\nWhen you actually live them than they seen when you read news articles\n... well let me just ask one more question about your mom or I mean you just talked about all the things that she was doing to be a healthy person uh but the response the reactions that she was getting from the world around her I mean how did how did those reactions affect her\n[noise] I mean it made her you know she talked me of that article the first time we ever talked about her weight in detail with for this article once I had you looked at all the research and things and she said that\nOf question was about eight to nine in the mid fifties becoming parties to Marlo to mid seventies that for a shower another storm tomorrow night brought a sunshine only getting up to about sixty degrees who's not even\nGoing on WB you are we're

create\n\nThis is on point I'm making a truck liberty we're talking this hour about maybe rethinking how we approach issues of being overweight and obesity in America\nAnd we're joined today by Michael hubs he's a staff writer Huffington Post and he's author of an article titled everything you know about obesity is wrong or there's a link to it at our website on point radio dot org\nDoctor if a team of Cody Stanford joins us as well she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital weight center and she's with us\nIn our own points to do here in Boston now Michael before the break you were sort of ... you gave us at the top three bullet points of the\nAspects of obesity that you felt that we kind of collectively misunderstand so let's dig into some of those a little bit more talk to me about the one where you you you said wait and health are not perfect sending them but we oftentimes feel as if they are with people who are struggling with their weight what do you mean\nOh well first of all I Want to say Hi to Pitino 'cause I actually visited her clinic as part of writing this article about a year ago my call this is how I was like we hung out together and say yeah I Know it was really fun ask 'em\nAnd I think I mean ... there's there's a lot of debate in the medical community about what exactly metabolic we healthy obesity means right and then some studies find that there's a small percentage\nOf fat people with medical it'd be healthy obesity in some studies find a much larger percentage and I actually you know if a team of feel free to disagree with me but I feel like it doesn't actually matter that we know how\nDifficult weight is to lose and we know how harmful it is the shame people for their weight and so if there are big health effects of obesity\nI'm not sure that it really helps for you know a neurologist to tell somebody you have to lose forty pounds before I treat your migraines I mean I think for people that do want to lose weight I think it's really important\nYou know I mean I I think it's fine to talk with a health risk in the same way you know I'm a gay man\nTheir health risk associated with gay people gay people are more likely to use illegal drugs they're more likely to have unsafe sex it's perfectly fine for my doctor to talk to me about those things but he needs to talk to me about those things in a\nHealthy and accepting and questioning way right of what are your sexual practices what are your drug use practices and not in this way that\nHello and then two seconds into the appointment he says oh well because you're using math I think you should stop using that I mean one thing that came away from me from your clinic Pitino is the way that you guys had an hour long appointment with patients and you were really listening to them and that's something that with primary care providers a lot of patients never gets that luxury of somebody\nAsking them about their habits and listening to what they say and believing them\nWell a lot of patients period will never get that luxury with their primary care physician doctor to ever go ahead\nYeah so I Want to touch on a few points number one um I went to remove some of the language or language that I wouldn't use with my patients which has fat or skinny I I can tell you that patients on the extremes meaning either very lean or ones that have obesity I'm often um are taken aback by those terms and we do know obesity is a disease process all say that the patient has\nEither mild moderate to severe obesity I'm so that we know that we're treating the disease and not labeling them by that because I Do think that promotes we buy some stigma so I Want us to\nTo make sure that we don't do that now this idea or concept of metabolic healthy obesity\nIs such that we look at a patient the patient we know has mild moderate to severe obesity but there's nothing that we're able to define\nClearly by taking like blood samples or things of that sort that really points to them having any disease pathology what we're finding is that this term metabolic fully healthy obesity as as a little bit falling out of favor because we're we're finding is that even in patients where things appear normal on the surface\nThey do have issues so for example\nI have adolescent patients that we send to weight loss surgery these are patients that obviously have moderate to severe obesity\nUm and when you look at them they may have no obesity ... conditions at the time of surgery\nWhat we do at the time of operation for most of these patients as we do a liver biopsy and what's that liver biopsy were able to determine if the patient has fatty liver disease\nNow if you look at their liver function tests if you do an ultrasound that their liver we're finding that it appears is that they don't have liver disease but when they do that biopsy we're finding that about Ninety five percent of these adolescence that we're sending to surgery actually have\nFatty liver disease Ninety five percent Ninety five percent of the patients we just finished a study looking at this\nSo that shows you that we're not picking up on something in a way that we\nIn an adult patients you a question of about this because I think you know there's something that Michael said that really is stuck in my head now where he he was I think he's pointing out like but but why should a neurologist do be talking to someone about their weight when that person's there for a migraine and and you know I Want to relate to what you just said\nEvidence of of fatty liver disease anyway\nBut let's look at what you guys just said and this is going to put all my medical have because that's why you guys have me here so patients that have obesity have a high likelihood of having migraines and just coincidentally many of the drugs that are ... there used to treat migraine headaches and also a great for weight loss\nSo when I find that my patience and I would say about fifty percent of my adult patients have a history of migraine headaches and have obesity I might concurrently be treating with the medication both disease process is I'm getting rid of\nTheir migraines they're losing weight it's a win win situation so I Would say that they're neurologist approaching them\nMaybe from the lens of neurology using that migraines as a as a key um place to come in but we recognize that remember we talked about every disease process that we know affects all organ systems sooner ... is one of the very important one Michael did you want to respond to that [noise]\nWell I think I mean the story that I'm hearing from that people are not that they're neurologist or saying you know we have a couple of morbidity do you mind if we run some tests\nThe stories that I'm hearing are we won't run any test until you lose weight I mean I've been hearing from people that their doctors refused to give them an MRI until they lose weight their doctors are used to give them fertility treatment until they lose weight\nI think when we talk about obesity care we tend to conflate\nWeight loss and the care that fat people get when they go to the doctor and I think that it's it's really worthwhile to separate those two things because not every fat person goes to the doctor seeking to lose weight a lot of them\nFeel like their life is fine if you like your habits or find they don't feel like they have to lose weight or they're already on a plan by themselves with their husband whatever trying to lose weight in some other way\nAll they needed a doctor to treat their ear ache right or if they if they get on a train accident they need somebody who's going to be compassionate and he's going to fix that ... D located shoulder\nAnd so I think it's really important that doctors take very seriously this idea that\nThat people are not getting effective medical care and a lot of people just shows up in studies to that fat people avoid going to the doctor because they're afraid that they're going to get shame for their weight if they don't get cancer screenings because they're afraid of what the interaction with the nurse is going to be like they don't want to be weighed and I think if you're thinking about effective care\nI think it's fine for a neurologist to bring up hey you know based on the research we have a couple of things that are related\nWeight might be related to migrants that kind of thing but that's not the kinds of interactions that people are having it's really important to think about how pervasive weight stigma is and how weight does this credit patience with their doctors oftentimes in specialties that are really only a tangentially related to weight ducks\nNever go ahead yeah so I Do agree that we as physicians overall don't do a great job of approaching patients that struggle with their weight secondary to our own biases and an adequate education surrounding how to treat patients that have obesity on what we do know and you do cover this in your article is that um education surrounding obesity nutrition physical activity\nAnd medical schools residency programs throughout the country is minimal at best\nI can tell you that there are several organizations working on improving the standards um surrounding this issue because we do know that forty percent of the adult population has obesity and Nineteen percent of the pediatric patients has would be the which means that this is by far the most prevalent chronic disease and so I agree that we do have some work\nUm I Would say that patients are concerned about the cure they're getting and if they want and dedicated care I Would seek out I'm a fellowship trained obesity medicine physician like myself are one that has undergone I'm training and certification by the American board of obesity medicine\nAnd I just jump in here for a second because if you're living in Boston or Seattle or Chicago or Houston maybe you can find that ... what if what if you're living in a rural county that doesn't have that kind of ...\nThat we're doing a really good job so the American board of obesity medicine has certified twelve hundred physicians in obesity and different sub specialties from neurology to OBGYN\nTo pass all gee in recent years and what you can do is you can go to the American board of obesity medicine site type in your ZIP Code and see what your doctors are certified and I'm In that area there is no pay wall to get through you can see\nYou R.

Stanford she's the obesity she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital\nAnd Dr Stanford and Michael so many callers I just want to ...\nWho's calling from Johnson City Tennessee you're on the air Seth\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em so I just got on to talk about something the Michael brought up near the beginning of the food\nAnd we talked about the way that his mom was treated kind of um by her friends and then kind of her behavior home um I think it's really interesting because I've struggled with my weight my entire life\nUm but I've never really what my wait hold me back it always seems to be the prejudiced reaction\nI'm kind of the stigma and things like that but I get from other people\nUm that really hold me back so Johnson City Tennessee the huge area outdoors activities or giant um\nSo I'm always very active however there have been several times in my entire life where I just don't get a good thing because people think that my weight will hold them back uh-huh I'm so it's kind of interesting but it doesn't just affect me but it also affects my relationship aren't very broadly\nYeah well ... thank you for your call a and thank you for sharing your story I Want to get Cindy in here who's calling from Charlotte North Carolina Cindy you're on the air\nHi thank you I have to play one of about the definition of obesity I Am a very low you'll are very active by well and when I got on the scale I Am airport will be so\nThat the very definition of a case that will tell us the number on the scale and my height\nRight around ... am I right\nAway but that that's that's that's one point the most important one I think it's that\nI never hear anyone talk about what is underlying the eating that if you're so you know as a society we we treat symptoms not causes\nI Know for many very obese are at absolute caretakers they're running school about foster kids they're carrying for everybody no time for them so they were like oh it's ... ...\nIf you will love for close and personal care tape and I never hear not walk up I very talk about that\nMaybe a solution to obesity is treating the thing is that people have\nCindy Cindy let me just jump in here thank you for your call because doctors Stanford go ahead yeah so I'm\nSitting able to address few appoints thanks so much for calling your number one I'm you talked about the ... which is what the World Health organization uses for obesity and I would say definitely there are some some challenges with that I can tell you that with each patient that I see I pay attention to the weight\nAnd hide that I pay very close attention to wait distribution so central out of ... wait that security met midsection\nIs most concerned because that does predisposed patients to\nUm heart disease and other illnesses such as fatty liver so I Would say that if for someone like yourself who seems to be a more muscular where it'd be a mind would not be necessarily the best criteria I Would pay attention to that we circumference of targeting a waste of Congress of thirty five inches or less than we do have significant study's based upon ATP three guidelines that support that\nI'm with regards to the psychology I'm actually if you look at um doctor ... members are Michael hops article he specifically did interview psychologist Dr ... song\nFrom them gee we'd center was interviewed and we do\nHave all of our patients um spend time with the psychologist delving to issues\nSuch as um what is the psychology behind 'em they're eating behaviors but not just their eating behaviors because of course that's the accusatory part I'm understanding what has been their struggles surrounding weight during the course of their life\nSo I Do think that that's a very important piece we have several psychologist like Dr song working on this and so um I Would I Would say that we do pay attention to that and I think Michael hops did do a good job by bringing those voices into the army so\nI Want to switch you switch gears here for a second I'm ... and take a step back and Michael I'll bring you back in here for this as well because I'm Dr Stanford I just I've heard you a couple of times in this conversation you\nKnow call ... especially extreme obesity and disease state implying that it's not a normal state now for some people are sort of a higher than average weighed might be their normal sort of bodies that point for their weight but\nFifty years ago sixty years ago we didn't we didn't see the rates of overweight or obese Americans anywhere where near what we have now so I mean I don't I I don't think anyone's gonna say that\nThe this epidemic that we're seeing is is normal right like ... and so who [noise] this is such a layperson question but I just want to get your fuel for ... and ... and Michael you too [noise]\nIs it the food supply I mean where did this come from is it a mix of of the food that we're eating and genetic predispositions or something because it does feel like it kind of happened overnight absolutely I think this is\nI'm really we are in an OB so Jenike environment so I call it the perfect storm will we have is we have had a change in our food quality we've had a change in our physical activity we've had a change in the quality and duration of our sleep we've had a change in circadian rhythm um disturbances\nIt with being able to talk to our colleagues in Russia and talk to our colleagues in India when we're supposed to be sleep here in the United states to tell you that maternity is terrible for our house [laughter]\nAnd I say that not not joking me right if you're talking about sleep and and physical activity and food and especially for people who you know a lower income getting that high quality food Michael you pointed this out it's like eight times more expensive than the food that they could get at the at the corner bodega\n[noise] yeah I mean you know four percent of our agricultural subsidies go to fruits and vegetables and when we talk to people about this kind of off brand advice about oh eat less and exercise more\nBut as soon as that people have the time to exercise and that their neighborhood has sidewalks and parks where they can go jogging and they don't have two kids\nAnd two jobs and a lot of people do and a lot of people you know if you're spending food stamps what are you going to spend your food stamps on you're not going to buy broccoli which is wildly expensive and doesn't feed your kids you're going to get something really cheap and really easy and frozen in process and whatever else\nAnd that's I I don't think it's fair to blame people for that I think we have we we tend to blame our choices without blaming our options and our options have profoundly changed since Nineteen eighty and the choices that we make with in those options\nI don't think there's blaming kind of frame for that really helps very much when it's simply impossible or too expensive for most people to do the things we're always barking at them to do\nAnd so the reason why I wanted to bring this up duck to Stanford is because we were talking about rethinking how we approach obesity and um\nEven in that context this conversation it it's not bad but I felt this conversation being pulled into sort of um you know a ... individual responsibility things can be done in the clinicians office et cetera but in order to really get a handle this epidemic we have to weigh outside\nOf that we have to go outside the box we need to bring together a person's and healthcare persons and that our policymakers\nUm physical activity facility schools et cetera I always talk about bringing together all of the people and that would really be everyone to the table to make this discussion really shift in a in a direction where we actually have any data on obesity rates in both the pediatric an adult population and and I think\nWhat we've done um with regards to this epidemic his work\nEntirely in silos medicine works by itself public health worse by itself um we come up with food labeling assuming that that's going to lead to change and obesity rate and we've seen none of that happened look at food deserts and\nOh if we get rid of food deserts that's going to change everything no we need to be coming together making these decisions together and really in order to make a shift in a way that's positive for the U.S and for the world well\nLet's get another call in here arena is calling from Providence Rhode Island Rena you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call um I in a primary care doctor in Johnston Rhode Island just outside of Providence and um [noise]\nA wonderful conversation I'm outside of my office just nodding my head very enthusiastically about all the comments that people are making\n'em and I had read Michael's article and sent it actually got out the other providers in the office because I think it's such an or in concept of how we speak to our patients about this and I just wanted to comment on the\nUm the nuances of how you speak to people about this conversation because it's so individualized it's a lot of times I'm trying to frame how I speak to people about focusing\nOn their health and you know wanting to care about the quality food that they're putting in their bodies and the benefits of exercise for how they feel about

body we're talking this hour about what Brett Kavanaugh specifically said in his hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and what those words again we're not looking at the past but what he said\nContemporaneously just last week what that says about uh whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court would joined today by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs and my editor green she's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist\nAt real clear politics and I just want to play one more moment I mean there's many moments we could choose from but let's just play one more moment from last week this is in an exchange with\nUh that that judge Kavanaugh had with senator include Bashar Democrat from Minnesota when she asked him to clarify his drinking habits in high school\nWas there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened or part of what happened the night before I Know I remember what happened\nAnd I think you're probably a ... or um and\nSo you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nIt's you're asking about young black I don't I don't know a view\nThat exchange went on and of course as people remember just having a after a break came back and apologize to senator ...\nAnd agreeing to play that clip and then turn to you because I think that was one of many moments where lots of people including you know what I'm seeing here you know Charlie Sykes a conservative commentator he said in the Weekly Standard pod cast the day after or on the friday of last week he\nSaid that um ... even if you support Brett Kavanaugh there was a breast ... that was breathtaking as an abandonment of pretense of having judicial temperament and he said it's possible I think to have been angry emotional and passionate without crossing the line that he crossed assuming that there are lines anymore\n... ... what's your response to that I think the fact\nThat he apologized to senator Clovis churches that he felt that he had come across as too aggressive\nThat I'm In the questioning and and he had said you know I Want to apologize was the first thing that he did when they came back from the break because I have appreciated how you handled your interviews and you know this is a really tough process this is you know it it's very hard and I want to apologize and she they had this but I found to be a very lovely reconciliation moment\nThat I can show that he was human because really got to remember coming into this he's coming in and he's kinda damned if he does and damned if he doesn't if he's careful with his speech\nTo make sure that he's clear and and I wasn't you know lie under oath which is the last person who's going to want to do that he understands the repercussions and he believes in our justice system then we're going to say well he seems you know on careful or as Nathan Robin said cagey\nUh but if she is colloquial unjust and says something like okay I'm telling the truth about these things that happened\nAnd the other people who were there they also say it didn't happen which is a click away of saying I'm telling the truth and none of them have said that I'm lying oh well now he's lying under oath and so\nMajor funding

culture today and we're joined by Madeline DeAngelis she's Twenty one year old senior at Boston College Brianna Picard joins us as well she's twenty two she graduated from Florida State in may and now she's a first year law student at the George Washington University School of law\nJak McCarthy is with us either Twenty one year old senior at Arizona State and Wesley Perkins is also with us he's a professor of sociology at Hobart and William Smith colleges he's been conducting research\nOn high risk alcohol consumption for several decades were at one eight hundred for two three eighty five hundred eight hundred for two three talk you can also reach out to us over Facebook and Twitter at on point radio\nUh and guess what people are doing exactly that I've got a tweet here from a gentleman named Steven Irving and Stephen I Hope you're listening to them about to read your tweets\nAnd the tweet is we're in the midst of a nationwide heroin epidemic and you find a shocking to hear some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what planet are you living on where that is in any way shocking magna\nSo that's an even if you're hearing this now first of all I appreciate your comment never let it be said that on point does not address the criticisms that come to this show in real time but I'm going to respond to you here first of all I don't think it's necessarily fair to conflate the heroin epidemic with a conversation about college alcohol drinking I think\nIt's not fair to anyone who is suffering are dealing with heroin epidemic nor to this conversation itself\nNow insofar as me being shocked that students who are under Twenty one or under drink to blackout in order to relieve stress perhaps I'm a little distressed not shocked about it because I think if that's the primary way\nOf relieving stress or or a manner in which people look to to relieve stress it does concern me a little 'cause there are a lot of other ways to relieve stress so let me just let me just talked to Madeline and Brianna and jak here I mean respond to what's what Steven saying and jackets\nDid a major way drinking to blackout that people use to relieve stress because I'm not sure it's the best idea when you're thinking the only way to relieve stress is to wake up the next morning and not remember what you did the night before\n[noise] no I definitely don't think that it was like the major way to relieve stress I think a major way to relieve stress to go with your friends and have a couple of drinks I brought it was saying you got on Thursdays it'd be after you have a class with a couple of friends and just have a couple of drinks\nThere's there's not like people aren't going out and be like oh I had a rough day to day I'm cynical blackout tonight like I think it's ... more of like you just it catches up on me let you go to a party and there's like ... you started drinking and drinking and then you blackout but there's a million different ways relieves stress and the button you know it's not\nA comment one I Would say OK so Brianna against even are being says ah why do you find a shocking to hear that some people blackout when drinking to relieve stress what do you have to say about that\nI totally agree with jak their million other ways to relieve stress I mean especially living in D.C which is such a ... century city you go for a runner you you go to the gym if you're stressed didn't have anything to do for school or work or other things that are\nDown on you or ultimately jak that and go out with a couple of friends after class and he'd grab a couple of drinks and then you go home and you do your homework I'm definitely not going out on a Thursday and then you know I had a really rough cold call in criminal law today I'm going to drink to excess and not remember what I Do tonight\nOkay good some of these clarifications because I thought I heard in the beginning part of this show I thought I heard all of you say that sometimes the point is to get to a blackout because things are so stressful did I miss hear any of that\n[noise] I Know I mean definitely that is sometimes the point but I think like professor ... saying it's definitely not the point the majority of the time um at least not now in law school in undergrad one needy your responsibilities weren't as much as they are earning now um\nYou might go out on a lens day because it's your birthday or because you know you had a really rough cat and do that\nBut certainly not the majority of the time anymore\nOK Madeline I yeah I also think we have to draw a different like a distinction here between the language that people are using and what they're actually doing because at least\nIn my license blackout just kind of used almost ... really like you you were like oh I'm going to go get blackout tonight but that doesn't necessarily mean you will it just means that kind of on normalized thing and it's part of the language almost like a slang term so\nWe're garlic as to what the comment on lines and\nI don't like I don't know that we are\nAll black out every weekend that would I Can't imagine that but I Do think it's part of our language out in a way that it might not have been before [noise] All right let's go to more callers Veronica is calling from New Orleans you're on the air Veronica\nHi thank you for taking my call um I just from here I already graduated

report by staffers\nNice nice I Am seeing here that they're going to sort of rotate between a group of Democrats and Republicans on each gifts and give each group or an hour or so to examine the report\nYes and then they will give separate staff briefings for them so that the staff will go over the report with them\nOkay ah how many copies of the report or they're just this one\nThere is one

this as a highly important document that deserves a secure facility\nBut are there agreements amongst the senators and or staffers to maintain the confidentiality of what's in the document I mean we're living in an age where would we be surprised if someone gave a press conference after seeing a seeing the document\nNo they'll be they'll be discussions or the Democrats are or have scheduled press conferences throughout the day and you'll see the Republicans were responding to the floor or statements back and forth on it now\nThe specific findings inside the report or confidential or are they are classified so well they're ... national security costs are with their confidential\nSo it would be improper for somebody to leave those or to put those out there are but I'm sure they'll be discussion broad discussion I mean we know that the FBI has talked to nine interview nine witnesses\nDr Ford was not one of them Dr ... before she was not one of them they did talk to Deborah mirror as they did not talk to afford which is interesting because she of course testified in\nBut there was the control of those witnesses that was worked out between the White House about who would be

I'm making a trucker Bertie we're going to spend some time taking a close look at George Brett Kavanaugh's testimony that he gave before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and asked the question of what that specific testimony says\nUh about his character and whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court now we're joined by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs he wrote a long recent piece entitled\nHow we know Kavanaugh is lying that sat on the radio dot org the link to it\nAnd like a green also joined us She's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist at real clear politics she worked with Brett Kavanaugh in the Bush White House for a little over a year and she recently wrote a column titled we can believe forward and confirm Kavanaugh as well and that link as is also at one point radio dot org\nOkay Nathan so uh you know we we read over your piece and we've actually pulled some of the moments that you referred to a in your article and I just want to go through a couple of them and get your analysis and of course and it goes response as well\nSo here's one moment it's pretty straightforward this is an exchange between judge Kavanaugh and democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and White House is asking cabinet I hear about specific freezes a that appeared in judge Kavanaugh's your book\nDevil's triangle drinking game I was deployed three glasses and try and and your quarters gr ...\nNathan Robbins and why do you highlight this moment\nBecause nobody's ever heard of this drinking game because there was no evidence of this drinking game a existed up until the moment that it came out of Brett Kavanaugh's mouth during his testimony a devil's triangle is a common slang phrase for a three ...\nAnd uh it's it's a sexual term and uh in Brett Kavanaugh's testimony she tried to paint himself he tried to reason to important just because throughout his testimony he tried to paint himself as a kind of innocent and high school that he was a Virginia but to charge you volunteer soup kitchen\nHe helped intellectually disabled children and this was all a way of suggesting that essentially Ford's picture of him was crazy it was totally out of touch with the person that he was now devil's triangle is actually a a minor one of the examples compared\nUh like the alcohol and like the just deliberate misstatements about about what other people said\nUm but there is a pattern and that is one example of a huge pattern\nIn which Brett Kavanaugh evaded admitting what everyone who knew him in high school and college says to be true which is that he was a hard partying hard drinking kind of guy and ... and aggressive and belligerent and he didn't want the sense that and so he didn't admit\nOr any of the things of that suggested that he did actually no power and think about sex in high school and uh things that would make for its out gives you more credible\nWell uh you know and just to add a level of I'm intrigued to this just after judge Kavanaugh said what he said about the devil's triangle someone with a congressional IP address went to a PDF and actually added judge Kavanaugh's definition of it um and that was quickly remove\nLater but but Nathan they'll let me I mean okay so what you just said let me just push you on this a little bit because we also see um I I Know the devil's triangle things a minor moment but to me it's very revealing because can't we also see this as a man who is so\nHe lives in push to such an extreme and it's so cognizant of how hyper partisan this moment is that he can he ... he is legitimately fearful of even admitting to you know what might I don't know I'm just what might be like kind of a junkie things that Seventeen year old boys say to each other\nBecause it wouldn't be taken as that it would be taken as an admission for something\nMuch much greater that he's alleged to have done I mean I think\nThe hyper partisanship of the moment may understandably make someone ultra cautious even admitting the slightest things\n... the problem is that there's this thing called a sworn oaths and you take it when you testified in front of the Senate and Brett Kavanaugh is a federal judge and he's seeking to be confirmed to the Supreme Court\nAh so it actually doesn't matter if you find details of your life embarrassing or you think that admitting them would make you look guilty the whole point is that you have to it's a it's a sworn testimony you can't lie to the Senate because if you told the truth it would make the allegations against you look more credible in fact that's entirely the point\nThe reason that he lied about these things I'm is because if he admitted the truth I'm it wouldn't help it was hard ah him in his attempt to make Christine Ford looked totally out of touch with reality\nAnd it's a green what he said I I watch these hearings because I wanted to know the truth and as I wrote in my piece I Believe both of them I found them both to be telling the truth to be credible now and I look at the evidence I think that it's more likely that the trauma\nAnd P TST symptoms that Dr Ford has described are distorting her memory and then it's quite possible that though she may have been assaulted it was not break having all and I don't think that the proof shows\nThat it could have been him to prove a and the number of people you have one person saying he was this type of person and then I hear people like a Nathan Robbins and saying things like nobody's ever heard of the stringing game everybody knew well those are not factual statements\nWe have people on the record under sworn oaths like eighty four women from the Bush White House attest to his character sixty five women from high school thing we've known him for thirty five years this is what he was like\nThat I that that seems to be discounted which bothers me as a person is really interested in the truth and sneezing statements like nobody's heard of it everybody knew as an example of that faith analysis and in this particular example when I was looking at this piece by an eighth and\nHis examples of why this drinking a meant what he says it means which I find kind of feel the mind it honestly\nIs nobody has ever heard of it meaning it's not on the Internet which we didn't have in Nineteen eighty three so it's not on the Internet okay so what DC area kids called uh drinking game devil's triangle which may have just been a circle of friends honestly we I mean who knows I don't have\nThe I I wasn't in the DC area Nineteen eighty three uh but that means he's lying and the additional proof as a Nathan's friend Pete Davis who went to high school in the DC area\nIn two thousand eight\nThat's not proof ... and I don't think that is even just crediting I mean I can find a friend to say anything I don't know ... Davis um but I don't think that a friend who graduated in the DC area and two thousand eight who says that\nIn the Internet age devil's triangle now means this thing is evidence that Brett Kavanaugh was lying about this drinking game Nathan I'm going to guess you want to respond to that\nYeah I mean look if anyone can come up with a source for the existence of this thing ah the procedure for having us testimony you know having to discuss that I really don't want to dwell too much on this because it is one of the minor things and the most major lives are much much much more significant\nAh like saying I never attended a gathering with the people for ... cents now on his calendar on Thursday July first he attended a gathering with the people that Ford says he attended a gathering with when he says all of the people she says we're there say it didn't happen\nIn fact one of the ... and he ... he ... he says Ford's friendly Lynn Kaiser says that this didn't happen that's not what layering Kaiser says laid when tiger says she believed\nYou misrepresent actually it would be all end if she believes belief does not mean that it did happen just to be well she believes that it did happen yeah which is the opposite of saying that they're trying to leave it didn't happen she believes that it happened right her opinion is that forward is telling the truth\nRight not but it didn't happen and so when Kavanaugh says all of the people she says we're there say it didn't happen that falls that's a false statement that the full representation of what those people say when he says he didn't go to a gathering with those people that's false he did we know from his calendar\nOkay so ... and like I'm going to come back to you for a second on this but I just want to play these two moments that Nathan is referring to first of all here is Brett Kavanaugh again before the Senate Judiciary committee last week uh in fact in his opening statement saying the calendar that he kept in high school a\nShow that he he says that he never attended a gathering with people that are professor Ford named\nNone of those gatherings record of a group of people to Dr Ford as far as my ... show I was very precise about lifting was they're very precise\nAnd then in an exchange with democratic Senator Chris Coons a judge Kavanaugh asserted that are the witnesses who attended the party that professor Ford said the assault happened that they have submitted statements are saying that it didn't happen and here's what judge Kavanaugh said\nI just when you emphasize all four witnesses who were allegedly at the event of said it didn't happen\nNow on like a green I'm actually we know that what the statements the statements of the witnesses submitted say that they have no recollection\nWhich is categorically different than saying it didn't happen\nWVU our supporters include applied vinyl math supplying mechanistic mathematic modeling simulation entered analysis to accelerate in the risk drug R and D more at applied biomass dot com\n[noise]\nI'm Charlie ... general manager of W. B. U. R. W. B. you our listeners are the best we asked you to protect independent journalism and you did\nYou and nearly eleven thousand of your fellow listeners put your contributions together to raise nearly one point five million dollars for WB you are in our full fundraiser from all of us the w._b. you are thank you for your dedication and you were generous support\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking this hour about what Brett Kavanaugh specifically said in his hearing before the Senate Judiciary committee last week and what those words\nYeah we're not looking at the ... once said\nContemporaneously just last week what that says about uh whether or not he should serve on the United States Supreme court we're joined today by Nathan Robinson he's editor of the journal current affairs and my ... she's senior director at the White House Writers Group and a columnist\nAt real clear politics and I just want to play one more moment I mean there's many moments we could choose from but let's just play one more moment from last week this is an ... an exchange with\nUh that that judge Kavanaugh had with senator Amy ... a Democrat from Minnesota when she asked him to clarify his drinking habits in high school\nWas there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn't remember what happened or part of what happened the night before I Know I remember what happened\nAnd I think you're probably a beer so um and\nSo you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that you didn't remember what happened the night before are part of what happened\nIt's you're asking about young black I don't I don't know a view\nThat exchange went on and of course as people remember just Kevin uh after a break came back and apologize to senator ...\nAnd agreeing to play that clip and then turn to you because I think that was one of many moments where lots of people including you know what I'm seeing here you know Charlie Sykes a conservative commentator he said in the Weekly Standard pod cast the day after or on the friday of last week he\nSaid that um ... even if you support Brett Kavanaugh there was a breast ... that was breathtaking as an abandonment of pretended of having judicial temperament and he said it's possible I think to have been angry emotionally passionate without crossing the line that he crossed assuming that there are lines anymore\n... ... what's your response to that I think the fact\nThat he apologized to senator Clovis churches that he felt that he had come across as too aggressive that I'm In the questioning and and he had said you know I Want to apologize was the first thing that he did when they came back from the break\nBecause I have appreciated how you handled your interviews and you know this is a really tough process this is you know it it's very hard and I want to apologize and she they had this but I found to be a very loudly reconciliation moment\nThat I can show that he was human 'cause really got to remember coming into this he's coming in and he's kinda damned if he doesn't damned if he doesn't if he's careful with his speech\nTo make sure that he's clear and and I wasn't you know lie under oath which is the last person who's going to want to do that he understands the repercussions and he believes in our justice system then we're going to say well he seems you know on careful or as Nathan Robin said cagey\nUh but if she is ... and just and says something like okay I'm telling the truth about these things that happened and the other people who were there they also say it didn't\nI'm telling the truth and none of them have said that I'm lying oh well now he's lying under oath and so I think it's important to remember is a human I think this moment showed that he was human that he felt he got too aggressive he apologized and ah I thought she accepts his apology and it was really nice Nathan your take\nWell what are called colloquial I call false right just just misrepresenting the facts that but I I say cagey for a reason I mean he us direct questions like I'm so your your book is a got a lot of references to drinking in it and he says\nI was number one in my class in high school\nWell that that's not an answer to the questions right and and for the drinking thing people dwell on it like we're trying to impugn his his character by accusing him of drinking is directly relevant alcohol comes up in all three of the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh\nIs why it's so important for him to be honest and to answer those questions directly nobody's going to hold it against him if he says look\nI I really yes it might yes I talked about drinking a lot I was voted you know president of the ... club like uh because I I drank a lot and\nYou know there's nothing wrong with being honest about that people understand that you move on and you grow up but he's a Yale classmates your time's talked to a dozen of his your costs money to all say that he's misrepresenting his record of drinking in college\nUm and and and they say that they say that directly we have his freshman year roommate who say they use it belligerent drunks\nUm we have the uh University of Washington I'm headed the are gone to college and go on to college you department who says I used to drink with Brett\nThe it's not credible she said it is not credible for him to say that he had no memory lapses I mean he even said that he'd never woken up with his clothes is different from how he remembered the night before that is what he said\nAnd we have people who were there who were participating with him all watched him all say that's just not credible he he he'd listen as high school yearbook he's part of the city club that tried to get through a hundred K. eggs in a year\nBut you know in March judges memoir wasted he's ... he's depicted as bart Kavanaugh who feel ... everywhere\nUm and he wouldn't even admit that he was bought a cabinet off um he was asked about that and he said oh you'd have to ask mark judge will ... you wouldn't have to ask mark judge because we know that his nickname in high school was bought that's also when you\nLook at let's take a call here Nathan is calling from Milwaukee, Wisconsin you're on the air Nathan\nI thank you very much for having me I was going to mention I did think that Brett Kavanaugh was lying and I wanted to say so it was already pointed out was claiming that everybody refuted was when he said people refuted the allegations about him one that wasn't true\nI also talk to the claim that there was a Clinton revenge street going as over the top accusations but I don't think the fact that he lied to Congress and she can be wide regardless of whether or not a show you lead regardless of if you will your doctor for it or not\nI don't think that will stop to Republicans being from Wisconsin I saw Scott Walker lying to Congress back when he was getting a lot of attention from act turns and none of the Republicans are scared about it or want to do\nAnd then I don't think they're doing now\nIn measuring the group of people supporting ethanol I found it very ironic that they have the phrase stand with Kavanaugh because it reminds me of the phrase stand with Walker in my experience was that's a political slogan used to cover up on trustworthy person\nWell look people there's a hash tag I stand with Christine I mean stand with so and so it seems to be a very very common way of expressing support for whomever it is that you expressed support for Nathan\nOh okay I'll I'll I'll open up that far but we I see a lot of yard signs saying a stand with Walker and white that somebody who's not trustworthy so when you actually have a science thing that was it was kind of law I'm like oh my gosh okay over again\nNathan thank you for your call and it's a green let me turn back to you I think Nathan is broader point is that he doesn't feel that no matter you know whether that that no matter the number of pieces of evidence of misstatements that the judge Kavanaugh may have or may not have made I Know there's obviously disagreement over that but\nIn Nathan sees he sees a whole line of misstatements and no matter how long that line is he doesn't think it matters to Congress and all of the congressional Republicans and they're going to\nA they're going to confirm him anyway and uh he he objects to that but what's your response to Nathan\nWell actually what needs and the things that he sees a line of lives and that is much stronger than misstatements I mean I I as a more trying to see this more objectively I say well maybe he did make misstatements\nUm I don't think that that for example he never said he didn't drink in high school he did say yeah I drink in high school sometimes I drink too much sometimes others drank too much that's what that's the way he sat in front of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd in his calendar you know you look at a statement like oh well they said that I look at my calendar there's no gatherings like those described there is no gathering that says that leave when Carter was there to also said\n\n\n\n\n\n", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)",
