moved here from Korea they thought they wouldn't be able to give you the life you deserved\nIt's the first story I can recall when what shape the hundred others once I was old enough and brave enough

of her biological family were at one eight hundred and forty three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nUh Nicole ... in a minute I Do want to hear the story about how and when you decided to sort of find the answers to the questions that were bubbling up in your life [noise] um\nBut but just the right trying to figure out the right way to say this but I'm just trying to I\nWant to get a sense of ... you're not saying that you never felt on loved by your parents right oh no I never felt among okay hadn't yeah 'cause 'cause I think part of me is responding to your story as a I'm a parent myself not of the of adopted children mind you but\nAnd I just feel like parents always try their best right they always do what what they tried to do the best with what they have in their tool kit\nAnd it sounds to me like is what you're saying that the your adoptive parents didn't quite have the tool kit that you needed them to have a as as a as a child of a different race I mean thinking about this\nFrom their perspective which I've tried to do a lot um partly because I'm a parent myself and I I really sympathize and I know how difficult it is\nUm I have no illusions about like mistakes that I've made or just things I Wish I had in my toolkit but I think in a way you know they weren't especially well served by the advice they were given at the time either I think and they've expressed this to me that they wish they had\nBeen offered more in the way of information not like warning that don't think they would have decided not to adopt the trans racially if they'd gotten more information but at the time that wasn't a conversation anybody was having with them\nUm and I think they have you know real regrets about that just from their own perspective as well because\nI think it was difficult for them later hearing and I had gone through some things that I didn't know how to talk with them about that we didn't know how to talk about as a family\nUm that maybe we we all should have been like collectively better equipped to handle you know I'm so it's not like a matter of like blame or like definitely not wishing that I hadn't been adopted are adopted by them it's just more\nWe all wish that we'd gotten different information and they really did try to their credit to seek it out at the time you ask many questions just nobody really was telling them these are some things maybe you should be aware of these are some things you can expect you should think about how you answer this question or\nYou know talk to your child about racism and nobody was saying that to them and it was really the job of the people they were talking to ... to have those conversations I think\nOkay now so I can hear it and fully understand how the the pain of the experiences that you were having those races experiences that\nYou talked about uh was was something ... difficult enough to handle 'em or know know what to do with her how to come through that but in addition to that ... was there was there all along and\nThat you had um it just sort of internally with racism aside to sort of Missouri longing we're empty nesters something that you felt that needed to be filled because of you know the fact that when you looked in the mirror you didn't see the same features we're complex and as you saw with your parents yeah I think it was it wasn't so much an\nEmpty nest or I felt like something was missing I there are two parts of it one was that I really did keenly feel once I was old enough to notice and once\nI was old enough to have it pointed out to me it did really feel those differences strongly I'm In a way I got used to be like one of the few or one of the only ones in the room or the school or the space I was in but it was never really fully comfortable\nUm I don't know the closest I can comment like thinking about\nIt it was sort of like when I left my home town it I had a lot of great friendships in great relationships and I love my family and and all of that but it it really felt like sort of coming out of a cramped little space that wasn't quite big enough\nLike it it just felt I never really felt fully comfortable and I don't think that was just the adoption you know I think a lot of that was just a function of where I grew up it was a a predominantly white area I went to like Barry White schools especially my grade school\nUm you know so that that was definitely some discomfort and then the other part is I I really did feel this curiosity this longing to know more about my birth family there was so little that we really knew for sure\nEspecially as I got older and realized you know maybe maybe some of this is guesswork maybe they're just things that I'm thinking are assuming are true that that might not be an can I live with never really knowing the actual answers what matters finally decided to reach out to them or trying to find them\nA lot of things it's interesting because I write in the book my pregnancy with my first child was a really strong push 'em something\nMaybe um if it hadn't become apparent but other times I'm convinced that I Would other eventually search no matter what you know it's nothing that have a firm answer to I'd certainly been curious and wondered\nUm I had gotten a little bit of information and that was available to me without making contact or the state of Washington where I was adopted\nYou could petition basically for non identifying like basic social history no names addresses but like general very general information I got that and it was very very little but I had done that I had done some research and I knew so what a search would involve\nUm but it was really my pregnancy that that was the final punished I remember sitting at um my first ... natal appointment talking with a midwife and she was asking me all these questions about my medical history and my family history and my mother's pregnancies and her birth\n'em and why I was born so prematurely ah because I was I was born about ten weeks early and you and I don't know I had no answer that was actually really scary to be facing my first pregnancy and I knew nothing and like as an adoptee I'm not saying all adoptees feel this way but I felt so unprepared for pregnancy and labor and child birth it just\nI don't know something about my ... my mother and my adopted mother had not gone through that with me it was like my my whole life began when I was adopted I couldn't imagine stuff that came before and I wanted I was excited to have a family but I was really scared and also\nYeah I I don't know I felt like the story it wasn't just about the health history the medical information I didn't have that could be important I felt all of a sudden like\nI don't have enough to offer this child you know one day they'll grow up and they'll have questions about our family and our history and like what am I going to stay is what I have good enough for them is a good enough for me anymore and so that was really when I decided okay I'm going to go ahead\nI'm and I so I really began that process yeah and I first trimester you know I think every parent\nGo through those ... that set of questions about is what I have good enough for my child and they can only those questions only become far more acute when there's so many on answered\nA issues in in the the parent's life so I hear you on that I'm Nicole we've got a lot of callers who want to join us and uh and I just want to get at least a couple of them here to be able to share

R. dot org slash cars and thanks [noise]\nThis is on point I'm making the chocolate party were speaking to start with Nicole ... her new memoir is all you can never know what's her story of her transracial adoption\nAnd joining us as well as Joyce McGuire pave oh she is the founder of the center for family connections and nonprofit that serves children and blended families for more than Thirty years a note Nicole just I Wonder if you could just briefly tell us what happened\nWith your with your biological family because I imagined that growing up there's a there's a very understandable tendency to idealize the people that you don't know it was at that age that I deal wasn't wasn't fully ... I mean it's always\nDangerous idealize in people you've never met her um you know a lot of ways it it really was sort of a confirmation of the story I'd gotten as a child but much deeper and richer and more complicated um and it was interesting you know I\nI hadn't thought enough honestly about my birth parents perspective in what it must have been like like what factors could have led to the adoption that was something\nI guess I wondered about in a way as a kid but I it didn't have them maybe emotional maturity or knowledge of the world to really consider what they might have gone through I was not expecting um to find\nYou know a story that had so much like trauma really um and lost that had nothing to do with my adopted and you know things that were just difficult if they were dealing with um that you know ... might have been factors in the adoption certainly but weren't like directly caused by for example\nUm so when I first reached out to them and I did Sylvia a confidential intermediary a under Washington state law\nAt the time I was placed in at the time I searched had to go through a third party so that person forwarded a letter from me and before we could exchange any identifying information like things like last names and addresses and really specifics about our lives you know we had to get various forms completed and it had to be by mutual consent\nUm so that also made the process take a little bit longer um but I reached out through the intermediary um and my birth parents at the time I found them had been divorced for many years so I wrote to them separately\nAnd I'm so there's like two different reunions really with two different branches of the family instead of the one ... and like not easily I had always pictured like talking with and meeting them or reconnecting with him at least like together so that was I was interested I was my first surprise\nUm and what I found initially or was that they hadn't never told um my sisters my biological sisters I have a half sister and a full sister and uh they were living at home at the time I was placed then they'd never been told about the adoption they'd been holding died at birth\nAnd All right when I wrote to my birth parents um you know do too I think the language barrier or just some difficulty translating the letter um that was sort of how my sister's got involved and how they found out\nAnd it was definitely a shot for them you know as as little as I knew they knew even less than I did and uh so it was really it was like a it was a whole family is sort of reconnection about as I mentioned segmented into like different different branch 'em well that was it was unexpected [laughter]\nWell I mean so Joyce adoptions are so complicated right because you're dealing with the lives of the the lives of so many people at ... at the ... the most vulnerable point probably in their lives so we've been hearing Nicole say that\nThat her biological parents hadn't even told there are other children I mean how how do you would ... I don't know how is that unusual not really\nIsn't I mean there's a lot of shame and guilt and you know really deep emotions and although no one in adoption gets enough support and help and training and and treatment\nBirth parents get the least and they just leave and have to figure it out themselves and often there is a history of more Lawson trauma in their lives and as Nicole said sometimes it's not related directly to the adoption it was something that was going on anyway\nUm so at this isn't a surprise and how do you tell your other children\nUm that one of them is gone and why so there's you know and also there's the cultural\nIssues I mean this this family was a immigrant family and so it it's not something they usually do place children for adoption and they in their situation so I think there's so many pieces to this that are familiar\nAnd difficult and again every store is a case study of one this is not every story about every birth parents but it's the whole family story\nAnd Nicole so then as you began to form relationships I mean especially with one of her sisters did you know ... were you in the book the ... the question that you that keeps coming up in my mind is did that process than help\nUh you know fill those gaps that you said you were you had been feeling growing up with your adopted family did it get you to the place that you would ... you were hoping to to to go to I think\nThe primary gaps I was aware of at the time I searched for just simply kind of gaps and knowledge which is not to minimize maybe emotional or\nOther other factors I certainly cared about 'em I cared about ... about my adoption I was curious about my birth family there was a lot I wanted to know and questions I Would have loved to have the opportunity to opportunity to ask which is one of the reasons I searched but I think it was real\nIs Cindy from whom I got a lot of information um you know she was she was very shocked and she had a lot of questions um\nAnd so I think that she was even more determined than I was in a way to get the truth I didn't always steel and I I wasn't really part of this family I didn't feel I it was my place to come in and demand all these answers all of a sudden\nI'm I kept my asks pretty simple at first it was like please thought a medical history and if I could ask you some questions I Would like to bet if you don't want to be in contact I understand and I were in fact that so much Cindy Cindy with this with her family family the only ones you've got and\nI think she was very surprised and wanted to know more and so she was really pushing for answers\nAnd that was how I I began to learn more and fill in those gaps in knowledge now\nWell this is obviously an issue that has had an impact on many people's lives 'cause we've got a stack of callers I just want to let them have their say a little bit more here so let's go to John who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma John you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call um I was raised in the south or in the sixties and seventies adopted shift in years ago a beautiful young man from a lot of ... and my question is is I don't have any experience how do I prepare my son for living in a racial world\nOh because you yourself have never faced or experience racism John\nYeah I had you know lived an upper middle class life ah went in the military where there's very little racism than you know I'm just ... those issues yeah how do I prepare my son to go out in the world he knows he's very dark he's you know going to say we think I don't know what to tell a\nJewish you have an answer for John well I you know there that's a huge question but one of the answers is to make sure you surround yourself with people of color especially you know if he's African American um you know I make sure that if you're choosing pediatricians or dentists that you look for on models for him\nAnd that you look for help for you ah you know the best people to help you to understand how to deal with racism or people who have experienced it\nAnd so ... and it's also good for him to see you claiming these people who are like him and not just him\nYeah let's go to Dana who's calling from Glen falls New York then a year on the air\nHi um I'm a white parent of two Asian um daughters Asian American now uh we began our adoption process about Twenty years ago and\nI feel really grateful that we had the agency we did I had\nI had no knowledge of how to do this when I when we started but one of the requirements of her agency was that we attend numerous workshops throughout the process and a few of them involved adult adoptees who\nUm [noise] um where people of color are adopted by white parents who shared their stories which in many cases were not so good mhm\nAnd made clear to us how important it was for one thing I'm not you know to the extent we could don't live in a segregated white community I live in a place where our kids were grow up I'm\nIn a

cancer research and why they're so much excitement around immunological therapies for treating cancer\nAnd we're joined today by the two thousand Eighteen Nobel Prize winner in physiology or Medicine He's Jim Alison and he shares that award was to ... of Kyoto University his work in cancer immunotherapy was recognized by the Nobel Committee this year and ... and is also chair of the department of immunology at Mt Cancer Center\nAnd I want to bring in another voice into the conversation ... and if I could joining us now is Dr Monica ... she is president of the American society for Clinical Oncology she's also chief of the division of surgical oncology at Dana Farber Brigham and Women's Hospital Cancer Center and a professor of surgery at Harvard Harvard Medical school as well\nAnd she joins us today from Washington for Britain hughley welcome to on point\nI make that great to be here it's great to have you know you you heard your mouse and described his research and also a you know meeting the first patient that he had he had met one on one who had undergone immunotherapy for her cancer\nA really moving story but I'm sure if you could sort of described from the point of view of as a fellow researchers are sort of how revolutionary is it that that we're thinking or focusing so much on using the immune system rather than external chemicals for treating cancer\nWell you know there is nothing more exciting I'm a biologist research is in our field than to see something some understanding from human biology finally\nRevealed that we can really use it help patients and that was an incredibly moving story that you know fortunately we're hearing lots of these stories and you know that it was it's a couple of decades now in the early nineties that um there was a first the clue that the immune system could do this um\nThere was some work done by Steven Rosenberg at the national Cancer Institute where he found that giving um natural drugs called cytokines that could really jazz up the immune system\nCould really reduce eliminate tumors in patients with melanoma and Reno cancers and and you know it was it was just a glimmer that this might be possible\nAnd then it took decades of really careful work in the laboratory and understanding the biology to really make this something that can help patients and so it's just wonderful to see the Nobel Prize awarded in this field and even better to see this brand new tool that we have to fight cancer\nNow or are we are talking about treatments and fighting cancer here is anyone thinking that immunotherapy might lead to down to the root of a cure\nSo we do see some cures from him you know therapy what is cure mean you know to to clinicians cure means you have someone who has a tumor\nAnd your ... somehow something we can do is able to eliminate that tumor and they didn't doesn't come back in their body um that's what we mean by cure and some of these initial immunotherapy is perhaps the patient that Dr Alison just described\nShe lived her entire lifetime with now this tumor never recurring that what that secure so clinicians are very cautious in using that cure word\nBut what really matters to patients is that they live a long long life and never have the burden of cancer in their life so that's what we're seeing and we're seeing that with him you know therapy\nOkay a gym Allison Lee ... let me turn back to you here\n... has said is are we talking about potential yours\nWas you know for a long time it's been considered very you know ... appropriate to use words treasure after the surge servants but [noise]\nBut er group started to burden early for\nMelanoma patients receive there'd be remember just as a single ... single round of treatments for directions for about ... percent of them are a lot at least two years after a single tree so [noise] um ... after a time people can\nQuit looking over their shoulder everyday religion I'm Wondering if some judges looming for them or down and move on them and that's what makes me so happy about the sure about Sherman's experience because she was told bird positions don't have an inch over after awhile ferocious another around ... normal life\nYeah oh Monica Britain usually a ... I mean how many immunotherapy is our ... are out there right now well we\nHave um Fifteen cancer indication Fifteen indication so Fifteen specific cancer conditions that are now proof have drugs approved by the U.S FDA\nFor treatment using him you know therapies um but what's another fascinating thing about our field is there are literally thousands at last count about two thousand different new immunotherapy drugs agents approaches\nThat are currently undergoing clinical testing so the field has just been blown wide open by\nBy the proof of principle that untangling this biology can have a true transformative effect on patient flags and I just somebody here think landslide thousands currently and development or in clinical trial\nDifferent agents from hitting different ... different components of the immune system\nUm are all undergoing clinical testing across and when's the last time cancer research has seen that kind of explosion in potential therapy is\nWell I don't think ever I mean this is really this is really a completely new era and you know we really have to acknowledge that why are we here we're here because there's been a tremendous investment\nYou know on the part of our government on the part of of of ah industry in understanding tumor biology in a very deep level and that understanding is leading to so many different possibilities for for treatment of care\nThat they I Wonder if I ... I Would I Want to just\nInject a little bit of not skepticism but perhaps a little caution here because and and and please correct me if I'm wrong because I remember awhile ago maybe a generation ago\nThere was a lot of excitement for example around a Judah Folkman research and Andrew genesis and cancers thinking like if we if we sort of figured out a way to block the blood flow to tumors that that would be a way to\nTo really get rid of any and all cancers in the body very exciting led to research perhaps didn't yield I'm the kind of a treatments that we're seeing now with him you know therapy should we so should we continue to have some ... some measure of a grain of salt or or skepticism even around this moment of great excitement ...\nMagnet you couldn't have possibly picked a better example\nUm you know we didn't plan on this but um you know one of the things I'm sure Dr Alison can well time in here too is that that work that Dr Folkman did to look at the blood vessels is now being combined with the drugs that Dr Alison group has developed with a with came out of his work\nAnd the combination of targeting the blood vessel together with targeting that it was activating that taking the breaks off the T cell is producing even better responses in some tumors so at that nothing goes wasted so\nThat's that's correct in the run of the things that we're realizing\nThat uh this coming coming ... ... there's just a matter of therapy can be combined with or not only other mental therapies but was conventional therapies looked him up therapy or ... or just or service\nVirtually anything that Charles tumor cells can be used to prominence in response or that's rather so many ...\nThat we've we've got a really ... have died either before decided to do yeah combination or ... or else we're we're we're we're going to a lot of false leads\nAll right well you know we've got a lot of callers who want to join us because obviously cancer is\nA huge issue that does have an impact on so many people's lives\nYou're listening to sour to Jim Allison he was awarded the to any the twenty Eighteen Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work in cancer immunotherapy he shares at a word of the ... of Kyoto University\nAnd you're also hearing from Monica Britain usually she's president of the American society for Clinical Oncology and chief of the division of surgical oncology at Dana Farber Brigham and Women's Hospital Cancer Center and we're at war\nThat's eight hundred for two three talks we've got a couple of the top researchers in cancer with us this hour what is your question for them let's go to Scott who's calling from Eagle River Wisconsin Scott you're on the air\nSide I'm On a ... ... ... ... um they did it go at a trace\nCollege fine where consulting work with high school students to identifying achieve their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship or more and more at home is fine dining\nJeremy house in California is now a so called sanctuary ... doesn't help the federal government with immigration enforcement some cities are happy about that we believe in the dignity of all people other cities pursuing this day you know I I don't think this has anything to do with racism that debate next time around here and now\nToday at noon on nine point nine WVU or Boston NPR\nThis is on point I'm making a chocolate bar ... we're talking this hour about where we are with cancer research and why they're so much excitement around him you know therapies and cancer treatment and I'm joined today by the two thousand Eighteen Nobel Prize winner in medicine and physiology it's Jim Alison\nYou share the word with the ... of Kyoto University\nGym Allison is chair of the department of immunology at Mt Anderson Cancer center were also joined by Monica ... she's president of the American society for Clinical Oncology\nAnd a little earlier in the show Dr Britain usually told us that we've never seen an explosion in the terms of the number of possible treatments or therapies for cancer as we are seeing right now some two thousand\nDifferent treatments in the pipeline the researcher clinical trial pipeline and it's a very exciting moment in cancer research but ... nearly just before the break we're also talking about how how individualized these therapies can be so are we talking about you know slightly different therapies tailored for from person to person\nOh perhaps um you know I there is a whole\nUm emphasis right now on understanding individual biology of every patient and being able to target that specifically\nUm that not only helps us develop treatments that work better it helps us develop treatments that have fewer side effects you know many examples of this and it's a general direction I Believe we're heading in all of oncology and they see\nBut you know very well just yeah just to add a burden earlier was told you wrote the adage institutions recognize we know now that many of those are generated by a ... that are part of the cost and different process itself\nAnd so it was a big effort I'm In I'm involved in summer but there's many many groups\nTry to develop rapid ... genome sequencing is that gets faster and cheaper to ... make them sort of politically or give them the person's along with ... with a checkpoint walkers were real therapeutic\nPerhaps would be much much lower doses of focus the response even more tightly I'm On the cancer cells themselves\nWell Jim Nelson and Monica Britain nearly um we've got a comment here this coming on our website and that the person wants us to to make a point that I I wanted to ask you about\nSome of the ... coming calling themselves Plain Dealer says I Hope that in addition to the brilliant scientists involved the show addresses the practical impact in other words the prices of these therapies\nA means to the gym limited to start with you I mean I'm seeing hundreds of thousands of dollars as it costs for some of these therapies that is that right\n[noise] yes yes that's correct and it's um it's it's a\nIt's too it's too hot it really is I mean I can understand some of them because\nThey're in development um they bloom or for example that changed all the rules the standard um importance to choose critically for evaluating drugs that target dresser cells were used for any more to her a lot of failed trials because they use the wrong importance and shuttered searchers are\nDevelopmental costs were amazing rabbis will probably most expensive ever I'm not sure\nBut still that's no that's no reason to keep those prices are are there on our cars they certainly don't reflect the costs too much of a drug it's also got to come down particularly as we go to the combinations and my heart you know for me and others outside\nMurder but are are are going to hope that they become fast so that they can get some more Persians\nMonica Britain usually I I mean I Know that you neither you a gym or setting prices are for drugs that are are that are coming out of clinical trial I Want to acknowledge that and also we've heard frequently over the many years and and Jim just pointed to it that the development costs are these drugs are very high because sometimes that we're talking about decades of research so\nThat point also should be made but on the other hand I mean both of you are in the world of cancer research are you concerned that as we have these potentially very game changing therapies coming out of the pipeline\nBut because the costs are so high it could further sort of drive a wedge between the haves and have nots\nAccess to to health care in the United states\nWell that ... you know and and it's terrible and it's something that concerns us every day and you know I I think it's a broader discussion than just the cost of some very expensive new ... you know transformative drugs\nIt's the cost of our entire healthcare system in the United states and how are we going to focus\nWhat we can do as doctors and his researchers is to focus on getting exactly the right therapies to the right patients in the best most efficient way\nBecause then it's it's not so unreasonable to justify what that's going to cost what what really concerns me even more is when we have wasted in the system or when it's inefficient or when we don't have the ability to understand who's going to benefit and has not and really as as clinicians researchers that's where our focus is\nOkay well let's go to Lucy who's calling from Jupiter, Florida lives a year on the air\nHello Hi Lucy go ahead\nOh hi thank you for taking my call 'em I wanted to counter all the talk of excitement with my experience of frustration over you know therapy I'm fifty two years old I was diagnosed with advanced stage three ovarian cancer which statistically has a terrible survival rate\nI'm like I'll be very very very lucky if I'm Still alive and five years\nAnd yet every day on NPR I hear about these clinics with all this and you know therapy but there's nothing for me\nAnd so my question to your research here it is for someone like me how many years I have to try to stay alive you can conventional methods of treatment until someone comes up with a needle here either it's going to pro in my life [laughter] you know ...\nHang on don't don't hang up the phone here let me just turn to Jim Allison first a ...\nFor her you know what I mean when we were one of the roots are going about a minute services because there's a lot of germs we're the we're uniform were fertile before oh better now responding unfortunately but auto respond I'm In ... group ... member grab her church for ... really responded much of all you're\nOn over and as one which doesn't respond with regard to re barge um so\nWhat we're involved here are the men are miserable for former Jewish daughter oh what goes wrong not only are persons deserve successful servers were personally received combinations that don't work and try to figure out what's missing\nRemember him in an irrational was a preferred are missing and ...\nYou know move move it forward ... ... more referred to as we're talking about the future for songbirds over as we're we're we're just mover for\nNote Lizzie Lizzie did I hear you correctly when you say that you've been searching for a clinical trial to participate in but you can't find one of one that you call that will that you qualify for\nUm yeah that's correct I found one but I don't think they're saying it's a vaccine but it's like what they think is different from um you know therapy but it's also one where there's a fifty percent chance that don't get a CBO uh-huh routes a vaccine same thing as a music therapy is that different\nLook to Europe for ... different germs were meals are yeah monitor weren't nearly I mean what what what would you what guidance or advice would you ... have really because I imagine that there are many other people like her out there who would like to have access to these treatments even in the clinical trial phase but for whatever reason cannot well\nYou know you have two questions you know ... to us just first Lizzie thank you so much for calling in and for\nSharing your story with us because um this is something that absolutely needs to be raised every time we have a discussion about some great breakthrough\nThere's just always so much more to do and I hope very much that you are in an environment where you have expert doctors who are doing everything they can for you because um you know there's there's a lot that can be done but there's still a lot more to do\nNow the issue of clinical trials again was he thank you for illustrating that how the importance of that\nI'm One of the things that one of the big problems we have only three percent of patients adult patients in the United states participate in clinical trials\nTo Ninety seven percent of people out there\nWe don't have information or even access to them for some of these new um potential breakthrough therapy so one of the big a part things that we need to advocate for is more availability of clinical trials and those trials need to get every tiny community not just the big cities for people who have insurance\nThirty a ... point nine WB you are\nFrom Boston University you're listening to

O. P. N.

for two three eight to fly aside the eight hundred for two three talk or if you're a Republican and you happen to agree with Max Boot about you concerned about where the GOP is headed what do you think we ought to do\nThe Republican who thinks the party is exactly where it needs to be right now representing your interest in doing so with a full throated passion call us as well what's your thought for ... where one eight hundred forty three eighty five five to eight hundred for two three talk\nUh now I'm actually in the in the last segment you mentioned um what what you call a GOP quote unquote ... who are have been surrounding and supporting President Trump exactly what do you mean by that\nAll the people who who basically flat or his ego including people like Lindsey Graham who\nOnce called him a coup can now oh talks about how Donald Trump as a superb Gulf or I mean I I have to our chapter and verse in my ... of of of the circumstance of Donald Trump who literally refer to him as if he were the second coming who think that he used the savior\nOf humanity I mean it's unbelievable this as a president or you know who was only has the support of about forty percent of Americans and and that's too high in my book but most people recognize\nThat he is not an honorable figure but what's really shocking to me is the extent to which the Republican Party has transformed himself into a Donald Trump called I mean so many people have drank the Kool Aid including people but I once had respect for it's it's really been a gut wrenching in ... in soul crushing experience for me to see what's going on\nWell uh we have some tape here from June to thousands Seventeen when the president convened his cabinet and called on every member of the cabinet to speak one by one now\nI think some folks might remember this because some of the cabinet members looked quite uncomfortable and we're careful to avoid flattering the president directly\nBut for many of the others um they did heap praise upon a President Trump now the whole sort of a person by person moment took about eleven minutes and we're not going to play all of that obviously we've significantly cut it down

Trump as a egomaniac who's also very insecure and has an insatiable need for praise and basically he likes anybody who praises him whether it's\nHis cabinet members or dictators like ... or Kim Jong on\nBut you know that that tape that you played some ... who's to my mind is one of the most revolting on American spectacles I've ever heard I mean this is something you might expect going on in the quarter Bluey the fourteenth or in Pyongyang this is not what should be happening in the White House the people's houses in our constitutional republic\nWhere we do not elect Donald Trump as king he supposed to be the president charged with enforcing the laws and yet he is being treated\nBy those around him and it was a few of the leader of a religious cult profoundly dangerous\nTo be totally cynical about this ... is it realistic at all to expect politicians to act anything other than politically and right now they are recognizing that the center of gravity and this party is around the president of the United states\nForgive me maybe I'm naive but I Do think the politicians have a higher duty to their country and to the constitution and they do to their own reelection prospects this has been so dismaying to me to see Republicans but I once respected people like Paul Ryan Marco Rubio\nLindsey Graham an on and on and on who have sold out their beliefs who will not say in in\n... in public when I Know they they understand in private which is that Donald Trump is utterly unfit to be president and why won't they do that\nBecause they're all terrified of what happened to Mark Sanford the the Republican congressman in South Carolina who spoke out against Trump Trump treated against him he lost his reelection okay this is not the end of the world okay it's not like Trump is sending out death squads to kill people the worst thing that will happen to these folks is that they will lose reelection\nBut better to lose reelection than to lose their principles and they've lost their principals they have lost their way very very dismaying to see ... book [noise]\nCan't the argument be made and perhaps this is the argument that you're making in the book that those very principles though I got the GOP to where it is right now I mean for example\nA you know I'm looking at your own support your Lucy for support in in the early ... thousands for for the Iraq War and there are many people today\nWho who cast their vote for President Trump because they look at things like the Iraq War as the epitome of ... of international elitism gone or wry that that was that that was money and effort that should have been spent right here in the United states he seems like there were many conservative\nA principled conservatives who supported the Iraq War in two thousand three they those same people surrounding themselves or or the surrounding the president right now so was it not inevitable in a way that we arrived here\nI don't think it was inevitable but it's certainly understandable because I think the establishment made a lot of big mistakes including the Iraq War including the mistakes that led to the great recession of two thousand two thousand an item that\nDiscredited mainstream Republican orthodoxy and I I write in the Balkans in in what I think is try to do in a very honest and soul searching way about my own responsibility for getting here\nI was certainly a proponent of the Iraq War along with\nSeventy two percent of the population but I was certainly more prominent than\nThan most of that Seventy two percent and for years I was very defensive about the disaster that ensued and refused to completely renounced my decision and now with\nThe clarity of hindsight and looking back in and trying to figure out my way forward I've\nI I mean I make a clean brush the in the book and I say you know this was a mistake and I was\nYou know I was wrong to have advocated the war this is a terrible\nDisaster for which I have to take ownership and I and I know and I think the other you know supporters and architects of the war should take ownership of it as well and and there's\nOf course the irony is that Donald Trump himself was a supporter of the war even though you won't end but it now but but there is no question that these kinds of miscalculations lead the way a in open the way to ... which you know I think is it was a catastrophe for America and the world\nFar worse than what we've seen in the past because he is\nA you know undermining our democracy with his attacks on the rule of law he's undermining American leadership abroad he's undermining American allies he's opening the way for dictators so you know this is the terrible situation but you know we have to be honest and and and admit that the Republican establishment was not blameless in getting us here\nYeah well we're speaking with max ... is our his new book is the corrosion of conservatism why I left the right and we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk a Mexican a couple of callers here if we can let's first go to Mike who's calling from winter veal North Carolina Mike you're on the air\nMax yes\nI agree with your analysis completely I think Trump an absolutely horrible president I was telling all my friends I could vote against them in the primaries\nBut leaving a party is a terrible mistake we need to fight for our party\nAnd hope that someone like I have a mental block on flakes name or ... or some decent Republican comes in and challenges and if he still president twenty twenty to fight against him leaving the party is is just wrong\nHe might before I turn it back to Mexico let me ask you I mean you mentioned Jeff Flake or I'd say ... Jeff clay Bob Corker all these are Republicans who who are choosing to retire rather than to continue their political career and I don't hear any of them seem to going to run for president so it seems like they're saying there's no room for them at all in the party\nAnd posters Smith printing posters on wrinkle resistant vulnerable fabric\nThat transport slack for conference presentations posters myth provides a service to research community worldwide learned more posters die\nFamily car he survived a lot of cheerios on the floor pen stuck under the seat and of course the kids learning to drive that old cars giving you a lot and now it can get one more thing donated and you'll be supporting news and programming at W.

[laughter] I mean I feel exactly the same way I I'm politically homeless I I Can't be part of this Trump provide Republican Party but I don't feel comfortable being part of the Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren party either and so on you know I'm\nI'm stranded in the middle I think you know look I think Democrats have an opportunity here because I think there are a lot of disaffected voters who could not be part of what Donald Trump is selling but they don't know about the Democrats either because a lot of Democrats seem pretty extreme for them like I I'm In that category if Democrats and I think\nGo to the center there can be a historic realignment of American politics of the kind that you saw in the Nineteen thirties I Would make the Democrats the majority party for fifty years to come I think the way they do that he was by nominating somebody who was pretty centrist in twenty twenty and not going to to the progressive extreme\nWell the all the forces that we've seen in terms of the primary process in terms of campaign finance the things that ah the league or the Republican Party some of the things that legally Republican Party also beleaguered the Democrats as well I mean do you do you think that uh in the in the twenty twenty cycle that the Democrats might actually\nNominate a centrist versus someone who's on the more progressive wing\nOr the guy anything is possible I mean who would've imagined that the Republicans would nominate Donald Trump for twenty sixteen so we don't know\nWho the Republican not who the Democratic nominee is going to be twenty twenty but there is no question that almost all of the major contenders that people that are being talked about his nominees potential nominees are certainly from the progressive wing of the party ... and that concerns me as somebody who's who's more of a of a centrist center ripe a person\nYeah let's go to Joe who's calling from St Petersburg Florida Joe you're on the air\nAll right thank you um I guess my my question has to do with the fact that a Christian I talked to a lot of my friends on it and I'm starting to call it takes most of my Christian friends are consider themselves conservative Christians are and they don't even have to say the Republican\nUh whereas um most of my other friends might be other denominations are some type of liberal Democrat\nOr when I find that people that aren't religious are Republican but they'd be gay or minority whatnot it usually has to do with money that they and wanting to be able to preserve their money or their future so the question is it as a liberal Democrat Chris\nI thought is that for the good of the world where it's supposed to take care of each other and all of our government is to make sure that everybody get by and everybody has the ability to either\nOn my question what was the original point of having a conservative wing of the party back when you join and get it a lot of the religious right in any way sway your decision to at the end of the\nJoke yeah Jo thanks for your call go ahead max\nWell the religious right has always been a big part of the Republican Party going back\nTo the Nineteen sixties ... and it's dismaying to me to see what happened with with with with that one of the party there you have ... I mean I agree with a lot of them in in the late Nineteen nineties when there were castigated Bill Clinton for misconduct for embarrassing the country for lowering our our moral tone I I thought that was correct\nBut now these very same people these are ... more or less than ... colds who are criticizing Bill Clinton have nothing to say about Donald Trump's transgressions then you know this is a president who was violated federal law in order to pay off a playboy playmate on a porn star that he had allegedly had affairs with us as a\nPresident who has been credibly accused of massive tax fraud this was a president who lies eight times a day you know I'm reminded of of of a bill Bennett block from Nineteen Ninety eight or Nineteen Ninety nine called\nThe death of outrage where he was lamenting the fact that more people were not outraged about Bill Clinton's misbehavior well the death of outrage is actually pretty good description of the of the of the Christian right or today including people like Bill Bennett where they have nothing to say\nAbout the shocking immorality was the president that they support\nNext ... I Want to return to something that we talked about a little bit earlier for a second that we should spend more time on and that's this question with this issue of race uh and and how that is shaped direction the Republican Party is going in because I'm I I'm thinking of\nUm you know the number of times you pointed out several uh where the president has said things even before he was elected and after that many people look to Clinton said that that was racist but\nDid you ... around him you know thinking of house Speaker Paul Ryan ... going so far as to release a statement saying yes that was a textbook racist remarks but ... but nevertheless I'm going to still support\nThe part of the United states because valuable he's helping deliver on tax cuts which are important to a lot of people and conservative judges which are also important to a lot of people still for as long as that you know your this is your term found the and bargain exists\nThe if the change has to come within the party structure as well\nI have little hope for the Republican Party unless they suffer repeated and devastating defeats they have to know there'll be a political price to pay for trafficking and bigotry and prejudice for political game there is nothing\nI've seen in American political life in my lifetime that is more despicable than this and they know what they're doing and they don't care they are\nThey are claiming that they can support Donald Trump because he's for tax cuts and then they ignore everything else including all of his racist baggage when he you know undocumented immigrants this is a disgrace and the Republican Party is disgusting itself by going along with us\n[noise] well let's go to another call here Ira is calling from Myrtle Beach South Carolina Ira you're on the air\n... export boots I Would take my hat off to you\nI Am in total application of the courage to your show and the intelligence analysis you will absolutely correct about the current situation\nIt can be no doubt and he married a woman on Saturday would face down from the late ... what he is a true ...\nTotal dictator and another Hitler\nHowever I'd like to tell you there's no need just to be fair we our great nation we went through the heart and the fact\nOf the civil war and we find it I Would say that the joke I'm sixty is to probably do it we pretty much on it now but the one people who will never recover\nAs it were mockery she read will recover but evangelists people who support ... percent and now we're in Ninety One percent they shall never recover their their chance to be a religious or moral ...\nIra Ira let me just jump in here for a second before I let you go I I hear what you're saying and I hear your passion a lot and I'm going to have Macs do respond to it for a in just a moment\nBut when you when you said that you see the president as another Hitler isn't the very fact that that is the the tenor of political conversation in America right now isn't that part of the problem because what you yourself said with all due respect to Iran\nIs also incredibly extreme in any it makes it hard to have\nAny kind of a ... you know civil coming together in this country\nNo future generations will realize that he was in the fact that no eight of it is ... is it not yes John ... and not in any way exaggeration not at all\nI I don't I don't want I don't want to have this uh conversation be turned to much towards that but you but you're you're you're equating the president United States right now with the man who led the the murder of six million people are in Europe in in in the middle of the century do are you really saying that\nEighty nine boy one WB UH Brewster and streaming W.

I Would I Want to just inject a little bit of not skepticism but perhaps a little caution here because and and and please correct me if I'm wrong because I remember\nAwhile ago maybe a generation ago there was a lot of excitement for example around a Judah Folkman research and Andrew genesis and cancers thinking like if we if we sort of figured out a way to block the blood flow to tumors that that would be a way to\nTo really get rid of any and all cancers in the body very exciting line of research perhaps didn't yield I'm the kind of a treatments that we're seeing now with him you know therapy should we so should we continue to have some ... some measure of a grain of salt or or skepticism even around this moment of great excitement ...\nMagnet you couldn't have possibly picked a better example\nUm you know we didn't plan on this but um you know one of the things that I'm sure Dr Alison can well time in here too is that that work that Dr Folkman did to look at the blood vessels is now being combined with the drugs that Dr Alison group has developed with ... with came out of his work\nAnd the combination of targeting the blood vessel together with targeting that it with activating the taking the breaks off the T cell is producing even better responses in some tumors so nothing goes wasted so\nThat's that's correct in the run over brings that we're realizing [noise]\n... ah this German coming ... or does the use of music therapy can be combined refer about on the other man surveys but with congressional ... temperatures that are preserved\nVirtually anything that Charles tumor cells can be used to prominence in response so that's where I was so many Tom ... out there so many\n... we've got a really ... our data before distorted your yeah combination scale or else we're we're we're we're going to a lot of false leads\nAll right well you know we've got a lot of callers who want to join us because obviously cancer is\nA huge issue that does have an impact on so many people's lives\nYou're listening to our to Jim Alison he was awarded the to any the twenty Eighteen Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work in cancer immunotherapy he shares at a word of the ... of Kyoto University\nAnd you're also hearing from Monica Britain usually she's president of the American society for Clinical Oncology and chief of the division of surgical oncology at Dana Farber Brigham and Women's Hospital Cancer Center\nAnd we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talks we've got a couple of the top researchers and cancer with us this hour what is your question for them\nLet's go to Scott who's calling from Eagle River Wisconsin Scott you're on the air\nRight I'm going on and on my vote on it and that no no more um they go at a truth\nW.

some of them because in the development um bloom or for example the change all the rules to standard and Poor's did she was critically for evaluating drugs that targeted dresser sales were useful anymore to a lot of federal trials because we use the wrong and points and just researchers are\nDevelopmental costs were emerging as well probably the most expensive over I'm not sure [noise]\nBut still that's no that's no reason to keep those processes approve it on our cars we certainly don't reflect the costs too much of a drug it's also got a compound project we're\nAs we're going to be combinations and my heart you know from remembers outside murder butter gr hopes to come down fast so that they can get some more Persians\nYeah Monica Britain usually I I mean I Know that new neither you a gym or setting prices are for drugs that are are that are coming out of clinical trial I Want to acknowledge that ah and also we've heard frequently over the many years and and Jim just pointed to it that the development costs of these drugs are very high because sometimes we are talking about decades of research so\nThat point also should be made but on the other hand I mean both of you are in the world of cancer research are you concerned that as we have these potentially very game changing therapies coming out of the pipeline\nBut because their costs are so high it could further sort of drive a wedge between the haves and have nots it when it comes to availability in an access to to health care in the United states\nWell that went in there now ... you know and and it's terrible and it's something that concerns us every day and you know I I think it's a broader discussion than just the cost of some very expensive new ... you know transformative drugs\nIt's the cost of our entire healthcare system in the United states and how are we going to focus\nWhat we can do as doctors and his researchers is to focus on getting exactly the right therapies to the right patients in the best most efficient way\nBecause then it's it's not so unreasonable to justify what that's going to cost what what really concerns me even more is when we have wasted in the system or when it's inefficient or when we don't have the ability to understand who's going to benefit and has not and really as as clinicians and researchers that where our focus is\nOkay well let's go to ... who's calling from Jupiter, Florida Lizzie you're on the air\nHello Hi Lucy go ahead Oh hi thank you for taking my call 'em I wanted to counter all the talk of excitement\nWith my experience of frustration over you know therapy I'm fifty two years old I was diagnosed with advanced stage three ovarian cancer which statistically has a terrible survival rate I'm like I'll be very very very lucky if I'm Still alive and five years\nAnd yet every day on NPR I hear about these clinics with all this and you know therapy but there's nothing for me\nAnd so my question to your research here it is for someone like me how many years I have to try to stay alive you can conventional methods of treatment until someone comes up with a needle care either it's going to pro in my life [laughter] ...\nHang on don't don't hang up the phone here let me just turn to Jim Allison first a ... for\nHer yeah I mean one of the ...\nA lot of cancers the word uniformly fertile before oh better now responding unfortunately they don't respond them in the group ... editor for for example the real problem here is really have not responded much at all yet on ovarian as one which doesn't respond for the frequency rebar gym so\nWhat we're are involved and here are the men are from reserve your platform as you're studying oh what goes wrong not only are patients have successful therapies would have Persians to receive combinations that don't work I'm trying to figure out what's missing\nRemember him in in a rational why are the things that are missing and try to [noise]\nUm you know move it forward move from where it makes it more effective or [laughter] we're we're we're talking about our future suburbs are over as one where we just made a very for\nNo Lizzie Lizzie did I hear you correctly when you say that you've been searching for a clinical trial to participate in but you can't find one or one that you call that will you qualify for\nUm yeah that's correct I found one but I don't think they're saying it's a vaccine but it's like ... which I think it's different from them you know therapy but it's also one where there's a fifty percent chance that I'll get to see though uh-huh right out with a vaccine same thing as immunotherapy is that different\nOkay Dr ... unit for Chuck ... different kind of a meal for yeah money's weren't nearly I mean what what what would you would guidance for advice would you ... have really because I imagine that there are many other people like her out there who would like to have access to these treatments even in the clinical trial phase but for whatever reason cannot\nWell you know you have two questions you know I've been to us just first Lizzie thank you so much for calling in and for\nSharing your story with us because um this is something that absolutely needs to be raised every time we have a discussion about some great breakthrough\nThere's just always so much more to do and I hope very much that you are in an environment where you have expert doctors who are doing everything they can for you because um you know there's there's a lot that can be done but there's still a lot more to do\nNow the issue of clinical trials again with the thank you for illustrating that how the importance of that\nI'm One of the things that one of the big problems we have only three percent of patients adult patients in the United states participate in clinical trials\nTo Ninety seven percent of people out there\nWe don't have information or even access to them for some of these new um potential breakthrough therapy so one of the big a part things that we need to advocate for is more availability of clinical trials and those trials need to get every tiny community not just the big cities for people who have insurance yeah", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "11"}
