watching\nA Black Panther I noticed that um you know the outdoor scenes are beautiful but we don't actually see all that much of where the ... I'm In great detail but we do get to know so much about them and their culture\nThrough what they wear I mean did you see the costuming for the film as central to the story telling as you know as we watched it and I've seen lately\nAnd the costumes gave us an opportunity to delve into specific uh parts of the\nAfrican tribal culture as well as to bring so much color and vibrancy to the film a there's a lot of scenes that take place in ... real expensive environment and we were able to color that environment with the suit you blankets and\nIn the forecast on this Halloween Night we can expect clear skies temperatures in the mid fifties sits now fifty two degrees and Boston\nW.

it the list goes on and on and she's talking with us this hour from Savannah Georgia and you can join us we're one eight hundred forty three eight to five find this eight hundred\nFor two three talk what is your question for America's most preeminent a costume designer who's telling the visual stories of African Americans on film through the fabric that she puts her actors and actresses and again we're at eight hundred forty three eight to five five\nAh Ruthie Carter let me ask you to just jump back in time deep back in time here because I read a in a previous interview that you gave\nThat um your mother when you were growing up ended up being a very large influence on sort of how you see the world and maybe how you even got into to costume designer is that right\nYes um when I was a younger uh say junior high school and through high school my uh mom worked for the CD she wasn't a social worker but um she worked in the office of a social worker was the free counseling service for the city\nAnd people could drop in and get services counseling services so she knew kind of like everyone on the street you know she knew homeless people she knew people you know um there was a guy named Tina and my mother knew about him and\nSo we would ride with her through um you know downtown or down go to ... she'd drop us off to school and we see certain people and we laugh in point or hide you know hide in the back seat\nAnd my mom would say you know he looks okay he's got a clean shirt on today and she could you know just kind of some them up in a different way and it and it gave me pause and it's kind of showed me how to\nHow little more empathy for people and look at them differently you know some time she would even role that window down to our dismay and\nSay you know how ... how George you know how are you today\nAnd you know that kind of a view of\nYou know people is what I still used today to kind of embrace a individuality and that it helps within bracing culture and embracing people and places and you know just taking it all in\nYeah you've suddenly occurs to me I don't know why it suddenly you know there's a long time ago but but ... ... on a day to day basis in the real world what we wear is a deliberate choice that we make every day to communicate to the rest of the role of who we are\nAnd when you're doing that when you are designing costumes for a film that essentially what you're doing right you're telling me on hold portions of each character's story or and so now they want to communicate that to the world's constructed in that film and then to us as the viewers\nYes I feel that costume design or can be just to find his\nStory telling design and you when people want to associate costume designer with fashion and you know that's kind of in the world of costume design but\nThe overall a I'm a goal is to tell the story to work within a larger story of the script and the smaller story that is each individual person\nHas the story was what they wear\nRight so so then how how did you get a down the path of working I'm ... in Hollywood I mean well ... let me ask you this way when did you first meet Spike Lee 'cause you've done what Fifteen plus collaborations with him\n[laughter] yes I have it ... it it goes by fast [laughter] um I met Spike Lee in Los Angeles\nA friend who's a casting director now Ravi read introduced me to him he actually came to a dance performance that I had done the costumes for and it in the lobby I was showing my portfolio to one of\nFriends and I I guess he was observant and listening on she's got to have it had been completed but it hadn't gone to the Cannes Film festival yet\nAnd Spike Lee hum afterwards we all were about the same age and we all you know wanted to hang out together and we did and he kept talking to me about getting film experience and I really came from opera and dance and theater and that's where my\nKnow modeling around him I have this idea of getting film experience and he suggested that I call us see or UCLA to their film department and sign up on a student thesis project and he said that would give me experience with being on a set\nAnd what that medium um would be like you know and so I did and before I knew it on a Saturday I was on the USC student film or doing the costumes\nAre well and then very soon thereafter came Nineteen eighty nine and and do the right\nThing so I Want to play a clip well not all day it was actually the first one and then do the right than to say OK I wouldn't be struck by the fact that they're like get your fill longer iffy right leg [laughter] mostly just go\nDo the right thing is such an amazing movie to this day so I wouldn't want to play a quick clip from here I'm this is a scene where you're going to hear a John John ... who plays bugging out\nAnd he asked so the owner of the local pizzeria played by debt halo or why they're only pictures of white celebrities on the wall of his pizza shop\nIf we're going to war were brothers on Wall Street Journal which would you want to\nGet a bunch of brothers are novels and nieces and nephews your stepfather stepmother whoever wants to see what this is my this American as high as long\nAs you do stuff for [noise]\nThere might be fine Sal was ate it wants to be any American I use my apple so since we last month we do have\nA scene from Spike Lee is Nineteen eighty nine do the right thing and Ruthie Carter was the costume designer uh on that one of many collaborations she had with Spike Lee and the thing about\nThis film a ruse if I may see is that it really one of his many powers as it captures this particular\nMoment where we see on screen very powerfully this sort of combination of the materiality of what the characters are where like the high tops the boom boxes that the printed tease the jerseys\nUm but also as we heard that clip this moment of political consciousness as well absolutely so how does that play out in your design well\nIt was a the eighties which was the explosion of um color blocking and really saturated color Nike was a huge part of a\nA clothing or during that time and a guy's war colorful compression shorts underneath their basketball shorts and we really wanted to represent you know pop culture of a moment and\nReally create this um this intensity of color in their environment\nAnd so what we did was we created like tops out of African fabrics and you see bugging out wearing can take cloth sure it's that we made and it was also the hottest day of the year and you know it was it was kind of thing in New York where when it got really really hot\nThat stuff will go down you know there could be riots there could be shootings and\nSo because of the heat the intensity of the heat the intensity and the saturation of the color and and the styles that um we present you kind of all the fed into the combination of what eventually happened story\nWill ah we've got a lot of callers who want to ask you some\nQuestions raised so if I may turn to them to be a delight we were talking with Ruthie card or she is a two time Academy Award nominated costume designer uh she got those nominations for Malcolm X and um it started but those are two of the forty plus films that she's been a costume designer\nOn then that means we double checked and I'm wanting more television projects I agree\nWith an incoming patients to you for that but we're the one eight hundred forty three eighty five five eight hundred and forty three talk so let's go to Tanya who's calling from Detroit Michigan Tanya you're on the air\nCategory and oriental rugs or the ... lower falls and not at Bronx tribal village ... plus contemporary echoes to ... we're going in robes dog um Mm\nHis father joined me for the final

you'd be you are screaming on line a double duty you our daughter work\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker ... we are talking today with Ruth e card or she is a two time Academy Award nominated costume designer she got those nods for Malcolm X and ... and her most recent work you've seen it it's in Black Panther she's also done the costume design for everything from do the right thing\nTo the butler to what's love got to do with it and Selma as well and I want to\nFrom Selma and you're going to hear David yellow he of course played the role of Reverend Dr Martin Luther king in ... twenty fourteen film and is seen he's giving a speech before leading a voting rights march across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma, Alabama\nAnd he's wearing a suit with a with a black and fuel striped tie and a styling black overcooked\nDon't want to come off\nDon't want to them all [noise]\nHave seen it on\n[noise] I think it was found in ... but we shall be an awful\nLot of\nThings on the team does or fourteen film Selma Ruthie Carter here's one of the cases several cases in which you are doing a film or depicting an act you know an actual person from history so how did you go about deciding how to design the clothing for you know for David who's playing Dr King\nWell there are several images that I could draw from of Martin Luther king there's several books pictorial books that I had been written and so the little nuances of his character were were I delved into the design um one uh is that I'm a Martin Luther king was busts\nMen and if you look at him and his suit you noticed that you know there's a little fleshy area around the color of his neck where he button down shirt and it would\nKind of roll over the top and David are yellow the brilliant actor that he is gained weight for the role um and I wanted to sort of\nHelp that along and I made his a shirt college so at least smaller than would we what would be required so that I can also see that little ... that happened I'm at the collar of\nKing shirt I Love that detail I Would have ever noticed but it's all it's all what goes into sort of the whole experience of sort of occupying a character\nYeah and the costume has to support the actor that has to help support their performance and\nI'm just looking at a lot of black and white photographs you have to create a color palette that supports the mood of the story as well as isn't accurate depiction\nOf the colors during that time now to David every day the shirt colors were too tight um he never come out and I would say he never complained um maybe it just felt\nRight right for him and uh when I hear that that performance in particular I really hear Martin Luther king more than I hear David a yellow all\nRight well we're at one hundred forty three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk coast with your questions for ... the Carter and how she tells he's African American stories through fabric on these amazing films that we've been talking about well let's go to Sarah who's calling from Lowell, Massachusetts Sara you're on the air\nI met an hello ms Carter I Am so excited that you are having a show talking about this when I saw Black Panther in the theater I was just\nBlown away not only by the film but also by its potential as a teaching opportunity I met future who's been working on a project on how we can use\nTextiles and clothing to teach science technology engineering and math topics and I just feel like you've provided such a rich palate here\nOf opportunities we can't we don't just send you know right now we just sense to\nYou know being a robotics team or something like that but they could learn ... D printing\nThey could talk about textiles with special technology in them like the black Panthers suit the stores kinetic energy well what kinds of other energy could you put into a fabric how would you do it they're just so many opportunities here and it was so exciting\nThere and thank you for your cold Ruthie of a response for\nYes um what I Love about\nSeries lab is that it's a\nIt's an exploration and what kids can do you never can hunters estimate what your children could can do and she certainly does represent that you know she\nI imagined was the mastermind behind the three D. printing up the queen's crown and her shoulder mantle she created the black Panthers suit and\nAnd I think it's just a great opportunity to use it as a vehicle for for learning ... uh\nHear from you or for a couple of minutes about ... in particular one of the films that you received an Oscar nomination for for your costume design there of course that's the Steven Spielberg film I'm about uh about a revolt honestly on a Spanish slave ship and so we have a scene here\nIn the films Nineteen Ninety seven and you're going to hear the leader of the slave revolt Josephine Cape played by the gym on a limb to who stands up\nEr during the mutiny trolleys put on trial for his labor of old and repeatedly cries for his freedom\nOr for the wrong reasons for for the front of the kind of disrupt these receivers which I\nCrying out or\nA scene from the Nineteen Ninety seven Phil ... that scene where the leader of the slave revolt justice in case put on trial Carter if I remember correctly in that scene a scene king is wearing a western coast right\nYes ah the abolitionist a and the reading we read that the abolitionist gave a clothing to the Africans and\nThere was an account that said in the courtroom they look like Doug ... sitting in the gallery and so I use those words to create um clothing that was donated especially forcing K who would have been given closing from the attorneys that were supporting the case and\nI also wanted to present him in a royal manner um very regal at this moment where he says give us free and you'll notice that um the African sitting there and the gallery or mostly in these white bill Lewis shirts up the period and\nI wanted to evoke the feeling of dogs\nNow is it also a comedian's reading this wrong because I I I thought that part of the reason why\nThe slightly baggy fit uh on on just it was as you said like he had to wear borrowed close um and that's a so that they didn't quite fit properly but nevertheless gave as you were saying that this regal field him\nYes yes and I was the ... of the parent period was very Bill O'Reilly pleaded ruffled shirt\nYeah and and this is a particularly interesting for them to talk about because I'm ... and you also did the costume design for white royalty on the film oh I'm\nYes John Adams yeah and you know based on you know art history I looked at the composition of some of the great painters and\nAlso the history of the court case of the ... side all those things were important to paint the picture of royalty and the African says you know when they\nFirst embark in Mystic Connecticut they are wearing blankets and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "01"}
