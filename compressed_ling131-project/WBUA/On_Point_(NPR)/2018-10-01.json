I'm asking you about this and we talked about earlier show because I Want to be sure we get it right a ... we can't be sure if the FBI would talk to those people right because it again there's confusion about whether or not the White House counsel's office and say here's the list of people you can talk to full stop\nBut we don't know if they have to go back to the White House who say we've been given these additional names of people who may know specifics about this incident can we go talk to them um typically the FBI has the ability and the authority to go do that\nUh because most times the client wants to know this level of detail most\nAnd we're we're tiptoeing around it is is there a conflict of interest in this case the White House's client do directing the FBI to pursue the questions that they want answered the same time this White House has made it very clear that they want Mr Kavanaugh approved confirmed\nAnd there's no guarantee that we will ever know who the FBI actually spoke to with certainty or if the report is not made public and if I'm remembering correctly for example the FBI's investigation back in Ninety One with Clarence Thomas that's been made public at All right\nWell in theory we'll go to the White House and then the senators are one hundred or who will vote on who is a nomination will be able to get access to it the question then becomes will leak when it gets to Capitol Hill has a little bit different era now\n[laughter] so so much has\nSo much and yet so little at the same time as change in Nineteen Ninety One so let's talk a little bit about the more and more detail about the mid term here and in order to set that up I just want to play a actually a clip from a conversation on sixty minutes yesterday with one man who is not running for reelection Republican Senator Jeff flake because he\nTold Scott Kelly or that if you had been running for reelection his decisions regarding um a delaying the vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination would have been very very different\nCould you have done this if you were running no you're not you're not a chance now because politics has become too sharp to Puerto ... there is no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nMichael Ward I'm seeing here also is just a recent study from Hugh that says that uh Seventy six percent of the potential midterm voters are saying that the Supreme Court nominee with a process around it is a very important issue to them in these midterm elections I mean how big is this\nA it is big but I don't think we know exactly how it plays out um you know George Will often says\nThat the political parties organizer animosity using that you know politics is as much about\nA ... who do you hate or maybe a little nicer of who you are not like who do not want to see in power I'm clearly Donald Trump himself has been in organizing force for Democrats who who\nSort of woken up uh in our own are are expecting a a good election in the midterms um my question is how many more potential democratic voters are left to be woken up in an energized to vote in the midterms\nI think there is a question about whether or not enough Republicans a have a\nHad been energized I don't think the Trump Administration as what's going on I had given him Republicans much to be excited about perhaps a and we'll have to wait to see how ... is a week or so after the uh the the hearings last week um perhaps\nThe feeling that judge Kavanaugh is under siege many uh give Republicans a reason to get to the polls that they haven't had a for the last uh Eighteen months um I don't know if that's going to be the case we've been talking about the ways that are that women voters might respond\nI'm a you know anecdotally I hear from Republican women voters who are sort of take the opposite of you that you might expect and say that I'm actually judge Kavanaugh's treatments\nI'm a as makes them more willing to go out and vote for Republicans we just don't know how that's going to play out but I think an issue like this is something that does animate voters or in a way that ah that that that does energize them to get out of the ... ah in November\n... in fact we heard the president himself over the weekend that those rallies galvanizing his orders saying you know if you want to\nPreserve the uh the futures of the judges judge Brett Kavanaugh go to the polls in November I mean he's absolutely using it as a rallying cry on the other hand you look I got so many comments on our website emptying yards saying\nThat's a quote I think we're seeing a new political party emerge a party of women to different possibilities for the cabinet nomination the women at the Senate block it or he is confirmed\nAnd the women of the nation rally their power to throw the bums out that is a comment on our website on point radio dot org let's go to Steve who's calling from Bangor Maine you're on the

you how many American Soldiers are in Syria today\nThe answer around two thousand and why are they they're well to fight ISIS of course but that mission could be changing last week national security adviser John Bolton said us troops will not leave Syria quote\nAs long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders and that includes Iranian proxies and militias end quote\nWell that's a sharp departure from the military's current mission and for the first time it\nTo countering Iran so listeners what do you think if you applauded when President Trump vowed to bring American troops home do you think we need to stay in Syria to take on Iran now we're one eight hundred for two three to five find this eight hundred for two three talk\nWell joining me now from Beirut, Lebanon is Liz Sly Beirut bureau chief for the Washington Post lives it's good to have you\nThank you for having me also with us from Tyson's corner Virginia is Kyle rent for he's a reporter for the military times Kyle welcome to you hey thanks for having me\nAll right so let me start with you I mean you wrote about uh about what John Bolton said in this article for military times by the we've got a link to it at one point radio dot org how big of a shift in rhetoric is this regarding the U.S mission in Syria\n[noise] it seems to be kind of a more over\nUm way to say that the\nPrior U.S policy goals which were to uh mainly just put us troops in Syria eastern theory in order to fight ISIS is being being expanded so the Pentagon has a readily acknowledge a Pentagon officials\nUp to and including secretary of defense Mattis that\nUs troops are only fighting ISIS however they do play a\nSecondary benefit of balancing against Iranian influence in the country a\nBoat and you kind of came out and was way more overt in saying that that is the primary goal countering Iran a hence the condition for us withdraw is ah the withdrawal of Iranian forces so that's a changing mission or an expanding of like the mission parameters at least\n... so I'm seeing here that James Jeffrey just uh the state department special representative for Syria a following John Bolton is comment said that the United states would maintain a presence in Syria possibly including an extended military mission\nAgain until Iran withdraws us soldiers in military forces it commands and Jeffrey told reporters on Thursday that the president wants us in Syria until that and the other conditions are met\nA but but Kyle I mean the authorization for use of military force that the U.S is operating on in Syria right now those date back to Afghanistan and Iraq right there there are counterterrorism authorizations\nYeah well there's one from two thousand and one which covers al Qaida and its affiliates and those who hire harbored al ... in response to nine eleven terror attacks and then there's one from two thousand two against Iraq and so neither of those really cover the Iranian mission um and so I think that\nThe way that if they were to continue having a U.S presence in eastern Syria they would try to quote it by saying that us troops or a conductor and counter ISIS missions primarily and um they would just continue to say well you know it also balances against Iran such as the secondary benefit\nWell Liz Sly you're joining us here from Beirut I mean let me ask you how is uh this new language or or I maybe to use ... raise cows description of it more overt language from the Trump Administration how's that going over in the region\n\n[noise] well\nI think people in the thing that the price by that suddenly coming out you can you learn that we've seen that yet because as you remember a few months ago um ... we're going to be going home very very soon and was actually an expectation that they would eat ... owned by the end of it yeah\nAnd most of the regional palate ... involved in Syria Sochi, Russia Jackie\nI'm no everyone else in the neighborhood and Phoenix but he likes to go and they can placate you punish the ... the idea that that actually going to be getting any definitely definitely puts them back like\nIn ... when it comes to negotiate cheating and then you can share and more and I think it should be glad that she'll go and eat at the moment\nOkay well let's hear a little bit more ah from what a national security adviser John Bolton said in his ramping up of the anti Iran rhetoric\nOn ... on Monday again he said we're not going to leave Syria as long as Iranian troops are outside of Iranian borders and then on Tuesday he went even further\nIf you cross us our allies are our partners you harm our citizens if you continue to lie cheat and deceive yes there will indeed the hell to pay\nWell the very next day on Wednesday of less meat week some lawmakers did question of the U.S military role in Syria and this expansion of the military objective they question Robert ... assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs\nAnd here you're going to hear Massachusetts democratic congressman Seth Moulton pressing came to get more says specifically about uh Iran and Syria and how that correlates with the mission in fighting ISIS\nProblem is that national security adviser John Bolton stated that the United states intends to keep an indefinite military presence in Syria until Iran withdraws for its forces\nBecause they're withdrawal is apparently dependent on actions of wrong not actions of ISIS\nOr the defeat of ISIS ... let me ask you about this because it seems as if what ... saying is that if indeed this is why the U.S will be sending troops to Syria and the future that it may be illegal because he they do not have congressional authorization for that\n[laughter] yeah so he's basically making the argument that even if I'm us troops are conducting active operations against Iranian forces or Iranian proxy forces the fact that they're\nIn the region with the mission to balance against those forces or restrict those forces freedom maneuver through eastern Syria means that they are I'm conducting a military operation and therefore the Pentagon the White House needs to come to Congress and ask for a new authorization\nHas the has the White House or the Pentagon shown a willingness to do that\nI mean I don't think that they don't think any real administration has shown a willingness to get a new authorization for the use of military\nForce ah I mean that's a question of the Aspen brought up ah during the past airstrikes that have occurred against ah the Assad regime in response the chemical weapons attacks some people think that those aren't covered by a either a you enough from to I've been wanting to I've been to\n... know Liz Sly me and the secretary of defense James Mattis has repeatedly said\nWe'll talk we'll talk specifically about what he he has said about this new language from the White House but over the many years he has repeatedly said that he sees Iran is the single most quote enduring threat to stability to stability and peace in the middle east in the region\nAnd to that effect you today you just went on a tour of an of an alleged a missile site in Lebanon that the Lebanese wanted to show or the Israelis it wasn't a missiles like he he tells a little bit more about that\n[laughter] well yes I'm\nAt the United nations um last week the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu held up a picture\nOf ... that he was shocked like Jim age and which we think like allergies on ... ... to ... sites that\nWhen his while I was at the store and while manufacturing Mikhail to be which could be used to like ... it's loud such gay he's fine ministry invited ambassadors took all the countries that then but you can walk up and then\nUm did you go on a visit she's arts people to fight to see

digital political reporter pure Thomas is also with us chief justice correspondent for ABC News\nAnd Michael Warren joins us to today he's senior writer at the Weekly Standard and of course so much attention focused on the FBI's current background investigation into the allegations are surrounding judge Brett\nPoint radio dot org John in Amherst says lying and allegations aside if someone with Kavanaugh has demonstrated belligerence unbiased capable of serving as a judge on any bench let alone\nThe Supreme Court well in fact this weekend Republican Senator Jeff flake of Arizona was asked about that on sixty minutes this was just yesterday a and here's what he described he saw in Brett Kavanaugh temperament during Kavanaugh's testimony last week\nWhen I heard him heard someone who are who are with some like if I had been unjustly accused to see his family behind the ... and ah [noise]\nIt was there was anger um but um but if I were unjustly accused that's how I Would feel as well\nAnd the crews there that Senator Flake referred to as Senator Chris Coons of Delaware who was interviewed by sixty minutes and correspondence Scott Kelly ask Hoon er about the the claim or the surgeon or the belief that parts of Kavanaugh's testimony and his demeanor in front of the Senate Judiciary committee may have crossed the line\nA lot of surprised to hear that from other colleagues in the committee or on television but I was really struck that I thought his anger got the best of him and he made a part in an argument that would've been best left to be made for his advocates and defenders on the committee made you wonder voters who voted\nIn my case yes it made me wonder about a city ability to sort of event\nThat's democratic Senator Chris Coons speaking on sixty minutes there and I keep making the same mistake I keep seeing Mike Judge but I mean to say mark judge and I apologize for it to everyone for that mistake here a huge burns let me just pick up with you because you were speaking to this point before\nThe break here I Wonder um you know all day on Thursday Democrats focused on their call for investigation\nThey got one they got an investigation you know its current terms they may not like but I'm Wondering if you think they missed an opportunity here because you know many folks did look at for example that paragraph in judge Kavanaugh was opening statement where he talks about a left wing conspiracy talks about\nThe Clintons 'em\nAnd you know that perhaps\nSome folks might say they should just simply point at that uh as evidence for of what you know might be judge Kavanaugh suit ability or lack of for the Supreme Court\nRight I think that paragraph was particularly revealing for a lot of people watching because\nUm remember we're talking about this seat as the potential swing seat on the court from I'm at a conservative and a ideological perspective but when Kavanaugh was talking about the Clintons and the left wing conspiracy I think it did raise questions about whether he would in fact be a part is that\nI'm a political type of person\nAnd so I wouldn't be surprised if the conversation starts to evolve this week away from the events in question in the Nineteen eighties and more towards Kavanaugh's dude ability for the court or\nThe question though and that the point that I Would make is that you know a lot of lawmakers made their decisions about ... even before these allegations surfaced you had many Democrats come out as soon as having all was\nOr shortly thereafter saying that they could not support him and you had lots of Republicans ah really cheering him on so there is a question of you know how much the events of uh that we learned last week how much we learned this week\nHow much it will actually change minds I think Republicans also are considering that the idea that they have wanted to shape the makeup of the courts that's been an organizing principle for them and election after election\nAnd so they have to kind of weigh that against the allegations that they've already heard and against any new information that comes out this week that pertains to the events in question and also that pertain to Kavanaugh's a personality and his fitness for the court\nWill Michael warn me chime in here because if as Kaitlin says we do start hearing more Democrats talking about issues of temperament will that argument hold any weight now because there has been so much emphasis placed on allowing the FBI to investigate\nMen do I think if that's where the argument shifts as as Kaitlin suggest to might\nUm it suggests that Brett Kavanaugh was going to be confirmed as a Supreme Court or or to the Supreme Court\nI mean this is I'm a respect for you I think a a ... his ah his testimony his anger\nYou're in that are in that testimony on Thursday or somehow revealed something about the kind of justice he would be what we're not hearing news any sort of analysis of his actual time on the bench he's a he's with on the DC circuit court one of the most powerful\nOr courts in the country or in this claim about\nPerhaps it robs somebody will now perhaps somebody will go back through some of his decisions and find it but so far they haven't um uh and and and I think Jeff Flake is getting something here remember flick is one of the three Republican senators I'm we're on the fence about cabinet none of the Democrats\nAre who are who are including Chris Coons were mentioning they're concerned about his temperament oh we're really ever going to vote for him in the first place um will Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake a change their mind because of the uh the angry way in which\nCabinet responded to what he claims are smears\nUm I don't think so is this the investigation finds out the capital has lied about this or has a lot about anything anything else that he's been accused of that will change things up but but the anger on display or I think a won't make a difference with the people who who matter in this decision which are those three Republican senators\nOr take a quick call here on this point let's go to Rick who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the Iraq\n[noise] Ricky their maintenance high yeah go ahead ray you're\nUh I really don't have too much faith that he will not\nBe pushed on the Supreme Court or I'm going to be asking [noise] perhaps British civic lesson if he is a\nAcquainted and confirmed um when will he\nWill have to decide how many cases you have to recuse himself because of his are blasted NATO to carry it or the Clinton years and are conspiracy or to the other members of the court to\nDecide when recusal should and should not be used\nRick and Rick thank you for your call peer Thomas you want to pick up on that because\nUh I think if you know a ... judge Kavanaugh on Thursday he talked about well funded left wing groups et cetera and if you're one of those quote unquote left wing groups and you bring a case before the Supreme Court\nWould you be right to be concerned about a ... a justice cabinet if the if he so becomes his ability to fairly educated case like that\n[noise] you know it's interesting a lot of the things that were said again we're out of anger I think what the caller is picking up on is the invoking of the Clinton for example that some people thought that that was a bit too much\nIn terms of the judge and whether he recused himself the justices have a lot of latitude to determine what they feel like they may have a conflict of interest on 'em but most of the judges in in many of these cases see themselves as the arbitrators on the facts and\nIf it's not often that they recused himself from cases\nAll right well let's go to another call here Reggie is calling from ... Iowa you're on the air Reggie\nYeah so I was wondering if the FBI comes back and so they can find no evidence to support doctor board or any of the other accusers\nSimple democratic and let you in your vote because I think they made up their mind they opt for Justice Kennedy said he was going to require there were voted no on whoever was nominated I don't even talk to the Democrats in the Senate believe it you can't get the good covered with those they want to go no\n... Reggie thank you for your call Caitlin Huey burns I mean I feel like Joe mentioned is the one one Democrat that keeps coming up\nRight I think that we have to kind of separate separate out some of these red state Democrats these are\nAnd Beth Israel Deaconess looking for people with IDS who are interested in the mind body research study I'd be a study dot org\nProtecting independent journalism is important to all of us Bruce Kellerman explains\nHer nation was founded on free flow of information is a lot that said these days reading sounds like journals but it's not always accurate or necessarily even troops providing people with honors and accurate information so they can use it it's really about swimming\nWe work really hard to get a right\nProtect independent journalism give now at W. B. U. R. dot org\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker Bertie we're talking this hour with Caitlin Huey burns she's CBS News digital political reporter also with peer Thomas chief justice correspondent for ABC News and like a war and senior writer at the Weekly Standard and we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for it to three talk\nUh and I want to talk with all of you about the midterms here and just a just a second here but peer you said something before the break that wanted to follow up on 'em in particularly because you're justice correspondent for ABC News about\nHow the the purpose and intent of the FBI's background ongoing or background investigation right now are into the allegations around judge Kavanaugh that that's supposed to provide some of the detail and clarity a around these allegations that until now we possibly don't ... right\nBut I mean I just want your thoughts on this like so many people over the weekend and even today are saying how can we possibly get trustworthy clarity\nIs the FBI isn't even investigating things like the allegations of a judge Kavanaugh's excessive drinking in college we have multiple people coming forward saying they want they want to talk to the\nPerhaps no one's reaching out to them to hear them\nI I guess we have to be very careful about describing what the investigation will unfold for example a mystery mirrors talks about the fact of this incident happening at Yale University\nSo the FBI interviews hurt and they get information from her regarding other people who may have known about\nThis incident contemporaneously\nSo therefore if the FBI goes in talks with those people they may end up getting information that speaks to whether judge Kavanaugh\nA drink to excess whether he has a demeanor change so that may end up in what's called the FBI three oh two which is the the report that they fall regarding what the witnesses say again the FBI would draw no conclusions about\nWho's telling the truth or not but what you may end up as a body of work which includes witness after witness saying the same kinds of things and again we'll let support judge Kavanaugh's version of the story or will it you know attack\nThere wasn't and I mean ... I'm asking you about this and we talked about earlier show because I Want to be sure we get it right a ... we can't be sure if the FBI would talk to those people right because it again there's confusion about whether or not the White House counsel's office and say here's the list of people you can talk to full stop\nRight we don't know if they have to go back to the White House and say we've been given these additional names of people who may know specifics about this incident\nCan we go talk to them um typically the FBI has the ability and the authority to go do that uh because most times the client wants to know this level of detail most and again the question here and we're we're tiptoeing around it is\nIs there a conflict of interest in this case the White House's client their directing the FBI to pursue the questions that they want answered the same time this White House has made it very clear that they want Mr Kevin up approved confirmed\nAnd there's no guarantee that we will ever know who the FBI actually spoke to with certainty or if the report is not made public and if I'm remembering correctly for example the FBI's investigation back in Ninety One with Clarence Thomas that hasn't been made public at All right\nWell it in theory we'll go to the White House and then the senators are one hundred uh who will vote on his a nomination will be able to get access to it the question then becomes will leak when it gets to Capitol Hill has a little bit different era now\n[laughter] so so much has\nSo much and yet so little at the same time that change in Nineteen Ninety One so let's talk a little bit about the more and more detail about the mid term here and in order to set that up I just want to play a actually a clip from a conversation on sixty minutes yesterday with one man who is not running for reelection Republican Senator Jeff flake because he\nTold Scott Kelly or that if you had been running for reelection\nHis decisions regarding um a delaying the vote on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination would have been very very different\nCould you have done this if you were running out of ... not a chance now because politics has become too sharp to Puerto ... there was no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nMichael what I'm saying here also is just a recent study from cue that says that uh Seventy six percent of the potential midterm voters are saying that the Supreme Court nominee with a process around it is a very important issue to them in these midterm elections I mean how big is this\nA it is big but I don't think we know exactly how it plays out um you know George Will often says\nThat the political parties organizer animosity is not you know politics has as much about\nAh who do you hate or maybe a little nicer who you're not like who do not want to see in power I'm clearly Donald Trump himself has been and organizing for ... for Democrats who who of sort of woken up uh in our own are expecting\nA a good election in the midterms um my question is how many more potential democratic voters are left to be woken up an an energized to vote in the midterms\nI think there is a question about whether or not enough Republicans\nAre have a have been energized huh I don't think the Trump Administration as it's gone on a has given Republicans much to be excited about perhaps a and walk away to see a how polling is a week or so after the uh the the hearings last week\nUm perhaps the feeling that judge Kavanaugh is under siege many ah give Republicans a reason to get to the polls that they haven't had a for the last uh Eighteen months um I don't know if that's going to be the case we've been talking about the way that uh that women voters might respond\nI'm a you know anecdotally I hear from Republican women voters who are sort of take the opposite of you that you might expect him say that I'm actually judge ...\nAnd we just don't know how that's going to play out but I think an issue like there's something that does animate voters or in a way that ah that that that does energized from to get out in the pool right ah in November ...\nIn fact we heard the president himself over the weekend at those rallies galvanizing his supporters and saying you know if you want to preserve the\nUh the futures of of judges judge Brett Kavanaugh will go to the polls in November I mean he's absolutely using it as a rallying cry on the other hand you look we've got so many comments on our website I'm seeing your saying\nThat a quote I think we're seeing a new political party emerge a party of women to different possibilities for the cabinet nomination the women of the Senate block it or he is confirmed\nAnd the women of the nation rally their power to throw the bums out that is a comment on our website on point radio dot org let's go to Steve who's calling from Bangor Maine you're on the air Steve\nI Would agree with that oh that is absolutely I find that in my early ... you know all all will go um it's a generational thing where we social media is lit up and I think\nThere are a few meals are are motivated you know they listen to their mothers or their grandmother you know uh the slogans like really come a long way we are this is like\nWhere we haven't Shane we still have men mostly now in their fifties who were making decisions you know on a ... you know talk about sexual assault in the ... and then they'll ever done nothing to control the military and the\nAnd and so I think your mode the bottom line your nails are motivated organizing a Alexander Alexandria court as New York court gee that's another one yeah like all that are normally you know back and that really happened women can't really you know get out of the kitchen\nWill seem you know since you brought up a the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez a victory there I I Want to actually take that and thank you so much for your call and turn it to Caitlyn Huey burns because you know we heard Michael say earlier just a minute to Michael worn saying\nThat um you know he asks and I think it's a good question uh you know how many democratic voters are they're left to be woken up for these midterms um uh but as the caller pointed out there's the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez are raised in New York I had a ... victory in Massachusetts as well I mean to those\nThose those campaign so they want because they brought voters to the polls who's ... who had never voted before so\nYou could Kavanaugh stuff further galvanized those young people\nWell I think that Michael brings up a really key point and something that question that I've been hearing from Republicans as what is the ceiling of enthusiasm for Democrats we know that at at a snare we've seen it and the turnout numbers from the primaries we've also seen in terms of women", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "01"}
