I Want to play a clip here from two thousand seven this is from an episode of Baird real man versus wild and he was dropped into the rugged terrain of Western Australia and he ran out of water and here's what happened next\nTime they drink my I had Mrs [noise] sorry I've never done before and I'm expecting it to be pretty horrible [noise] but I Need a gene that birds going and [noise] it may seem disgusting but you are in your in it's safe to drink [noise]\nFair\nGrills a re hydrate ing in Western Australia India thousands\nSeven uh then I'm going to argue and I forget that [laughter] I'm gonna let you off the first time I go entirely that bend you're lucky what do you drink you know you're lucky if I got about a novel with an apple juice then would you go so far as to treat your urine you had to duck on\nA mountain [laughter] depends [laughter] probably yeah\nThank you for big our surprise guest this hour or ... let me let me turn back to you or was it disgusting it sounds like it was\nA ... a lot of things and survival of disgusting you know but ... you got to leave your prejudices behind you go to do whatever it takes and survival food is never going to taste Niceville look nice and survival\nYou know fluid set need I taste nice but it's about doing whatever it takes you know and and I'm definitely not one of these people who drinks pay for founding editor of therapy with ... and actually I've met a few of them over the years and that kind of make a swift exit if I get Qunu by somebody tells me they do it for fun I you know not hunting\nIn your book though how to stay alive ad on page twenty here you actually have this really great a diagram of below ground solar still\nThat if you're in the desert I eat someplace like Western Australia if you dig a hole in the ground but what a foot or so deep and if you have a piece of plastic you put plastic over that whole and some rocks around it\nAnd the stone in the middle so that I'm a water whatever water content in the soil around the the whole will actually condense a underneath the the plastic and drip into a cop and you say you stay here if you you're an eight in the whole before setting up the still\nMoist junior year and will condense into clean drinking water why didn't you knew that\nThat she could the thing is if you're really dehydrated\nDrinking you'll pay when it's brown pay is not going to help you you're just into pure waste product\nSo if you can make a cell is still like this you have the you have the resources to do that\nPaying into the bit around that you're gonna evaporate like you say condense and then you you're going to get fluids out of that but if you uh well hydrated when you find yourself stranded in survival situation for example you call it breaks down or whatever it is you know I knew what hydrate said you don't want to be paying out\nThose fluids because actually if you pay is clear\nThat that can actually help ... so you want to be drinking that you want to be using in other ways maybe paying onto your clothes and wrapped around your head to Kuti ahead\nUm you know in the little things about the bunch of times I mean it was right she loves looking back in because well it's always the crew the guy that you think the next few days we'll move after my T shirt wrapped around my neck you know on the head scarf the pay and you know I bet he said look you know if it's about whatever Italians in it\nSince you mentioned your crew I've always wondered I mean how ... your crew is there with you with their equipment having to go through the same terrain and as you are I mean how how how much do you ask of them in terms of a ... of having a survival mindset or doing the things that you're even doing\nI'll tell you what they are they're incredible they really are they're being with me from day one is a small team\nYou know we're real kind of band of brothers and a foot of respect and admiration and everything you kind of thing can hype about them is true you know they always say hey bet you have the easy job we're going to do everything you do the back woods carrying a camera you know and it's a ...\nBe under no illusion they are incredible and they work the hardest and the the real unsung heroes and the whole story\nAll right well we're speaking with their grills he is host of running wild with their grills

B. Y. dot org slash sponsorship\nIs on point I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking this hour with Baird grills he's got a new book out at how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation and there before the break we heard from college Steve who was former navy special forces that here in the U.S and he'd he'd gone through the ... the Navy's really rigorous ear training and he was talking about how\nI'm One of the toughest things for him was the mental challenge of the forty eight hour period that\nNot you've ever experienced a similar challenge or has gone out on one of these survival expeditions without a a a a camera crew and I'd hang couldn't let you respond before the break but I wanted to give me a shot at that now\nYou know first of all the respect for your service and a lot of ... to the\nA guy who ran in the food is your by Sally Ride the bathroom for survival is won or lost in the mind um the sea of training is something I went through like rise with part of the British special forces or it is long it is odd shifted its tough\nAnd the time on your own ... I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's hard but you need to kind of get into that mind five cars are okay we're into this you know however long it's going to be just break it down into the daily tasks\nAnd I she found you get you get so busy surviving you know use his job off the job and people kind of\nYou know often underestimate how busy this is a lone survivor to look up to yourself and\nAgain you know when we're now as a crew you know when were filming staff everything is so much easier when you have an extra set of hands if you need it you know putting up shelters are getting a fog and someone else if you needed just to put a first on that well you do you know the ...\nThe everything on the ground is so much harder but it's all so busy you know I just remember that save training I went through to the days on our own it was just doing to a doctor and the sea collected firewood repairing the setting snap as doing that\nAnd by the end in sight yeah yeah\nIt's all on your shoulders and then it's a mental Saudi you got to keep yourself up beef you gotta keep thinking like you know I always say to people and it's the Bible situations never letting your mind go into neutral is always something they are doing to think about the planning\nAnd um and that's why it becomes very draining what the times on the right I I think it's three times higher than when you go one other buddy with you\nThere just one of the thing that Steve had said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response from you because then I actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he ... he was man and he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training and I was\nThinking he's really highly trained navy special forces a guy\nA and and so he manage just near rabbit or two but I was wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on television or at least survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is\nYeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on Sallie Mae spending three hours trying to lie to five but that is often the reality of a sudden in the old days on the Memphis while shows\nYou know I spent hours and hours doing this or you know hours and hours setting ... obviously that she was going to make a really boring program you know I guess edited down and ... you know it's like the music and ... got a guy but\nYou got to the reality of it it is it is hard work for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just this is one that runs the show survivor of summed up three was never give up or what about that nasty that spirit\nAnd you might have to go through multiple failures hours and days of\nOf getting something wrong before you get success and that's why the rules so we've got to that do get the determine your next Saturday to\nThe Berlin the brave the strongest well so let's do a lightning round a quick quick right here for\nBy the way to rabbits for a few people [laughter] that is going to be no one do you love food the fans you know like wow yeah I I'm not saying that seventies I we we run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave with nothing no camera crews running and they have to\nFilm everything in themselves that you know we come back a month later and it's like ... like stream weight loss it\nAnd that is the reality of survival is yet you're starving you ... your frighten you wet your cold and ... and you know and that's why it is is it's very on glamorous it's right on romantic Ohio reality of survival is great\nWell so speaking of the the glamorous part of survival I Do we just got so many questions here a lot of them coming in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round so I asked a question in just a quick answer so we can get through\nA as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans in survival situation is ... how miserable is bears intestinal track I mean does he sit there and say why couldn't it be somewhere with some nice stopped grubs to eat\nYour mind tests are tracked needs needs some attention yeah [laughter] I'm like\nI mean there's definitely don't care about the failures number of things have eaten the end of a bad guy rare and stuff and I saw um but on the whole is you're not getting the land villa by the failures that and your next time I got ... to ... that one again\nRight so I get Matt wanted to know how often as Barrett guessed wrong and ingest poisonous planter animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said\nBut not but also you've got to be ...\nThanks once and when it comes to you know poison things I've ... mushrooms and and ... you got to really know you stuff and be careful and if the doubt there's no doubt don't eat it right you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms\nYou know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas that look like so many things okay and then\nYou know I mean look at that story from Alaska was at one such a great film you know the other end of the wind and the Alaska insight into one day and I had a baby coming on yeah I got her own ran to get it wrong ones out there\nAnd by the way if you have it from folks have already Jon Krakauer as original book it's amazing uh Tanya be asked any special advice pertaining to women [noise] well hey\nListen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild is that they make incredible survivors enough taken so many running wild guess\nThat you know you think that the man the the the big Bush ... who's got the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the middle of an actress severely thinks she can snap in the wild and she's also dislike made of steel so survival is all about that in the spirit the outer muscles\nAnd I'll see an incredible Geraldo ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on a team who ... you know it's such an inspirational survival is so they are living examples that survival is all about spirit and ... to nasty impulsivity [noise]\nUm and actually some of them have the guns the guy with the you know [laughter] or that if it was impressive to see as well\nAll right one more a lightning round here question Sam Winston on Twitter or say on our website says there can you do your classic how like when you accomplish a big Klein thanks that's from Sam ...\nSome odd never give out the were on it we're moving on a ski guys stay positive protein in we can do to\nTheir grills and his class how let's go

part of a pine tree\nIt's high income you know drink the water from the early part but I Can't find the information to know what that is true or not\nThat is true that the the pine tree is one of the unsung heroes of the wilderness so much you can do everything you mentioned but also more you know the old days they used to use the reds and mix it with a charcoal from afar make glue outta that\nUh you know ... ... ... to ... ah there's so much to do I spend a lot of time is moving through forests just chewing on the chewing on the needles good victim and see you know I mean you think of all of the\nClassic old Raul navy and the old days sending around the world and ... and things ... and everyone was dying lack of intimacy and yet they were harvesting pine trees whether we're going to replace them moss and the ships but will they didn't realize that the ... the pine trees could give them a lot more than just good new\nMosque some that ship it could give them all the victim and see and it was it a hundred years later they figure these things outside\nThe pine tree is one of the many heroes of the outdoors and also super easy to make five with you get that ... a lot of resident

U. T. she's joining us from Austin, Texas Brandon running house joins us as well he's a political science professor at the University of Houston\nJoining us from Houston as well and we want to know what you think I mean if you're if you're living in Texas what is this Senate race feel I feel like to you on the ground here what do you think about the fact that it's so close between\nCrews and or ... and if you're living outside of Texas\nOh what is the the Texas race mean to you in terms of what we might see politically when the midterms do roll around in November where at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nAshley Lopez I wanted to turn back to you here for a second because we were talking about the the really big growth in the Latino community in Texas here I mean the two thousand ten census showed that\nFifty one percent of the state's overall population is Hispanic or Latino and I'm seeing some numbers here two and a half million maybe to point seven million new Texans have come into the state between ah since two thousand ten and more than half of them are Latino so this is a ... a huge potential I don't want to call it a voting bloc that are ... not monolithic\nAnd rented was saying but the huge growth in I'm In the electorate there\nYeah and look you know there are set to become at least by twenty twenty two the biggest population group and the state so even if Democrats where to find a way to mobilize and and get loyalty among a large portion of that group and they would argue I've I've heard that immigration because it's such a huge issue and the Trump Administration\nHas had such unpopular policy it here in Texas among Latino that this would be like the right time to start doing that\nI mean the other issue and and I heard this a lot from people who work in democratic politics who said that you know they see this opening to really um capture a larger part of the Latino group a\nLatino voters is that they haven't really spent a lot of money here it takes a lot of money to register voters in Texas and voter registration drives and mobilization therefore costs a lot of money and Texas\nAnd progressive groups in third party groups that are interested in growing the Democratic party don't see a good investment here because it's been so Republican for so long so I mean it is true that this is this could be the future of the party it probably is the future of the party\nI'm here in Texas but it it just you know it takes a lot more work than has yet Ian I see a\nBrand and running house so we can focus a whole hour multiple hours on the the political force that the growing Hispanic and Latino community in Texas\nOr will form but I'm also seeing though that you're taking the conversation back to how Texans feel about president Donald Trump that in fact the president's ah um approval ratings in Texas are probably lower than the one might think some thirty nine percent\nThey're they're low overall um recently\n... percent um but that's really propped up by Republicans who support him to the tune of about eighty six\nTo Ninety percent so it's really driven by Republicans and this is not terribly surprising if there's a lot of unity within the party that number has grown because there was a time where there are definitely people who objected to Donald Trump and Democrats or Republicans who were favoring\nKind of people who want to get to remote places so it's small and zippy and he can fit skis or hiking camping gear and easily and it's\nJust a joy to drive and we should stress you get your pick if you want the cross track if you want the outback\nThese are both fantastic cars one thing that I'm I'm really interested in is\nThe the the the something we have the willow street hoses Ninety eight percent of sue Bruce sold in the last decade are on the road today that is some amazing longevity if you're like me I drive my car until it dies\nSo if you're like me this was the car for you and this is a car you could win by doing your part for the new year WB you are one eight hundred nine zero nine nine to eight seven or online at W.

the we're talking about the Senate race in Texas between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke and I'm joined today by Ashley Lopez brand and riding house and Abby Livingston\nAs well and look here are some of the ads that Texans are are listening and listening to you and and watching on their televisions\nThis is from a campaign ad from Beto O'Rourke it's one of his highlights one of his favorite talking points that he's visited every county in Texas to meet people across the state and he highlighted that fact in his first ad\nWe weren't\nDollars off the\nGeorge Washington actually burn churches margins\nThat's an ad from congressman Beto ... campaign and here's some sound from an ad that ripped the Senator Ted Cruz of campaign is running\nWhat\nYou\nLive in\nAn ad there from Senator Ted Cruz running house that that Ted Cruz at ... ... talk to me a little bit about it because I think it speaks to some things that that a lot of Texans hold dear I mean the the right to gun ownership but the idea that\nI'm a ... maybe liberalism can't be something that that represents the state of Texas\nYeah you're going to say that this was something that holds the Texas hold dear because it's like country music but I think that's true as well\nThere's definitely a a synergy there and clearly the cruise campaign to understand how to run in taxes they know that there's a certain like guys as you say for\nVoting um to keep you know people's guns I'm keeping a fairly conservative philosophy and that's something that was successful for Ted Cruz so there's definitely enough Republican support in a midterm election that an organic\nKind of campaigns that relies on priming Republicans through these conservative policies can work\nWork has to tangibly make up about a million votes and the just the shores God made little green apples Republicans will come to vote in mid term so the difficulty of trying to make up that with a campaign like Cruz's running which primes Republicans and prime conservatives it just makes it really difficult well\nLet's take a call here Christine is calling from San Antonio Texas Christine you're on the air\nGood morning I'm just calling and I need millennial voters and for the twenty sixteen election I had about eight or Donald Trump\nConservative household my husband is conservative my whole family is but I've been very encourage and I and voting for that to work this election in November just because he looking beyond party line and I think that's so important to 'em in the day and age right like you're either a Republican or Democrat\nI my mother and I have two children and I think it's so important that I raised my children with positive values and I really appreciate what that don't work is\nGoing out there and I'm making it a point to meet people where they're at ... and um I really appreciate what he's doing\nChristine touched a quick question before before you go yeah did you support Senator Cruz before this year yes I did go so what's changed their hand\nIn that um I really I whenever he was in the twenty the female action\nAnd how just doesn't like the talk that whenever he looks like me too I'm President Trump and just how\nLike how he's steady getting sand and all of a sudden he decided oh I'm gonna be for him and then I don't know like President Trump tweets about Ted Cruz and and now he's supporting him I just think that\nYou're a true um I think it's important that person's true colors and how he just\nWas really again President Trump knows any for him like yeah that's that's not to show you something about sunny personality how I really appreciate how that nor work is just um he is who he is\nOf course you can ask you one more question I'm again I'm really glad you called in because you were talking about you you liked the fact that ah you you think that you feel that Beto O'Rourke supports women's rights I mean I just want to touch on one of these controversies that hit the campaign recently right to\nA controversy over something he wrote in Nineteen Ninety One or a review for a Broadway musical of where he is in the review he wrote some I'm\nAn unkind things about the female actresses in that Broadway musical you know he wrote that there are only qualifications seem to be their phenomenally large\nBody parts or need to say it does that concern you\n[noise] um I I don't know um [noise]\nI Know he's apologized for it ... and um [noise] I I honestly I don't know I Know that I mean I Can't say that okay because that's not that it takes a lot for the making of college I just don't get that for women's rights\nYeah ... ... I I just wanted to I don't know is a perfectly finance or rock hard certainty sometimes is probably is what gets us in trouble so who thank you so much for your call\nAbby Livingston let me turn back to you on that Christine on the one hand must be a Republican Texas Republicans worst nightmare but on the other hand I mean she talked I Do wish talked about Senator Ted Cruz I keep coming back to this question about whether the challenger\nThis time around is Ted Cruz himself and that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there were more positive and likeable Republican senatorial candidate\nI think it's also I think she I I've heard similar things ah from what she said um I think it's important to remember what a rough landing crews had in his presidential campaign and he was sort of\nYou know I mean it it's hard to um be against Trump I mean in retrospect endorsing Trump and the fall of twenty sixteen was probably the smart political move 'em but it did there there are women in Texas who have a lot of problems particularly when Trump made fun of cruises wife\nI'm In Texas that's just sort of a an and I would call these women a husband should stand up for his wife\nAnd so it's it's a tough ... he was and I do think if this was John Cornyn we wouldn't be talking about this race or it would be much more um he would have a much bigger lead a corner and it's just a different president and Cruz is very very polarizing and so I think she underscores that\nOkay well I Want to play one more piece of tape here uh this is something that went viral on social media and um it has to do with an answer that Beto O'Rourke gave 'em when he took a question from an audience member at a campaign event and the question of believe came\nFrom a military veteran and the veteran asked whether or not NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem was disrespectful to members of the military and are working to ended up giving quite a long answer was several minutes long um he began by saying my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful\nUm and so we just want to play a portion of the remainder of what he said\nAre frustrated friendly with people like me and millions of visions of public draws in power who have been unable to resolve this or bring justice for what has been drawing and dissolve it from January to happen in this country and Long Island we peacefully\nMajor funding for on green is provided by Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and ranchers insurance through the Geico insurance agency additional information can be found at Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven ...

Stanford joins us as well she's in obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital weight center and she's with us\nYou know on point studio here in Boston now Michael before the break you were sort of ... you gave us the top three bullet points of the\nAspects of obesity that you felt that we kind of collectively misunderstand so let's dig into some of those a little bit more talk to me about the one where you you you said wait and health are not perfect sending them but we oftentimes feel as if they are with people who are struggling with their weight what are you in\n[noise] ah well first of all I Want to say Hi to team up because I actually visited her clinic as part of writing this article about a year ago like oh this is Hi I was like we hung out together [laughter] so yeah I Know it was really fun ask 'em\nAnd I think I mean as the team you know there's there's a lot of debate in the medical community about what exactly metabolic the healthy obesity means right and then some studies find that there's a small percentage\nOf fat people with metabolic healthy obesity and some studies find a much larger percentage and I actually you know Fifteen or feel free to disagree with me but I feel like it doesn't actually matter that we know how\nDifficult weight is to lose and we know how harmful it is to shame people for their weight and so if there are big health effects of obesity\nI'm not sure that it really helps for you know a neurologist to tell somebody you have to lose forty pounds before I treat your migraines I mean I think for people that do want to lose weight I think it's really important\nYou know I mean I I think it's fine to talk with a health risk in the same way you know I'm a gay man\nTheir health risk associated with gay people gay people are more likely to use illegal drugs they're more likely to have unsafe sex it's perfectly fine for my doctor to talk to me about those things but he needs to talk to me about those things in a\nBut but we need everyone out there listening to do their part if everyone out there right now became a sustaining member of WB you are done we might need to do you know we might not need these pledge drives at all because we would know that we had ongoing support from the community and that we can provide ongoing news coverage in return\nThat's how this works if you want to see this

... efforts or maybe a call to rethink how we think about the obesity epidemic in America I'm joined today by Michael Hobbs\nHe's a staff writer at Huffington Post and he wrote an article called everything you know about obesity is wrong and also with us is Dr for team of Cody Stanford she's the obesity she's an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital\nDr Stanford and Michael so many callers I just want to let people have their say let's go to set who's calling from Johnson City Tennessee you're on the air Seth\nCall 'em so I just got on to talk about something the Michael brought up near the beginning of the food and we talked about the way that his mom was treated kind of um by her friends and then kind of her behavior home um I think it's really interesting because I've struggled with my weight my entire life\nUm but I've never really what my wait hold me back it always seems to be the prejudice reaction\nI'm kinds of stigma and things like that but I get from other people\nUm that really hold me back so Johnson City Tennessee the huge area outdoors activities or giant um so I'm always very active however there have been several times in my entire life where I just don't get included and thing because\nPeople think that my weight on them back uh-huh I'm so it's kind of interesting but it doesn't just affect me but it also affects my relationship on Broadway\nYeah well ... thank you for your call a and thank you for sharing your story I Want to get Cindy in here who's calling from Charlotte North Carolina Cindy you're on the air\nHi thank you I have to point one is about the definition of a big city I Am a very ... very active by well and\nWhen I get on the scale I Am airport will be so that the very definition of a case that's what counts the number on the scale and like high\nRight now the am I right\nAway but that that's that's that's one point the most important one I think it's that I never hear anyone talk about what is underlying the eating that they've here so you know as a society we we treat symptoms not positive\nI Know so many very obese are absolute caretakers they're running a foster kids they're carrying for everybody no time for them so they ... themselves it ... it\nWas so close and personal care tape and I never hear not very [noise] talk about that may be a solution for it is treating the beneath the people in the\nSenate is Cindy let me just jump in here thank you for your call because doctors Stanford go ahead yeah so um it's been able to address few appoints thanks so much for calling your number one I'm you talked about the ... which is what the World Health organization uses for obesity and I would say definitely there are some some challenges with that I can tell you\nThat with each patient that I see I pay attention to the weight\nAnd then how can I pay very close attention to wait distribution so central out of pocket meaning weight that security net midsection\nIs most concerned because that does predispose patients to um heart disease and other illnesses such as fatty liver so I Would say that if for someone like yourself who seems to be a more muscular where there'd be a mind would not be necessarily the best criteria\nI Would pay attention to that we circumference of turning a waste of comforts of thirty five inches or less than we do have significant study's based upon ATP three guidelines that support that\nI'm with regards to the psychology I'm actually if you look at um doctor ... I'm Sorry Michel hops article he specifically did interview psychologist Dr ... song\nFrom them gee we'd center was interviewed and we do have all of our patients spend time with the psychologist delving two issues\nUm such as um what is the psychology behind 'em they're eating behaviors but not just their eating behaviors because of course that's the accusatory part I'm understanding what has been their struggles surrounding weight during the course of their life\nSo I Do think that that's a very important piece we have several psychologist like doctors all working on this and so um I Would I Would say that we do pay attention to that and I think Michael hops did do a good job by bringing those voices into the artist so I Want to switch you\nSwitch gears here for a second um and and take a step back and Michael I'll bring you back in here for this as well\nBecause I'm Dr Stanford I just I heard you a couple of times in this conversation you know coal ... especially extreme obesity and disease state implying that it's not a normal state now for some people are sort of a higher than average weighed might be their normal sort of bodies that point for their weight\nBut fifty years ago sixty years ago we didn't we didn't see the rates of overweight or obese Americans anywhere anywhere near what we have now so I mean I don't I don't think anyone's gonna say that\nNo the this epidemic that we're seeing is is normal right like ... and and so who [noise] this is such a layperson question but I just want to get your field for ... and ... and Michael you too [noise]\nIs it the food supply I mean where did this come from is it a mix of of the food that we're eating and genetic predispositions or something because it does feel like it kind of happened overnight absolutely I think this is I'm\nReally we are in an OB so genetic environment so I call it the perfect storm what we have is we have had a change in our food quality we've had a change in our physical activity we've had a change in the quality and duration of our sleep we've had a change in circadian rhythm um disturbances what I mean by that\nIs that we're rewarded with being able to talk to our colleagues in Russia\nSupposed to be sleep here in the United states to tell you that maternity it's terrible for our house [laughter] and I say that not not jokingly right if you're talking about sleep and and physical activity and food and especially for people who you know a lower income getting that high quality food Michael you pointed this out it's like eight times more expensive\nThan the food that they could get at the at the corner bodega\n[noise] yeah I mean you know four percent of our agricultural subsidies go to fruits and vegetables and when we talk to people about this kind of off brand advice about oh eat less and exercise more\nThat assumes that people have the time to exercise and that their neighborhood has sidewalks and parks where they can go jogging and they don't have two kids\nAnd two jobs and a lot of people do and a lot of people you know if you're spending food stamps what are you going to spend your food stamps on you're not going to buy broccoli which is wildly expensive and doesn't feed your kids you're going to get something really cheap and really easy and frozen in process and whatever else\nAnd that's I I don't think it's fair to blame people for that I think we have we we tend to blame our choices without blaming our options and our options have profoundly changed since Nineteen eighty and the choices that we make with in those options\nI don't think there's blaming kind of frame for that really helps very much when it's simply impossible or too expensive for most people to do the things we're always barking at them to do\nAnd so the reason why I wanted to bring this up duck to Stanford is because we were talking about rethinking how we approach obesity and um\nEven in that context this conversation is it's not bad but I felt this conversation being pulled into sort of um you know ... individual responsibility as things that can be done in the clinicians office et cetera but in order to really get a handle this epidemic we have to look way outside\nOf that we have to go outside the box we need to bring together a person's in healthcare persons in that our policymakers\nUm physical activity facilities schools et cetera I always talk about bringing together all of the people and that would really be everyone to the table to make this discussion really shift in a in a direction where we actually\nHad any dead on obesity rates in both a pediatric an adult population and and I think what we've done with regards to this epidemic his work entirely in silos medicine works by itself public health worse by itself um we come up with food labeling assuming that that's going to lead to change and obesity rate and we've seen none of that happened look at food deserts and\nOh if we get rid of food deserts that's going to change everything no we need to be coming together making these decisions together and really in order to make a shift in a way that's positive for the U.S and for the world\nWill get another call in here arenas calling from Providence Rhode Island Reno you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call um I Am a primary care doctor and Johnston Rhode Island just

U. T. she's joining us from Austin, Texas Brandon running house joins us as well he's a political science professor at the University of Houston joining us from Houston as well I mean one\nWhat is this Senate race feel like to feel like to you on the ground here what do you think about the fact that it's so close between crews and or ... and if you're living outside of Texas\nOh what is the the Texas race means to you in terms of what we might see politically when the midterms do roll around in November we're at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk\nAshley Lopez I wanted to turn back to you here for a second because we were talking about the the really big growth in the Latino community in Texas here I mean the two thousand ten census showed that\nFifty one percent of the state's overall population is Hispanic or Latino and I'm seeing some numbers here two and a half million maybe to point seven million new Texans have come into the state between uh since two thousand ten and more than half of them are Latino so this is a huge potential I don't want to call it a voting bloc ... not monolithic\nAs brand and was saying but the huge growth in I'm In the electorate\nThere yeah and look you know there are set to become at least by twenty twenty two the biggest population group and the state so even if Democrats where to find a way to mobilize and and get loyalty among a large portion of that group\nAnd they would argue I've I've heard that immigration because it's such a huge issue and the Trump Administration has had such unpopular policy it here in Texas among Latinos that this would be like the right time to start doing that\nI mean the other issue and and I heard this a lot from people who work in democratic politics who say that you know they see this opening to really um capture a larger part of the Latino group\nA Latino voters is that they haven't really spent a lot of money here it takes a lot of money to register voters in Texas and voter registration drives and mobilization therefore costs a lot of money and Texas\nAnd progressive groups in third party groups that are interested in growing the Democratic party don't see a good investment here because it's been so Republican for so long so I mean it is true that this is this could be the future of the party it probably is the future of the party\nI'm here in Texas but it it just you know it takes a lot more work\nDone has yet to done I see\nA brand and running house so we can focus a whole hour multiple hours on the the political force that the growing Hispanic and Latino community in Texas\nA will for him but I'm also seeing though that you're taking the conversation back to how Texans feel about president Donald Trump that in fact the president's\nAh um approval ratings in Texas are probably lower than the one might think some thirty nine percent\nYeah they're they're low overall um recent polling has gotten more and about fifty percent um but that's really propped up by Republicans who support him to the tune of about eighty six\nTo Ninety percent so it's really driven by Republicans and this is not terribly surprising if there's a lot of unity within the party that number has grown because there was a time where there are definitely people who objected to Donald Trump and Democrats or Republicans who were favoring\nTed Cruz and so now we've kind of morphed into one bigger sort of more continuous unit for Republicans that support Donald Trump but there's a lot of friction so\nI see so so is there another group of voters that we should be talking about here as potentially influential in this race I mean ... white suburban white women or women in general\nYeah I think that the suburban white women are going to be the biggest swing vote in this election that's really gonna what's probably drive any kinds of success that or walk fines and suburbs which is going to have a reciprocal effect of affecting some of the challenges the congressional level many of whom have\nA really harness this vote and could potentially do well\nBut I think if we're talking about changing demographics that we could talk about younger voters who are energized in significant ways in this election so that number breaks considerably in favor of better work they don't treat typically vote in the same numbers that we see for people who are over forty but\nIt is the case that those numbers are rising and just as an aside to I think that the number of Asian voters is increasing in some of the big suburbs in\nThese big Texas counties you've got the number of Asians far outpacing the actual rows of any other sub racial group and as a result you've got them potentially being of our poor partner\nPlaces like Ford been county here outside of Harris County outside of Houston are booming and that really could spell another level of success the Democrats might find so\nAshley Lopez that makes it seem as if turnout is going to be absolutely everything in in this race in November\nIt's always a wild card in elections in Texas I'm a big reason you know Democrats are always say a big reason that Texas has read is not because it's a conservative state it's because it's a non voting state\nSo if you get all these populations who don't usually vote that could change what Texas looks like if he changed the electorate you can change who gets elected so that's always the big question and especially during the mid term I mean this is a weird mid term because you know everyone's kind of excited and\nAnd angry and you know all that they typically like Democrats aren't likely to vote during midterms\nLike this could look different than most mid term now so I'm seeing for example Beto O'Rourke um\nUh a couple of Saturdays ago is quoted as having said our contention is that if no one's ever shown up\nAnd listen to you talking to to to voters\nOr potential voters and incorporated your story into why they're campaigning and the expectations were setting for one another then I wouldn't expect you to vote either so it was he hoping to dry out people who haven't bothered or haven't seen a reason to vote before I mean that's the that's the tactics that we've seen in other places we saw that\nIn New York with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez for example\nLike what are you betting on yeah go ahead Britain and it's like\nOh sorry I was going to say yeah it's definitely the case like actually said that the turnout was in ... in mid term years you're talking about\nProbably on the order of about forty percent which is extremely low now I think we'll have a turnout probably spike a little bit in this election because you definitely have the energy that we've seen 'em\nAnd so that's something that would definitely I think produced some democratic gains but you still have about two and a half million on register Texans who could otherwise register\nThe Latino population is only registered to vote at about birding forty four percent and that number is about eighty percent for Anglo so there's still some fundamental voting demographics would make it really difficult for Democrats to win statewide\nOkay well I Want to listen to a little bit more from the candidates themselves and by the way I should note that we definitely reached out to Senator Ted Cruz's campaign and to Congress and better routes campaign as well invited them or or one of the represent their representatives to join us today\nUh aerobics campaign declined our request and senator Cruz's campaign never responded to our class but we do our due diligence on that part\nBut let's hear from the senator anyway this is from the uh the Senate debate that they had on September twenty second and Senator Ted Cruz was asked about his contentious relationship with President Donald Trump especially the relationship they had during the twenty sixteen election and here's what Senator Ted Cruz said\nI have worked hand in hand with the president on substance in we have delivered remarkable victories the biggest tax kind of a generation we've seen for a million new jobs created since Trump was elected and we and we cut taxes and cut regulations we're seeing record low unemployment\nTexans lives are better so yes I could have chosen\nTo making about myself to be selfish and say you know what my feelings are hurt so I'm going to take my marbles and go home but I think that would have been not doing the job I was elected to\nThat Senator Ted Cruz on September twenty second let's take a call here Dan is calling from San Antonio you're on the air Dan\nHi thanks for taking my call 'em I wanted to say that\nWell there's a lot of work and I don't don't have all that much time but I did want to say that that the lord

I I just want to say I\nDon't know is a perfectly finance or rock hard certainty sometimes is probably what gets us in trouble so who thank you so much for your call Abby Livingston let me turn back to you on that Christine on the one hand must be a Republican Texas Republicans worst nightmare but on the other hand I mean she talked to the we talked about Senator Ted Cruz I keep coming back to this question about whether the challenger\nThis time around is Ted Cruz himself and that we wouldn't be having this conversation if there were more\nPositive and likeable Republican senatorial candidate\nI think it's also I think she I I've heard similar things ah from what she said um I think it's important to remember what a rough landing crews had in his presidential campaign and he was sort of\nYou know I mean it it's hard to um be against Trump I mean in retrospect endorsing Trump and the fall of twenty sixteen was probably the smart political move 'em but it did there there are women in Texas who have a lot of problems particularly when Trump made fun of cruises wife\nI'm In Texas that's just sort of a a um and I would call these women has been should stand up for his wife\nAnd so it's it's a tough conundrum humid than I Do think if this is John Cornyn we wouldn't be talking about this race or it would be much more um he would have a much bigger lead a corner and it's just a a different presidents and Cruz is very very polarizing and so I think she underscores that\nOkay well I Want to play one more piece of tape here uh this is something that went viral on social media and um it has to do with an answer that Beto O'Rourke gave\n'em when he took a question from an audience member at a campaign event and the question of believe came a from a military veteran and the veteran asked whether or not\nNFL players taking a knee during the national anthem was disrespectful to members of the military and are working to ended up giving quite a long answer was several minutes long um he began by saying my short answer is no I don't think it's disrespectful um and so we just want to play a portion of the remainder of what he said\nAre frustrated friendly with people like me and my vision of public drop in power who have been unable to resolve is justice for what has been drawing from January ... in this country and the Long Island we peacefully\nWildly argue this country are watching these games they drink on me to Reno changes that are good for this problem to ensure that we regard as why we're doing it and I can think of nothing more American than the [noise]\nWere actually Lopez or as I mentioned that went viral on social media which may or may not have significant meaning but how did that go over in Texas\n[noise] well I mean if you look at the black vote in Texas I Would say it went over really well specifically among black voters yeah something like Ninety seven percent approval according to like one latest poll on that one might be a little high but it it's not unlike most polls that have come out\nUm you know conservatives this is red meat for them this is something that Ted Cruz had been talking about um the NFL or in the the protest during the national anthem he's been talking about his rallies\nBecause it really frustrates conservative or they see this as like disrespectful to the flag into veteran so you know if you look at like democratic base voters this is something that they are so excited to hear you know a Democrat\nI'm standing up for racial injustice in their eyes and then on the on the other side you know conservative voters you know this is a polarizing issue so conservative voters see this very differently and are very frustrated by this\nBrenda running house I mean I think ... outside of Texas political watchers are saying that perhaps this is the way ... talks about these issues ah is one of the reasons why he's getting so much traction there that it's not", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "03"}
