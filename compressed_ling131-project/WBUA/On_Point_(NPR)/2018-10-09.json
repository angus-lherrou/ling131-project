broadcasting today from the studios of WHYY in Pennsylvania because we are talking about gerrymandering and Pennsylvania is\nAdventures in redistricting and really what effort or what impact that had on Pennsylvania politics on representation here and the Keystone State what impact it could have\nAs the discussion about gerrymandering and redistricting is taken to the national level I'm joined here today by lives our species a multimedia journalists were WHYY and also for Keystone crosswords media nonprofit that's really focused on the state's political challenges\nWe're also joined by Terry Madonna he's a professor of public affairs and the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin and Marshall College as well now Lindsay and Terry ah I just want to play a little bit of tape for you because uh we were talking about at the very beginning of the conversation how\nPennsylvania's gerrymandered districts were struck down in January of this year by the state Supreme Court\nAh and this weekend we actually caught up with Valentino did Georgia oh he's the chairman of the Republican Party for the state of Pennsylvania and you know he's previously called and I've seen this in your reporting a ... he's called he called the January twenty Eighteen ruling a hyper partisan decision by an activist judicial bench and he\nFollowed that up with us this weekend and here's what he said\nThere was nothing in Pennsylvania Constitution which says and not have to be fair whenever fair me did he just took it upon themselves to say fairness means [noise] now what we think it means and they drew in the process was one analyst called the Democrats dream map\nSo it was a it was just such a huge just to take and unconstitutional taking of power by the ...\nThe Valentino to Georgia the chairman of the Pennsylvania GOP now Lindsey ... let me just get a some impressions hear from you because first of all when to Georgia talks about this new map that the state Supreme Court drew they didn't actually want to have to do that they want they sent it back to the legislature to draw new map but that didn't work out\nYes and so the timeline here was it was pretty much a crunch so around ... well on January twenty second at the decision came down that the two thousand eleven map deprived Pennsylvania voters of the right to free an equal elections\nAnd basically gave Republicans an unfair advantage and diluted the Democrats boats and basically they gave about a month\nI'm In between that time to come up with a new map so they kicked it back to the legislature said OK guys you know give it to your best shot\nThat didn't happen and we saw these um these contingencies of different groups handing in math and just those Republican controlled legislature but Pennsylvania has democratic governor now they were supposed to agree on a new about the could it yes the governor was supposed to approve 'em the matter that the legislature um came up with it didn't have that didn't have\nThe first of all the legislature didn't do it the legislative leaders there there was never pass by the general assembly uniform of a law which is what is required and the Supreme Court in in all fairness to both sides of the Supreme Court did not give a legislature\nI think adequate time to come up with a map even if the legislature could've come up with a map\nWhen when I'm ... and they went back to there's a clause in the constitution known as free an equal yea which had never been applied in that way before I'm not suggesting what the court did was wrong or merely suggesting that they went back into\nA the Eighteenth century for the original constitution to find it\nThere yet but let me ask you both about that because you know we've had other cases that have worked their way through the federal system to the United States Supreme court but Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's who brought this case deliberately chose not to do that because\nThey saw the Pennsylvania state constitutions having stronger voter protections that even the U.S constitution but but Terry's indicating here that but this was a a novel reading lovely ...\nWell I think you also have to look at the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court there are five Democrats on the court and two Republicans on the court so we also see this change in the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court I'm so who are ultimately making the decision\nYeah that's exactly right I mean are they part of it was a political calculation on the part and are going into the federal court it could have going on and on and on for a relatively long period of time as it worked its way up through the through the Supreme Court\nAnd as that state court challenge was going on there was a parallel challenge for off of you know different theory in the federal courts that ended up going nowhere and actually that the federal judges decided that no it's not they can't say that it's a a gerrymandered map\nSo there's a lot of detail in terms of what's going to happen next in Pennsylvania about these new districts that have been ...\nDramatically from Republican uh to uh like balance\nA Republican Democrat or into the Democratic category or um some of them become profoundly more Republican I mean we'll talk about that in a minute but the but the point is is that a lot more of the districts are competitive now\nAnd that could have a big effect nationally because the Democrats need to pick up some twenty somethings seats and they're looking for anywhere from four to eight of them right here in this one state\nYou know the reason why I wanted to come here because I actually I'm also curious about a deeper question and that is sort of the divide in American politics and whether new gerrymandering is helping to drive that divide and if we reduce gerrymandering will we get\nMore moderate voices so so we actually went to the Lehigh Valley uh this weekend to do it asked that question now of course gerrymandering is not the only driver of hyper\nPolarized politics now but it does tend to ah drowned out moderate voices so I just asked voters up there what do they think about Pennsylvania's new districts and here's what some voters even the ... valley told us about what they see\nYou have a place for you for the church and uh\nThere's pumpkin pie pastry and pulled pork on the table at the Chapman quarries United Methodist church\nIt's in Pennsylvania is brand new seventh district in the Lehigh Valley on this day there's a meet and greet going on for Republican candidate Marty no Stein a bulletin board hangs on one of the wood paneled laws reminding members to keep Jesus at their core\nIn the middle of the room a volunteer has set up a life size cut out of President Trump giving a thumbs up Brian Rodgers takes a quick break from the meet and greet he's a grassroots coordinator for the no Stein campaign\nOf a campaign staffer a lot of quick meals\nLouis Hi valley was previously split into a long lobster shaped district that captured heavily Republican areas to the west near Harrisburg\nThat made it safe for former Republican Congressman Charlie dent a moderate who never faced a serious challenge ... retired this year saying basic governing had become far too difficult in Washington\nIs old district voted for Donald Trump by a margin of eight points Rogers says the newly drawn district favored Hillary Clinton by just one point\nMaking it one of the most competitive races in this year's midterms\nI like to think of the valley is a microcosm of the United states blue dog Democrats to Trump Republican voters rural areas suburban areas urban areas and it's it's just going to be a battle and we know that we always try to better\nRogers calls no Stein a different kind of conservative primarily because his candidate wanna cycling gold medal at the Sydney Olympics\nNo Stein also advocates for strict term limits but he falls in line with the ... on key issues low taxes anti abortion pro Second Amendment rights also calling for an end to the Affordable CARE Act\nNew Stein is also a farmer and a small business owner and that's what excites Dorothy Nicholas she organized the church meet and greet he's\nNot a pie in the sky conservative there's people who are just the ideologues and he is not an ideologue he is a working man\nSo I ask Nicholas question does she think political compromise may be possible in her new balance district\nYou will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots versus the socialists and and the global is\nNicholas says there's another divide she thinks Democrats are encouraging a sense of victimization and women and other women at the table nod in agreement\nFord I think she was victimized but she came across as for me that would not have been our response not by any means we refuse to be victims we we would have been angry\nAnd yet when he closed does not approve of the fact that millions of women and men are angry right now and they're taking action they're marching in the streets and protesting on Capitol Hill but to Nicholas that kind of anger isn't becoming it's not viable she says\nRyan Rogers Marty no signs campaign staffer puts it this way\nI think that ultimately will come down to just the contrast of candidates are all things been results versus resistance\nIn the forecast mostly cloudy tonight to mid fifties tomorrow cloudy start turning sunny by the afternoon upper seventies\nW.

Pennsylvania Jason you're on the air\nFor taking my call um I I'm from a\nEleventh district and Pennsylvania just thing is running and um I also helped I also did some volunteer work for a George Scott any a tenth district and I was\nHappy to see these two districts are now competitive especially the the ... district\nBut um\nI'd really like to say Pennsylvania move further in this direction and make it more fair mhm\nAnd I really wonder why should this be more of a mathematical law a procedure rather than a political procedure you know start are starting to topple after the state sort of mathematically work your way through the population and the counties and Jay yeah boundaries are\nRight it's a good question Jason and I mean losing lives are even falling issue for a long time what do you think\nYeah I think you've got a great point there and I'm under the ah Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling and you know they they kinda borrowed from the state legislature or the state legislative district rules that\nYou know a congressional districts needs to be ... compact they need to be contiguous they need to split as few counties municipalities as possible and that part is in consideration cannot supersede those neutral criteria so I think that\nYou know I'm going forward and the ruling does say that there are these neutral criteria that needs to be considered before part is in concern but you know the quick didn't go so far and say that here's where you can you know a draw the line as far as when a\nDrawing districts becomes to part is and so there's it's today but there there are some guidelines that you know or the legislature can use going forward but I'm Terry Madonna to to the point\nThat the caller was making about you know are there algorithmic ways to get fairness out of a out of district masters or politics always going to be part of this process\nOh I don't think you can ... I don't think you can remove politics Democrats and Republicans were both trying to advantage themselves and actually because of the algorithms and these\nAre in these models that they now have\nThey can be more skillful added there actually can be better a jury may during because of the nature of\nThey they can literally get down to the precinct level you want to just said knock the district or the ward level the precinct level and divide and divided up the electorate in a way that benefits one party or the\nOther one's still is is that the rules for the algorithm August when I was thinking we think computers can do a better let's take another call here Jim is calling from Akron, Ohio Jim you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call I live in northern Sonoma County up the Akron Ohio area and we of course of a ... a Republican\nGovernor and a Republican Congress and they\nAre about three years ago they came over and ... northern summit county which was a democratic area and we now have a Republican congressmen were were they see and uh it was all gerrymandered that's how they got us and we lost our our Democratic Congress\n... you may I made a thanks go ahead Harry and how to make a point about this elections have consequences\nAnd what happened in two thousand and ten in the Tea Party election was not just that the\nRepublicans picked up sixty three house seats or put it another way the Democrats lost sixty three house seats\nBut that they took over state legislatures I think the number now and I may be off is thirty six state legislatures in which the Republicans control the state legislatures\nBoth houses and you can see what that means in states not every state does has done by law\nBut when you get all these Republican governors and Republican state lawmakers in state after state after state\nThat has a huge difference on writing the laws if each day you know that govern the judge drinking yeah exactly and the actual process itself so the two thousand and ten election\nWas huge not just in terms of the bringing the Tea Party to power the radiological conservatism that represents\nGo ahead was yeah just to piggyback on that just one thing that I think we saw with Pennsylvania is you know uh you know one of the most egregious gerrymandered maps in the country we see one party control right we see that the Republicans control the house the Senate that the governor's office and you know\nThere was no really check combined the Democrats would do a lot of it's being nonpartisan about an hour you're not partisan but the Democrats have done that already pointed out there's a district in Maryland yeah yeah so this is not parties in both parties will do that\nWell that's exactly the point I wanted to go to because if if the regardless of party if the party has the power it seems very natural in terms of American politics try to consolidate that power but but you know when Republicans do it and uh they have they have done here in Pennsylvania Democrats have done it elsewhere people keep talking to me about Marilyn\nA California back in the eighties and nineties\nUm but the point is is that is there a way to come up with a fair system that does mostly remove politics from the equation and and I'm here let me just limited to the limit let me play for you\nI'm a a little bit of tape here this is again Valentino to Georgia oh he's ... GOP chairman of Pennsylvania\nAnd he basically just takes he takes issue with that entire question because he says it's perfectly fine with legislators creating districts um and he really opposes the idea of any other systems specifically an independent citizens commission which we'll talk about here to second\nHe poses other systems to drop future congressional maps and here's what he said\nSome legislators are in the best position to draw lines and the end of the day heaven forbid politic should enter into a piece of legislation\nThat draws party you know political maps done all over the country Democrats have drawn maps of their favors and other states will get Marilyn so you know this is nonsense this was part of a rock Obama Eric Holder\nFair disturbing plan they called it to take back the rational these and they've done it here in Pennsylvania [noise] ...\nThat's about the Georgia Pennsylvania GOP chair citizens' lives are so he he he basically says we know the state the best we should draw the maps but there is this other idea about an independent citizens commission what would that look like in Pennsylvania I just have\nTo say I love that um operatic music behind fail in Columbus Day festival in in Philadelphia is taking me there to south Philly um so\nYou know I'd I'd groups in Pennsylvania fair districts PA um for a number of years now they've been trying to\nChange the Pennsylvania Constitution and to implement and independent citizens commission that would actually draw the lines and they've modeled this after California\nAnd and this is really a grass roots organization you see them at street fairs out you see them at events canvassing and you know uh they they they're asking the legislators to basically vote\nAgainst their interests to form this commission as you pointed out\nIf there is such a commission in California made up of a appointed independent citizens and I think some several other a couple of other states in the west have similar similar commission so who do they have they created fair districts\nUm if you talk to the the people on the commission yes if you talk to voters yes I think a key difference between Pennsylvania in California is that in Pennsylvania\nAnd there's no referendum so basically um to get that process in place at the state legislature would have to pass a constitutional amendment and then it would go to the voters for in a referendum\nThen there's no guarantee there's no guarantee that an independent commission itself would be truly independent I mean they have to be appointed by somebody other

yesterday about the consequences of global climate change it's a very dire new report and it's based on more than six thousand sided studies written by Ninety One authors from forty different countries\nAnd saying that if we continue on the path that we are now globally\nThat the devastation that climate change could cause would change human civilization permanently I'm joined today by Chris Mooney covers climate change energy and the environment for the Washington Post ... del also joined us he's professor of climate scientists at Duke University and was one of the authors on yesterday's report by the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change\nAnd we want to hear from you where it eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk a and cruise injured I just want to play us a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski scientist and lead author of VIP see the report\nAnd he said that we need to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at lots of it but learning that doing so will also have some consequences\nTo limit more bang to one point five degrees C we would need to start taking carbon dioxide ... of the atmosphere during the twenty first century\nThe methods for doing this include planting trees\nBioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage\nChanged lawns management as well as some normal approaches that sort of at a at least stages of development however carbon dioxide removal on a large scale could have implications for food security for ecosystems ... diversity\nThat's Jim ski scientist and lead author of the PCC report\nChris Mooney it's the last part I mean we'll talk about ah these negative input as ... as he talks about there but it's this it's when he said that um remove a lot of large scale of carbon dioxide could have implications for food security and things like that what is he talking about\nWhat he's talking about is this is a key part of the the report not only does it say that emissions\nHave to be cut at a extremely rapid pace such as I said before you have to remove the emissions of a major economy annually but on top of that you have to create an entire new industry the polls carbon monoxide out of the air and this doesn't exist now so people have been trying to imagine it\nIn studies and in climate models and one of the ways in which they imagined it\nInvolves planting huge essentially plantations\nOf trees are crops and using those for energy but making sure that you capture the emissions that are released when they're burned and put those in the ground so that you're sucking carbon dioxide out of the air into the plants and then pulling it into the ground and getting energy along the way\nThis is what he referred to as bio energy combined with carbon capture and storage but there's this huge problem which is that you needed an enormous area of land\nTo do this and land has other uses like growing food or the what they're saying is that we might need so much land to pull carbon out of the year that it might compete with the need to feed of the world's growing population\nDruze you know that sounds like a a very sobering zero sum game\nYeah you know I think that taking the risk that we can admit more carbon now and we will make up for it later by pulling it out of the air is akin to you know buying a new house on a credit card and hoping that eventually you'll get a better job and be able to pay for it you know this has enormous scale\nAnd and I think you know where the turning over a large portion of our arable land to grow crops to to burn them\nAnd to use a large portion of our water to grow those crops in our fertilizer has enormous implications for biodiversity inability to feed the planet and so if we cut our missions much more rapidly and we do have scenarios that do this and the report\nWe do not need to rely on this kind of technological carbon remove all you can get away with only planting trees a kind of carbon removal that we already know about and is relatively benign but that requires the most aggressive Kurt cuts in carbon of any of the scenarios we explored\nBut just to be clear I mean as Chris was saying ... with some of that tree planting globally uh be taking place on Arab land that would otherwise be needed for you know to feed the extra two billion people that we expect to be added to the world's population in the next several decades\nThat would generally be restoring abandon lay on marginal lands on how we could if we keep the reliance on these negative admissions at its lowest possible levels which you can only do of course by cutting carbon aggressively right away\nThen we can get away with out really compromising most of our arable land\nOkay I Want to get to um the uh the the emissions cutting scenario aggressive emissions cutting scenario that you're talking about uh that you hinted out there and just a second but we do have a lot of callers who want to join us and obviously this is an ... an issue with that that affects us also let me just get to them a Mars calling from East Lansing Michigan you're on the air\nNow my question sorry my question\nIs when the people that are profiting from the destruction then they're meant big oil parents or whatnot when will they be held accountable like the conversation very scary but I never hear any ... who make the money out of [noise]\nAnd so I mean when you say accountability what are you asking for\nTaxes or something to fund programs or the thing the the action that need to be taken\nSo you like carbon taxes or income taxes and just just trying to get a sense of what you're hoping for\nI'm I'm thinking in that there is something that people make billions on a whale\nOkay Chris Mooney I mean first of all thank you for your call and because many do you have a response from her for her\nWell I don't know I I Would I Would put it a little differently I mean this is climate change is the consequence of industrial civilization is the consequences of all of us are deciding you adopt the technologies that we created\nUm that make our lives better or driving you know heating your home schooling her home and many many other things eating food that comes from a very far away\nAnd we often forget that every one of those things has this site is that was that it takes energy and to get that energy mostly burn fossil fuels so the way that we live\nAnd the scale at which we are using energy is really what's at stake here um so yes there's companies that sell energy at this point a lot of them are are actually fully accepting of the science and trying to find ways to do it differently um so ...\nDo pick up on that thought because I mean I think Chris is exactly right this is an indictment of modern civilization and so if that's the very thing that we're saying needs to be changed rapidly how is that possible well\nThere is an indictment and in some sense of people's choices and people consuming too much red meat and\nYou know people using more energy than they need but I I Believe that this really is also an indictment of some of the fossil fuel companies an automotive companies and those who are have been pushing aggressively and recently succeeding in getting regulations\nAre rolled back and so you take something like release of methane from the natural gas industry and this was a measure that were nearly pay for itself because methane is the main component of natural gas they would capture more of their own product\nAnd they said it would cost them a little bit of money so they got the Trump Administration to push that a regulation back\nIt would almost pay for itself with outs even counting for the environmental cost so what's happening in reality is that we all pickup these costs you know more than a hundred billion a year\nIn disaster relief expenditures everybody's health care premiums go up when people suffer from heat waves and suffer from air pollution and so\nThese companies really are profiting\nBy imposing a hidden tax on every other part of American business and American consumers and I think until we do change that like something you said a carbon tax really reflects the true cost of these activities we're not going to make the shift\nMiddle field Connecticut Larry you're on the air\nI I'm just want to mention that I worked for a company in national company and although we pulled out of the climate agreement her which I disagreed with\nAnd um [noise] the government itself is spending billions of dollars upgrading for energy efficiency

general manager of W. B. U. R. W. B. you our listeners are the best we asked you to protect independent journalism and you did\nYou and nearly eleven thousand of your fellow listeners put your contributions together to raise nearly one point five million dollars for WB you are in our full fundraiser from all of us the w._b. you are thank you for your dedication and you were generous support\n\nTo some point I'm making a chocolate bar ... we're talking about the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change is new report\nAbout what the future will hold if we continue emitting carbon dioxide into the air the rates that we are now and how much of a change civilization all level change humanity is going to have to undergo in order to get a hold\nOn a climate effects or carbons effect on on the climate\nSo I Want to play a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski he is lead author of the IPC the report he was in South Korea yesterday saying that now the government that scientists have sounded the alarm its governments that have to decide what to do about the grim forecast\nThe messages we've told you the scientific fought the evidence the calls it up to the government snow to decide what to do with it [noise]\nOkay so that was Jim ski just yesterday so let's roll back the clock a little bit and go back to December of two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump here's what he said about global warming\nMom is talking about\nAll of this was the global warming and do that in a lot of it's a hoax hawks I mean it's a money making industry okay so\nThat's December of two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump or of course Mr Trump is now president of the United states ... your author or one of the authors on yesterday's report\nA I mean where two and a half years out from when Donald Trump said those things about global warming but in light of what has just been written what do you think\nUh about what the the president's attitude was about global warming\nWell unfortunately well he's liable to say things well outside of what many in his party would say that's a really quite a common view for most of the Republican Party and it didn't used to be this way even a few decades ago both parties supported environmental\nProtection and now it is just become in particular since the passage of the since the Citizens United decision with unlimited campaign finance without anonymous campaign finance\nIt's more and more of the Republican Party at least appears to be beholden to the fossil fuel industries and now they're they're toting things like creating coal jobs even though renewables create more jobs than does coal and even though\nI'm coldest is going away not because of government forces but because of the other fuels just being cheaper because of market forces so there there's really this this narrative from the Republican Party\nThat's wildly inconsistent with both the facts and the majority of of Americans public opinion or even the marketplace\n... Chris Mooney have we heard an official response from the Trump Administration from the state department or a from above a response to the ... report a yes\nWe have statements from the state department and also I'm from ... acting administrator Andrew wheeler\nUm in our story actually um and we'll or you know ... one of our journalist asked him what it would take to keep the world to ... below a dangerous level of climate change and ah he didn't identify specific level but he pointed out um that what you did doing right now would\nHelp um help to lead to continue innovation and clean coal technologies 'em and these technologies will be exported to other\nCountries are still there wheeler was highlighting something that we also heard from the world coal association\nOr they're saying that because this report quarterly targets coal and says we're gonna have to burn a lot less coal maybe phase out entirely in what they're saying is actually no we need to create technologies that captured the emissions of calling buried blow the ground\nUm so that's one of the angles a that is being taken\nOn the report I'm yeah I'm seeing here that a State Department official I'm as you're reporting that said that\nQuote governments do not formally endorsed specific findings presented by the authors\nAre and that and the person went on to say though that from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen us carbon ... related emissions declined by fourteen percent while global energy related carbon emissions rose by Twenty one present during the same time so it's so touting us efforts to to cut emissions there well and it's it's\nHum they haven't gone down as much as would be needed a for the world to be on track for one point five degrees Celsius\nAll right let's take another call here breed is calling from Baltimore, Maryland Bree you're on the air\nHigh magnitude um [noise] I just had um a couple um I I guess more like a question ... comment on I think baking and significant changes manageable for the average person is\nProbably our best\nHope of of actually making change so high and it's like a cute kid playing like the stand\nThat on you know sort of blew up on social media and ah you know people really ran with it unfortunately it's not enough to make a dent on and\nOn the problems that we had in the environment and buy it you know is even eating at you know taking one day a week or we don't send me from one day is that enough to make a change\nYeah well breathe thank you I'm I'm I I didn't mean to cut you off there but thank you for your call because I just want to turn it to ... now a individual level efforts a professor shouldn't do is breeze asking could they make a difference\nThey can and and again I'd like to highlight that there's some really positive news in this report too so we did not for example\nInvestigate the entire world going to vegetarianism that seems just some so wildly improbable that it's not really worth looking at but what we looked at\nWas people in primarily in the west who eat too much red meat according to the world Health Organization healthy dietary guidelines just going back to what's best for them might so it's not like we're asking people to make a huge sacrifice for asking people to do\nWhat they should do anyway for their own body and that's enough to make a big difference livestock has an enormous footprint with the land the deforestation the land to feed\nGrow crops to feed the cattle et cetera and so I think there there are things we can do more active\nTransport bus biking and walking more use of mass transit those are active transport is also good for your health\nYou know but there but there are limits to we cannot all go buy electric cars unless there is charging infrastructure\nAnd currently at least in the state where I live we have a special tax on electric cars rather than the government trying to encourage us to adopt them so I ... that there are ways that we can facilitate people making choices we can buy more efficient air conditioners\nOnly if they're available in the stores and they are not available and less companies are pushed to make these kind of products so it's an interplay between individual choice and the system that that determines the range of options that are available\nLet's go to Kevin who's calling from ... Louisiana Kevin you're on the air\nHello Hi Kevin what's your thought\nIs that how you doing I just had a comment to make 'em you know I work in a in an oil industry\nAnd um there's a lot of infrastructure that's already in place like in the Gulf of Mexico per se as\nTwo thousand platforms out there that has jazz jackets in the water might be a little less than that but at least a thousand where wind farms could be adapted blue jackets easily I mean but they're naturally infrastructure would have to be built you know the power generation would give it to the beach\nBut that that's something that that could be done\nAlso went on when an oil company those exploration on a certain area\nThey have to mitigate somewhere else it doesn't matter they dropped a drop off oil they're not if they kept the queen the whole time\nThey have to spend money to mitigate another area that meets mitigate needs restoration mhm so it's it's a balance you know and they do spend money or in to the good I guess some people go to the good of you know mining industry some people it's bad yeah but we use it we need it you know I just got so much more common\n... Kevin thank you actually so much for your call cause many do you want to respond to that first part of Kevin's indicating that I mean he's out there working in the Gulf Oil fields saying that there is infrastructure in place if we wanted to to expand a wind generation\nWell there's actually a close relationship between offshore oil and offshore wind I mean you you you find a a company like status oil um which is a major oil producer now going a very strong into the uh offshore wind industry and that sort of the deep\nOffshore wind industry which is where you need really really powerful infrastructure in where some of the most powerful when can be harnessed and if you can get it to shore then you can get yourself quite a lot of renewable energy I I think I think it goes to show that there is a corporate transition that's happening right now again the it's not at the pace\nMajor funding for on point is provided by Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and renters insurance through the Geico insurance agency additional information can be found it Geico dot com or one eight hundred nine four seven auto [noise]\nSome WVU are Boston and NPR magnet talk her body and this is on point when you watched\nHold your breath and look away because he has no roe he's one of the world's best refilled all climbers using only his hands and feet no safety gear no margin of error and yet tunneled has done the unimaginable the free so little three thousand foot vertical face of your seventies habitat\nThe free so and that's how it is pretty close\nWhere you get something one hundred percent because her life depends on\nSome point Alex huddled on how he conquered el Capitan\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington encore of a Coleman United Nations ambassador Nikki Haley says she is stepping down NPR's Scott Horsley reports Haley is expected to leave her posted the world body at the end of this year Haley's departure\nTook the international community by surprise that President Trump says Haley told him six months ago but she wanted to take some time off\nTrump praised Haley service at the United nations ... hope she'll return to his administration in some other capacity in the future Hayley the former governor of South Carolina is not a political ambitions beyond that you and\nShe told reporters she won't be mounting a presidential campaign anytime soon and plans to campaign for Trump's re election in twenty twenty Scott Horsley NPR News the White House\nThe national Hurricane Center says hurricane Michael as top sustained winds of one hundred ten miles per hour it's getting stronger as it moves toward Florida's Gulf Coast\nNPR's Windsor Johnston reports the strong category ... storm is expected to make landfall tomorrow along the panhandle of Florida as Big Bend area as a major hurricane\nResidents in the path of the storm are boarding our homes and preparing to evacuate federal emergency management agency spokesperson jets fired says Michael ... life threatening storm surges and all warnings should be taken seriously\nThe main thing that we ask you to do is to be evacuated asked to do show that was the most important role you can play\nTo protect yourself but also to protect the lives of our first responders we ask that you do not for the first responders in harm's way of if they have to come and try to rescue and you've been asked to evacuate\nForecasters say Michael is expected to make landfall on Wednesday states of emergency had been declared and thirty five Florida counties Windsor Johnston NPR News\nIndependent researchers say they've identified another Russian spy accused of trying to poison former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in England Matthew bother reports from Moscow it's another highly publicized issue for Russia's military intelligence service\nInternet's the bell in cat have identified the second suspect in the St Paul investigation as Russian military intelligence officer Alexander Michigan\nBut the Kremlin told reporters in Moscow today that it will no longer engage with journalists on these mounting allegations two weeks ago battling cut identified the first suspect is decorated military intelligence officer and the College of ...\nRussia initially explained that the two men were simply sports nutrition salesman on holiday in the u._k. the criminals and facing mounting wave of allegations that its military intelligence service is conducting all kinds of operations across the west for NPR News I'm Matthew butter in Moscow\nOn Wall street the Dow Jones industrial average down sixty three points at twenty six thousand four hundred and twenty six ... thirty at Seventy seven sixty six [noise] this is NPR\nThis is Ninety point nine W.

undertaking I mean a ... something that I've been thinking about since two thousand nine and then I finally did in a last year so that's eight years of sort of dreaming about you know this big potential harm but it just took a long time to get there\nOkay so so tell me why though I mean for people who don't know A L cap or sort of what it means to climbers what what is it about this

the one of the world's most famous a rock climbing walls and he did it with no roads that effort is captured in the documentary free so low which was directed by Elizabeth chai fire Sally and Jimmy chain and Alex ...\nIs with us this hour to talk about how he free so loaded el cap a Alex tell us a little bit more about about this particular thing that you do the notes that you take and how you mentally prepare for declined do you really memorize almost every move that you're going to make\nWell I mean you can hear in those notes that that is not every single move 'em I mean I have to memorize every single move for the hardest sections like what we were just talking about with the Boulder problem I knew every single hand and foot placement of exactly how I Move my body\nBut then you know from my note for pitch one was very rough just like step left or to keep place you know the rest of the pitch I could just count on myself to to climate appropriately without having to memorize everything movement but then I also climbed the whole whole face so many times that I kind of just remembered most of it\nUm you know but I didn't have to specifically memorize every single move right is a lot of them\nOkay but so this is part of what did the documentary really sort of underscores that you have this thing that you call them in a sense when you first of all you you were very deeply prepare but you also have this thing that you called mental are or what is\nThat why I actually um I actually don't call them into learners and in the film Tommy says that a few times and he's actually sort of quoting something I'm like I've had some other climbing films from for many years ago where I talked about mental armor\nBut um but actually a big part of the process for me to be able to free solo cap was to sort of get past that I think that you like the idea of mental farmers to to sort of you know shield yourself from like it's it's something that's too scary you sort of get psyched up and like\nShield your mind from it and then do it despite the fact that it's quite scary and I felt like I wasn't really a sustainable way to climb oh crap like it was just too big of a wall and it's too difficult and I was basically worried that\nThat at some point you know it's sort of come to my senses and things like oh wow this is really scary like what am I doing up here so I kind of felt like I had to prepare to the point where I didn't need any kind of armor where I just felt comfortable walking up to the wall and being like I Need the wall is the wall and I'm In I'm capable of climate is you know not having to get all psyched up or anything\nBut how do you get to that point though I mean that there's got to be a lot of focus and worked at it takes to get to that point\nWell yeah I mean that's that's that's basically the the film at two years of training physically and mentally and practicing and and just refining techniques and eventually you know I mean it took a long time to feel comfortable yeah and and that doesn't even include the six years before that I'd been dreaming about it and thinking about it and climbing tons of other routes that were similar but slightly different\nYou know take a step back here for a second because I could talk to you for the whole hour about the technical have preparation and I'm feet of climbing el ... but ...\nFree solo rowing is also to be realistic I mean people do die of the world's best free so many of them have died and then that is soon or in this documentary ... you're going to hear a climate Tommy Caldwell in this clip a plus news report describing\nSome of the death of the world's best free solar climbers\nI think everybody who is made for ... a big part of their life that now [noise]\nJohn back or with a tiny arrest feel free solar climbing she found this past week at the age of fifty two\nWe're sorry to report on the death of us climate showing Larry [noise]\nShow them was killed in Utah was found a couple of days ago there were seeing was climbing a new somebody valley his body was found Saturday morning mercy climate as usual\nAlone without ... most people that are pushing the limits of course they have this mentality of screwing whatever happens happens [noise]\nDown there from the documentary free so low I mean not just all begs the question Alex how did you get into this what is it about climbing was no ropes that has really that really drew you in\nA yeah well yeah good good question um I mean basically you know I mean not all free sowing as extreme you know it's not all the face of all kept sometimes free cell and can mean scrambling a beautiful ridge and the mountains you know I mean sometimes it feels more like an extension of hiking and so\nThere is definitely a place for for rope climbing in the mountains it's sort of a more efficient and faster way to climb\nAnd so when I was younger and I was growing up climbing in the Sierra\nUm I mean you could I was I was sort of an anti social youngster so combined the fact that I didn't really know many climbers didn't have many partners and then combined with just the the the feeling that freedom to speed or the fish in the I mean there there are certain joy in in hunting by herself\nAnd so I just sort of you know got into it to be clear free sewing and stone a small fraction of of my normal climbing you know you don't want to climb all styles all you know every sort of climbing with ropes with partners on expeditions various\nVarious types of climbing and free zone has always sort of represented this this extra little side [laughter]\nThe part of your career that draws the most attention because it just defies most people's a tolerance for risk right I mean you do\nIn our yard or totally understand that and I mean it certainly always been a very inspiring part of climate to me as well even though it's only a small part of what I Do okay for has been sort of the most significant in order was\nTalked to me about that I mean what is it how is what what is it that you're feeling when you're on those big faces with no roads are I mean is it is it is known that you just cannot enter or experience in any other way\nWell I I don't know I mean I'm sure that humans can experience that feeling and many other ways I think that for me it's sort of the easiest way to tap into the feeling of of doing something challenging but doing very well you know the feeling of flow whatever you want to call it but\nBut um you know feeling like you're you're close to tap into your potential or whatever yeah um\nWell here here's laugh okay because I mean a long time ago when I was in college I did a little climbing to I mean just sport climbing no more than a hundred feet up but you know I'm On in in some beautiful places in the western United States and it was really I mean it was thrilling there's something about [noise]\nYou know every climb that I did that I got a little better at and this is like super amateur stuff I'm not saying it's anywhere near a even a million miles of what you do Alex but but even my likes low level climbing every every new pitch that I was able to do there was something about um mastering mind and body\nViewing of constant improvement yeah constantly challenging yourself a little bit I mean that's exactly what what I enjoy about free zone is seeking out for the bigger challenge is things that are slightly hurting on what you've done before so you feel like you're constantly learning or growing you know so that you feel like you're always a little bit butter or what you do\nBut of course with re sowing though the cost of the mistake or absolute so you know you're you're going to push yourself to what is an inevitable perhaps I Hope not but never to blend\nWell I mean we were all facing the number one and I mean we're all gonna die\nUm I'm trying my best not to dark climbing are very much want to move to old age and her family and all that but um no I mean I I I don't think that if I just keep pushing middle for sure dark climbing you know some time ago\nWell let me just reiterate nobody wants to [laughter] but um\nLet me get some calls in here because we got a lot of people who have questions for you Alex uh we're speaking with Alex ... he is a professional rock climber a best known\nFor free so loving and in fact he did a free so low Yosemite is el Capitan it's a three thousand foot wall in Yosemite one of the most famous rock climbing walls anywhere in the world he did it without ropes and that story is captured in the documentary free so low which is directed by Elizabeth ... and Jimmy ... so\nLet's go to Kay who's calling from Virginia Ohio okay you're on the air\nHi mega ... and you do that several of the questions I was going to ask Alex about what drives him and that that that edge of a risk and you know that\nThat drive to conquer but I go back and forth older Colorado to Ohio and have so for the last forty five years so there's huge rock climbing community there and about four years ago go at the Boulder film festival they showed about four different\nDocumentaries on climbing and so I was around that climbing community there and they did show a documentary on Yosemite and Alex it was so fascinating that\nAnd college vine where consultants work with high school

scene that you ... W believe are in the Boston Globe investigate the\nLargest art heist in history\nI'm Kelly joined me and my colleague tonight at that at hopefully in Boston for a live taping us out we'll do behind the scenes for the latest in search for Thirteen missing masterpieces each a double wide or less the conflict in part by Eighteen\n\nDoes his own point I'm making a truck or body we're talking this hour with Alex huddled he is a rock climbing superstar and he is the first person in the world to free so low that means without robes Yosemite is three thousand foot wall el ... and that feed is documented in a new movie free so low which is directed by Elizabeth ... and\nJimmy ... and I'm going to get to some college here in a second but Alex we just heard a professor Jane Joseph there who did that an MRI skin of your brain sort of talking about some of the unique things that she saw a in her analysis they're wondering now that you know that about\nUm you know the the shape and response of your ... has that changed at all sort of how you see a you're climbing or what you might be capable of doing\nNot particular I'm ... I mean in general I was a strong sense of I mean you know I Am who I Am you know in some ways no matter how much you look look inside I mean I'm Still the same person you know I find it all kind of interesting but um I mean we had a much longer discussion when he refers to scare yeah and um\nKnow practice the that over time you can do some of the things and that's that's very much been my experience that um that you can learn over time it was nice to hear from I heard that she was at a one of the pioneers for fear free so it would have been good to see her that I've been I've been wondering ... out with her more actually\nOkay well we can put it we can definitely get you guys back in touch you know I was really excited to have to because I think a again as she said and you just said there's this and you are living proof about the effectiveness of very focused concentration and training and perseverance as well about what can be accomplished but\nThat's that's how I see it but it's interesting because a lot of I feel like people take what they want out of the film you know a lot of people have been seen this and uh and they just see it as like oh well your brain's effective so obviously this is easy for you or you know I mean people sort of take whatever they they hear from it\nI mean I've always heard it as as you know with practice you can prepare for for many things\nUm but you know it's I suppose it's a little bit open ended\nYeah but one of the things that the movie does explores how the people around you deal with the stress of of what you're trying to accomplish so let's get a call uh who wants to a collie wants to talk to you about exactly that's what's going to guess who's calling from Deerfield New Hampshire guarantee you're on the air\nIraq's um you know it's one thing to watch you in preparing to go through the regular on the wall where you are in there for every movement but\nThere's also the aspect of family and loved ones and I was just wondering how do you prepare them and how do you measure we prepare um before going out of one of these big feet like al cap and do a photo of loved ones or anything like that ever come into your mind while you're you know and the Mets so nervous multi thousand for them\nYeah I mean that does not is probably the biggest challenge in um I'm not sure if you've seen the film yet or not but um but I mean a big part of the film was chronically my relationship with my girlfriend saw it and how we sort of navigate it that because in order words ... is easier if you're if you're single or relatively unattached\nUm but you know Saudis or sort of argue that ah that I could I could have both you know I could have a a good relationship and still climbing a high level or just needed to to balance it properly and I mean that's I mean that's that's the big challenge but um but I think we never get it All right I mean she kind of\nGave me the space I needed to climb at the right times but in general you know we had a totally normal normal you know healthy relationship\nWell let me ask you was asking though in the middle of a big time I mean well let's talk about your al ... ascent yes either on August ... did you think of her or is would you bring that I mean how how focused\nOn the on the harder sections which represents maybe half the route um I wasn't thinking about anything I was just sort of physically executing moves and just performing\nBut then on the easier train 'em I was able to think about other things and think about friends and partners uh\nI mean I remember specifically on on a free souls or cap I spent you know maybe five hundred foot section in the middle of this kind of easy or thinking about some of the partners I've been up there earlier in the year with just a couple of other professional climbers and friends of mine and and you know feeling really grateful for the people who sort of helped me on my on my journey than than\nYou I mean certainly I was thinking about Saudi as soon as I talked out about my girlfriend uh [laughter] you know when I finished\nYeah well I mean ... as you write in a free so does the movie does explore um your relationship with signing McCandless your girlfriend and I want to play a little clip from it because here in this exchange a sunny is asking you\nHow are you factor her into your decisions about free solar climbing\nI Want to like I Want to my knowledge to compression you having more on the guy like minds on you\nKnow what we want ... here in a tent hanging people die but I feel like I Want in half way\nWhen you sound like you take me into that [noise] and\nRussia than going to be on with cutting in and actually ... change when you actually make decisions I mean [noise]\nI have some kind of obligation to maximize my lifespan than like you obviously I'd have to give up so I got on\nWest ... do you see that as an obligation\n[noise]\nBut I appreciate your your concerns I have you know I respect that but but I Know what if you are but you know\nIs that true Alex you still not feel obligated to maximize your life span\nIt's kinda hard for me to listen to some of those positions are like oh I mean I have that does struggled through the whole film there there's some restrictions on our whole cringe that's that's pretty that's that was ... you know I should have been kinder um but I mean I think that that a big part of what I was getting out there is that\nYou know whether I'm thinking about her or my family or anybody else um I you know I don't want to die climbing like I'm already doing my best to not fall off the wall\nAnd so you know if I'm if I'm thinking about others not I'm Still sort of going through the same motion I'm Still doing the same things to to make sure that I'm prepared yeah but\nFor about a year at that point and I've been dreaming about recently have for maybe the seven proceeding years and so I felt like the ratio was was was different you know I mean now we've been in a great relationship for three years and I've you know finish this big climb and so you know moving forward you know I'm sure the the calculations would be different\nOh okay so there are potentially the tent and I'm sure you're potentially\nNo well I'm I'm sure it would be different and yeah sure it would be different or I don't know which way\nTo go to another caller Michael's calling from Kiev, Ukraine Michael you're on the air\nYeah greetings or how you doing a ... all currently Alex you have the uh the mutants climber brain graduations I'm I'm a\nI'm a climber I've I did a various things from the early seventies and\nClimbed my greatest accomplishment was a devil's tower Wyoming um which you know but the easiest thing on it is the hardest thing I can do [laughter] um so you know you you are Superman and totally insane\nBut when I was there a there was just this kid who was tree sewing it\nAnd you know I did I did some of that in the beginning and and it's actually easier in a lot of ways because it's so much faster and and you don't have to stop importing protection which is really hard and really dangerous I really have been done too much leading and uh\nYou know and I I was I was ... I you know the TV reporter I'd gotten documentaries and ah I really want to do the documentary on this guy because I saw it on I was taught goes I just didn't think he'd be around and firefighters and but what he did was he actually\nHeld off the top of this thing that's twelve hundred feet a vertical crystal on a vertical columns\nReally really difficult thing in close encounters of the third kind and repelled off the top\nFoot by foot and a quarter of a mile including the whole room with metal toothbrushes and broke off boulders that were exploding like like ... you know blow\nOh and then and then it says that they need that event later free climbed\nYeah ... ... S C I F\nWondering if you ever had done something that you know incredibly intensive and ah you know I Know you can't you know it's a it's a very smooth and closing that hundreds of thousands of people do yeah um\nYeah but no I I I very much went through that exact same process I mean uh\nYou know the the film free so is is very much about the two years of the center of pulling the wall cleaning memorizing holds um you know\nI don't know if it's actually in the film but I definitely did spend some time removing some loose rocks from from one key section of a crack and\nUm and then I can just throw 'em down and let them it's just I was there too many people and he's already but so I put them in a backpack and repelled back down at them um but yeah definitely spent a lot of time you know physically preparing the ... because it just yeah I mean you have to there are scenes\nUniversity You're listening to Ninety point nine W.

of what the scientists in a in this IPC the report are saying are they saying that one and a half degrees is not a reasonable goal anymore\nWell they very carefully do not take a stand on that question but they do\nClearly showed that it will be extremely difficult in order to do it essentially you have to do something that humanity hasn't done before which is radically change a major systems how we get energy how we get food how we get around transportation\nHow we build our cities so they once they've described the magnitude of what's required it's reasonable to ask whether it can be done\nOkay so the Paris climate agreement that uh of holding warming to a one and a half degrees or above ... over pre industrial levels was considered to be pretty ambitious to begin with\nSo I mean what are scientists saying that we would need will ... for ... you are scientists saying that current practices and current plans to meet that goal or not enough\nUh unequivocal either saying that so they're saying that current promises made by countries ah which they made as part of the Paris Agreement process\nWill give us three degrees Celsius so over five degrees Fahrenheit of warming

about the consequences of global climate change it's a very dire new reports and it's based on more than six thousand sided studies written by Ninety One authors for forty different countries\nAnd saying that if we continue on the path that we are now globally\nWould change human civilization permanently I'm joined today by Chris Mooney covers climate change energy and the environment for the Washington Post ... del also joined us he's professor of climate sciences at Duke University and was one of the authors on yesterday's report by the inter governmental panel on climate change\nAnd we want to hear from you where it eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred for two three talk a and Chris injured I just want to play us a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski scientist and lead author of the IPC the report\nAnd he said that we need to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and lots of edge\nBut learning that doing so will also have some consequences\nTo limit more than ... to one point five degrees C we would need to start taking carbon dioxide ... of the atmosphere during the twenty first century\nThe methods for doing this include planting trees\nBioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage\nChanged lawns management as well as some normal approaches that sort of at a at least stages of development however carbon dioxide removal on a large scale could have implications for food security for ecosystems for bio diversity\nThat's Jim ski scientist and lead author of the PCC report\nChris Mooney it's the last part I mean we'll talk about ah these negative input as as you talked about there but it's just it's when he said that um remove a lot of large scale of carbon dioxide could have implications for food security and things like that what is he talking about what\nHe's talking about is this is a key part of the the report not only does it say that admissions\nHas to be cut at a extremely rapid pace such as I said before you have to remove the emissions of a major economy annually but on top of that you have to create an entire new industry the polls carbon monoxide out of the air and this doesn't exist now so people have been trying to imagine it\nIn studies and in climate models and one of the ways in which they imagined it\nA involves planting huge essentially plantations\nOf trees are crops in using those for energy but making sure that you capture the emissions that are released when they're burned and put those in the ground so that you're sucking carbon dioxide out of the air into the plants and then pulling it into the ground and getting energy along the way\nThis is what he referred to as bio energy combined with carbon capture and storage but there's this huge problem which is that you needed an enormous area of land\nTo do this and land has other uses like growing food\nSo what they're saying is that we might need so much land to pull carbon out of the year that it might compete with the need to feed of the world's growing population\nDruze should know that sounds like a a very sobering zero sum game\nYeah you know I I think that taking the risk that we can admit more carbon now and we will make up for it later by pulling it out of the air\nIs akin to you know buying a new house on a credit card and hoping that eventually you'll get a better job and be able to pay for it you know this is an enormous gamble with the future of our whole planet\nAnd and I think you know where the turning over a large portion of our arable land\nTo grow crops to to burn them\nAnd to use a large portion of our water to grow those crops in our fertilizer has enormous implications for biodiversity inability to feed the planet and so if we cut our missions much more rapidly and we do have scenarios that do this and the report\nWe do not need to rely on this kind of technological carbon remove all you can get away with only planting trees a kind of carbon removal that we already know about and is relatively benign but that requires the most aggressive Kurt cuts in carbon of any of the scenarios we explored\nBut just to be clear I mean as Chris was saying well with some of that tree planting globally uh be taking place on arable land that would otherwise be needed for you know to feed the extra two billion people that we expect to be added to the world's population in the next several decades\nThat would generally be restoring abandoned land marginal lands and so we could if we keep the reliance on these negative admissions at its lowest possible levels which you can only do of course by cutting carbon aggressively right away\nThen we can get away with out really compromising most of our arable land\nOkay I Want to get to um the uh the the emissions cutting scenario aggressive emissions cutting scenario that you're talking about or that you hinted at there and just a second but we do have a lot of callers who want to join us and obviously this is an an issue that affects us also let me just get to them a Mars calling from East Lansing Michigan you're on the air\nNow my question sorry my question\nIs when the people that are profiting from the destruction of than my arm in ...\nLike the conversation very scary but I never hear anyone who make the money on 'em [noise]\nAnd so I mean when you say accountability what are you asking for\nTaxes or something to find programs or the thing the the actions taken\nSo you like carbon taxes or income taxes and just just trying to get a sense of what you're hoping for\nI'm I'm thinking that there is something that people make billions on oil\nOkay Chris Mooney I mean first of all thank you for your call in because many do you have a response from her for her\nWell [noise] I don't know I I Would I Would put it a little differently I mean this is climate change is the consequence of industrial civilization is the consequence of all of us are deciding you adopt the technologies that we created\nUm that make our lives better a driving you know heating your home cooling your home and many many other things eating food that comes from a very far away\nAnd we often forget that every one of those things has this side effect which is that it takes energy and to get that energy is mostly burn fossil fuels to the way that we live\nAnd the scale at which we are using energy is really a what's at stake here um so yes there's companies that sell energy at this point a lot of them are are actually fully accepting of the science and trying to find ways to do it differently um so\n... do pick up on that thought because I mean I think ... percent exactly right this is an indictment of modern civilization and so if that's the very thing that we're saying needs to be changed rapidly how is that possible\nWell ... there is an indictment and in some sense of people's choices and people consuming too much red meat and\nYou know people using more energy than they need but I I Believe that this really is also an indictment of some of the fossil fuel companies an automotive companies and those who are have been pushing aggressively and recently succeeding in getting regulations\nAre rolled back and so you take something like release of methane from the natural gas industry and this was a measure that would nearly pay for itself because methane is the main component of natural gas they would capture more of their own product\nAnd they said it would cost them a little bit of money so they got the Trump Administration to push that a regulation back\nIt would almost pay for itself with ouch even counting for the environmental costs so what's happening in reality is that we all pickup these costs you know more than a hundred billion a year\nIn disaster relief expenditures ... everybody's health care premiums go up when people suffer from heat waves and suffer from air pollution and so\nThese companies really are profiting\nBy imposing a hidden tax on every other part of American business and American consumers and I think until we do change that like something you said a carbon tax really reflects the true cost of these activities we're not going to make the ships that are necessary\nLet's go to Larry who's calling from middle field Connecticut Larry you're on the air\nI I'm just wanted to mention that I worked for a company in national company and although we

in South Korea yesterday saying that now the government that scientists have sounded the alarm its governments that have to decide what to do about the grim forecast\nThe messages we've told you the scientific fact the evidence the calls it up to the government snow to decide what to do with it [noise]\nOkay so that was Jim ski just yesterday so let's roll back the clock a little bit and go back to December two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump here's what are you\nAll of this was the global warming and do that a lot of it's a hoax hawks I mean it's a money making industry okay there's hope\nThat's December of two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump or of course Mr Trump is now president of the United states ... your author or one of the authors on yesterday's reports\nUh I mean where two and a half years out from when Donald Trump said those things about global warming but in light of what has just been written what do you think\nUh about what the the president's attitude was about global warming\nWell unfortunately while he's liable to say things well outside of what many in his party would say that's a really quite a common view for most of the Republican Party and it didn't used to be this way even a few decades ago both\nParties supported environmental\nProtection and now it is just become in particular since the passage of the since the Citizens United decision with unlimited campaign finance without anonymous campaign finance\nIt's more and more of the Republican Party at least appears to be beholden to the fossil fuel industries and now they're they're holding things like creating coal jobs even though renewables create more jobs than does coal and even though\nI'm cold is is going away not because of government forces but because of the other fuels just being cheaper because of market forces so there there's really this this narrative from the Republican Party\nThat's wildly inconsistent with both the facts and the majority of Americans public opinion or even the marketplace ...\nChris Mooney have we heard an official response from the Trump Administration from the state department or a from above a response to the ... report\nA yes we have statements from the state department and also I'm from ... acting administrator Andrew wheeler\nUm in our story actually I'm an wheeler you know ... one of our journalist asked him what it would take to keep the world the below a dangerous level of climate change and ah he didn't identify specific level but he pointed out um that what you'd be doing right now would\nHelp um help to lead to continue innovation and clean coal technologies 'em and these technologies will be exported to other countries\nAre so they're wheeler was highlighting something that we also heard from the world coal association\nOr they're saying that you did this report clearly targets colon says we're gonna have to burn a lot less coal maybe phase out entirely in what they're saying is actually no we need to create technologies that captured the emissions of coal and buried blow the ground [noise]\nUm so that's one of the angles a that is being taken on the report\nI'm yeah I'm seeing here that a State Department official as you're reporting that said that quote governments do not formally indoors specific findings presented by the authors\nAre and that and the person went on to say though that from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen us carbon ... related emissions declined by fourteen percent while global energy related carbon emissions rose by Twenty one percent during the same time so it's so touting us efforts to to cut emissions there well\nAnd it's it's not incorrect us Americans have gone down um they haven't gone down as much as would be needed a for the world to be on track for one point five degrees Celsius\nAll right let's take another call here breed is calling from Baltimore, Maryland Bree you're on the air\nHigh magnitude um [noise] I just had um a couple um I I guess more like a question fires comment on I think making a significant changes manageable for the average person is\nProbably our best hope of of actually making change so high and it's like a cute kid in like the stand that um you know sort of blew up on social media and ah you know people really ran with it unfortunately it's not enough to make a dent on and\nOn the problems that we have and the environment or but it you know it's even eating at you know taking one day a week or we don't need him one day is that enough to make a change yeah\nWell ... thank you I mean I didn't mean to cut you off there but thank you for your call because I just want to turn it to drew Chanel are individual level efforts a professor shouldn't do is breeze asking could they make a difference\nThey can and and again I'd like to highlight that there's some really positive news in this report too so we did not for example\nInvestigate the entire world going to vegetarianism that seems just so wildly improbable that it's not really worth looking at what we looked at was people in primarily in the west\nWho eat too much red meat according to the world Health Organization healthy dietary guidelines just going back to what's best for them right so it's not like we're asking people to make a huge soccer\nShould do any way for their own body and that's enough to make a big difference livestock has an enormous footprint with the land that deforestation the land to feed\nGrow crops to feed the cattle et cetera and so I think there there are things we can do more active\nTransport bus biking and walking more use of mass transit those are active transport it's also good for your health\nYou know but there but there are limits to we cannot all go buy electric cars unless there is charging infrastructure\nAnd currently at least in the state where I live we have a special tax on electric cars rather than the government trying to encourage us to adopt them so I ... that there are ways that we can facilitate people making choices we can buy more efficient air conditioners\nOnly if they're available in the stores and they are not available and less companies are pushed to make these kind of products so it's an interplay between individual choice and the system that that determines the range of options that are available\nLet's go to Kevin
