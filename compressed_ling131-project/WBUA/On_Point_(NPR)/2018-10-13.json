Abrams excuse me appeared on MSNBC yesterday discuss the tens of thousands of voter registration applications currently on hold it in the state of Georgia she's accused her of Conan blind camp of repressing citizens right to vote\nThat challenge is this process called exact match and we've been fighting on that sets twenty fourteen what happens is you have a hyphen in your last name if he'd have a difficult spelling anyone misspelled or lose leaves out anything they can use that as a pet basically as a reason\nTo not process your registration\nAnd that means that if that fifty three thousand Jordan's currently have their registration intending status\nTechnically they can cast provisional ballots the provisional ballots are often not processed and so we are deeply worried at fifty three thousand people Seventy percent of whom were African American will be disenfranchised in this election\n[noise] a deal hotel me uh what would Brian Kemp say if he were here and uh how do you assess that argument it's pretty difficult for me to challenge now I'd\nLike to hear at the channel someone like um brand Kaplan I guess when he would say is we need to make sure that the people who are registering are actually the people who they claimed to be and therefore we need to impose strict standards on whether or not we process an application but I think what's really critical here is that\nA minor typo like I'm missing hyphen or the transportation of two letters when a someone's entering a voter registration form into a database that shouldn't be a basis for disenfranchising people\nAnd one thing to underscore I think there's um the fact that people who are on this list I don't want there to be any confusion all of those people can still vote in November they might not show up on regular voter registration rolls but they all still have the right to show up at the polls and cast a provisional ballot that's not a perfect solution\nBecause provisional ballots are counted under different rules um than regular ballots but no one should be deterred from voting because they're scared that they might have been purged\nI'd like to take a call now from awake cross Georgia a John go ahead you're on the air\nYes I was calling about the uh the um now when you file your tax returns in most states you have to put in your driver's license information in it gets your tax return process\nIncluding earned income credit and other credit that the people that you are saying oh being disenfranchised um\nHave that because they want to get those refunds so\nI don't see how people are being disenfranchised by using and not be when you\nThink you so much John we'd also like to take a call from Appleton, Wisconsin I Believe it's Mark Mark you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call just certain what bothers me is rarely discussed is the fact that every one of these voter ID laws is always\nTied to furious restrictions to access to the polls either reducing the polling places fully time um when they're clerks offices are open to file absentee ballots which was the case here in Wisconsin so it's not just about ... it seems to me that undermines his argument it's about voter fraud\nIt's about reducing people's rights to vote\nOkay well thank you so much for that mark joining me now from Tuscaloosa, Alabama someone who may help address some of these questions are from a different perspective I John Merrill is the secretary of state for the state of Alabama since taking office in twenty Fifteen more than one million new voters\nHad been registered in that state the Alabama process requires voters as I understand it to show a photo ID when voting John Merrill welcomed on point\nDavid great to be with you thanks for having me as your guest\nYes sir tell me just from the ... what's your approach to ah to to having voters on the rolls\nDavid we each and every eligible US citizen this resident of Alabama\nTo be registered to vote and have a photo ID and we have gone to extra links to make sure that people are accommodate whenever that occurs and we did our six seven counties at least one time every year\nWith our mobile units as well as having our border registrars office opened each and every day that the court houses open\nAnd we visit festivals events and activities\nIn our counties throughout the state at different times to make sure that we're giving people ample opportunity to register and to obtain IDs if they don't have one now I Will also tell you that in the rare instances where people say hey I Can't get to the board registrars office\nBecause of my work schedule or I Can't get to one of the mobile unit locations\nBecause it's not convenient or I don't go to the events are festivals in those rare occasions where that has happened David we're going to people's homes and we have given them photo lab they in their homes and we're very excited about what we've achieved during the last\nThree years and then much and twenty three days that I've had the privilege to be Alabama sectors state\nWe've registered one million Ninety five thousand eight hundred and sixty one new voters and we now have three million four hundred and thirty four thousand eight hundred and sixty three registered voters in Alabama those numbers are unprecedented and unfair loud and the history of the state\nWhat's the need for the for the voter id\nWell the reason that I voted for David Was because I Want to make it easy to vote and hard to ... if you needed that day when you open a bank account\nIf you needed that day when you go to the movie if you need an ad the when you buy six pack of beer or if you buy a pack of cigarettes then you ought to be able to present and not be when you exercise the most precious rats that we have\nEnough to participate in our Democrat Republican vote\nAnd want to take a briefly a general I Want to take a call from a nearby states from Louisiana New Orleans I have Sharon on the line ... ... a share your thoughts on that\nAll right thank you for taking my call Manhattan in Louisiana you've had to show and I have an id which are voter registration um for ... years we've been here which is over twenty\nHowever the the ID now it's changed you have to have a real id to vote and the ... id is requires you to a show a birth certificate Social Security card and to um ... and said to document\nOn but they don't tell you you need that you know find out about the real ID\nUntil you go and get your driver's license renewed it so if you're not in the schedule to get your driver's license renewed but for the next time your vote then you realize you need a real ID and ah you won't be able to do\nSo I think Sharon Sharon thank you so much for that I appreciate that John Merrill your secular state in Alabama ... some of the specifics ... maybe a little different than Louisiana nonetheless number to David in his you serve it\nTo remember that they vary from state to state I mean we have\nTen different elements that can be a change to use when you go to vote including your driver's license or a non driver id or the free Alabama voter id that we give\nAny other valid state issue that the federal id ah student ID A passport or military idea travel Addy\nOr we just want to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat period that's it and we bought David look we broken every record the history of the state for voter registration and voter participation in our elections and ... were double excited about that because not a single time has anyone been denied access to the polls\nBecause they didn't have the proper credentials when they went to vote not one time\nLet me ask you one question that some folks who analyze a what efforts in your state and other states particularly in South but not only just south of said uh they say things one of which they say that some of these rules ... even if framed very mutually disproportionally affect voters of color citizens of color\nOr how do you respond to that ... those repercussions are those cravings\nThat they're entitled to their own opinion but to not entitled to their own facts uh-huh so what are the facts I've just share them with you about voter registration in photo lab the delivery of shared them with you about voter participation we're we had one point two million Alabamians go to the polls\nWe like College of education and human development online master's programs and higher administration and curriculum and teacher [noise] BU dot edu slash we lost [noise]\nDecades before ... ... in the midst of the AIDS epidemic nasty ran an ad\nCampaign featuring a man named Rick movie I said why are they going to somebody like me then I answered the question because there's really not a whole lot of people who are HIV positive and who are marathon runners this week on only against socially conscious of advertising for shoes joined us\nTomorrow at seven AM and seven pm here on WB you are Boston's NPR News station this is on point\nOn David Folkenflik we're talking about the right to vote and about who actually gets to exercise that right just weeks before the twenty Eighteen mid term elections you can join the conversation\nHow would you make it easier for people to cast legitimate votes can we ensure the integrity of the vote at the same time we're one hundred forty three eight to five five hundred forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter find us on Facebook on point radio my guest this hour\nIn Center for justice NYU deal who abused seal you and from Tuscaloosa, Alabama where a gratified to have the secretary of state for the state of Alabama John Merrill's I Want to quickly take a couple of calls with some uh a different perspectives we've got a call from Baltimore, Maryland at go ahead\n... thanks for taking my call you I just wanted to say that you know I I wrote the first one I was Eighteen years old I'm sixty years old\nNever missed a vote even when I was up there in the military at first I was out of town travelling I think it's a question of taking the extra effort to make sure that my right to vote is counted\nThank you so much for the call and I can verify that accent is truly from Baltimore or we've also got a call from Alex or from Charleston South Carolina go right ahead\nWhich are happening I'm all up and that previous caller's comment on my ... is the number and I find that it has become very difficult for a service members to register especially last minute on some of the younger servicemen numbers are frustrated because they don't have\n'em they no longer have their own state id they move to different stations and receive driver's license\nIn other states and in their home they do not accept military I eat when registering\nMountain I didn't ... thirty days to receive a ballot and now that I think we are getting their ritual scary numbers and not allowing military each ... restrictions and all fifty eight and for creating such a huge gap in allowing him and next\nAlex thank you so much for sharing that perspective I really appreciate at one thing you haven't heard us talk a lot about today's voter fraud in part because there's so little evidence that really happens I think that there was one survey done something like eight hundred million\nVotes cast over a fourteen year period and there were maybe scores of of of of allegations that seem credible maybe a hundred or two hundred\nBut the but the that concern wall talked about a lot particularly twenty sixteen raised by the president and a lot of his supporters\nThere really isn't a lot of evidence to support that nonetheless it's as we've all a test and there is a desire to ensure that people legitimately have the right to vote in these things when ... when he wiser you actually had some questions for secretary of State John Merrill he ... state of of Alabama's been good enough to join us this hour as well so\nI I wanted to build up with the last caller talked about the difficulty of at least many Americans to register to vote and um the secretary marrow was very rights to point out that what we need to do is ensure that each and every eligible citizen in the country has registered to vote I'm I'm\nGlad to hear that um he he thinks that Alabama has very high voter registration rates and I know that there have been disputes about those numbers but we can all agree\nThat it should be a goal to get every I'm eligible voter on the voter rolls and with that there's been a real advances across the country and and how to do that better how to sort of ... a modernized the system so it's not just relying on\nAds in papers and visits to libraries and driver's license offices but we're seeing in many states we're moving towards a more automatic voter registration\nSystem I'm Thirteen states and D.C have already adopted that in the last three years alone and there's been really bipartisan support in momentum and that really works to expand voter registration and to do so in a much more accurate and seamless way and I wanted to hear a little bit from secretary marrow\nAbout um whether he is I'm interested in taking steps to advance that in the state of\nAlabama like in some of his neighboring states like Georgia\nWill know windy or like you know without me said it but I Will see any way\nThat we have the nation in the last three years nine minutes and twenty three days\nIn voter registration per capita nobody has been more than we've done\nNobody's been better than we did we don't just waited football when I get something to do about it needs to know I also think it's important to note when it comes to automatic voter registration what you're what you're talking about there's different definition for what automatic voter registration means to certain people\nNow one of the questions that outrage whenever somebody introduces concept to me is it do you believe that if you have automatic registration in your state but there should be an opt out provision\nIn opt out provision would mean that somebody says no I don't want to be registered and they should be given the opportunity to keep from being registered when they engage in that activity would be getting in your driver's license getting social services or whatever it happens to be\nYou know if they agree that there should be an opt out provision in what I immediately tell them that's what we have the day you just have to opt in which is why we've had Ninety three percent of the people in Alabama that are now registered to vote and I'm very excited about this\nOh sure I think anyone who's\nOpt in versus a system where you have to opt out knows that those two kinds of systems are quite different and that the yield very very different levels of participation in the abstract you might think that those things aren't very different but the empirical data shows otherwise most states have some kind of off in system through the DMV right now\nOther states have an opt out system Oregon was the first state to adopt that in Oregon saw its registration rates sky rocket so I think I'm Glad that the secretary says that he's committed to trying to make sure that every eligible person in Alabama is registered to vote and the easiest way to do that used to create an opt out says\nSo we're getting callers are suggesting their own thoughts on this let's first go to Abington Virginia Perry uh what would you suggest to make things a little more rational from your standpoint\nDavid thank you take one call Wendy ... secretary neural circuitry ... um what would you think of potentially creating a holiday whether it be a state holiday even to propose that perhaps the national level to\nUm have an official day off for voting whether or not they'd be in conjunction with a friday and Saturday to have a weekend day so that potentially more people would have the opportunity to actually votes or I'll take the response off the air thank you\nThanks very secretary Barry I think it's important to know that it's\nBeen my observation and my experience people vote when it's important to and if you say well if we had voting on Saturday\nOr if we had voting on a day that was specified as a holiday that it would potentially increase the turnout well we've broken every record the history of the state in the last three major elections we've had the empirical data\nAs Dan said speaks for itself which is that people come when they want to vote we\nAs a secretary Maryland secretary let me just play devil's advocate for a moment obviously the rig nipping at turnout is actually Yes sir I'm Sorry state Folkenflik\nOr ... you know there's obviously really interest to win a Roy Moore and Doug Jones we're going off in that in that a special Alabama raise rates of violent and people really turned out but what would make you think that people are ... wouldn't turned out more\nIf they didn't have the day off from work I mean there are a lot of folks for whom that a ... point there\nBecause this is what I Know I Know that when we had the presidential election November the eight two thousand six thing where to point one million Alabamians go oh Seventy two percent of people that were registered voted\nIt sound like a guy you sound like a guy to me who's very much in quest of a hundred percent participation of people who can do it right where a lot like something like that's your desire\nTo that's that's what I said earlier we won't each and every eligible US citizen that's raised in Alabama to be registered to vote and to be able to participate and have a voter id\nCard and to be able to participate at the level they want to participate but I don't know why some people vote and some people don't if I knew that I'd write a book and I wouldn't be sectors date anymore I'd be a multimillionaire\nAnd I promise you that when you write that book well welcome on on point we'll have you on the second hour and friday will enjoy yourself very much I'd like to ... to to to weigh in here\nI just wanted to take secretary Merrill's observation about when people want to vote 'em they they vote and you just\nTake that to be a a would logically implies right if we think that the only reason that people don't vote is because they're not interested in voting than what we're saying is that in the United states where we have turned out that's not even in the top thirty amongst democracies around the world\nAre FM Boston home of Boston the largest radio news from Ninety two

report from the un and after the market jitters does that affect how you feel about the economy should it where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's one hundred forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook at on point radio\nI'm Talking with Bloomberg White House correspondent totally all the ... ... excuse me all the ... the hills national political correspondent Alexis ... an on point use analyst Jack Beatty I also want to remind listeners that we are tracking or what's going on with a hurricane excuse me tropical storm Michael\nAnd you can find use of that are all day and all weekend on NPR broadcasts and also one line that NPR\nDot org I Do want to turn to uh to the climate report done by the eyepiece ISI the inter governmental planet a panel on climate change commissioned by the United nations\nOr which had very stark\nAh conclusions about uh the world's climate where it was headed and what kinds of actions were needed to even just mitigate damage\nDuring an interview with on point on Tuesday ... del ... at Duke University climate scientist and one of the co authors of the report explain the past climate change models had been if anything much too conservative and that we're seeing the results of not changing our habits quickly enough\nWe've seen hurricanes hold more water we've seen coastal areas get flooded we've seen the currents of heat exchange go up\nSo we're not just relying on these models we're actually seeing that the models or if ... if anything been kind of too conservative and we are now reaching areas of dangerous and damaging impacts more quickly than we realize we went back in the eighties\n[noise] total ... how is the government responding to this panel just this report\nI without much action actually if you're looking specifically at the White House which drives so much for the policy and the federal government\nThere's not a lot of action is being taken to a combat this fast moving problem of of climate change or we've seen the president you know try to talk about how climate change a hoax he said that in the past and\nUh it doesn't is racing has rolled back a lot of the regulations that were put in place by the previous administration to try to get ahead of this issue we did see the president pulled out of the Paris climate agreement last year a saying that it was not fair to the United states it's it's an agreement that basically all of the countries in the world or agree to in order to try to slow\nThe uh the impact and the onset of climate change uh this is the president that really wants to focus more on um you know reducing regulations are investing in a traditional forms of energy and ah as you said putting coal miners back to work\nAnd he hasn't spent as much time focusing on these very dire warnings that we're getting from scientists about what will happen if action isn't isn't taken to a to slow the impact of climate change on on the planet\n[noise] ah I'd like to take a call now from west Brookfield, Massachusetts I Believe it's Bob Bob you're on the air\nI thanks for taking my call Yes sir I think the I think the biggest driver of climate change is not all people in their everyday lives to turn away from it there's no bigger issue in this report anything\nIt tells me that people who claimed to say that they will do anything to protect their ...\nAre not telling the truth unless they get engaged and are willing to start seeing those changes in pushing for seeing those changes from the bottom up because it ain't gonna happen from the top down\nThanks so much for that call a Bob uh Alexis I'm asked to what a action have been taking a it at the White House what kind of just reaction has there been from a from leaders on health particularly Republican leaders\n[noise] well I don't want an element of the un report was born out immediately in the reaction as as you're questioning and he at the held a news organization I work with our environmental reporter went to the hell went around on Wednesday was uh trying to talk to lawmakers who are on the right committee or would normally be interested\nAnd came away writing a story that he couldn't find anybody who would read it now why would that be that's because we're just a couple of weeks before a mid term elections and uh the un report said that there were very limited options because time is now very very short to try to have some\nFunctional impact on this trend but that the political will is not there and that was the reaction that we are\nDiscovered right away and as Tony said the president has said you know oh there's lots of reports as if this report is just among hundreds that he is willing to reject or ignore and so whether it was the White House or Capitol Hill\nIt was just a big you know cricket\nMakes it sound like sort of yet another parking ticket whereas of\nThe issues at stake are quite dire indeed this is an issue obviously we hear it on point will continue to coverage I Do want to move on to the swearing in of the new justice on the Supreme Court one of nine of Brett Kavanaugh appeared at the White House there was sort of it I'm a ceremonial swearing in that as he'd already been formally sworn in but he appeared at the White House\nUh and at that time the newly minted justice Brett Kavanaugh assured Americans would be an independent an impartial justice devoted to equal justice under law and part of the Supreme Court's team of nine\nI was not appointed to serve one party or one answer is but to serve one nation\nAmerica's constitution and laws protect every person of every belief in every backgrounds every lit again the Supreme Court can be assured that I listen to their arguments with respect and open minds\nJack Beatty you've heard the new justice or can you uh feel assured that listen to the litigants arguments with respect to an open mind\nWell he had to say that didn't he based on who is a little Philip it in front of the Senate committee attacking the Democrats as part of the big conspiracy and we heard everything except big guys the come out of his mouth he was so deeply into Republican paranoia [noise]\nUh so yeah he had to reassure us on that score but will you know there's no check on him he lifetime appointment he can say what he will if I might let me just quickly return to that climate change report because\nYou know it's clear enough the challenge is poses to the GOP or some people call it the ... oil party which is deep into purchased denialism ... what about the Democrats James Hansen the climate scientist and a recent paper\nSaid we will go to negative admissions now basically or we will have to invest\nEighty nine trillion to five hundred trillion dollars over the next century just pull the carbon it's in the atmosphere out partly through developing as yet unheard of technologies where does that say to the Democrats when they went to Bernie Sanders when he says free college for everybody\nWhen he says we need the universal healthcare\nWhen they talk about guaranteed jobs where is this money going to come from their costs at a party that caused by keeping true to their rhetoric\nYes yes and and and yet they want to pose as the part while we're in we're concerned about uh the climate if they're concerned about the climate their agenda has to change to reflect this civil civilization will crisis\nElected cementing or is there any sense going back to the the new justice or that are thinking about the elections that ah that that the Republicans will pay a price for a for cabinet are what they did that now look as though there'll be a little bit juice by that the enthusiasm of conservatives returning to the fold\nWhile listening to Republican leaders in Washington as well as some pollsters who are watching these racist very carefully they're suggesting on ticketed Mitch McConnell has been doing some victory lap sort of the interviews recently a bunch of them\nAnd they're pointing to polls in which there a Senate candidates are are pulling ahead are doing better than they thought they might in a state that they would normally be thought out to be winning and a Mitch McConnell the majority leader in the Senate is eager to say that that little\nWith cabin on fact as you know in the NPR interview he said it it happened just at the right time he thought the timing was just perfect even though he said it wasn't planned that way to be so contentious right before the election\nAnd ... and a Democrat that not disputed that they're they believe that Democrats are very motivated and might themselves be very motivated about what they saw particularly women\nIf I see that WVU are

news analyst Jack Beatty you can join the conversation what other stories are moving you this week what's on your radar what's not getting enough coverage where one hundred forty three eight to five five ... hundred and forty three talk you can also follow us on Twitter and find us on Facebook\nAt on point radio or one of our callers are called to admonished us for spending time on Kanye West visit to the White House at all but I think it's part of a piece of understanding where\nAre the president is coming from what's on his mental landscape what does he sharing with us he also had some a sharp words at a rally a in Council Bluffs Iowa on Tuesday the president had harsh words for those who oppose him\nHand matches during our citizens and you don't give power to an angry left wing mob and that's what the Democrats\nWe've heard a lot of rhetoric from Republicans about the Democrats in their opponents being object ... where's this rhetoric coming from\n[noise] well yeah and you know let's just get a job for the test was called the Democrats evil the party of crime they want to destroy our country liberals are quote very very bad people\nYou know in the ah October nineteenth two thousand sixteen debate the president was that then candidate Trump was asked you abide by the results of the election and he said I Will look at it at the time I Will keep you in suspense it could be rigged\nNow we have to be in suspense about two thousand and twenty is it likely that the president will turn over power should the Democrats win to a party that is what destroying our country very very evil\nYou know you we have reached the point where this sort of ultimate alarm is almost common sense about Trump is ed lose\nMy heavens writing in the Financial Times it's hard to imagine Trump refusing to accept election defeat that that's a along step\nFrom where we are but certainly the rhetoric is charged he's talking about mob rule elect to some degree or you've been hearing that from a congressional figure some of them on Capitol Hill as well what are you hearing that's driving that rhetoric what did they point to and and ... you know what is it really grounded on\nWell first of all when we first started to hear this discussion about an angry mob it was a talking point it was very clear because Republicans including the president were all speaking with the same voice so it had been focus grouped with a talking point and pollsters were suggesting that Republicans would profit by doing this\nAnd part of this is because an election season no matter what party here and you're trying to draw very sharp contrast and mobilize your own base to turn out and we know that Republicans had been very concerned that their base is not has mobilized her as excited about turning out in the mid term election and the Democrats may be so\nLike I don't like yeah let me just stop you there to help underscore your point during on points a trip to Pennsylvania last weekend ... valley resident Dorothy new clothes told our co host magnet chocolate party that people are getting tired of constant protests from Democrats\nThe Democratic party on so far to the left and\nI don't know if you will always have a divide there because you're having the patriots versus the socialists and the global is [noise] and that until\nHe could sit down and discuss things and not have one faction running around with Philippe hats on their heads and science and everything that goes I mean they're just they're everywhere\nAnd that's from one point said field reporting from Pennsylvania a in that case about how congressional redistricting the redistricting is affecting states\nHotly contested midterm races you can find more about that on our website on point radio dot org but Alexis to allow you to continue a little bit you know if there's something more than what they're saying about sort of mob than simply the people were protesting I mean you know freedom of assembly is a constitutional right that's hardly seems like ... to me\nWell it is but it sparked a debate about what is our our ... in our in our ...\nEach and what is going over the line at of course Democrats are furious because they argue that the president himself is very incendiary and his rhetoric and\nAre often insights a mob reaction himself but I Would also point out that the Republican efforts to drop sharp contrast started before Brett Kavanaugh and you can see when Alexandra or Ocasio Cortez won her race at in New York and defeated\nA Joe Crowley long term and comment and it is running as a socialist that there were a lot of eyebrows raised and hands or being rubbed together in the Republican Party about why we can really use this because the effort there is to say that the entire Democratic Party is being\nPulled to the left to the left to the left and you know you can see that there are a variety of candidates are interested in perhaps running for president or in these house races\nThat fit into a mall that the president and Republicans are using to showcase a kind of activism that they want to paint as going too far\nIt's interesting 'cause there's this tension and it's almost as though there is seen as in parallel but sense of kind of different to me about pension about whether to be pulled it left\nA among Democrats and you've seen that play on some congressional primaries and races and also tension about how strongly teach you fight for a political success\nOr earlier this week a former attorney general Eric Holder of course served in the Obama administration spoke at a campaign event for Georgia democratic gubernatorial candidates Stacey Adams\nA reference Michelle Obama's often repeated comment when they go low we go high\nEric Holder said no when they go low we kick them that's what this new Democratic Party is about he followed up a few minutes later\nWhen I say you know we don't do anything inappropriate you don't do anything illegal but we've got to be tough fight for the very things that John Lewis Martin Luther king when the young you know all those little gave to us that can be taken away\nThat's the thing to do they want to maintain\nThat was a former attorney general Eric Holder speaking at a campaign stop for Stacey Abrams in Georgia\nA lot of Republicans and conservatives took great offense to lose ... uh they said you know this is a wildly inappropriate he further clarified his remarks on Twitter saying OK stop the fake outrage I'm just saying Democrats need to be tough proud and stand up for the values we believe in the end but the president took this is a bit of a rallying cry\nYeah the president did the RMC did the\n... the ... the leaders of the Republican campaigns for twenty eight teams\nAre all sort of seizing on this comment and other comments that are somewhat similar by Democrats trying to paint this broader picture that you know Democrats are party that condones in a an incite violence uh and it just it's a talking point that they're really driving home on in the final weeks of the election because as electric said\nThese both both parties see this as a base election where they're trying to motivate their base\nThere has been evidence that Democrats are incredibly motivated in part by their animus towards the president\nTo turn out in in high numbers and Republicans are trying to match that\nIn part by saying you know these Democrats or socialists they are violent they're part of antifa and you know as the president said they're going to allow crime to come into the country if they take over so it's part of a political strategy will have to wait and see for the next three or four weeks it's if it works if it does\nSucceed in driving turnout um\nWe did hear from Michelle Obama who sort of push back and said you know the politics of fear is not the politics it's going to win over the long term but there is this debate in the Democratic party about\nHow hard to push and they've seen some of the success that President Trump is hat and and that Republicans have had with hard line type tactics like\nHolding up in the Supreme Court seat for a year they're saying we want some of that on our side we want people to really go to the mat for our policies and there's a debate between that and and the idea that we need more civility in our politics are going to beat them by going high when they go low\nAnd that internal debate is still playing out and it's been happening in different ways in different parts of the country seem more moderate Democrats win in some places we've seen\nDemocratic socialist and progressive went in other places and uh what's going to happen in November is going to have a big impact on in determining how the Democrats move forward in twenty twenty and what kind of party they want to be for the next parts of the presidential race\nI'd like to take a call now from Detroit Michigan steeply gotcha what's on your mind\nHi I Am calling that with the question what a counter general observation and that is I've heard a\nLot to different NPR talk shows this warning this batting back and forth about a Democrats or historical because we said that Trump has administrator fascists like and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city": "Tisbury", "day": "13"}
