stronger keep our arteries clear impact our mood and emotional state support metabolism and essentially serve as a master switch\nFor two thousand genes in your body believe it or not we're talking about vitamin D\nWell our guest today is Dr John canal a practicing medical doctor majority on vitamin D\nHe's the founder of the widely respected vitamin D council author of numerous scientific papers that outlined the tragedy of this vitamin D deficiency epidemic an author of an upcoming book on the topic he's the man the media increasingly turns due for answers when a new vitamin D study is published in his Thirty years in medicine\nDoctor canal has never indoors to supplement for any company but that's all changing\nYou not only door says charities advanced vitamin D formula he's put his name on it joining us live from California doctor canal welcome back to the program thank now doctors now I Know that you're plump you're extremely excited about the absolute barrage of information that's emerged in the\nPast year or two on vitamin D you're seeing the vitamin D revolution the vitamin D error is officially started in the impact is going to be\nUnprecedented what's really going on here\nWell let me tell you it's just a little bit about how I got into this 'cause I think it'll give some information about how this evolved\nAbout ... years ago I realized that vitamin D was going to revolutionize medical care the reason I came to that conclusion is because I realized that virtually all Americans are vitamin D deficient when we follow doctor's advice in our government's advice and we started putting on the sun block and staying out of the fun it had\nTremendous effect on the vitamin D levels in our blood so I started a nonprofit the vitamin D counsel on there you can read more information than you can possibly remember all about vitamin D\nAnd I also realize that the amount of vitamin D Americans were taking whether it be in their multi vitamins are trying to drink milk was pretty much irrelevant the amount is so low it had no effect on vitamin D blood levels\nAnd when I realized that it literally changed my life and then within the last year or so I realized that to work fully to optimally work vitamin D needs a number of coke factors\nIt needs vitamin K to a vitamin K one but the more expensive vitamin K to\nIt needs for on it needs magnesium it need sink and we'll talk about all these secondly I realize there's a difference between having vitamin D on the shelf and people can buy it for getting people information on the radio so people who are not taking it or taking the wrong preparation can learn about it\nAnd that's a big difference so I approached a number of companies and purity agreed to make the vitamin D formula that I insisted upon and secondly I said by the way I Want people to take this with fish oil\nSo what we're gonna talk about today is purity offer about up complete vitamin D formula one that's unlike anything else on the market you can't buy it in the store you can't pocket on on the Internet it this is the only such formula that exist\nTogether with their ultra pure molecularly distilled fish or\nYou know let me ask you a question here 'cause I'm a skeptic at heart and I like to play the devil's advocate on the radio and how is it possible that one vitamin in this case vitamin D can be involved in everything from cardiovascular health to immunity to body weight even dental cavities I mean I've heard stuff like this before you know about vitamin C. what's what is different with vitamin D\nYeah that's a good question let me just do one thing that people understand exactly what sort of things have been discovered and one of the best ways to do that is to go back and look at Google News now here's some headlines from major publications in the last couple of years about vitamin D I'm just going to read off a list of headlines\nWhen you think about it is truly amazing\nAnd they these sorts of headlines have never been seen before for any other vitamins Newsweek\nOr Americans dying from a lack of vitamin D London time neglecting vitamin D comes with a heavy price\nYour PI lack of vitamin D can affect thirty six Oregon Washington Post vitamin D deficiency called major health risk I Am a new American Medical association or listen to this that vitamin D deficiency maybe the root\nOf numerous health problem that's the American Medical Association the you know it's just truly amazing\nThe reason that it's involved in prostate health breast health bone health cognition blood pressure hell immune health all these different things as because vitamin D pet it's not a vitamin it is truly the one vitamin you cannot get from a good diet\nBecause it's not a vitamin ...\nIt's made in the skin upon exposure to sunlight and what's eventually made as they there are worried hormone now they're worried hormones activated vitamin D is a steroid on and the way they work that is the key\nThere are key to your genetic code\nAnd some steroid hormones are key to only a few genes but vitamin D is the key to two thousand gene that is it unlock two thousand gene\nIs the key that two thousand one tenth of your genome but when one tenth of your genome is waiting for the key to unlock it\nAnd the only thing that can unlock it is vitamin D that's why it's involved in so many different health conditions your body knows what it needs it just needs the tea one lock the right gene\nNow Dr you say we need five thousand I use pretty now here's here's the problem I went through the the health food store the other day and I'm looking at most multi vitamins and I'm even looking at vitamin D sold separately\nYou know as a supplement itself most of them have two hundred four hundred I use I saw a couple of brands they had a thousand nobody even comes close to what purity is offering your I Want you to talk about why we need five thousand per day and there's really only three ways to get it I could either go out in the the new times sun\nWhich really isn't practical for a lot of us and there's you know these the skin concerns you talked about before I go to a tanning bed again not an optimal choice where I can supplement the right way with purity products why the importance of this five thousand number was that the magic bullet\nYeah because of the single fact and this that changed my life seven years ago when I was researching vitamin D I came across a number of studies that showed that if you put on your bathing suit and go outside in the summertime\nAnd ... for about twenty minutes ten minutes on each side you make between ten thousand and twenty thousand units of vitamin D in twenty minutes now\nThat's incredible I thought about that and I thought about that why would nature devise a system that made that much vitamin D that quickly and if you look at levels that people like ...\nThe guards were roofers gardeners or something they're levels or fifty or sixty or Seventy\nSo that's the natural level and studies very clearly show if you want your level to be ideal your blood levels to be fifty or sixty\nYou have to take five thousand units a day two thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to them maybe thirty two but five thousand units a day we'll get your blood level up to fifty and if you take less than that you'll get some benefits the vitamin D but you will not get the full benefit\nHow do I know if I'm vitamin D deficient I mean other than there is a blood test right\nRight there is a blood test and luckily more and more doctors are ordering tests\nThe problem with getting a blood test this first you have to get your doctor to agree to it and then your doctor has to know something about vitamin D and many of them are really too busy to read the current research right then you have to go and have the blood tests done and then you have to go back and have the doctor interpreted and you hope that by the way the doctor ordered the right test\nThere is there an easier way are their symptoms I could look for they wouldn't tell me pat you're probably I'm not a lifeguard so chances are right and I'm not a not a roofer so probably gonna be vitamin D deficient but other symptoms I can look for\nYes not having enough energy is a common one aches and pains that doctors can't diagnose is another one interest only in another is your muscular skeletal system out kind of ready you feel even your performance on the athletic field will talk about that later then I have a paper coming out and\nAbout a week talking about vitamin D effect on athletic performance how\nSharp you feel mentally whether\nWhether sometimes you're in a fog it seems like you're just not thinking straight vitamin D is crucial for brain how those are the most common symptoms but it's important to understand that most people who are vitamin D deficient won't have any way of knowing it\nBecause they've been fishing for so long they think the way they feel and the way they think\nAnd then when you move is normal yeah so you can't go by symptoms\nNow you've written that vitamin D deficiency is probably the single most overlooked problem we face when it comes to to our health how can you see something that's wrong I mean what what's the scope of the problem here in the U.S\nWell more and more studies are showing virtually everybody is vitamin D deficient course it all depends upon how you define that I mean if you define vitamin D deficiency is anybody less than thirty\nThen about a half of Americans are vitamin D deficient but many people many scientists now thinking that ideal level is forty in many of us now think actually the ideal level is closer to fifty and\nIf you use the cut off the fifty than Ninety seven percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient\nYeah let me ask you this when when people started supplementing properly supplementing vitamin D with a product like purity products getting that five thousand I use per day what kind of a difference if they gonna knows he's gonna make them feel better\nUntil then Beijing and the

the balance of power in Congress or in sixteen days this is it Fifteen days till election day\nOr a newly redistricted congressional district ten in the state of Pennsylvania and on November the sixty three term incumbent isn't a fight to keep that dream alive is going head to head with a liberal Democrat\nGeorge Scott for this newly drawn district and\nPerry won the last three terms in Congress by no fewer than twenty five percentage points but now because of uh Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision\nThey decided read do draw that state's congressional map it's a district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grew up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking that's the hand you're dealt\nAnd ah anyway a congressman Scott Perry is with us She's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting then they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have out this week that they wanted to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can\nAnd they drew the district to make it or to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you kind of highlighted some of the things they're doing of course the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to be\nYou know in talking to all your friends whether Jim mark Louis Gates' whoever\nUh it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it\nAnd that this this whole thing about pre existing conditions and healthcare a show on you know they're the ones that screwed up our healthcare system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a\nTwenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan to keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right and now they're blaming us for messed it up um we tried to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put wet thumbs down but\nYou know Sean when we fought the original Freedom Caucus in particular fought that original a bill out of a you know the ... the replacement for Obamacare because if you remember we're going to vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it\nThe original bill that deal with pre existing conditions among other things the Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew you know what and talk to the president talked or leadership and said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies the dying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right\nIn the buildup we finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we broke healthcare well it's all hardly ... tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the big lie is well Republicans didn't support pre existing conditions of course they did that was part of the plan I Know because you're right because I remember that very specific battle\nAnd in the insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill\nThat was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate is gone\nThis is not Czech president John Fong it's a Democrat's fault for obstructing a closing these loopholes and securing our border and the president as frustrated as the eye and ... everything he's got and it took it to to put pressure on Mexico and\nThen they usually more funding and fully funding all yes and you had\nBoarded our belt thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall yes or\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell John I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on a house bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because of being misconstrued by the Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear and people in that family\nMember wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare as they held in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen if a very happy that they're no choice people lock their healthcare coverage we had people right now a tree that the conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that I and and towards something that gives more choice for people\nMore flexibility at the state level more free market get the federal government you know to not be doing that one size fits all top down penalty taxes the mandate it's failed\nAnd so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ring that vote I I voted to protect people with preexisting condition oh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies bringing the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nOr Martha
