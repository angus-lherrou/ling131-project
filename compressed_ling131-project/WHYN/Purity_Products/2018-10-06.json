have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea Tina it's mainly used\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue as\nWe get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great from memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nIs an amazing story you can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's the reason for being to maintain strength and power it's an every single so on the body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the powers up the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important to help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their higher energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed here's the key is is so important for those of us\nSay in our fifties sixties seventies\nYou see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had one of the stuff it was coming out of our ... we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea Team in our muscles you know the good news is that hundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nHe goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how eliminate athletes have been using Korea teen for years to enhance strengthen performance tell me more\nWell this Korea Team is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used at body builders know about it athletes know about it\nKorea Team is the premier\nSports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course you can do about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee\nThey came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff is amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever a strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in states stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat you know he's like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarians can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel\nAnd I put 'em on average strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on a younger person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general and you have more of a vegan style diet this is for you you definitely want to add that are very strong\nSide so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing the folks in

brand new book out by the way it's called ship a fool's that was selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution\nUm are we really getting to the brink of a revolution in this sense I mean look it's only happened three times in the last hundred years where a party wins the White House power in the White House and they don't have losses in the next midterm election year the last time was right after nine eleven two thousand and one George Bush was president\nUm but I got to imagine people are pretty pissed off at the\nAt what's you know it was two weeks ago

they're crushing him and his family in order to get it\nAre we moving to a revolution while I don't know what the people in charge look at the Congress look at our media they're pushing conflict in division on us they're pushing racial division endlessly they're pushing gender division they're claiming that the cap not\n... ... women should have men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them to control that divide and conquer it my oldest strategy there it\nWell you know look I I've I chronicled this historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans racist or sexist I won't get the whole list but exactly they want to throw granny over the cliff and now with Supreme Court justices\nOr if they have an opening ... there seems to be no\n... there's nothing they will say or do now I mean your friends of the attorney for professor cats\nYou know Dianne Feinstein recommended who herself is pretty radical left\nNow soliciting people from the Georgetown Prep community whatever that is and asking if if they have information or they want to come forward their soliciting people and the FBI now is being told by Democrats\nWell it's got to be white in scope and it's got to go on for as long as need be which is the opposite of the so called agreement\nBetween a senator Coons and not enough in honor of snowflake it last week\nExactly I mean Republicans left their hearts are so literal that they offered this stuff every single time and

have blacked out in this event\nUm nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said that somebody I blacked out correct so this is a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him so here's objects question\nRight go ahead where\nThings could change yeah I'm from an emphasis on the sex misconduct allegations too was he truthful about his drinking and I think that's what the fact\nThat there really isn't any evidence to support the sex or allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although mentioned many times in his testimony that I'm In fact\nDrink today rock harbors an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single
