Houses Maine also has one of the oldest populations in the United states the median age in the state of Maine John his forty three and around five years older than the rest of the country to attract younger workers\nMain is providing tax credits to student loan borrowers\nWhat a brilliant strategy I think it's absolutely brilliant and you know we say that\nNeed is a power these and states and governments need to take a page from private enterprise and find out what it is people do in the real world to attract people and keep people and get people to come work for you\nOne of the things you hear in private enterprise is people want to have help with their student loans\nAnd you know main is offering student loan help to people who live in Maine and work in the state and I just think it's a great idea because they the population is getting older now people are moving out there trying to encourage\nSmart people just stay in you you go to vote in college you go to ... stay here you go to Cal State and and we'll pay your student loans for the way the program works if you're not familiar with it\nIs it's a tax credit program so if you're paying two hundred dollars a month ... in student loans the end of the year when you file your tax return your state tax return it has pretty high income taxes\nYou're going to get a tax credit huh equal to the amount of those student loans up to two hundred bucks more if you're a stem major like if you're a science technology major you can get more but that's that's a like most kids when they graduate college are going to have student loan payments\nYou know the kids I Know if you've got forty thousand dollars and your student loan payment on that might be anywhere from two to three hundred three hundred and fifty bucks a month so far the sudden state of Maine pain that for you and you you get a job offer in Portland yet right you know say hey Portland nice city\nGood place to live maybe a nice place to raise a family and if nothing else they're going to pay my student loans\nAnd think about what that means for Portland for or from Maine I mean if that person making eighty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars you look at that state tax next year Neal year after year after that you look at the fact that you're probably going to own a home be paying a property tax is going to help your community a at a time when they're losing people it makes a lot of economic sense and we talk about the fact that private employers\nAre now offering is sometimes in lieu of four one K. matches or in addition to four one K. matches\nThis type of program to help students with their debt and we're seeing survey after survey of\nPeople coming out of college saying they're number one worry ... is paying that low to think about it right you your graduate from a Wentworth you graduate from northeastern Yale whatever your date and if you have an opportunity to go work for a biotech company in Cambridge\nAnd they're going to say to you or will pay the first three hundred dollars a month when your student loans\nShe was that's hard to turn down and it's a smart move on their part to do that so\nYou know kudos to Maine for doing this uh sometimes you know a necessity is the mother of invention you know and a lot of times when you're pushed to the back to the wall you do the things you probably need to do\nAnd you come up with creative ways to get by and you know main is dealing with a crisis like you said the average age median age being forty three [noise] uh that is not good news because that means people were younger or leaving this will help yeah absolutely nothing big impact it you know the problem is\nWe report on it today won't have an impact for ten Fifteen Years true but it it does send a
