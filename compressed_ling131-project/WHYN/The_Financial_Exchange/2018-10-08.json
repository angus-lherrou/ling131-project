but obviously there's a whole other side to this which is you know if there's any government that spent more on defense over the last decade it's also China so\nDefinitely some concerns there that's not what we want either that I'm going on from China\nOr an interesting story from CNBC this morning global deal making appetite as fall into a four year low a mid ... that China trade fears et cetera are only forty six percent of global executives over the next twelve months are planning to\nBuy or merge with another company which is pretty low in terms of historically what we've seen yet temp\nDown by ... percentage points from a year earlier so that's you know it definitely a dramatic\nShift or of course you know you have seen a you know a lot of big deals going through the sky Beale Comcast\nComing in to pick them up a bear and Monsanto you know at some point you sort of wonder or just how many deals are they're left out there to do I mean I suppose every single day there's some deal to do but you know if we've come through a period of a really aggressive em an a and you know if we knew the answer to this we\nMake a billion dollars you know we'll things are in the economy in the stock market be better twelve months from now than they are now I think you know there's a reason to to have doubts about how much longer kind of the good times we've seen can keep\nGoing yeah certainly I mean that that is a risk I you know the big executives are cited regulation and geo political uncertainty as the biggest risks and concerns they have to deal making\nYou know and the other side is some of the theory is hey if you're gonna be heading into a period of slowing or you know economic recession you want to be big and you have some consolidation so you can whether that storm so two sides of the coin but\nA clearly a lot of geo political and economic uncertainty out there and you're seeing is this is one of those early indicators that we see out there you know if people aren't willing to shell out cash for other companies that begins to become a concern when compiled with other issues\nAnd sort of another version of that is are people waiting and thinking some people are gonna get beaten up in the next twelve to twenty four months and you might be able to make better deals in twenty Nineteen twenty twenty\nDerby not to mention you know probably costs you another

it it it was a weird place um the number of people that are buying mattresses on line now and the number of expansions that that that this company had done just didn't seem to add up to me yeah it is not terribly surprising that I've seen this company going out of business yeah 'cause I go\nBy a couple of every day and this got me thinking about I've never seen anybody going into a mattress store and you know these days or what a better product ... get it delivered to your house lie down on it if you don't like a return it\nYeah so I my my wife bought one of these are online matched I don't remember which company she used it as a group on deal five years ago we ordered it we actually really liked it but\nThinking about that ... that return process that wouldn't be very pleasant if we had to return it I mean first off yet that whole that two hundred pound box up three flights of stairs and towards south the apartment south Boston apartment that was miserable [noise]\nUm and then if we had to bring that same back down I genuinely don't know how we would have done it ... it might have involved the chain saw on a window and\nSo I see the appeal or to bind them ashes on line and

A. comparisons to Donald Trump or who you know came away with a big portion of the vote she did not win the election the Brazil doesn't elections a little bit differently\nThey have a big election with all the uh all the people running and then if nobody gets fifty percent then there's a runoff so we're heading to a runoff but it looks like they're going to be a big shift of power in Brazil\nWell and things are are just such a mess down there in terms of you know a level of debt up to you know eighty percent of GDP\nIn debt and the government spending I appreciated this until I read this morning two thirds of the budget in Brazil goes for old age pension is public health care and the payroll of the public sector by twenty twenty that's going to be the entire budget there's no money left for schools roads and highways\nYou know it's just sort of out of control so you can see where a a you know a ...\nComes from in terms of people being fed up with a you know getting whacked with taxes to pay for a colossal government sector\nIs a ... I think it's ... and narrow a former army captain is pretty much being going up against the the leftist Fernando ... died in the left working party has been in control in Brazil for I think a decade or more\nA nobody down I ... I spent a fair bit of time in Brazil nobody in their has any faith in their government and rampant corruption for years and years and years\nAnd bad economic pay place right now no one expert or Brazil hardworking Brazilians sort of look clean my house ... you're right it's it's it's not a good economy down there and that's it for this hour of the financial exchange I coming up we've got a few different guests a ... from the ...\nUnder two hundred that's luck for two hundred two hundred you'll get a text confirming a tree plus I heard radio info standard messaging data rates apply good luck for news radio five sixty WHYY end use rainy or\nIn any way you want to bring real [noise]\nAnd you know the question of tariffs on China how much of a impact is that having because you see something like a third of the revenue for the U.S and the five hundred companies comes from outside of the u._s. so um you know you certainly have seen\nSome a specific companies that are really be whacked by the uh China tariffs but you know this burning season could give us a sense of the broader economy wide impact of what essentially is a tax on you know two hundred billion dollars worth of stuff that we buy\nTo correct myself by the way markets were flat about Fifteen minutes ago right now the Dow is down about Seventy points S. and P. off seven\nNASDAQ off forty five points so down and or some ... down about a quarter of one percent the NASDAQ off about more than half a percent that would make a three day losing streak of this comes to fruition so so far pretty rough October uh\nIn addition to earnings though you know the big backdrop that we have\nI have other than earnings of the terrorists as interest rates so the ten year treasury yields is now up you know pretty far above three percent read three point two three three percent on the tenure treasury\nAs we all know that impacts everything that we do know you go get a car loan you get a mortgage any of these things are going to be impacted by the ten year treasury rate and that's been on the move really since the end of the summer\nWhen I was amazed to see a jump Fifteen basis points last week zero point one five percent um and you know in the in the news the world a bond trading you know that's a ethic 'til you have a move that big and one week and you know as you pointed out have really been around two point eight percent for most of the summer so\nYou know it's one of those sort of bad news good news things because to me the reason the interest rates going up is because the economy's doing well and the fed can raise the interest rate and um you know we're seeing some ... I Would say a for now fairly positive signs of inflation growth\nSo you know uh every uh every piece of economic data you can argue is good or bad\nYeah I mean we did get so we got a a jobs report on friday and you know reiterated incredibly low unemployment rate we're down to three point seven percent unemployment\nAh wage growth was up at an annual I's rate of two point eight percent but it's been accelerating so it's the ... two point eight percent but if you look at the last quarter by quarter we've been getting faster and faster here so I think there are some legitimate concerns that the fed has\nAbout inflation or as as you see interest rates and that's the reaction is they're moving up interest rates but wage growth is the big one that we've been looking at and or if there's one thing that I think you really need\nTo keep the stock market and the U.S economy afloat for another few years it's going to be it's gonna be coming from the consumer and it's got to come from the American consumer making a little bit more money\nAnd spending that money on things like cars like toys like all that ah you know all that useless junk that we don't need but that keeps our economy floating Seventy percent of the economy you and me and everybody spending\nA so speaking of interest rates last decade you know if you wanted to go buy a new car you get a pretty sweet deal on financing zero percent financing deals really came\nAbout right after the the great recession all these car companies said well we got to sell these car somehow so how do we do it will get them in with zero percent financing lot harder to find these days\nWhen I was amazed when you started seeing you know zero percent for one year three years or ... you know great deal but when you start seeing Seventy two month zero interest loans I mean that's really a the the lender taking a major risk about what's the future going to hold\nYeah I mean I Would do is Seventy two months a loan on a car if I had zero percent but you really got to think about what us don't don't just sign up for one of these car payments people uh Seventy two months loan yeah those payments are really small\nHow how often do you have to replace a car before Seventy two months goes by I mean I I don't know if I Try and drive my car into the ground but a if you do a fair bit of driving in a pretty good chance you're gonna have to replace that carbon for six years goes by\nYeah and then you've got a big uh you know or you gets told\nThem on their own that car pretty quickly yeah\n... those deals are going away if you see is zero percent financing deal on a car uh usually it's for a couple of reasons one that's just something that can't sell any more so\nYou're ... you're still seeing some of these deals on you know smaller size or sedans that just aren't selling very well right now you know everybody wants to small SUV sedans just aren't really going so they're putting some decent financing deals on those\nUm but they're really by and large have gone away to zero percent\nFinancing well these Judy power numbers or two years ago nine point one percent of all new cars good sold with the zero interest loan now it's just three point four percent and even you know a talking about the effect of interest rates\nPercentage of cars funniest with an interest rate of one percent or lower uh that's just five point three percent a and that was never there was eleven point seven percent September twenty six teams are definitely people you know I'm digging deeper into the wall it to pay for a new car\nYeah I did I just bought a spotted mini van a about a month ago because I've had my third kid and so I jumped on that bandwagon I think my my interest rate on their cars over three percent now for only a forty eight months alone so\nYou're saying it interest rates are moving up you're trying to lock in a mortgage or anything like that I don't think they're going down anytime soon edge seems to be like it's going in just one direction\nI Would say the mini van is like a colonoscopy nobody wants to get one but you get to that point in life when you have to go now I'm all about\nMy minivan

exchange says the financial exchange radio network\n\nThere seems to be to me at least a lot of confusion\nAnd these days about the health insurance marketplace now if you got an employer and you know they're covering your health insurance that's pretty simple uh it's not trying to not settled trying to figure out what's covered and how much is going to cost\nBut at least you know what you're expected to pay is pretty simple but with the rollout of the Affordable CARE Act and then the you know the changes that were made the Affordable CARE Act a law has been changing over the last few years\nAnd now there's these almost like GAP insurance policy that you can go out there and by short term short term insurance they're you know they were designed to really only cover insurance for a period of three months if you're in between jobs or something like that\nUm but they are now being sold on a longer term basis they can be really cheap you know as much as fifty to eighty percent cheaper than plans available and Affordable Care act but as we're learning is they are you know specifically very different from what we think of as your typical health insurance plans oh\nAnd I mean they're completely terrible this a story that we're looking at from a CNBC you know ten thousand dollar deductible coverage a pre existing conditions no prescription drug coverage no subsidies uh you know you can't renewed them so you go from one provider to another\nAnd I get to the end of the story and I said you know why would you even pay for the coverage and the first place it seems like you're better off just not even going totally uncovered\nYou know I think what this type of thing I disagree with you a little bit there I mean what if you really do your research what this is covering you for is somebody that says hey I don't want health insurance but if I have a heart attack I don't want to go bankrupt now basically there's a saying if if you have to have an emergency really expensive procedure it's going to cover that\nBut it's going to cover pretty much nothing else as a pre existing conditions you won't even be approved for the health insurance and the first place so don't worry about it uh it doesn't cover prescription drugs largely\nA sky high deductible talked about that a ten thousand dollars ducked doubles ... thing I didn't realize though so if you buy one of these policies and then it expires 'cause they're you know three months policies you can't just go back and buy and Affordable Care act policy if you get rid of one of these policies you have to wait until the open enrollment period\nWhich is actually the one that come here yeah um the other thing too is there's subsidies available or if you're in an Affordable Care act policy these types do not offers subsidies\nSo you do it it's tough these days you really do need to research this I actually talked to a guy or just last week who is running a small business she had been in corporate America for years\nStarted a small business really you know the the politics of the Affordable CARE Act really rubbed in the wrong way so he just wasn't carrying any health insurance up until that point and it didn't really it it didn't really seemed to click like\nYeah I mean if I if I get in a car accident uh if I you know if something like out in LA I'll lose my house I'll lose anything that I have because you know any visit to the emergency room these days costs thousands of dollars\nUm yeah I I had a had a client who had a heart transplant the bill to the insurance companies one and a half million dollars wow what would you do if you I mean if you didn't have health insurance there you're just toast ... and he was in the hospital for two months\nAre all sorts of prescriptions and that's the other thing right you know yeah that's all covered the heart transplant these basic insurance policies but how about all the prescriptions that you have to be on for the rest of your life that this this health insurance doesn't cover all that\nYeah the interesting to see the the last time recently they had a twenty sixty and there were about a hundred and sixty thousand people in America who had a these short term uh coverage plans will be interesting to see the the updated number you know it's just getting to maybe five hundred thousand or or even a million now\nThe penalty goes away now you don't have to pay a penalty if you don't have health insurance so I think a lot of people are going to drop off and it's a big bill ... if if you earn a decent let's say you're a small business owner or your you know just a independent contractor and you make a decent wage you're ... for you know a decent Affordable Care act policy you're shelling out\nEight hundred thousand bucks a month for just an individual family plan two thousand four hundred yeah it's big big money I get why people don't have insurance it's really really costly but are you really need to think through the implications if you're not going to carry health insurance\nUm folks do you have a trust to protect your assets if not in your closing in on retirement this messengers for
