sixty\nYeah you ... you know the the tax law change it might have in effect this year and next year just short term is people sort that out but it's not going to have a meaningful long term impact just because you you can't change human behavior over the long term with something like that like it'll reset this zero after next year in terms of hey this is the new normal and then it's\nG I Do need to uh buy a new car yeah let's just tap the equity line why not\nRates are getting high though you know you want to use your home equity like ... say you and your wife decide oh we're going to use our home equity to buy a car that six percent interest why couldn't you get a better loan rate than that on the car\nDepends on your credit quality in some cases you can you know if you've got really good credit you might be able to get a you know a better rate but keep in mind a lot of those teaser rates where they say oh it's you know zero money down and zero percent interest for six months you know that's if you've got the best credit near an awful lot of people that don't necessarily have the best credit so\nI I think you know when we talk about the higher rates I think that is going to be something in the short term that does have an impact as people are going to look at that and say\nGee it's it's really expensive now like I was looking at my equity line that I have on my house and just because of how it was set up and how it's tied at seven and a quarter percent now hikes you know I'm I'm not so that's a that's something you would use as a last resort\nExactly you know I I have no desire to tap that but that that's again my personal perspective I realized that I'm not necessarily the same person that someone news listening to the to the show you do not behaving the same way I Do necessarily so I look at it in my my general point of\nView when it comes to debt is if you give human beings the capacity to take that out they will take\nForty four percent of homeowners between the ages of sixty and Seventy who have outstanding mortgage debt anticipate still having some mortgage debt when they retire\nDidn't used to be that way you you when you you would not dare retire in the old days you would not dare retire with a mortgage that was like\nYou you have to get rid of the mortgage before he retired [noise] not so much anymore\nDo you think it was easier twenty Thirty years ago the combination of home prices incomes and you know just general you know principals do you think it was easier to retire without a mortgage in the seventies or eighties\nNo I think people lived in within their means to a different degree you look at the older generation they you know that the you know I've got a real principals I guess the way it does it and that's you know that's why I come back to the emotional scarring of two thousand eight you know forty years ago Chuck\nThe people that were paying off their mortgages before they retire yup were children of the depression\nAnd and they had a different mindset they grew up in the forties and fifties and all they heard about was the great depression when unemployment was twenty five then\nEverybody was losing their house it psychologically they were trained to pay off your mortgage as quickly as you can now ... nobody pays off to more people die with mortgages\nAnd and I do think you may be onto something there for at least for that age group my my age group where Tucker and I are\nI think our age group is had really negative experiences with that and also that age group is young enough to be able to make changes in behavior over thirty to forty year time period to change where things are going I think for Generation Next I think for the boomers I I don't think you're seeing any meaningful change in behavior\nI like a lot of my friends still have mortgages are poll question today is\nDo you still have a mortgage and or do you think that you will have a mortgage when you retire and if you are already retired just stay in his answer us honestly do you still carry a mortgage on your house you're you're Seventy two years old\nAnd you've been retired for six years or are you still carrying a hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollar mortgage or a home equity line of credit that that's the other thing I see ... is a lot of people use home equity as a and their lines of credit in return\nOr ... years so we'll ... we'll see what the answers come by or we were talking earlier about mega millions can be one point six billion so we bought tickets for a billion would we be buying tickets for one point six but\nYou would think so I mean and and keep in mind that one point six I think is going to go up before the uh the jackpot is a is revealed to present weekly make notes twice a week it's a it's Tuesdays and Fridays I Believe\nUm and then Powerball I think It's Wednesday and Thursday Powerball by the way still has not been one either and that's now up to six hundred and twenty million so you get to point two billion dollars now up for grabs on these two jackpots here\nThe I I did the math the other day though so the odds on the mega millions are so bad it's one in three hundred and two million dollars right there one in one of three hundred and two million\nOh my gosh you think about you know your perspective\nIf you buy twenty million dollars worth of tickets you know you have a one percent chance of winning your odds are still terrible\nYou know and that's true and I are rich [laughter]\nStill determined [laughter]\nCutters taking his draft Kings' losses enrolling them over into mega millions ...\nHopefully he's not taking his home down payment fund and putting it in the ... the way over to his wife has as rock that account up I think about how nice of a house you'd be able to buy for one point six billion dollars you know what I look at it you know the I don't know so one point six so there'll be a drawing tomorrow night\nIt's it's gonna be tomorrow night one point six by the way the funny thing on this so you drive past any of the stores that have the mega millions and you know there was the jackpot and hey here's how much is available\nIt can't with how much is available because only has three digits [laughter] and so just every single one just has nine hundred and Ninety nine million dollars if it doesn't actually say one point six billion ... the system is not built to deal with it\nWe suckers are born every minute hey coming back talking about rolling blackouts in New

after losing my first one to my ex wife that's why you get ... you know news ah your your iron that outlet\nAll have a house so problems [laughter]\nThat's all [laughter] I don't get out\nThere you go exactly there you go a this retirement expense has hit one hundred thousand dollars annually and it's continuing to rise we're talking about the cost of care we're talking about assisted living facilities and we're talking about specifically nursing homes cost of this stuff is just going through the roof\nAnd the median cost of a private room in a nursing home is about a hundred thousand a year that obviously has been nationwide costs when you talk about the cost in the northeast and it really anywhere on the east coast anywhere not in the middle of the country you're talking significantly higher than that um and so this is one of the biggest things that I think people\nYou know don't necessarily have a clear plan for just because it's really hard to plan for a hundred thousand dollars a year that you're going to be spending on something like this and a lot of cases was not very many people that can afford it no I mean you you look at what most people have saved you know they might have a couple of hundred thousand dollars total and so if each spouse ends up\nSpending a year or two in a nursing home it can wipe out the entire state in in the blink of an ... you know\nThe er I've gone through this process with family members and uh recently had a family member that is going through now they're not in the New England area they're out in Arizona but the cost of it is about four hundred thousand to buy in\nMuch of that four hundred thousand dollars those tax deductible okay so you get a big tax deduction for the four hundred thousand dollar up front and this is not a nursing\nIs one of those aging place ... where they have different levels of care that you gradually move up\nTo it is so and and the four hundred thousand as non refundable you're out like gets when you die it that that's gone you getting to know that the family gets none of that four hundred thousand ... okay and then you're paying a hefty fee every month you're paying you know upwards of six seven thousand dollars a month\nPart of which again is going to be tax deductible too\nDo you think there's anything out there that ever been to the cost curve on this in order to make it more affordable cars you know ... years I've done the math and like people say oh gee I Can't believe that you know a nursing home costs Fifteen thousand dollars a month or something and then you do the math and you say okay first of all\nHow much would you pay to live in a hotel room on a nightly basis you'd say okay if it's you know kind of a middle of the road if you're looking you know what the average person in the country pays\nCall it a hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars a month or a night I'm Sorry so right off the bat you're somewhere in the ballpark of forty five hundred six thousand dollars a month and then you need food then you need care and so I just I look at it and I sit there and I go I don't know what you can ever do to bend\nThat downward they live on a cruise ship it's cheaper\nOver you know you have you ever seen stories about that no in years living on cruise ships like permanently permanently they moved away is that they live on a cruise ship and it's less expensive than one of these facilities that I'm Talking about the reason the costs for these facilities are so high is a I have a client that was running when\nAnd if you look at the amount of regulations that they have to go through both federal and state regulations it's all regulatory the costs the the they could provide\nCare at a much lower cost but it wouldn't be at the level mandated

Seventy percent of the audience liked it so pretty even they're\nPretty good there but it it does look like there's some absolutely terrible movies coming out this week so I think Halloween is likely to remain strong especially you know we had no that would not get all the way how to use a weekend of all the Halloween parties right be Saturday I mean I Know I'm going to want cetera yeah and uh the movie's coming out this week and look absolutely terrible\nUh so I anticipate it's going to end up staying in that top spot\nThat need to pay Fifteen bucks just to go get scared the Dickens out of you well I mean this a classical Halloween\nOh sure well it's a remake but it's still the same character oh yeah but Jamie Lee Curtis is and this really yeah oh yeah oh yeah\nYeah they ... they brought like a lot of the back and everything but ah yeah continues to ah do very well by the way do you remember um a couple when was it I'm trying to remember\nIt was a couple of months back you remember the crazy Rich Asians movie yeah yeah yes and so you know we had talked about hey you know how well is this movie going to do with a bunch of thirty million but it really strong back to back weekends and so forth\nIt's pretty much closed up at this point but it did two hundred and thirty one million dollars on the thirty million thirty million dollar budget huge when they're for Warner Brothers\nOn that and ... do they make additional money when it goes on Netflix or Amazon\nThose are some additional licensing but it's it's always the ... just made up front even though there is more now with the streaming services there is more that you know ends up happening\nUm but it was you know really good one for Warner Brothers there just because they were a studio that you know had struggled to kind of find any voting this year in crazy Rich Asians is their best performing movie in the United states this year\nWell very profitable labor force participation among prime age us women\nTwenty five to fifty four has risen to Seventy five point two percent from Seventy three point three percent three years ago what can we learn from what what's the what's the lesson to be learned from an increased number of women in that age group working I think\nThere's there's two things that I really glean from it number one uh I think that the cost of running a household today is much higher than was previously and so you have more families with two spouses working at the number one uh the second piece is that we have not seen a similar\nBounce back for men over that time span in as a result I think you look at that and you say why are you know that it raises more questions for me and that wire men not coming back into the workforce at the same rate is a drug addiction\nI'm sure that the well I don't so I don't know because I don't know of drug addiction more men are addicted to drugs and I'm Talking about the opioid crisis if you look at the number I haven't seen the numbers of how how ... like I I'm going to well I don't want to I don't want to put it out there but I I\nBecause I'm a going from memory and that memory is failing but I Know a lot more men die from the opioid addiction than women\nBecause I'm working I'm pulling up the numbers right now so if we look at uh males age yet middle age twenty five fifty four is pretty much flat over the last three years you know it's up slightly from about ... ... yeah so we're about one percent\nWhat does this do to the birth rate the fact that more women are they going back to work because they had kids and they need money to pay for college or are they simply not having kids and that's why there's more women\nI don't know if you can glean enough from this data to be able to say that you know you know I it it's really hard to be able to say when this is happening just because it ...\nIt's not happening just in the United states either this is going on in Canada Australia in the u._k. women are becoming a much larger percentage of the workforce\nYet in in I think again when you have I think the economy is strong enough that you know you have people coming in who were enticed by better job offers that they might have gotten a few years ago but it's also more expensive to run a household today you know you ...\nSent it to pay for daycare they eat so you you know like if you want to if you want to have a kid\nI mean you've got to make a lot of money to justify going back to work with because her name's bring your child the work done yeah wouldn't that be nice\nJust to daycares expensive if you talk to young families about the cost of you know dropping that kid off at the childcare center it you you better make a lot of I think I used to be why a lot of women said whoa

thousand or no excuse me if he made a hundred and twenty eight thousand four hundred dollars or if you made more than that you didn't have to pay the attacks now it's a ... in twenty Nineteen that number's going to a hundred and thirty two thousand nine hundred\nDollars yeah so a greater a portion of wages are going to be taxed for high earners and so what does that like four or five percent of workforce is ... not many people are making more than ... some of that um let me take a look\nI'll actually let me see if I can pull what the what the numbers are and that just 'cause I mean\nThe ... the old days you guys are too young to remember this but that Medicare tax you ever noticed that they break it out like the Medicare X. yeah that used to be kept at about fifty thousand bucks now that's on kept you pay ... Medicare tax on every penny you could make a million bucks and you're paying that Medicare tax on the million dollars or next\nWorld and at one thirty two nine hundred them and it looks like a that is let's see um changed the top five Ninety three point five percent so there's about six and a half percent of people that are going to be affected by this\nThey just means that you know next paycheck you're you're paying that fake attacks and it's a big tax it's a flat tax\nIt is if if you're self employed you're paying all of the twelve point four percent if you are employed by a company you pay six point two percent in the company pays six point two percent\nAs well people forget that you know they they talk about tax rates right they say oh my my tax rates thirty five percent nothing on forty one person you got a factor that in you know and then they forget about the state well you've got thirty five percent is another five of the state ... in most cases not Florida\nA normal retirement age is increasing by two months that's just that's part of the I think that went into effect in the Nineteen nineties where they pushed out the retirement age [noise]\nYeah it was one of the things that they did in order to make the program more sustainable it's going to be something they have to do again if they want to you know deal with the funding issues are that the trust fund has or rather is going to have in about fourteen years now\nYou know you can make a little bit more money than those of you who collect your Social Security early you can earn a little bit more money without suffering reduction in your benefit in those early years you know sixty two to sixty seven\nYeah if you retire before full retirement age will now be able to earn Seventeen thousand six hundred and forty dollars a year up from Seventeen thousand forty\nUh that's what you'd be able to earn with out it affecting your benefit great question that a lot of people have actually look if you are retiring in a given year let's say you retire in July of that year a lot of people have a question hey can I earned income prior to that that's an excess of that\nThe answer is yes or if you are turning full retirement age twenty Nineteen and you can earn up to forty six thousand nine twenty in the months prior to turning normal retirement age but if you were in more than that than Social Security with holds one dollar for every three dollars above the limits\nA lot of money but I'm going to a U.S shale has a glaring problem this is one this and unfortunately our friends in Saudi Arabia are aware of this yeah we're producing a lot of oil in the United states I think we're we're the largest producer in the world in a hurry or second largest\nRead probably depends on the given week but we're right in the ballpark yeah problem is we're losing money doing it well it's so here's what's interesting it's imports\nIf you were this was looking at a review of thirty three quote publicly traded oil and gas fracking companies so this is just companies that are involved\nA in oil and gas fracking not companies that are uh you know just have that as a portion of their business but purely ones that do that and what it found um were that these thirty three companies posted they combined three point nine billion dollars in negative cash flow in the first half of twenty Eighteen ...\nNegative cash flow in the short term doesn't necessarily mean you're going to be negative in the long run is that because you get a lot of ... or a lot I have a lot of ... they didn't break it out really so it's hard to see where it's coming from ... um but it's it's something that I think could be a little bit of a red herring just because\nIt could be that they're just investing a ton of money right now because they think oil prices are going to continue\nTo move up words so I'm curious to see what this looks like on a consistent basis just you know obviously we've seen this report here\nWhat was it a year ago what was it two years ago you know is is this something that's changing here you know because companies are adding so much capacity in the U.S right now we've seen us capacity go for about eight and a half million barrels a week up to eleven million or a day rather up to eleven million barrels a day over the last two and a half years\nIt could just be they're adding a ton of capacity and that's what's going on here\nStill distribution issue ultimately though isn't it they we we either don't have the ports are we don't have the pipelines to get it where we need it because we theoretically we shouldn't be exporting any oil if we had enough pipelines to get it where we needed more profitable to export\nYeah but it should it ever be more ... like if you think about where we can export it to export to China why should we have to ship it all the way to China shouldn't be less expensive to send it to the northeast by pipeline than shipping it to China on a barge\nWhat they think it is less expensive that's why you ship it to China instead because the more profitable because again they're they're China is now the biggest ... oil in the world they have the demand and they don't have the production understand and they need to be able to pay for this or you\nCan be your your producer because most of our oil is coming from the Permian Basin Texas right oh it's\nIt's scattered I mean you've got big deposits now that are shown up in like in Colorado you've got the colonel production though is it the largest coming I think it's about thirty percent that's in Texas\nSo you got your biggest slug coming out of there and we're still importing between what we buy from Canada and in our friends in the middle east we're still importing a good seven million barrels a day yeah\nSo why is my point is if if you had a distribution system would you really need to be exporting it all ... what are we wouldn't you be\nBetter oh you mean by distribution system pipelines well how do you think the ... getting to the ports it is truck but ... the ... we can't get natural gas to the northeast and we can't get oil to the north net gas is a different issue so I think when when we look at net gas that's a very separate issue that local to the northeast and and that's because\nWe haven't built the pipelines but if you look at how you know oil flowing around most of the country right now it's it's not a pipeline issue to get it to most places aside from the northeast now you know the northeast is an isolated issue but it's of its own making you know they they got because we won't allow the pipelines that's the big thing you look at the entire rest of the country they don't have the same issue so\nI don't hate coming up we're going to tell you why you should no longer put your vodka in the freezing I thought everybody put their vodka and the reason I thought that was just like what you're supposed to do that mentally I was wrong
