Springfield\nI I thought that was going to be the end of the lockout I thought for sure these guys would be back to work today what national grid hold it told on the line\nAnd it's been four months now since this lockout started back in June and you know you're getting into that I got to be run out of money while in and you're getting into the time where this matters to be honest you know it's it's it's one thing where hey it's the summer and you know you you've got to deal with you know this and that you're getting into\nIt it's cold out now that the company is the company does not seem to be\nBending they know that company is holding the two big issues if you're not familiar with it you got about twelve hundred steel workers for national grid that have been locked out since June\nAnd the issues are the company wants to eliminate the defined benefit pension plan and they want to pass on more the healthcare costs to the workers and the workers are saying no where union and and we're we're we're we want that pension and you know we were going to stick to our guns\nIn the it's it's amazing that it has gone on this law in my opinion I Wonder what winter does to the cause of the company saying hey we're still getting the work that we're not getting as much as we want to get done and they acknowledge it's costing them more than it would with the the union writers\nAnd and what what what I'm curious about this is you know if if the company you know just keep kind of going along as is eventually those additional costs I Do think will come down because of the big thing that you're losing with a lot of these workers not working today it's experience but if you have other workers that are building experience year after year and so for\nHim but where are they going to get the workers I mean these are ... are trained steel workers\nAnd and again it's it's it's not going to be a quick and easy resolution this is something that look if if they decide hey we're just not moving ahead with this it might take three to four years for that cost to come down I kept\nThinking winter was they think the impetus is it am I wrong on that is I Would imagine it's emphasis ... this is the fact that\nIt's getting cold all of a sudden because now it's going to happen is these guys are going to be out there trying to fix Keating that's that's broken and and when pipes go down I mean these guys go out and fix something in Seventy two hours\nI Would think that the again if it was thirty five degrees last night you know it wasn't warm like you're at the point where stuff starts getting used to ... I think in January February even before then delivers cold\nYou know it it starts to ramp up and so my guess as to what ends up happening here is I think the unions are going to lose on the pension plan do just 'cause I I don't think that like you'd ever companies getting rid of them I think they lose on that I think they get some concessions on healthcare\nBut they so far it may vary according to the union they made very little progress but yeah they they had a dozen meetings and they'd been cordial but but\n... yeah I Hope it doesn't seem like they're getting anywhere so we'll see if they can get a deal but again you know when I voted for months a paycheck eventually some of these guys have to be getting that I'd jobs you know they're skilled worker so they could be maybe they're doing side jobs at some kind of take could maybe they're working on that Columbia gas pipeline\nWell in part of it you almost wonder if you know obviously you know their their union workers you wonder if some other you know union jobs gigs or you know having them some work saying hey you know we know you're in a tough situation where we can help you out\nWe'll see we'll see I voted early view the day because I'm going to be out of town on the left\nToday but sounds like early turnout is rampant across the country\nYeah the numbers are pretty staggering I'm going to be a voting later today actually why are you doing it early just because I don't want to wait in lines on voting day did you have lines I just I don't want a chance to you know I've never voted where I Am right now I only moved to a year ago the suburbs you don't have lines to say no that's that's good to know I\nJust want to get it done then but yeah you're you're seeing a early voting turnout in some cases in particular Indiana you up early voting turnout almost identical to presidential election year levels in terms of normally you know significantly more quiet as far as the overall numbers that you see there\nDo we know whether one side is more fired up then the other you know you get more Republican showing up more Democrats showing up to vote early and does it matter like does it because usually you only get about a quarter of the eligible voters that vote in the ...\nYeah and it depends on the state and it depends on the count you know it's like ... there's different trends depending on exactly where you go so\nI don't know if you can glean any you know results from this as far as oh early turnout stuff that's good for group acts it really depends on the specific race non specific candidates that are out there in a lot of cases what does the polling indicate\nRight now in terms of outcome if we're talking most likely outcomes out there you're most likely outcome is that you see the house they were or I'm Sorry the house go Democrat and you see the ...\nThat have already been really unclear and here's why it's so unclear is that if you look at one of the best predictors of how things are going to end up playing out it's what we call the generic ballot which is hey what are the voters preferences just for Republicans or Democrats\nAnd a two or three point swing either way from where the polling is has a massive effect is based on kind of how things are set up right now so if you see things end up two or three percent more Republican\nYou could have Republicans keep the house and the Senate pretty easily actually if it goes two or three percent more Democrat ... winning a wave in the house and might even pick up a Senate seat to do which is a case where you\nDon't take you don't see the Dems taking the Senate in under any circumstance\nIt's there's maybe a five to ten percent chance that I think they do but I think it's really really unlikely usually die for thirty eight saying it's one out of seven I'd say it's lower than not smart though so they kind of know what they're doing\nOur poll question today is do you vote early I did vote early and I participated in the poll you can participate in the bull by visiting our website financial exchange showed dot com and be a vote early\nI'd be curious if the end results are that you have higher turnout I I don't know the answer or do we 'cause it's usually about a quarter of\nEligible voters registered voters that vote so in the presidential election I think it's about half right\n[noise] uh I'm pulling the numbers all I Need to dig and dig into that when a\nPrep the next segment which is regarding a new drug for the flu it's flu season folks there's a new drug available for the first time in gosh Twenty years I have\nNumbers actually if we want to do that first sure\nSo in a a typical presidential election year if we go back and I'm just going to go from kind of Nineteen eighty eight just the last Twenty years 'cause you know it's kind of the relevant period\nWe've been anywhere on the ... in Nineteen Ninety six fifty one point seven percent on the high in two thousand eight sixty one point six percent so generally around fifty five percent if we look at mid term elections going back to let's call it Ninety\nYeah we'll go back then as ... as well uh we're anywhere between thirty five and forty two percent so about thirty seven typically so\nQuite a bit less well they pull question again do you vote early financial exchange show dot com we're talking about a new flood new drug for the

I still am not convinced that were out of correction territory I ... I think that we're going to continue to feel some pain or possibly right up till Christmas maybe it'd be on but uh I I just don't feel the the markets are convinced that the worst is behind us say they want to go over\nWell I I tend to agree and I was talking to someone yesterday and and the point that we raised in that conversation so historically if you look at\nMarket correction is defined as being a ten percent more or more drop in markets you know you see one of those on average every sixteen to Seventeen months there really common you see those alive\nThe question is ... and the question that people have is look is this heading towards a barrel mark and defined as a correction or a dip of twenty percent more and more okay in the case that I made us look market corrections they're effectively ... their tests of the market to see whether or not the economy is strong enough to support current stock prices are normal you see 'em a lot\nBetter markets occur when the economy is not strong enough to support market valuations it's when those tests failed ... that's what you get when those market corrections when those tests fail there\nIn this case when you look at it the one that we had earlier this year it was again it was a ten percent correction it was a test mhm and the data came back over the next few months and it said\nHey we're still seeing an acceleration in gross yeah we're seeing wage growth inflation's tame everything looks good to go okay fine continue on on your merry way\nIn this case the data the next three months is going to be critical doesn't show a further deceleration in housing do autos continue to roll over if the answer to those questions is yes mhm then you do have further room to go here so that's ... it's going to be really interesting because the trained on that data suggests the answer will be no\nLet's talk about how we got data out from the national association of realtors as it relates to pending home sales yesterday we saw new home sales numbers that were very disappointing a housing seems to be weakening despite the fact that there's a tremendous amount of demand [noise]\nYeah in in in housing I I think it is not not even seems to me it it is weakening and specifically last month for the first time in a while you saw on increasing inventories in a decrease in sales and ... that's not a good recipe for healthy housing\n[noise] no but I mean the increased inventory level is nowhere near where you'd like to see it like you'd like we like to have somewhere I don't know Tucker would like to see Eighteen months of inventory available because that means prices were low but six months is healthy and I think still what do we have three four months\nOr ... I saw charred on this yesterday I'm trying to find where it is a year ago yeah uh oh no this is just for a new home sales sorry not existing so I have no health care but here's here's what we're seeing a new home sales to put this in perspective\nEarlier this year really late last year when things were peaking ... we had about five and a half months of new home inventory that was available new home not existing but I'm looking new ... okay today a new home inventory\nWe're up to seven point two months and that's\nTough for the builders you know so that because they're building these things on spec often it is in the last time that we saw numbers at that level in terms of ... the number of a month's supply of new homes not looking at existing but a new homes which again or a small part of the market but it's where you get a lot of activity for jobs the last time we saw numbers like that was two thousand\nTen see my observation is that the when I drive around and they see the new homes that are being built there these big mansions silly ones they they're they're building ... they're buying these two acre lots and they're building these houses that are I don't know five and seven thousand square foot house\nWas buying them but those are the only ones that are profitable for them to make if you could actually itself you could actually sell them and so I I look at it and that number is a little spooked by the way that number in terms of months of ah inventory for new home sales that number has increased each of the last six months\nOkay so we're building the wrong types of homes and there's an excess of new homes but when you look at existing homes in total real estate for sale is still under a healthy level you still have a lot of pent up demand most millennials still do not own a home\nNo and and it's because it's\nIt's and they're in their prime age like a ... even a young millennial now is like Twenty one twenty two years old I\nTook her where's the line from millennials to that next generation that we really don't like\nThese are like Twenty years old they are taught is that what it is okay Nineteen twenty yeah so ... do a fact check uh let's see here between Ninety excuse me eighty one in Ninety six are considered millennials yeah so millennials twenty to twenty or thirty seven\nTwenty to thirty seven so yeah you you still have even you know for younger millennials in that twenty four twenty five range and you know they're still not buying at the rate that historically they have leaving the old ones aren't like a thirty dollar five you know or ... or not they're not in in its affordability you know that that is the key driver here it's a Ford if\nIf Tucker could have found a home that he liked the price he wanted he would have bought ... you know get the issue that Tucker's running into is the homes that he wants to either too expensive or you know other people are coming in a bidding up the homes that he wants to make them too expensive\nToday on top of breaking financial news by becoming a member of berries brigade log onto financial exchange showed done come and sign up today\nAdam Johnson joins us now from New York you know our weekly soccer begin segment you'd be\nFounder and author of bull's eye brief actionable ideas for thoughtful investors [noise]\nAdam heck of a week to happier how's it going\nYou know about a week ago I said I think on the ... and I want I Want to let you know I Am on my back hurt\nSo what's living yeah intent is it is not been fun I I Am not bullish at the moment and and I want to talk a little bit about why that is to see if I can get a response from me and my view is it any time you get a market correction is a test of whether or not the economy is strong enough to maintain valuations\nWe saw one back in early earlier this year the economy over the next few months answered that bell and said yep we are strong enough in the market continue to move up words\nIn this case we're seeing some pretty important data declining housing in autos and I don't think there's a chance to those turnaround in the next few months so I think we're closer to a bear market than a recovery here what are your thoughts on that\nThere's an additional component that I think we need to address and it called valuation and actually it stick with what you're gonna get mentioned housing auto because uh we just got earnings yesterday from Port and believe it or not a little bored at training down you know I'm a dollar on\nA beat the earning ... and then it fails estimate it reiterated the fourth quarter of thirty ones then OK\n[laughter] you know what sometimes just reiterating that you are in fact going to make what they they you know what you said you were going to make good enough that you know eight or nine ... the ... better if you take a company like afford\nDown for now you will find value buying it thinking just stabilize ethic bored with trading yesterday on the low\nAt about ...\nThink of that and by the way you think ... percent [noise]\nWe'll hear\nIt and also one other point there when we factor in the earnings growth and this is a point you know for the ... that that you do after that I have to acknowledge here if you factor in the earnings growth that we've seen this year\nEven with the market being equivalent to where it was at the start of the year we are way cheaper on a relative basis than we were ten months ago so there is you know some comfort thing look valuations are stretched in general but that doesn't mean they're necessarily stable here\nYeah well I mean I think you and I are ultimately trying to find some sort of common ground even though you call yourself a barren I call myself a bowl and here's why um because\nWe ... and you just pointed out if you take something out foreigners that becomes cheap rate and the other piece that trading at fourteen and a half times during\nThe well I Will grant you on the fact that GDP coming out tomorrow with three point three is lower than it was last quarter which was way too um I Will counter by saying I yeah\nBut look at worst Dr price and there there comes a point at which you sort of rebalance you say well OK grotesque level a little bit but you know what do you wish will come down so much that\nI'm willing to actually step in and buy and I think that's what we're starting to see today you've taken back down far enough that people are starting to say All right this valuation I'll actually step in and buy\nAnd I'm looking at valuations what in particular seems most attractive to you when we're talking to either sectors are individual names what seems\nThe ... in this environment where it seems to me companies that are pure growth oriented and don't have much in the way a cash for profits are being punished where's more stable companies are being rewarded a little bit\nYeah I I agree on that front certainly on on the growth you wrote the names that hard they don't have a you know earnings but look at the financial um you know look at bank of America a Goldman Sachs\nI'm black down I mean these companies all three of them actually now a trading under and I are going on in the bank they're they're trading back or you know one point ... book value I mean that the compelling um you look at some of the industrial I don't\nGo to Adam Adam stop at the banks why are the banks so discounted\nBecause my ... and and\nI like okay I'm might take it that I'm a who many people are doing right now that the economy has hit a peak and that we're going down from here on that probably the second quarter was as good as it got and if the economy it\nWas as good as they get that mean that can only get worse ... consumers and bank or single ... leopard group consumers and let the auto loan on housing that are a student loan or\nThe consumer is going down in Mexico I go\nTo the financial Hancock holders have been getting rinsed for

wrong they market decides that was up two hundred and Seventy seven points yesterday as a thirty eight points texting and driving\nProbably not as ... those kinds of things happened because valuations are nuts and everything goes wrong right now you can have a lot of stuff going wrong mhm evaluations or you know in line enough that look\nThings going wrong might result in a Fifteen to twenty percent dip and markets not a forty to eighty per cent tip and there's still no great place to go on the sideline that I can answer though that it doesn't matter well I don't know it doesn't matter if there's no great place to go with people don't want to be in markets leave you know\nBut it's a lot more tempting to go out and buy a ten year treasury when the ... four and a half percent than it is when it's three\nI think in the short term if you're talking next two years there's a bull case to be made an intermediate term treasuries if the fed has to pivot you could get that ten year coming

of numbers they were able to bring in all nothing they they're not they're not saying but that's not good the all the\nUh people that were you know the reporters that we're going to the sites you said it was it was not strong they want it was the hundred or a hundred and twenty thousand they were trying to bring on that one day they're trying to do forty thousand\nJust on that one day so what they're doing here is obviously they're seeing their costs going up because of fuel because of wages\nAnd so what they are doing is they are raising prices on domestic deliveries and also adding surcharges on oversized packages and so when we take a look at their us business the revenue per pieces of four point eight percent for the third quarter which is the fastest growth they've seen in their pricing since twenty eleven so when the last seven years [noise]\nUm so you've got prices coming up here\nMy big question on this is whether this has an impact on some of the companies that currently offer free shipping name Amazon do they have to raise their prime price again they already raised at once this year that I have to go begin at some point number two you have target saying hey we're going to a two day delivery or a two day delivery free\nFor free well they might be able to do it for Christmas this year can they continue that\nGoing forward because that's going to be a real margin squeeze so\nI think there are some questions then for businesses that rely on both UPS and FedEx\nHey can they maintain some of the pricing that people have become accustomed to and if they can't how much does that affect people's ability to shop on line the same way that they buy in stores because one of the\nWouldn't that be something to fall of a sudden people started to go and buy into stores again because the prices are ten percent lower it could be largely make yeah he\nDid for going to store with a lower price [noise] if it was actually ... you know like you just about anything you're buying it you should get rewarded for you drove to the store you didn't ask somebody to deliver it\nTo end or a theory that would be the case the other ... you know answer for these companies could just be they will just raise the price of all of our products by you know two percent and Walsh said it\nWas different ways the different companies can hedge it I think they're going to react a little bit differently but there's there's definitely inflation coming on the side of shipping we're seeing it one hundred percent right\nNow [laughter] Seventy two percent of employers conduct background checks on all the employees that they hire in twenty nine percent\nCheck credit reports that's an interesting side I I actually thought it would be higher than Seventy two percent checking backgrounds right you would think that that would be pretty close to a hundred percent I Would think right you know you're going to have somebody come in and work and be near the cash register any job right I'm I'm doing a background check on make sure they're not an ax murder [noise]\nAbsolutely and so you know the big things that they're looking for when they do these checks you know can you be trust with money are you who you say you are a you know those types of things they want to learn a little bit more about we had to kind of hit a lot of\nPushback though I'll tell you if you if we asked if we did a poll\nAsking whether employers should do credit checks people get very uptight about I don't like credit checks I I like them background checks and I ... I like them both I I Want to know as much and I don't care whether I'm hiring somebody to flip burgers or whether I'm hiring somebody to deposit checks I Want to do is ...\nAbout them as I can and I think your credit score is an indication as to what kind of character you have\nWhat if someone just doesn't take out any credit that's fine that's fine ... like ... ... have a conversation about it before you hire somebody I like to know when I hire somebody I like to know that they have a strong credit score because of strong credit scores means that they pay their bills on time what they pay their bills on time\nMaybe that means they'll actually show up for work on time yeah maybe that means that they actually do the job that they're asked to do for the wage that they agreed to do it for\nI've always liked background checks credit checks I feel don't tell you I I just because there's so many reasons why someone could potentially have a bad credit\nReport explain it that's fine they I've had that situation come up before because we do credit checks and I've had situations where I sat down with the candidate and said jeeze you're you know your credit is all screwed up what's the problem well I went through a nasty divorce this happened okay well that that's fine right I just but I Want to know the ... and I I I think most employers\nBoy I I Can't imagine why they would not want to know that\nYou know I I don't view credit the same way as you know looking at you know just don't have you know criminal issues I have you credit\nDifferently I guess right now is up two hundred and thirty six points are gonna be talking about some new menu additions at McDonalds when we return to the financial exchange\nBusiness news is going to break and we're here to break it down and show what it means to your portfolio used the financial exchange with very Armstrong ... on the financial exchange radio network\nIf you're a real estate or property management company you need a banking partner that has all the right tools to keep your operation efficient leader bank is one of the premier banks and the\nProperty management in real estate space offering a suite of unique\nProducts and cash management services to help you collect rent manage condo association payments and digitized paper checks leader bank utilizes state of the art technology to offer convenient banking services to its real estate clients such as a C.
