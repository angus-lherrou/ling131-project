Springfield\nThis is a Fox News alert it's up to a dozen suspicious packages now I'm Dave Anthony to more intercepted this morning one sent to a democratic senator the other an ex Obama intel official turn Trump critic Fox's Rachel Sutherland does more life from Washington\nBut it's something where hey if we get a fourth quarter reading that confirms this you got a real slow down this coming\nWell so let's let's think about why business fix investment might be declining or are they look or companies looking at twenty Nineteen and saying hey you know our province looked pretty good for Eighteen because the tax reform and the only way that wouldn't be able to keep up these numbers is just cutting cost is that what we're talking about here\nWell I I think there's a couple of different pieces year a number one is if you're talking about the the ability of U.S companies to export goods from the U.S become tougher this year because the dollars up yes they're number one if you're a company based in the U.S that's trying to export to other countries you're not investing in exports to begin with because the dollar stronger\nAnd then also you're sitting there saying gee I've got these terrorists that are out there that are looming and I don't know what the situation is on that front\nOr and so that's a concern if you're a business owner as well so I think those are major contributors to this\nThe dollar issue you know might go away but it's something that could get a little bit worse before it gets better there um and the other thing to keep in mind on\nThis uh GDP report here is you know one thing that may reverse itself and that may make the fourth quarter look a little bit better we did see a spike in imports in this quarter with a lot of companies trying to import goods before tariffs went into effect\nSo that is something that did create a little bit more drag in this quarter here\nAnd that could reverse itself and maybe you know companies say okay now we need to source more domestically and you could get a bounce back\nIn that business fixed investment number but it's something that you know it's it's it's a concern just because we haven't seen this in two plus years now and it's it's just unusual to see a decline like that from where we were\nI have concerns about it but I'm going to take the optimistic view and I think I'm going to say that going through the end of the year here we're going to have consumer spending pick up to a level\nThat maybe it reverses this business trend that we will see maybe maybe I'm wrong about this but I think the consumer spending especially through the end of this year and starting through next year I think may pick up the slack of what we're seeing on the drop in business investment\nFor third quarter GDP in at three point five percent better than expected Mike's but what how would you describe yourself cautiously optimistic is that a fair\nI I just only because I hear everyone you know you're calling for you you were right in the middle of a big market volatility and I hear everyone around calling for recession and I just don't see it so I don't think that the GDP report does anything to tell me that we are headed imminently towards recession\nI Do get concerned about decreases in business spending but that can reverse quickly\nMike cautiously optimistic Chuck\nMore cautiously pessimistic ... will go from there which talked about a couple of companies that reported earnings after the bill yesterday there both tech companies\nAmazon and alphabet both reporting a in both down significantly today after reporting Amazon now off\nAbout eight point five percent right now alphabet stock currently off about four point eight percent so both down north north of four percent in both times with similar as you're not the exact same but similar issues net revenue is a little bit weaker than expected and margins being pressured\nYeah unfortunately for Google they've got the that combined with a lot of regulatory issues that Amazon is currently facing right now so that's been a bit of a combined whack against their stock price today and you can take a look at you know you can look at the chart and see that they've been under combined to pressure there um you know in Amazon's case\nIt's just a story of ... and maybe this is just to you know one quarter type of issue but it seems to be a story of they can't continue to grow with the rate that they've grown up forever\nUh and perhaps expectations were just a little bit too lofty here for this company so they saw the\nProfits that were in line but revenue drops that we're a little bit of a surprise uh pretty much across the board you know even the Amazon Web services division which has been the profit Center for the whole company of the last few years even that you know it didn't shrink but it's a slow down as they saw more competition coming out of Google and Microsoft\nYeah ... and certainly I think both of these companies you know one of the big questions that I think a lot of investors tend to have is look you know Amazon's been so good for so long one and I just put my whole portfolio into that company will just because they're not based on what they're doing today they're based on projections of growth Ryan ... and and so forth\nAnd that's why you see in a time where by the way the S. and P. five hundred just entered into correction territory meaning\nA it is more than ten percent off a of it's a lot of it's all time high now temper that Amazon right now is down twenty percent okay from its high of just over two thousand fifty dollars a share\nSo the risk with a company like Amazon you take on because the valuation so lofty\nThere's more room for it to fall into this fall and since the start of October about twice as much as the rest of the market sure\nYeah absolutely and if you if you were one of those that bought back in September you're almost you know definitely kicking yourself a little bit here\nUm I bought last week and I'm Still kicking myself yeah it'll be so ... that's not to say that there isn't room for reversal here with Amazon but they have been just the darling of the stock market for the last decade and this is a little bit of a cooling down period for them let's call it before we hit\nThe brake was also talk a little bit on ... earnings Versailles increasing on higher prices they're able to push through some higher commodity costs or to their ah their customers their ... what do you make of this quarter for ...\nUm one I haven't seen anything in the news recently about a mass groups of people getting horribly sick from eating their food is good you know as long as they can do that quarter after quarter that's great\nThat big number that I saw that I really like for this company digital sales at forty eight point three percent in the order of making up a eleven percent of sales and what we've seen from other companies that are able to convert on this is once you get people ordering stuff from your app\nOn line they will come back and they'll come back more frequently and spent more money on that application\nAnd especially to pull away the biggest criticism aside from you know occasionally having problems with ... customers from occasionally making people throw up are the biggest problem that

with a number of different um social media companies and so far as they are managing to extract a little bit more revenue and profit from their users\nBut their growth of daily actor users is declining ah so it may actually Snapchat side declined a drop in daily active users\nAh they expect to continue\nLosing some customers but they are a delivering a little bit more revenue from those customers that they have but at the end of the day you've got a a a sinking ship here or potentially if they continue to lose customers unless they find a way to get them back\nSo that's what Wall

actually where the kids use now sold him [laughter] I'm just saying like this is what the cool kids are saying now in and I happen to know what it is your hip hip what the kids are I'm I'm I'm not that help them but I'm\nI'm a ... week you know I'm All right let's talk a little bit about uh the plan that the president is proposing try to lower Medicare drug costs wouldn't what are we seeing here\nMike what we've been talking about this since President Trump took office and it looks like he's putting together a plan the\nIdea behind it is that right now the United states most people I think are recognized as the United states on average\nPays considerably more for prescription drugs than the rest of the world or the rest of the world specifically Europe puts a very specific price controls a on drug makers if they want to sell their drugs in their countries\nAnd therefore the United states and that ends up paying a lot more and end up driving a lot of the research and development that gets done on these\nThe idea here is that President Trump is proposing a plan where they would create an index of international costs for drug prices and then Medicare will be required to negotiate down to that price\nSo two things could happen here either the drug companies would have to raise prices and the foreign countries to get that index price hire us that they could charge more the United states are more likely\nUnited States prices come down a little bit and international prices go up a little bit to offset that this isn't\nIt is this will be imposed on every drug that's out\nThere it is not there is a specially this seems like a little bit of a beta testing so they're going to do it for just a few different prescriptions that Medicare has um certain drugs made by a single manufacture and those noted biologics or those made from living organisms and it's gonna be going from twenty twenty to twenty twenty five is where they're gonna be experimenting on this\nUm it seemed to be a woman\nSo and I ran into this and that and and oh by the way can you pick up milk you know it's a three minute message\nThat I Know like just tell me pick up now everyone acts good everyone's grade I I can get knocked facts by anyways\nThe U.S and China haven't really heard of people on trade talks in the last couple of weeks here any sense that things are moving behind the scenes or still kind of some hang ups to just getting to the table\nUnless they are being incredibly sneaky about it it seems like things are just completely stalled out right now are there is the hope to have a meeting scheduled right now for the end of November at the G ... summit\nI'm looking potentially unlikely that that even happens the the us is basically refused to resume and then go ... until Beijing comes out with a proposal to Washington that addresses the complaints about forced technology transfers and quote other economic issues\nI Believe there's a whole list of some hundred and sixty seven hundred and forty two separate demands of us has put in and um\nChina's just hesitant to put out anything from ... to be fair one I think we're probably taking the right tactic here which is just don't even begin negotiations until they come up and give you something\nUm but China on the other hand as saying if we put out anything than we are fears to me a link to the press and then we're going to come from a week and go shooting point\nBy the way some some data on you know how companies are mentioning in responding to tears this is according to Bloomberg uh in the course over the course of twenty eight team the number of companies that are mentioning tariffs are the number of transcripts that have mentioned them over the course of the year so far\nTwenty one hundred and eighty eight if you go back to last year we didn't get above seven hundred even with some ... you're talking to your three times as much activity on the side as last year\nDo you feel like it's just being used as an excuse for companies know now you think it's going to miss you\nKnow I I I again just from talking to people\nIn the construction industry and what's happened to prices on that side for steel and aluminum yeah it's it's it's a real issue there um as far as you know can can you get projects done at certain prices um and that's just in one industry there's definitely some businesses that are using it as an excuse you know I I always hate when companies\nYou know use you know oh we had bad weather and so like we write like\nGrow up ... happens cheesecake factory don't blame you are terrible sales on bad weather here\nImprove your product improve your product but do you know damn good things like this real like you know whether I sit there and I go look there's always whether they're always hurricanes there's always snow yep you figure out how to deal with it OK stuff like this these the kinds of things have there aren't always terrorists that are coming into effect right so these are things that I Do think have a more meaningful ... where\nWould you put if you're a gay man where would you put the likelihood the odds of anything getting done on trade with China like a concrete plan before end of this year twelve percent cut them down they're very very unlike\nNot Thirteen not eleven but it was going on but that's OK twelve percent I I don't understand odds what I wanted I'd had you know a different story\nAb ... of the big a beer maker or they make Budweiser that they make just about every ... yeah um so they are struggling and they actually cut their dividend in half\nYeah they're not strong I mean when you got your ... and half that's a pretty big message or sending\nSo here's the thing they bought SAP Miller when was it two years ago maybe three three three years ago the exact wrong time to ...\nUh you know an awful time\nThe exact wrong time to make that deal and they're paying for it now why they're cutting their dividends they took on so much to make that deal and consumers tastes have changed\nYou know I I think back to three years ago and you know I already thought that at that point the craft beer market was you know really getting crazy and wild and sort of peaking and it has gotten so much bigger since that three year ago and um they just continue to take market share away from Budweiser\nAnd I'll tell you the latest ads where they're pretty much making fun of craft beer drinkers or are they have you seen these no\nIt's the ones where they've got the guys you know the ... and you're going up but let's for everyone and someone's going oh do you ever meet ah yeah ... they're pretty much making fun of craft beer drinkers yeah ... ... there's not a good way to get people to come back to what\nProduct but I mean the Bud Light can make fun of the craft drinkers all they want but then on the other side of it they're coming out these Budweiser products you know a Budweiser freedom reserve red laughter\nIs one of them and they came out recently immigrated bottles and whatever and then eventually earning at home in Maryland barrel I mean so their knowledge and the fact that they need to change it up and be more creative with their beer is not working now it's not it's it's ... you can make fun of it and then do the same thing on the side of it you can't have both ways\nConsumer see through that stuff these days and so a be in the stock\nHas gone from a hundred and twelve down to Seventy three it's fifty percent this year thirty percent this year [noise] you know it's a big dip in a pretty short period of time this stock if you go back to two years to the end of September and twenty sixteen was one thirty a share switch off almost fifty percent in a span of two years and it by\nThe way it's not just um you know just people saying I Want to craft beer over a Budweiser there's also a\nBig big trend towards liquor and wind that or did not exist in previous generations spirits are on the up enough spirits big time wind to a lesser degree but spirits are very much so much more demand for that type of specific alcohol than ah than beer it well\nThe thing that's missing with Budweiser is the fact that these breweries have become a destination and hang out and it ... a day trip for most people our age\nYeah they got they got no experience from Budd while you go to any of these crap when they got food trucks there they might have local art is a good ... and stuff\nIs a B end up doing anything to get into the marijuana industry you see constellation brands are really making some strides there I haven't really heard of ab doing anything\nHaven't heard a ton doesn't mean they're not working you know kind of in the background and maybe have say I'm coming but I've heard a whole lot there neither [noise]\nWell that is all the time we have on this hour the Dow continues to struggle S. and P. and negative territory now in correction territory off more than ten percent from its high so time we have on this hour we'll be back in just a little bit with more financial exchange [laughter]\n\nUse radio they\nFly in

everybody's like oh yeah that guy uh you know called that we're heading into five years of bull market right in June of two thousand seven oh well ... my looking at this one\nThis one is the first started back a couple of weeks ago you know a lot of people were ... kind of similar myself included I remarked pay the bills kind of similar to what we saw earlier this year since then I've kind of moved off that 'cause we've got an economic data that suggests hey we've got you know real slow down the housing that's coming this for this third quarter GDP report had some questions\nWhere do you stand as far as not necessarily how bad this could get because again we're not trying to make predictions year 'cause neither\nPlus no but you get the sense this thing is a quick dip like we saw in the spring or do you get to get the census might linger a little bit even if you don't know exactly where it goes\nYou know I still draw a lot of correlations back to what we saw in February and I like you don't make myself in the business of protections but\nI can see a few instances where you could see a rally of this coming back rather quickly yeah if you if you get the midterms behind you and all of a sudden you see a very strong consumer spending towards the end of the year to me that would be an indication that things are going to recover\nRather quickly or but it could go the other way too I I hate to jump\nIn here and try and lay claim is or where I think the stock market's going to go over the next sixty days 'cause nobody knows\nNo and I think the the big thing isn't so much trying to say hey here's where it's going to go but hey what what's important to watching it high book\nHey anything housing related you you have to be watching that because that's one of the concerns right now so focused on housing focused on some of the big you know kind of existential questions what's going on with trade negotiations going on in Europe with\nUh the Italian government and their ability to get a budget passed you know those are the things that you need to be asking yourself hey what kind of progress are we seeing and I think when you start to get some of those answers we can get more clarity but for now if it's tough to find a path to a quick bounce back for me but it said any of these things resolved themselves and you might see that'd be the impetus\nYeah and by the way you know I Know a lot of people looking at elections and saying oh that is going to be a huge thing that tests the markets one way or the other I Would really discouraged you to putting putting too

as people that are\nLeasing an apartment and then sub letting it out on the air being bay and that that creates issues for the owners they don't want that it can create issues for the if it's a condo association there can be rules against that sort of thing so what this service does as one company called pillow in one called apartment jet where\nThey specifically contract with both the lease holder as well as the owner of the unit to make sure that you know the owner knows who's going to be in the apartment and are a number of different factors to make it just a little bit more secure in the way they're renting this out\nDo you think this makes what one of the questions that I've raised with regards to air B. and B.\nIs you're seeing ... he's pushing back on either setting limits are saying hey you can't do this do you think this helps the square away some of those problems and maybe make this a more um you know not favorable but I guess a more reasonable landscape for companies similar to air BNB to operate and\nYeah and to be fair to air BNB they've taken some pretty big moves to make things a little bit safer and make things more [noise]\nI guess I compliance with local jurisdictions in terms of collapsing collecting taxes and things along those nature that they weren't doing initially so I think every NBA themselves are doing a pretty good job but these are some new start ups that could make a big dent\nFor those specific types of situations where you're looking for more security around higher renting at your place\nTo go to let's take a break here when we come

what hedge funds to do a maybe a look at a sale\nEven though this is a stock that's down you know ... almost fifty percent in the last two and a half years no one's boss not no one's buying can't

they weren't even just a year or two ago right did you know we've seen dramatic changes there\nI think that's their points entire point though is they're saying a lot okay you're you're bored and you're management has clearly they don't address changing consumer behaviors you need somebody from the outside to come in and change the company\nUh and that's probably a third points you know idea here I think that this could be a pretty good and easy sale to a company like craft times\nOkay to do something along those lines\nYeah I mean I'm not saying that that's what's gonna happen but it would seem like they were pretty easily fit into that business model\nI Will say you know look I'm I'm not a big Campbell Soup fan in general but there's something about the tomato soup on a on a cold
