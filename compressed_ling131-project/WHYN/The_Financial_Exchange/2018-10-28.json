life story All right so you have to stick around for the second part did you see how I did that they're so if this case in this case we have a uh\nThe the big question is short cut planning right\nClient came in and said look you know here's what I've done and what you look at over but you know for the most part I only have one child is my only son my only beneficiary my only air um and and I basically just want everything to go to him so this should be easy right that's what they say that's how they start right there should be easy\nSo what I thought was a good idea was to\nTake my house put it in my son's name and reserve a life a state\nThat was done actually more than five years ago okay guys so you did that and the rest of my bank and investment accounts non IRA there wasn't much in the IRA most of it was just taxable investment accounts mhm I just went ahead and added my son's name to the account so he's now a joint owner\nAnd I've really accomplish two things they're right because uh now I don't even need the power of attorney 'cause my son can access the account\nAnd it's going to avoid probate and go right to my son when I when I die so I got that covered and just life insurance policy that I own does have a cash or undervaluing it but you know I'm just going to change the owner and beneficiary and give it to my son now and that way that will be protected and I want to have to worry about that\nWell it does sound like he thought this through a little and at one all of you listening to know well did he you know again I'm no lawyer representing the father here right and I want to make sure the father's taking care of right so\nI I Would go through some of the pros and cons with you of this arrangement\nOf this sort of short cut approach well the home\nYou know at a bare minimum I can tell you the home was was probably the best thing he did if there is a best selling less bad thing\nHe did give the house to his child and he did reserve the right to live there so at least he's got that going for him\nAnd and the so he can be kicked out he leaves can't be kicked out and in five years it would be protected from the cost of nursing home care and it will avoid probing and it will avoid probate and it will actually receive a step up and basis upon death\nSo it'll help with the capital gains tax issues ... but here's what I don't like about it so those are good things yeah what I don't like about it is it is a completely different gift tax purposes so you need a vial that\nYou can't ever change your mind so you know if you want to give it to a a grandchild that comes along right you can't do that now I get it's only child maybe that'll never happen but the\nPeople do this when they don't have just an only child they got a couple of kids right and they put all the kids on there\nTo put all the kids on her then you can change your mind as to which child you might want to get it if later on one child is providing more care for you than another child and you want to rethink how you leave the assets but even beyond all that just for your own self\nI have so many clients who did this plan and years ago and then come to me and say taught I Want to sell my house and I want to move to Florida and buy a new house in Florida\nOkay now you need to ask your son for permission no thank you I don't like that now he has to sign off on the deed and when you start learning about how to calculate what percentage ownership you have as a life tenant\nYou will be surprised to find that the older you are the smaller the percentage\nOf money that you would get even though you're a hundred percent current owner when it's so you don't get all the proceeds about oh you're going to go to this life estate table and you're gonna find out if you're like Seventy five and selling it you might be lucky to get Fifteen or twenty percent\nOf the proceeds if the kid gets it all back to you there oh that would be your piece right right right eighty percent goes to the kid right so the kid now has eighty percent of your money and you're like I Can't really buy my replacement property ... even in Florida\nFor that much money I Need the money to back\nAnd you know what you know what folks if you have your home in an area ... trust and you want to sell it you don't have any of this nonsense going on with the you keep that control you're not asking for permission to sell your own home the way these trust operate on a day to day basis is all detailed and Todd's guide that he ... he has written\nFor the month of October it's designing and income only ... trust it includes important information that must be in your trust and maybe more importantly all of those troublesome provisions that absolutely cannot be included in your trust\nRequest you're free copy of Todd's designing your ... trust right now by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine you can also download your free copy\nRight 'cause they did this planning ten years ago ... mom while ago so it was Seventy at that time ...\nIt's a little harder to undo doesn't mean you don't do it no I think you're still step back and look at her health and say you know while she's in pretty good shape let's let's get another clock started do it\nSo what do you do Todd if Dave puts the CDs in there now and four years down the road mom goes into their thing and they don't make that five years\nA great question I Would have to decide by looking at and this is where last minute planning comes into play right I normally there's things left out of the trust look at this case the for example she left a lot of money out of the trust our CDs that and go and\nI'm sure even though she's putting the CDs and now Dave that she left out of the trust her IRA money and any other money that she just didn't feel comfortable putting in ya mhm\nLet's look at how much that is if she left about a hundred grand outside the trust\nAnd were four years into this new five year waiting period I'm likely\nTo tell the mother in this case or Dave if the mom's going in the nursing home let's private pay with the money you have outside the trust mhm why it's at risk anyway and if I spend a hundred grand to protect all I don't know\nAnother five hundred thousand of CDs that I put in the trust I'm OK doing that and that will get us past that one more year waiting period that we need to get to\nMhm to protect it all otherwise none of that five hundred thousand is protected so think of it as being pro rated in the sense that yeah I've got four years under my belt even those zero of those dollars is\nProtected yet I'll pay for a year mhm just to protect the balance of the money that's in there so lots of options get the clock running never a bad idea\nYeah and you know what folks ideally you're going to do your planning in advance educate yourself before you start the process so you know what should and should not be in your trust in how these trust operate on a day to day basis\nTodd's guide for the month of October it's gone back in the vault folks that you need to request your copy now which you can do by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or visit our website\nLegal exchange show dot com where you can download our guide you can download our podcast and you can submit your questions for Todd to answer on the air our next question comes from Donna in Newbury port ... writes\nI Am single I have two kids and three grandkids and leaving my assets equally to all five of them\nI haven't ... trust that holds my home should I named my ear evoke about trust as beneficiary of my IRA what are the pros and cons of this\nSo if it's an ear replicable trust I I'm ... I think we need to figure out what size\nOf the IRA meaning what percentage of the IRA makes up ... the trust or makes up the entire state I think with Iraq a couple trusts not replicable rather go as a whole different animal but was irrevocably trusts well\nWith a rubber ... trust you could name\nThe designated beneficiary of the IRA so trust them with a replicable\nTrust I worry a little that the language I have to put in there in the trust to allow the IRA to be a beneficiary\nAnd the way the states are scrutinizing every application for Medicaid and trying to find ways to poke holes into these trust\nThat somehow they may say that the principles available to the tone or because of the language you have to put in for an IRA so as it's not paid out so you could stretch it over the individual's right on the fisheries lifetime\nMy my inclination is\nNot to do it have I done it in the past yes it you know I I think the ups the upside is in this case this person's single\nAnd arguably the IRA money could never get in there until the individual is dead so how could the principal regardless of the language ever make its way back to the don't or 'cause\nShe'd be dead right I agree and I think that arguments there and and it may carry the day but I'm of the mindset that you know what I don't wanna have to cross bridges\nIf I don't otherwise have to write so I'm going to probably go with the answer of not naming the IRA the designated beneficiaries of the euro vocal trust okay vocal trust absolutely can do it if you want okay so if it's ... then\nIs there a downside of doing that in terms of the payout does that change how the ... and\nThat's a great question but again in the air in the ... arena you still have to put language\nIn the document that makes it either a conduit trust or in a shoe mutilation trust in case you want to pay it out over time to the kids and not just dump it in their hands spray so if you're making the accumulation trust or the divorce proof language there you need the accumulation trust language\nYou still are allowed to take out the distributions over the lifetime of the oldest child's life expectancy OK so not a bad trade off it's still going to come out over time\nOver there so there's a big age difference between oldest beneficiary and youngest beneficiary that can be a downsize\nCould be although nowadays they're saying also and you could spend honestly you could spend an eight hour seminar on designated beneficiaries of IRA sons how how complicated they are because of the income tax bite riots there\nNowadays I Believe they're also saying that in the designated beneficiary side of that equation\nOn the IRA you could actually put the trust F. B. O. share you know Billy ... share valley and then I Believe you get around that problem that you just mentioned suicide at the beneficiaries each beneficiaries life expectancy would be honored\nNice folks if you have a question that you would like to ask Todd visit our website legal exchange show dot com and click on the asked Todd tab\nSubmit your question there and maybe we'll be able to read your answer on the air and hopefully his answer will stop you from being one of his next real life stories in the meantime it is your last chance because I'm sad to say the month is over crazy is that is\nYou got to request your copy of Todd's guide for the month of October it's designing an income on the area a book about trust and it will show you all of the important information that must be in your trust him perhaps more importantly\nThe language those troublesome provisions\nThat absolutely must not be in your trust you can call to request you're free copy of Todd's designing your ... trust guide right now the number is eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine [noise]\nThat's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine remember it's your last chance to do so folks you can also\nDownload a copy on our website legal exchange show dot com where you can download your guide you can also download our podcast if you missed any of today's er our past shows\nYou're listening to hide let's get a partner with the law firm of pushing into and I'm Susan Power as a financial advisor with the Armstrong advisory group and we'll be back in just a few minutes on the real life stories of the legal exchange\nYou're a real estate or property management company you need a banking partner that has all the right tools to keep your operation efficient leader bank is one of the premier banks and the property management in real estate space offering a suite of unique\nProducts and cash management services to help you collect rent manage condo association payments and digitized\nPaper checks leader bank utilizes state of the art technology to offer convenient banking services to its real estate quiet such as a C.
