Springfield\nBut the reading on nothing the reason why sergeant shots in in ... you know we are\nThe reason why this has the potential to be really disruptive is twofold number one obviously Saudi Arabia's the biggest oil producer in the world right okay so they they are the biggest in the low cost producer as well\nAnd they can take they they can lower worldwide production by as much as ten percent if they chose if they want it to ... and they could cause prices well how could they cause prices that because there's so much you can see prices double\nKnow that if if they said ... wrote a report said you know we you could see two hundred dollar oil if if Saudi Arabia wanted to sustain oil now they would be inflicting a tremendous amount of pain on themselves if they did that though\nThey would I mean again that when you talk about the economy of Saudi Arabia\nIs oil there on this campaign to try to divert guy and they go forth that they are the they are in an oil economy very Petro state that is what they do [noise]\nUm so the first concern is hey you know if they wanted to they could potentially say look we're gonna pull five six million barrels of oil off the you know off the market right now and potentially spike I don't know if that's necessarily what they ended up doing\nWhy would they do it let's talk about what we ... if if the if there's a conclusion that they murdered this journalist ... ... what what would our response be we say well we're not going to sell you the armaments were Oregon uh\nI don't know it could be you know that three hundred and fifty billion dollar arms deal could be something that's talked about there it could be financial sanctions that could be a whole bunch of different things\nThe reason why this is really important okay and and this is not just looking at a water gas prices going to be over the next twelve months as Saudi Arabia for the last forty years has been the reason why the u._s. dollar has value okay the reason why is because back in Nineteen Seventy three after the Nixon shocked back in Seventy one\nThe U.S went to Saudi Arabian said hey look we want to make a deal where we are going to affect that we have the barrel or have a barrel of oil price in US dollars and that's going to be only way you can trade in Saudi Arabia because they were the world's largest producer one of the world's largest producers\nSaid yeah we we can get on board that it gives us a guaranteed market for a product that gives us stability in the U.S said hey now people need to buy US dollars and that's why the dollar remains the world's reserve currency for the last forty years\nIf Saudi Arabia says gee we see where the puck is going and we see that China's going to all of a sudden be our biggest buyer over the next Twenty years now plus you're saying you want to sanction us for something that we may or may not have done again I I don't know what happened I think it's likely the Saudi Arabia probably did something but here's the thing\nTurkey is not really someone you can trust either on\nWell and we treat like heat we do business with a lot of bad actors but\nHere's like turkey just two years ago ... went and murdered a whole bunch of journalists themselves also in jail the whole bunch of professors in a crackdown themselves so you're sitting there going\nOkay I don't know like ... you're pretty much given me bad a or B ... what what do I choose Russia does the same thing exactly so there's a whole bunch of this now keep in mind the Russian model is this kind of when you look at where he said gee we've sanction them for similar things you know you talk about like the Magnitsky Act and things like that\nDoes the exact kinds of things that this is built to deal with so I I look at this nice they look at the U.S says hey we're going to sanction you or we're going to pull back from this Saudi Arabia might say you know what\nWe're going to move away from pricing oil in dollars we're going to go in and find you know at a different trading partner\nHere isn't it's in between a rock and a hard place isn't it yes he's he's damned if he does any damned if he does\nYes there is no right answer on this ... and that's why no one wants to job of being president like this this this is something that no matter what the price decide is going to have big implications for where things go in the future because if he says look\nSaudi Arabia didn't do anything we're not going to do anything ... hey that pretty much gives them ... you want to go not what gives it gives Saudi Arabia carte blanche to go do whatever they want going\nBut they've been doing it they just have done it much more quietly in the past exactly they China does it does this turkey like not you know they don't make a list of the countries that\nPartake whole bunch of them but like this is just a blatant in your face thing and that's that's the difference I think in this case is for this is one where turkey allegedly has it on videotape ... there's there's all kinds of measures they was nice that you know there's there's\nOne rumor that's going around that was from and and the reason that I stayed and even though it's you know somewhat of a rumor is because it's from bill Browder who was you know very prominent in actually passing the Magnitsky Act um who said look it was actually recorded from his I watch them and like in that you have audio recordings that way so\nWho knows what's going on here but this has the potential to be a huge mess yeah well you can't overstate this\nThe are the issues that you should be concerned about folks is you turn your feet on this weekend most of you are an oil trading at Seventy one dollars a barrel and you know you're going to get a delivery of home heating oil sometime in the next forty five sixty days what are you gonna be paying for it I don't know the answer to that they when we come back we're take a\nTopic that is a little bit later we'll

things that we've seen over the last decade it comes from things like this when the average person the person who is working every day feels that the people who are empowered to make decisions for them don't make decisions that actually give them what they want this is going to cause all kinds of problems\nBut one thing that the unions should be ashamed of and not the ... leadership that the members themselves the drivers the guy's handling the packages they didn't vote they didn't show up to vote no only about half of them voted and that's you know like you have no right to complain about your contractor union when you don't even vote\nAnd that's why they were able to ratify this damn thing because they didn't get enough people who voted\nYeah pretty much that's ... that's really the exact reason why if you go through and take a look\nAt the Teamsters constitution which I didn't know there was one button hey there's Teamsters constitution it quote grants the Teamsters general president the power to implement a contract if less than fifty percent of the members vote on a contract that then requires a two thirds no vote to reject\nIt supposed to be that that's the case only in a final offer\nA but it looks like that's what ended up happening here so even though this contract was a rejected pretty soundly by union membership that actually voted it was not enough to overcome the fact that the president can pretty much go through and say yeah we're going to push this through anyway you know the\nAmazon pays more than UPS\nFor entry level workers in these part time worker so if you're in this thing may end up settling itself just say oh yeah wage pressure to have guys the UPS going to have a tough time hiring people for Thirteen bucks an hour when they can go across the street and make Fifteen at Amazon there were more they'll go to work at an Amazon warehouse\nI I'd be curious to see what you're going to be getting paid this winter into an Amazon warehouse you'll see the ads I I'm going to guess Eighteen to twenty bucks an hour in this region\nWhy do you think management push to ratify this management or men while it in your union management why do you think union management push to ratify\nSpeculation that ... on the take\nI'll tell you what it is like if it doesn't look good it's not it doesn't make a whole lot of sense\nAre you sick of working in finance or retail you might want to consider the biotechnology sector is growing very fast as a matter\nOf growth is about the double here here it is in twenty twelve six point one percent of mass life science companies are left their jobs voluntarily typically with another job in hand according to Radford this unit of global professional services\nUh last year that more than doubled to Thirteen percent so if you work in biotech there's a demand for your services especially if you happen to be a scientist\nYeah and the big thing that you're seeing is in order for these companies to try to retain talent obviously wages are moving up significantly but they're also throwing all kinds of perks people just try to keep them on board anything from gym memberships\nA you know uh you know the cafeterias on site that or you know high quality and this and that child care you know all kinds of things\nThe big thing that people like that work for these biotech companies is the time off I talked to a gal\nAnd she's working at a you know it's a small biotech no money so they don't have the gym memberships and the other what they do is at Christmas the weak Christmas they just shut down\nFor the entire week the whole week now and they're going to do it now for the July Fourth week and it doesn't count towards your time off so you get your four weeks of vacation time plus your personal days or whatever\nUm but you have two weeks it you know in the middle of the year at the end of the year where you get a full vacation week that you don't have to use your vacation that that if you're raising a family so it's a very valuable for\nAnd it it it's one of those things where if if you look at it there's a lot of industries where they can't do that anything customer service face and you can't do that can be financial services there can't do it but for something like this where all you're doing as a whole bunch of research you can coordinate research schedules you you you get you can do that kind of thing so\nIt's it's really interesting that these businesses are kind of pushing the envelope as far as hey you know we can't necessarily pay people more will give you all kinds of different perks or they might still you know offer significant benefits\nA lot of money poured into that sector there as you look at their companies\nYou know there'll be trading at three bucks and then a couple of weeks later they're trading at twenty dollars a share because they got some kind of after all it takes is like some kind of a drug approval of the opposite way too though that's the problem yeah oh they do you you can make a lot of money and um you can lose an awful lot of money and you know speaking of which\nMedicare premiums are going up modestly next year unless you make a lot of money you see the if if you make a lot of money your Medicare premiums are going to be over a thousand bucks a year\nYeah it's it's something where\nUh the the part B premium so which this year have been\nA hundred and thirty four dollars ... ... a month they are going up to a hundred and thirty five fifty so it's oil it's modesty it's a really small increase and I don't know what the reasons for that I don't know if they've been better at cracking down on fraud I don't know if they've found you know better reimbursement rates to keep prices down\nBut that is a really small increase for Medicare premiums and what that means is that people who are getting Social Security bumps meaning everyone who gets that two point eight percent bump on Social Security so what's that work out to about forty bucks a month yeah they're going to be able to keep most of that now\nWhat is being because there there have been so many years were either people have gotten no bump for Social Security or it's been all eaten up by increases in Medicare premiums and this is really good ... again\nYou know let's put it this way though Chuck if you're living on your Social Security you're working as well ... you're not living you can't pay your bills in New England and live on the Senate and earlier eighty or you get New England\nBut there's lots of parts of the country where people live on is their Social Security there's people in New England who do it to you know they're not easy they're not living inside one twenty eight is my guess now they're living in subsidized housing [noise]\nNo you you can live if it work if you're out and you know uh Lancaster or something like that you can you can live cheaply out there you know it's it's just we get so focused on okay here's what things cost in the city there's a whole bunch of people don't live anywhere near city\nSo you get a modest increase in your Medicare part B in a pretty good bump in your Social Security and other bumping Social Security left in the January check\nIt to be a I Believe so yes it's and so they they pretty much tell you right now just so you can plan for it um but that is going to be starting in twenty Nineteen so in January\nAnd just as an added bonus here a sixty five year old American male\nIn two thousand and Eighteen is expected to live another Nineteen point two years I start to see the older you get the more you start focusing in on these that so yeah if a if a sixty five year old has another Nineteen years I figure I must have another twenty twenty five\nOr that means that if you make it to sixty five pretty good chance you're making it to eighty four the\nProblem is binary you either do or you don't when there's no middle ground you know you can't get halfway gets it you either do or you don't you know it's not like oh I get to Seventy five in it you're done then\nThere is it how about women sixty five year old American female in twenty eight teams gets an extra Twenty one point six years\nIn eighty six point six years old and you know what we've seen over the last forty years as this uh outlines here is that life expectancy is particular for those who are older have increased somewhat here a lot of the gains that we've picked up in life expectancy over the twentieth century or primarily due to improved\nA medical care around the first few years of life you know it used to be you know if you go back to late Eighteen hundreds early Nineteen hundreds\nYou had a pretty good chance of dying and your first five years of life you know it was pretty common and that's part of the reason why people at such big families pay they knew a couple of weren't going to make it\nWhat you see now is we're starting to get better at improving quality of life for older folks and so you are seeing longer life expectancy is even if you're already in your fifties sixties and seventies\nWell that ah you know the it's all good news but managing the strain that's going to put on Medicare and Social Security ... which they weren't calculated to live you know when they these programs are designed you're supposed to be dead by the time you're Seventy\nFive most times you were you know it it's just that they're they're not built to last in a world where people retire in their sixties and then a retired for twenty to twenty five years they will nobody talking about fixing them or are there no no one wants to\n... the ah our generation here is really at least ... our our generation is\nJust saying yeah we'll let the millennials handle that one of

buying treasuries okay\nAnd your fear is that they'll buy less going for\nThey already have okay trying to say that ... fourteen foreign buyers have been ... neutral as far as what they've been buying there and so the question then is if you have rates going up meaning that the the the treasury is going to have to pay more on the bonds that are issues at auction\nAid that extra interest is gonna ... into the federal budget which means we have to borrow more or cut other programs for it and so you end up with this crowding out scenario because you don't have foreign buyers to sterilize the U.S debt anymore and you potentially end up with some nasty situations as a result of that\nIt's not something that is guaranteed to happen because hey maybe things get cleared up internationally and all of a sudden China says yep we're happy to buy treasury is again I don't think that's happened you know it doesn't I don't think that's happening China sees an existential threat to being tied to the dollar and they want to move away from it\nYou still love chick fillet\nSet a question to answer that question is I never been we've been over this I don't have any near me a minute drive twenty five miles and go to one you should\nYou should I was your age your life I was looking at every I was looking at chick fillet and I said to myself why would somebody by a McDonald's franchise as opposed to a chick fillet or why would somebody by a subway franchise I guess subway franchise is more expensive to buy\nThan chick fillet franchise you can get ... you can get a chick fillet franchise for like twenty grand but you know what\nThere's twenty thousand apple gifts it's harder than getting into Harvard\nIt's it's unbelievable twenty thousand people apply to buy a chick flick a you know how many they give out\nA little less than a hundred yeah so it's something going on you have a less than half a percent chance of actually being approved to to buy one of these franchise so they're looking for somebody\nThat they can mold and they they also don't sell you you can't say well I Want to buy all the chick fillet franchises in New England for all the trick for what I you know you can buy\nOne on unlike McDonald's which now is looking for people to buy more than one McDonalds if you go on their website and take a look at their franchise got their franchisee guidelines they want people who can by five ten Fifteen twenty they want\nWith obviously you're not operating them great like chick fillet saying yeah we'll let you in the door for twenty grand yep right but you have to be there every day you've got to hire the people you've got to make sure grief the customer like if you own a chick fillet franchise it's not you're not operating it from the sea sweet no on the floor\nThey they want you to be active but one of the key things is when you go through a what they detail that they want one of the biggest things they don't want you have any other active business ventures I Want you to be all in on this franchise\nAnd I'll tell you one of the you know I talk about how good the food is a chick flick ... again I I Love the Chicken Little something about like I Love the chicken\nThis customer service that I have gotten there not only is better than any other fast food restaurant I've seen it rivals some actual you know sit down dining establishment in terms of the overall quality that you get\nYou get managers ... what are we managers walking around picking up trash saying hey can I get you anything do you need ice and that you get people coming up to help you more often than I've ever seen and I think when I talk about you know the chick flick experienced and why I think it's better the food's one thing\nBut customer service is something that's been largely left out of the last Twenty years just about everywhere because it all gets sent\nYou know to think about any customer service ... you've had whether it's with ... whether it's the L whoever it is it's generally not good\nI don't I I'm going to disagree with you there you go to an American restaurant\nAnd you are generally going to get\nPretty good service for I guess we came back when we were in Paris for a week you want to talk about bad service try visiting Paris ... what was bad about it maybe they knew you were American ... maybe it was not about the the the the waiters they they don't get much in the way a tips right so they make you know\nFifteen twenty euros an hour but because\nPeople don't tip for reasons don't tip\n'em they the you get just God awful survey what was that was a slow did they not bring the rate like what we actually we have added on it usually just slow the it wasn't like the a lot of times people say oh the French ... they weren't there are very nice but it was just like\nYou you could go literally twenty minutes with your Empty Plates on your in front of you know I when I'm done when you I Want my plate gone I think part of that just as a cultural different I I was just\nAbout to say that check I think in America everything's fast paced and getting it out and over there it's just way more laid back I\nWant you to spend like two or three hours eating right yeah well I I Would I Would take American service over a European I said I think\nTo today's the day boys by the way I just Google a chick fillet near me in this one and data which I was not aware of a which is right on the way home so you're going to go and I think I might\nBut they they if that answers the question as to why people don't buy ... how much does manager make if you if you buy one of these franchises\nWe're kind of money going to make are we talking a manager of the ... or the ... who will you go out like really you're only paying twenty grand to get the franchise so really what they're doing is they're hiring managers\n[noise] you're you're buying the opportunity to be a manager for France for a chick\nSo I can do some research okay based on what I'm finding initially okay and this is a from someone I found this on line this from someone who is a former marketing director at chick fillet\nUm but it looks like if you talk about the base revenue that you get plus some profit sharing and so forth it looks like the low end is about a hundred thousand a year into the high end is well north of three fifty so my guess is most

thank goodness for Mississippi because it was from Mississippi all the other states would you know have to be embarrassed but Mississippi always has the worst economy in the ... what what state Mississippi Mississippi\nUpset that might not have to go back and I I I\nHave I made a big known to be kind of me\nIn New England is Maine\nI have a good buddy of mine from a Alabama ... who I was talking to him over the weekend he went down to Mississippi or over the Mississippi for a wedding\nAnd he said for everyone who ever makes fun of Alabama have them go to Mississippi and they won't make fun of Alabama and these are his exact words um but yeah so you take a look at these are these numbers here um what what stood out to you most overall in terms of some of these trends\nLike I just look at wages in like in Maine the average weekly wage is eight hundred and ten bucks a week mhm how do you live on eight hundred and ten bucks a week even if your housing is an expensive\nYeah I I think it is again\nIt is different when you're in different parts of the country and you can if you take a look at some of these areas India and I'll just use as an example you know Indiana their wage growth is slowly one point two percent\nUm but it's a really cheap place to live actually like right you can live off of you know twenty five thirty grand a year pretty comfortably and a lot of these ... or low property taxes property taxes are low you're overall expenses are low 'cause a lot of the food is grown relatively close by they don't ship it long distances\nYou know things like that make a big difference there but in terms of the overall economy is that you see here the ... which stands out to me and you talk about this is an awful lot\nIt's education you know you know education makes a big difference you talk in Washington state Colorado\nD.C Utah Texas Massachusetts Virginia Iowa those your top ten and they'll either have really good public universities or really good private universities in them so you know it really does make a big difference there\nWhen it's all said and done but I look at Vermont and New Hampshire a pretty good at it education infrastructure and their economies are good I think part of that is so education I think is a big piece there um but in those cases I think it's just size and scale you know they just can't get to the overall size\n'em in critical mass in those places you know Vermont's got the second smallest population in the country\nUm and and I think that plays in their Florida you've got a good economy\nNever ... growing at two and a half percent yup eleventh best in the country and again you talked about really good education University of Miami one of the best schools in the country you know they've got some obviously state schools are good or state schools are pretty good they've ... they've gotten better they didn't used to be great but they've got to get out of Haitian systems terrible\nBut again on the private side they've got some good private universe\nNo public I'm Talking about your grammar school though like if you live in a in Boca you're not sending your kid to public school\nNo so I I think in general it's its its size and education and kind of are the two pieces that you need in order to kind of get things moving or\nNetflix with the ... what's the problem and Netflix they they laid an egg\nWell they they did in that they didn't grow at the rate that people were expecting that came in with five point five one million new subscribers in second quarter this is what we found back in\nUh when they reported earnings last quarter that was down from seven point for when the previous quarter and below six point two million that they had guided to in April the big thing is Netflix is a growth company okay and when you buy a gross company you're not buying the cash flow that they have the day you're buying the potential cash flow they might have tomorrow you know\nAnd the issue with that is if they miss numbers like this the stock does get punish the stock went from for Nineteen to share in July down to three sixteen in mid August drowned three twenty four share today so it's all about twenty five percent almost twenty five percent from its highest here\nDo you think it has to do with all the competition coming into the space you know Eighteen tease getting
