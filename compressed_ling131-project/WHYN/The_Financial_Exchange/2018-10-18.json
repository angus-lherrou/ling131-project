reasons for that obviously terrorists are going to play a role into that you have a tight labor market where look you could only grow GDP by pulling two lovers when it's all said and done hours worked and how productive you are during those hours if everyone's important everyone's employed full time who wants to be\nHow many more hours you're going to be able to work there's only so many more people that you can actually\nGet into the labor force so that means you've got to pull the productivity lover well we haven't seen productivity gains of any meaningful number and in the last\nDecade that but what about robotics what about like you look at robotics if all of a sudden you've got robotic cars and robotic warehouses we got to have that next year well you're you're the cars are coming this year\nRight around the earth day in any meaningful number we got two hundred Ninety million ... we have two hundred and Ninety million ... of human driven cars on the road today and how many self driving ones are we going to have ten thousand twenty or you know it's like so that there simply aren't the productivity gains to be had\nSo what is it the the ... the neutral rate they like this is the part I don't understand I read the fed minutes and ... says and this is a quote from Jay Powell yep we're a long way from neutral at this point\nProbably I mean talk that that leads me to believe they don't really know what we're neutral third knitting they don't know we're neutral as\nThe other thing that you have to remember what the fed as much as they are a policy institution saying hey here's what we're going to do and here's what we're going to execute\nIn the last decade really the last two decades they've become a messaging institution\nIt doesn't give you confidence so when you hear the chairman of the fed saying\nYou know we uh we we kind of think we're a long way from neutral but we don't really know for sure I mean ... what what is it like we are investors want to know I thought they are rates go to four percent are they going to three percent are they going to two and a half\nWhen when I look at what Jay Powell was doing here and again you have to look at this from a messaging perspective what is he trying to signal yeah he's trying to signal that we are not going to let inflation get out of control because once it does get out of control it's really hard to put that genie back in the bottle\nIt's a lot easier for him to be hawkish and go to dovish ... than the other way around thinking about it if you start off dovish right and then you say hey by the way we got to hike rates really quickly ... what happens to the housing market what happens to the stock market okay it's a lot easier to be hawkish and go to dovish\nThan the other way so from my perspective yeah I think he's saying look\nWe're going to be as aggressive as we need to be in order to tamp down on inflation but I think if you get into next year I I I think that you end up in a situation where the economy's not strong enough for it to warrant higher rates I think the feds between two really difficult you know options here so you're looking at two more hikes that's it\nYou're looking at one in December me personally I'm looking at two more hikes and then I think the fed let's inflation run hot because they're ... I don't think you can get to the point where this economy can sustain four percent interest rate so hike in December\nAnd then one sometime in the first half of next year for ... and I think that's it that's it right because I I think they realize they have to inflation run hot they just don't want a message it\nWell the you you may be right I you know many of you are buying a lottery tickets in anticipation of winning the mega millions a we have an office pools going I Wonder how many people who haven't have you I think everybody's in it we got everyone in your head so what are we got like twenty people it's like we get a couple of hundred bucks in there I think\n... winter odds not a\nGood [laughter] good [laughter] I'm going with Tucker [laughter] well let's look at\nThe uh the the the answers to questions that you might have if you were to win the mega millions a ... ... if you when it's a nine hundred million right [noise]\nThat's what it is currently it might go up by tomorrow based on how many people were buying tickets originally tomorrow is going to be eight hundred and thirty six million\nBut nine hundred million is the annuity amount sets like thirty million a year for Thirty years or something like that\nExactly and if I Want to lump sum so the lump sum is significantly smaller okay if you take a look at the cash option right now it's five hundred and Thirteen million if you ... I'll take the lump sum [laughter]\nNow do you think oh I'm Sorry I don't care what it all now a couple of things stuck or to keep in mind okay the first is even with that you're not going to get that entire five hundred and Thirteen million dollars because they require you to withhold a big chunk up front so that Uncle Sam doesn't end up getting caught behind the eight ball when you spend it all on a yeah yeah I only four percent right off the top\nSo they're going to take that right off the top okay which isn't enough because the tax rates thirty five okay yeah it's gonna end up being significantly higher\nBut the other thing you want to keep in mind Tucker so you get five hundred million dollars after taxes you're going to end up with college somewhere around three fifty\nOkay oh shucks I I'm\nNot okay keep in mind you can't keep your name secret [noise] the doctors had read hard I don't like okay so everyone who's ever met you okay Jimmy and grades including hey do you either way I guess I'd have to change my name is Lou including Barry ... if you'd have to change you'd have to go in to witness protection alright ...\nThere's only six states where you can keep your name secret Delaware Kansas Maryland North Dakota Ohio and South Carolina I'm so there's not a whole lot of anonymity at this point\nLet me ask you a question of Chuck in all seriousness let's say you when the nine hundred million\nAnd I know everybody takes the lump sum but that means you're subjecting that lump sum to a five percent tax in the state in which you live right assuming you live in Massachusetts not if you live in New Hampshire but if you're a Connecticut resident Massachusetts resident\nYou're paying five and moved to new ... New Hampshire before tomorrow way you can't that's the whole problem you've you've won that ticket so no victories Morrow\nI'll be ... yeah well oh yeah I'm going to do that just pick up and go right across the board if you take the new the option that you could move to Florida or New Hampshire and then have those taxed at a lower rate in those states over time yeah normally I Would tell I was talking to Jim pleaded this morning as you were talking about whether we're going to take the lump sum or not and should always take the lump sum please tell ya\nYou know you're really forty percent right off the top Tucker so you know that number you gave five hundred and Thirteen movies really like so\nHow much would you get paid a year if you didn't take the lump sum it was thirty nine Thirty years or thirty million bucks a year which in the end you'd end up with how much uh you'd end up with somewhere around twenty million a year but you don't have like I Want to let it OK so five hundred you get twenty million a year when you get it out so\nDown wouldn't have to pay the state income tax 'cause then you could move to a non tax state okay that that was the mayor went to the early on them you know if you want to move um how long do you have to clean the jackpot so let's assume Lee when and how much time do we have before we have to claim it\nDepends on the specific state but it's anywhere from a hundred and eighty days to a year so the big thing that they always tell people look if if you do win the lottery isn't it if if for whatever reason you end up winning this thing which odds are you're not going to but if you end up winning this thing\nBefore you go and claim it mhm take some time to figure out who you're going to work with to get everything in order because the second you claim this thing you\nEvery attorney every financial advisor every person out there is going to want to work with you ... you want to find the people who don't want to work with you now the people who say I'm not really sure like you want people who are you know okay you know get your money in about two weeks or I'm Sorry you want people who are going to want to work with you know before you have the money\nA year to get paid in about two weeks with ... like from friday you say okay you just friday night you're going to know\nYeah the way it's it's it's a it's within a couple of weeks so before you actually go and claimed this and you want to have all the legal work done that you need you want to have a brokerage accounts that you know you want to have all those things in order to have a place because otherwise everyone in their mothers out saying hey we want to work with you you want the person who already wanted to work with you before you had five hundred million dollars\nOr well our poll question today is are you buying a mega millions lottery ticket I I'm raising my hand I already put my ten bucks and uh that's my limits and we haven't done this in years what is the first thing that you're gonna buy you a chocolate private jet a\nPromise to get to really good Turkey's for Thanksgiving this year biker [laughter]\nAnyway um that's our poll crushed you go to

can call them eight seven seven six nine one seven nine zero zero for more\nInformation if you know any truckers they're not happy about the E. L. D. law it's a law that\nBasically limits the amount of time they're allowed to spend behind the wheel or you know one would think that a trucker would be happy if they wouldn't be allowed to work and drive more than eleven hours during the course of the day\nBut the problem is they spent so much of their time stopped and at a warehouse or picking something up that they are limited in terms of how much money they can be made because truckers I don't think people notice truckers often times are working by the mile not the hour\nYeah they're they're they're paid by the mileage that they do not by the hour and a lot of cases here and so because of these time limits if they're sitting there waiting or if they've got a fourteen hour block where they can only drive eleven hours you know hey if\nFive of those hours you chewed up by a just sitting waiting for delivery guys they have to load the truck you know they can only drive nine of those hours actually so it's you know that's how it ends up working\nUm and so the the big thing is that you know they ended up showing up a lot of the time that they could spend working now are just waiting for deliveries instead\nOf the problem they have now is in the old days it was a paper journal and they just the if you got if you saw and we also right you'd see a state trooper pulling over a trucker and they might look at their journals or they'd pull into the truck stop and they and they look at the journal skiff was paper and the truckers could fudge those those records\nWill to E. L. D. those or electronic and it measures whether the motor running or not and you can't fudge that\nKnow and and pretty much these logging devices were mandated as of December twenty Seventeen so what I'm curious to see\nIn the years before if you take a look at the ... and really the reason that they're they're doing this is to try to make driving safe right now there's not just for the truckers but you know if a truck hits\nOr your car your cars that take the ball into the ... year that you're you're done okay and so in twenty sixteen as an example forty four hundred and forty large trucks and buses were involved in fatal crashes what I'm curious about is whether there's a statistically significant difference now that this law is in place here\nIf we see we don't know for five years no it'll probably take two or three years to be able to tell but look\nI'll tell you what if that number goes from forty four hundred down to Fifteen hundred and ... pretty clear ... even though you might not have all the conclusive data you need it might be a really strong sign that things are moving there if you go from forty four hundred and forty two hundred\nYeah you're probably a need for five years of data in order to figure out if there's something statistically significant that's actually going on here\nThe whole theory behind the law was that the truckers retired and they were having accidents because they're driving too much and they're exhausted ... right that that that's the whole genesis all ultimately it should increase wages\nRight 'cause you're you're you've got your fewer truckers that are available to work even fewer hours one would think that these guys and gals would start making more money it is still not that there's not be are they are ... well\nI was there was the highest rate of pay increases that if any industry\nI understand but it's still not where it should be you don't know about half of what it was in the seventh so it\nIt it still is well below where it should be the downside to hire truckers pay is that with how much we buy online today is going to drastically affect shipping costs and that's part of the reason why you're seeing the post office looking for ten percent hikes now just about everything that they're trying to mail these days well an Amazon raise their prices by what twenty percent to be a prime member yep\nWhere they went up ... it's all going to filter through you know they only pay more which\nAgain these are people who should have been paid more to begin with I don't have a problem with it but that's what the reality is known to be\nFolks in terms of uh are we going on this\nMachine that you had your life I had I had it out of order I didn't know what I Know I had it out of order here so I guess we'll do it now and folks over twenty percent of Americans have saved nothing for their retirement can you imagine that if you're sixty five and you haven't saved a nickel\nHopefully none of you listening today are in that boat but what ever you've saved for retirement I looked to help you devise a strategy\nThat will allow you to uh to enjoy your later years and the new guy that's out this month will help you weren't strategies to help manage your portfolio and protected but when it's time for you to retire your assets can be there to work for you retirees have to worry about a lot of different things\nWill your money last can cover your expenses\nAnd if you don't know the answers to these questions you can call right now at eight hundred three nine three four zero zero one and request to copy of this brand new guide\nOver two hundred and sixty years later with a little resource\nIngenuity and\nWe're not only capturing energy from the sun\nEnsuring Americans have the energy they need [noise] whenever that\nEight hundred six six seven Nineteen twenty five reveals use traffic and winter season news radio fighting W.

know weekly stock picking segment you the founder and author of bull's eye brief\nIdeas for thoughtful investors Adam good to have you on today Oh thanks for having me as always\nAm I Want to talk a little bit on rates urine and specifically we got a you know some some minutes notes from the fed yesterday and it it seems like there's a very hawkish tone there my personal view\nIs I don't actually think the fed is hawkish as they are presenting I think it's just easier to go from hawkish to dovish down the road than the opposite what's your take on the situation yeah I think you're right\nAnd I think it's also important to look at what they're actually thing and you know kind of funny they're the guys out there who read the fed minute and create all kinds of the chart based on the word that you know up here and the word strong worth some variation of drawing like strongly are stronger strongest whatever anyway\nUh some variation on the word strong has appeared like thirty times in all of the minute since April as opposed to a year ago when you saw you know from version of strong only like you know three or four so clearly the fed is saying you know things are getting better their quote unquote getting stronger but\nUm you know it it at this point with GDP at it for ... percent and inflation will only you know in the two you know to point to two or three percent\nI'm actually a really good combination though it you know strong is not something the worried about right\nIn terms of oil a oils been focused this week with uh the murder of the Washington Post journalist uh who were not sure exactly what happens but it happened but it doesn't ... really good\nThere's been a lot of talk as to whether or not the U.S is going to take a a retaliatory response in response to Saudi Arabia here\nBut the oil market not really suggesting that that's going to happen with west Texas intermediate below Seventy dollars a barrel after being above Seventy five last week\nIt merely suggesting especially when you hear the rhetoric coming out of D.C he doesn't sound like there's going to be much of a response here\nAgreed and by the way thank you for mentioning that you know because it's so when you look at the headlines and jump on Twitter and and you know we just get carried away with the emotional thing whatever happened there we don't really know what ever happened is crazy\nBut um what mattered more than anything else is the relationship between\nSaudi Arabia and the U.S you know Israel and Saudi Arabia or the strongest allies the U.S has in that region and let me tell you we need them in spite of the craziness whatever the Saudis which clearly is pretty shocking world the fact that oil\nIs under Seventy bucks tell you that the market is dried there's going to be a breakdown in the relationship because if there were it'd be a lot higher than that in fact in Saudi Arabia the U.S and Russia\nAre all competing more than eleven million barrels a day we have never seen that before though there is a lot of oil out there and I'm Glad to see that the reality of the by the band was covered in oil right now not emotion behind the crazy situation however went down\nAnd have a question for your relating to a growth in twenty Nineteen ... you chat it a little bit about you know word for point two percent of GDP right now I'm curious where do you think things are going in Nineteen just 'cause I Will get the message out there and it does have any concerns about a slowing specifically\nLook with regards the long term GDP Growth there's two lovers you can pull how many hours do people work in the aggregate what kind of productivity they have I don't see movement happening rapidly enough next year to get us back to three percent I'm curious what your thoughts are on it\n[noise] it's gonna be hard to squeeze more productivity out of people I mean you already have unemployment at what point seven percent of the year low yeah people are working hard you know our early\nAh the number of hours that are worth per week now that's tracked by the deal is you know that that's pretty strong it's hard to take it too\nMuch higher than where you are now so I I hear you on the point about productivity um the good news is well there are a couple of pieces and you know me I'm an optimist but um there is technology now that he's touching absolutely every single\nBit I mean every target has become one of the you know target the store right has become one of the biggest abusers of artificial intelligence a I I mean they record how mannequins are dressed in position around the store on Monday versus two day and that impacts sales veterans so\nIt's technology that's able to you know keep driving these additional games you know I mean think about what's happening in your Instagram feed now where you know if you were on the Patagonia website you saw those baggy short\nYou know where to cool down Beth\nI'm last Saturday well all of a sudden out there that there's a a one click buy this now\nAdd that appears in your Instagram feed and all of a sudden you tap on it right so there were these there's these things that are happening because the technology that I think are are enabling businesses to be more productive consumers to be more active um and as long as the people are employed and they're spending money\nThat's going to drive again so um yes but here you completely on squeezing the productivity thing but I think technology is actually pushing the goalpost farther down the field\nOr good ad and we've got to run but thanks for

Springfield\nTrump has been briefed by his secretary of state's I'm Dave Anthony Fox News\nA boatload right you know but I think in general a they pay out maybe quarter of what they really don't know I ... I don't know probably depends on the game and you know whether their state lotteries versus these national ones and things like that I I don't know\nKnow bart is buying a cancer drug maker called an does site for two point one billion dollars in cash why would they do that yes there\nAnd they're buying this company a for again that to point one billion dollar a price tag new year and you know pretty much Novartis if if you take a look at you know what they're trying to do here\nUm it's ... they're trying to buy effectively drug pipeline specifically related to oncology that's way under state really specializes in I have no idea at all this is a good price or fair price for the company but the big things Novartis isn't growing much organically at this point right there sales growth was you know three percent for the quarter\nA there you know earnings growth was two percent for the quarter so they're relatively stable company right now and I think to be completely honest or going out there saying hey we want to try to buy growth for the future\nThat's always a lot of them do the right they they ... they buy these little small\n... is the right now it's one of the main ways but a lot of these companies build their pipelines and grow at this point I'm just because it it gives them away so they don't have to do the early stage investing they can say OK here's where the risk is right\nLeaving early stage there's risk even if some of these I mean we've seen cases where you know drugs get you know company a buyer you know another company that's been stage to her stage three of you know if the approval\nAnd the thing flops on its face and they got it right the whole thing off I mean there are there still is that potential out there there's definitely less risk if you're going in to this to the stage of company but there still is a lot out there just because\nAgain you you never quite know what's going to actually end up paying off I mean think about all the old timers trials that have been out there for the last couple of years where you've had come like Mark said look we're just we're giving up on it 'cause we can't do any like\nYeah there are so much all farmers is one where they there's been a lot of false starts there\nIt it it's it's like fusion power we are always ten years away from a cure that it's just you're always ten years away it feels like\nHey a Tesla advancing in China buying land for a factory that they think they'll actually own\nYes they bought a two hundred and ten acres site in a ... just outside Shanghai cost them about a hundred and forty million dollars to buy this um which I Will get this is my first question to be honest was okay so they bought the land for under forty million bigger factory they built in Nevada cost them was three billion dollars I think\nWe're going to get the money to build this thing well\nYou know I Wonder if you know as much as if the Chinese government's investing well and and this is where I was going so you on most 'cause obviously not a fan of the SEC the short seller enrichment commission as he called them a couple of weeks ago which probably didn't do any favors\nI Wonder if he ends up getting kind of pushed into China's orbit on this and do we really want to lose a guy like that\nWill tell you what kind of depends what you mean by a guy like\nThat pretty bright guy ... it'd be like you know you think about all the innovation that he's brought whether you're talking about pay Powell a space sex he space sexism yep I'm you know test of whether you like the guy or not he pretty smart guy either you really want to chase them into the arms of the Chinese\nAre really smart guy there's no doubt about it but I Would make the case you kind of chased him self their ... you know it's not like based on behavior yeah we ... it it's always on doing that you know so I I just wonder if he starts ended up working closer to that orbit but to be honest I don't know if you'd really get along well in China I don't know that you know like I\nLike I said he's going to have five hundred thousand cars a year there I don't know\nIf he doesn't like the oversight from the SEC yeah you think he's going to like Chinese oversight\nRight in Chinese oversight is come over here we're going to put a bullet in\nYour head so it's it's it's something I I just don't know if he is necessarily a good fit over but he might find themselves kind of pushed into that orbit\nYeah well it's a ... we will watch that story or with continued interest\nA question comes up what happens if you convert a rental property into a personal resin let's say you say you bought a property in Florida and do you live in New England you bought a property in Florida\nYou bought it five years ago you bought a ten years ago and you rented it out so you've been renting it out collecting the income on it and now you're retiring Chuck you want to move into that ... property in Florida get a CPA yeah get yet\nSo in the way that it typically works remember you can declare a property as a primary residence if you've lived there for two out of five years and being able to do that\nAllows you to offset up to five hundred thousand dollars and capital gains if you're married two hundred and fifty thousand if you are single that's the exemption you get if you're able to satisfy that requirement it's a little different when you have a rental property\nIn that if you've been depreciating that rental property there's going to be some recapture of that depreciation that you've taken and that\nThat's what I wanted to point out on this story when you do that you can do it you can convert a rental property into a personal residents you can get the five hundred thousand dollar tax free game but you can never escape that depreciation recapture you're always going to pay the taxes on that\nSo if you owned it for ten years and you wrote off two hundred thousand dollars in depreciation yeah\nEven if you're within that five hundred thousand kept gain tax free cap game you're still going to pay the tax on that two hundred thousand of depreciation\nThat you know it's really important to make sure that you have any attacks advisors will get that that just because otherwise it's going to be a situation where I I've seen cases where people don't realize that the case and all of a sudden the IRS is you know send them a letter not only are there going gee I thought I got this exemption you got the exemption on the sales price but you have to factor in that depreciation recapture\nComing up we're going to be joined by Steve Moore asked Steve some questions as it relates to wages and worker shortages that his next on the financial exchange\nNews is going to mean break
