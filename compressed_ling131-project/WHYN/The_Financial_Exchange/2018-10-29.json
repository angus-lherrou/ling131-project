I think it Sunday yes it's connect dot com slash tour by the way for the tickets and the details on we're going to be ...\nIt's going to be fun there's a lot of election stuff to talk about ... ah ah stuff yeah they were given gift from the gods as far as the serial goes the the ... turned completely insane so it makes a comedy fairly easy\nIs that it does and a Pittsburgh we've got something special for you there were going to have laughs and\nAnd comedy but uh also uh I Am a taking all of the proceeds\nFrom the I'm from the event and um we're giving them to\nI'm not sure if we're going to give them to the synagogue or to or to\nThe uh the refugee I'm now a group I'm not sure we're going to give them to yet but we're we're\nUh we're we're standing with uh Israel um and uh so the proceeds to your tickets or will be going um to a a local\nJewish um center perhaps the synagogue but I'm not sure and I sense from an anti Semite like why would you do that when you hate Jews so much um I noticed he went back and forth at a little issue with a reporter from GQ this weekend oh did I ah Julia something or other said\nThat she was a she's a little upset about this and basically blamed anyone who's ever can a criticized I think it was George Soros meadow\nOr and I remember and you came back to this is you know completely ridiculous like it's nothing to do with that like we you know\nAnd then she posted here's an example of ... supporting the Jewish people and posted a clip of one of your criticism of one Jewish person George Soros or as as an example of how much you hate the Jews\nNow I did respond because I found an example of you are supporting the Jewish people as well when you want the defender of Israel aboard a that was shot by somebody national award what are the highest um ... most prestigious awards for someone defending the Jewish people cry but beyond that uh it was just\nIt was just presented by the the prime minister of Israel though\nBob that's it [laughter] okay that's not a big one that out of bed [laughter] not a big one so it's just amazing you know 'cause this is not just a criticism of you and it's not just this one dopey reporters all over the place and this idea that if you criticized George Soros\nThat you are an anti Semite is completely insane if you are a conservative\nAnd the people in this audience I Would leave all would fall into this category many of them would criticize door source but they criticize him because he's a liberal as progressive policies he supports\nA policy that we disagree with so we're criticizing him around him to be dangerous all around the world around the world he has a very shady history or around the world that but\nAnti Semite hate George Soros too we in some ways there are things in common there however they don't like him because he's a Jew the same way they don't like been Shapiro because you're in front of a hero\n[laughter] reporting the policies you know like I don't understand racism I mean you can get to know people in hate them for a valid reason [laughter] you know like Karl Marx I don't like Karl Marx he was Jewish I don't like him not because he was a Jew no but because he came up with the idea of communism\nI'm not a fan no not a fan of fat\nAnd the ... like you're in these liberals have never criticized Ben Shapiro before is that because they're anti Semite which because they don't like within Shapiro said they will love what ... they would love Ben Shapiro if he was a liberal and they don't like him because he's conservative is this\nDistinction difficult for people can you really not understand I mean we all know than on no\nIt's not all under state it they're just trying to use this to make it look like conservatives are anti Semite\nWe you're telling me the way the uh you know Sheldon Adelson right here's a guy who is one of the biggest financier the Republican Party have you ever seen a word of criticism for liberals about him of course you have does that make them anti Semitic\n... it does not it does not you can criticize just like when they criticize Clarence Thomas are they racist\nNo they don't like Clarence Thomas is legal opinion because they don't support what they believe\nIt's not about it it is it you try to make these into cartoon arguments ... is such a\nA ... ... this is another example of horrible discourse yes they complain about how bad Donald Trump has made the discourse you're calling everyone who's criticizing the main liberal or progressive funder in America\nYou're calling everyone who does that an anti Semite how that possibly in the realm of positive discourse it's completely a disingenuous and they know it is they know it's not true and they go on television and they say anyway in this time in the middle of a tragedy they say\nIt anyway 'cause they don't care\nThat that that is exactly what they they they claim to be again and they do it every day wow\nI didn't hear solution

I I look at this and in theory you've got to give her at least to the end of that just because you know that's where you're going to potentially see what happens there but\nI mean you will get all the deals of decide that have happened this size that have happened in tech they generally\nDon't work out what um when when you look at this deal the thirty four billion dollar price tag 'em do way if you're a shareholder in red hat and you say why don't want to take the hundred and Ninety dollars you don't really have any choice do\nWhy would you not want to take the one Ninety you know just say you think it's worth\nI don't know two ten or something you want to but all you can really do is vote against you have to take the cash maybe there's a reason you don't want to do it yeah you have no chance your your your your that cat that deal that money's going to show up in your brokerage account whether you want to know how long does it take a deal like this because I saw in\n... let's say I owned a thousand shares of red hat right\nAnd it's going to close is it\nIs it'd be year end is it to one as a cue to some of these deals take a long time in it and some of them get need government approval\n... what they're guiding to on this is that is going to take somewhere between six and nine months for this deal to actually close so it's not a tax issue for this you know it is likely going to end up being somewhere I Would guess and the second quarter early third quarter next year is where you see this close so late spring early summer is is kind of what you're seeing a for when this causes but\nI'll tell you if if I get this one wrong ...\nThey're not out of business because companies that big don't go out of business but they're going to be in a case where they're digging out for the next decade\nYou know you know what I said to my son I said this sounds like a G E type deal\nThis is something ... would have done I was not an HP okay yeah that may be a better you met maybe a better comparison because of the the tech\nA relationship but we'll see you know it's easy to a to point fingers and cast aspersions we're not in the boardroom we don't have access to the financials we're just looking at I just said holy smokes you're paying a hundred and Ninety bucks for a company that on friday closed at one eleventh\nThis this is one of those deals and and here's the other thing is you look at this and you look at kind of when they're doing this it really brings similarly to that AOL Time Warner merger you know peek value weight like it just it has all the feeling of like something that just isn't going to work and you\nKinda wonder does red hat end up on top with this deal does this become a red hat culture company because redhead you will get red had success and revenue growth and share price appreciation I mean they're they're one heck of a company\nThere still and here's the thing so red had they do about that last year they did about two point nine billion dollars in revenue IBM did you know Ninety five billion so IBM is still you know far and away the biggest piece why understand but you look at growth well here's the thing though is in order to justify this multiple\nThey don't have to grow just you know what they've been they gotta grow through the roof and I just\nIt's a really tough pot the spin\nOn the path of uh IBM is that this will access them to grow the categories and there'll be able to you know really improve their sales I you know I I got to tell you I think Jenny is too old to be running this company or disagree with that tech companies I think tech companies and the young CEOs\nI disagree with that now you know I mean we'll get Tim Cook Tim Cook is you know not a spring chicken these I think going to be fifty eight or fifty nine you know in the next you know you're a good example you know so like I don't think you have to be in your thirties and forties gifts\nYou know well not if any of our yeah but still he was older when he was no no he wasn't he he was a kid he started that when he was at Harvard time\n[noise] but ... I I Will get you know some of the some of the again\nYou know I don't know if you need to be in your thirties and forties but you just need to be good and Janine ... just not appeared to be able to turn the corner for the last five years we've been hearing oh we're going to be a cloud companies to be a cloud company and then they went out and bought a cloud company you know it's just it's an admission of failure\nThere are plenty of networks that have you know said okay we'll put you on suspension for a few weeks or hey we'll just get the limelight and then we'll bring you back you know for ratings were good which is why she's gone you can't say what she said but that doesn't change the fact that her ratings were bad to begin with and I think NBC wanted to move on anyways\nI Wonder if you do you think they paid her out fully or it was like well how would a competition do work\nSo it depends on what's going to happen in terms of what she wants to do afterwards ... if she doesn't want to work right now if she just says look I'm just not going to do it they're going to end up paying her out over time because she was trying to get out from under that contract if she says look I Wonder if they\nCouldn't they say well you made a bad comment you broke\nA note that was generally know generally for something like that you know it's not something where for something that happens on air like that see I don't they're not going to be able to get out of the question is if making Kelly wants to go back to work\nThen she's going to have to go to NBC and say look I Need you to release me from that three year contract yeah and that's where they could said we're hey we're not going to pay you out or anything else at this\nI don't know if she's going back to work because she had previously been a wrecked by creative artist agency and that was her her agent\nUh she fired them or they fired her we don't know she went to United talent agency and they fired her saying that they couldn't make calls on her behalf so I think ... I Wonder if she untouchable that my my pressure when you get fired by your talent agent\nDoesn't that mean that you you're toxic and they I mean the fact\nTalented the only way they make money is if they can get you a new contract\nYou're untouchable until you're not okay and and what I mean by that\nYou remember about a year ago when all of the army to stuff with breaking on a Harvey Weinstein

those little mini bars and ... did you or you can really start that were given those way to lose their Twenty one says I'm going to buy mine today\nAnd I think I might just go with the M. and m's they're the most popular by the way I got a way to avoid getting aid\nI got an a to a to forty packs of these and we ended up coming out at just twelve and a half cents per a candy unit I guess so do you do the variety pack I Do the variety pack yeah yeah and a hundred ... units a was eighty eighty what are you get that many trick or treaters\nNo idea it's gonna be a first year after treating it

story you know you go back to two thousand the average home transaction you used to hold your home for about four years I'm Talking across the country\nYou know you you buy a house or your first kind of how long did you and that\nUh bought it in July of Thirteen sold in July of Seventeen so the four years yeah that was the average\n... going back in time now people are holding their homes a lot longer twice as long yeah the average of the eight point two three years according to analysis from Adam data solutions\nOr they have data going back to two thousand and pretty much as as you mentioned from two thousand through kind of ... ... people on on average was hey every four years kind of moving on whether that was you know because they were moving up to a different whole whether it was because they were moving to a different part of the country that was the average that you saw\nThe average is you know again pretty consistently increase now up to that eight and a quarter years um and there's a couple of reasons for this\nReminding murderer is now on the ... radio as to when the fog\nIt's time well spent WHYY in\n... getting to know what the news that now you do and I catch up on what's going on and coming up at the top of the hour news radio by Donald wage why in\nSay on\nTop of breaking financial news by becoming a member of berries brigade log onto financial exchange showdown income and sign up today\nLenders on stock on friday took the pretty good hit ... was it didn't down to ten percent\nOr in that ballpark I Can't remember exactly what it was but somewhere went from about Eighteen hundred a shared down to you know the low sixteen about eight nine percent\nDown again today you have one percent of it you and I looked at their numbers I said the grow it like twenty nine percent how how can you be so critical for the company that's grown at twenty nine percent\nIt's ... it's concern on margins in certain areas there that they had margins that held up in parts of their business but you know not the whole thing and and the problem is if your margin start to show signs of weakness\nYou know the the very small profitability that they have becomes threatened than in particular on the cloud side of things you know that's that's the question that I think they're facing is\nYou know the cloud side of their business is facing some competition not a ton at this point they're ganging up on them that's relatively stable but the the big retailers on the retail side that's where you're seeing pricing pressure because targets being competitive Wal Mart's being more competitive\nWhat's not only that ... the the workers are saying hey man you want me to show up and work at a warehouse which is a tough job right you you by any standard working you if you work at a an Amazon warehouses your walk or walking\nEight to ten miles a shift I think the last time I read something is like the the workers are really putting in a lot of physical effort yeah you've got to pay me and\nThey're demanding a lot more than minimum wage whereas five years ago and is on those things are sweatshops they treated their workers terror I I I'm not sure they treat their workers any better today but there is at least pain than better\nWell and you got costs going up for shipping and I mean it's it's you have costs going up and it's unclear if Amazon can continue to pass on higher cost to their end users and the problem there is that you know if\nThey still are so convenient to use do you like like I must confess\nIf I just need something quick like say a battery charger or\nTrying to think what I needed chocolate yesterday um and so\nI went you can buy the audience chocolate I you can buy well you know the big limits chocolate bar assure you can buy twelve of those for thirty bucks on a good deal I don't know where he does not apply um I I I'm not sure if it's a good deal but I you know you it's hard to find write the Ninety percent chocolate\nThat's hard to find all it is I don't know\nAll the stores are sold out because I buy something maybe that um but that that's it's so convenient you know ... well they've become the market\nKnows that they have an look they're not going anywhere anytime soon again like we're talking about this with a company that's still growing you know almost thirty percent year over year so the rumors of their demise are greatly exaggerated\nBut having said that ... there are some cracks that are appearing where you say gee if they can't raise prices what was once profitable might suddenly turn unprofitable just because the margins are so stand on the retail side to begin with health and if they get more competition coming on the cloud side caught sides world Providence\nYou know it's funny you mentioned this because I don't know if you remember Tucker but John Mooney said this about six months ago John Mooney said look Amazon's a great company\nBut he didn't own stock and he said the reason I don't own the stock is I Can't figure out what it's worth you know like a you just it was impossible for John to put a valuation on Amazon stock he just said\nLook I have no doubt that they're going to be a juggernaut company and might be a great company to work for and provide a great service that keep down inflation all that stuff all that that you know that's all good yeah but he said trying to figure out the stock price\nHe said you have to figure they're going to grow at thirty percent a year for Thirty years in order to estimate that stop\nIn ... in the big thing is that where we've come to know is ... a year later than that because I sold a bunch of my Amazon stock of about eight or nine months yeah I remember and I I've gotten back in in the last week so you know it's good that we're talking about this year\nAnd the reason why is simply there's a clear a path now to the valuation that they have oh compared to where it was a year ago 'cause we've seen again you're thirty percent growth is big so yeah you sit there and you say\nGee there's a chunk of risk that's off the table now there's still a whole lot that's left okay but you sit there and he said look this is a company that's gonna be doing you know two hundred billion dollars in revenue they're trading four times revenue now it's a much clearer path then you know eight months ago when they were trading six times revenue and you're sitting there going\nBut they're trying to ... revenue in a business with low to negative margins right they got some stuff they lose they still lose money\nI mean it's it's estimated that on the retail side of their business there it depends on the corner but they're anywhere between one in five percent margins in general that's where they they tend to live is right on that edge there and the big thing is the cloud side and on their cloud computing business\nYou know they're still in that thirty to forty percent range and a lot of different category\nBut all the companies that they compete with are coming in and saying hey we're coming at ya right you've got IBM Microsoft\nYou got a lot of the ... area well we you know what the heat and even if they just hit him on the edges on the margins right if Microsoft deals from business with them from them if H. P. oracle like it just seems like everybody's got their ... their ... or Amazon in their target sites\nIt doesn't matter until it does but when it does it matter\nBig the Dow is up two hundred and

really interesting to me is to kind of look at where we've come from in kind of this ... in in dealing with the the problem of aging mhm 'cause this is kind of a new issue in on two fronts number one you have people living longer okay so that means that they\nYou know a greater percentage of people are going to run into something that doesn't kill them mhm but requires them to have care you know used to be if you go back to you know the forties fifties and sixties\nYou didn't have a ton of people that needed this level of care because most of the time\nWhat ever happened to them usually they were dying anyways you know they didn't have this level or the disability and they didn't live for ten years in that state no it's it's the medical advances have gotten to the point where we can keep people alive now but we don't really have a system or a way to take care of them easily\nAnd the problem I think is compounded by the fact that in today's world\nIn so many families both spouses have to work in order to make ends meet and so you end up in a situation where you know family member can't be that person carrying and a lot of case\nWhat about assisted living facilities 'cause that's a that's an alternative they you know I'm going through this with family members now where you know they're they're selling their house\nRight and they're buying a unit in assisted living now that costs depending on where you are but that's about four or five hundred thousand dollars but if you have equity in your home if you own your home outright you can afford that\nBut then you're looking at the the cost for this couple is six thousand three hundred dollars a month I really question how many retirees can afford six thousand three hundred dollars a month every month you not not that many ... they may know families don't have that much in gross income\nNo and and and it's in in particular what you're going to see is you know so many people in ... really it's it's generation X and kind of the beginning part of the millennial generation are going to be in situations where they're having to care for parents now but also still having kids in their teens and a lot of cases\nSo what are you guys gonna do are you going to like have your folks move in with you are you going to pay the assisted living facility yourself ... like I I mean I'm not I'm not joking about this this is a serious issue that millennials are going to have to take care of no way the boomers we're going to be you know we're we're going to be the ones that need taking care of\nNo idea I I have no idea how to deal with\nIt really no easy solution is there no it's if you wear how ... what do you do put them in a warehouse ... you've\nGot two options you have care for them yourself you know or spend money so someone else care some like either way like there's no easy way to deal with\nIt because the nursing homes are closing ... we've seen a wave of nursing home closures because they're saying hey the government regulations and this is you know it's\nIt's a it's a fascinating topic and I'm not an expert on it but you look at the reason nursing homes are closing we you close your business because you're not making any money right\nRight and and the government says well you must have this many nurses you must have this many doctors you must have this type of\nCare well the government regulation is driving up the cost\nAnd I understand the logic behind it right it it's kinda like daycare you get a lot of government regulation involved in daycare because a kid dies well same thing in a nursing home a senior citizen dies and the government feels the need to say well you must have this type of care available you must adhere to these regulations and then eventually these nursing home say\nThey they wave the white flag they just say look we're done I talked to a ... we have a client who who are used to run a health care facility and he said very you know you you have no idea what kind of merging compression we've experienced in the last twenty\nYears on in in in looking at this overall don't get me wrong ... these are good problems to have because the the you know flip side of this is look if people just you know pass away than like you don't have to deal with this problem but no one wants that you don't want your loved ones that just passed away it's OK we need to figure out how to care for him so it's\nIt's a good problem but there's no easy answers because of how we've built a boat the system right now that cares for people as they age\nAnd the fact that many families they can't take enough time off to care for these ... to care for a folks who need it you know in their families it's we're we're just not built in today's society to deal with these problems in that risk is going to be present whether or not we build systems to fix this or not [noise]\nAn interesting topic that would require much more time and research we can solve isn't ten minutes\nNo no no I don't

mind bring something back you know got to be the right country\nWell you've got to be going to like if you're going to South America you can make a lot of money if you're going to Europe you could make a lot of money on this in\nPretty much the way that you know shoppers try to avoid you know customs um it's not something I mean I think part of it is you know there's obviously legal ways to do this they are very illegal ways and they're certainly not trying to find the illegal ones as far as hey how'd you know they kind of lawyer they kind of are well they're trying to ...\nYeah they're trying to skirt the customs duties so I'll give you an example uh you want to buy an iPhone in Paris it's going to be I don't know let's say four hundred dollars more to buy in Paris than it is in the United states yeah so what you do is you buy that brand new iPhone in New York or wherever you live\nYou take it out of the package and you make it look like it's used even though it isn't it's a brand new product and then you transport it to Europe and the person who hired you and Europe says okay here's your two hundred euros or whatever you agree on compensation and you hand over the phone\nSo how is the state not shut down then ah the government's not on the ... like that that's how it works I mean uh uh the I I read the whole story I mean that it and there's this isn't the only one but some of the countries like if you look at Argentina Brazil oh yeah ... huge tariff on an American technology\nThat they do and and so you know some of these and again when you're in some of these countries I think those are the situations where a lot of people turn to this not so much hey you know between more developed countries that are better image and so\nForth right it's not

Seventeen think about it struck it couldn't have been more than five years ago when they just took started selling more cars have passed us it looks like it was twenty eleventh about seven years ago actually is when they passed us but if you want to see a fascinating one\nTwo thousand eight they sold six point seven million vehicles in China mhm two years later it was Thirteen point seven they doubled sales in two years\nSince I Wonder though how viable that is long term ... based on the density of their population you know automobile travel I think we're learning that in the United states is in our major cities are clogged because of cars\nLong term if if the solution out of this is a combination of city designed a new building cities that are going to get around by foot a mass transit and and you know alternative a means of you know personal transportation like bikes and scooters and stuff\nThat's that's how you get rid of traffic otherwise about car pooling that doesn't do enough now does it's\nIt's just so when you talk about traffic to thing that's fascinating about it is it's really it's it's a geometry project ... if you are an individual that's driving in a car okay average us cars about Eighteen feet long it's about six feet wide so if you look at it it's about you know a hundred and ten square feet is how much space you take up when you're in a car and a hundred and ten\nEven if you ... you get for people in there you're still like twenty seven twenty eight square feet per person\nWhich is why when he talked about bikes and scooters and walking you're down to you know you could go you know four feet in either direction or you down to Fifteen or sixteen square feet buses the best we're down to well pretty much you know eight to nine square feet per person and that's where you want to get too so it's it's really a geometry problem and cars are just not sufficient\nYou need to be careful about Medicare part B why if you miss the age cut off which is sixty five by the way folks\nYou get penalized in a big way for having missed out on that Medicare a premium the way it works is\nYou you have basically six months before he turned sixty five you have to enroll in Medicare part B if you miss it and some people do you've got hundreds of thousands of Americans who have missed the cut off yep and are paying a penalty as a consequence\nYeah and it's something that again if you are you know kind of getting towards that points uh you need to make sure that your your cognizant of this simply because right now\nUm if you're signing up for part B cost a hundred and thirty four month right now it's going up to one thirty five fifty [laughter] um and so\nYou know you do need to make sure that you're signing up if you end up with that penalty okay for each year that you delay\nMedicare as a permanent ten percent penalty to your premium so few Mitt tried to imagine why somebody wouldn't sign it sixty five\nI think in a lot of cases it might be ignorance okay just they in I'm not saying that like in a derogatory way I'm just saying they don't know you only retire once you don't know it's not like something that you do every year and so you just might say gee I'd I don't\nKnow what I had a job though I don't say I'm working for IBM or in and I'm sixty six years old and I have benefits through there I don't pay the penalty then you", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "city": "Springfield", "day": "29"}
