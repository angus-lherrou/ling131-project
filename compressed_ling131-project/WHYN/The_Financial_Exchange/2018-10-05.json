A. dot com\nMass national license number one zero one eight three\nWe're joined now by ... from ... uh talking to us about the financial impact of you and I'll be playoff series I we got the red Sox at home tonight against the Yankees are we were just taking a look at tickets by the way it looks like you can still get tickets for about a hundred bucks a and then going up from there but uh\nYou know Brad we had you on I think back in\nTalking to us about the impact of the super bowl a and it seemed like it was pretty muted in terms of ah you know most cities saying hey we're going to be throwing parties at home and you know restaurant sales not really seeing much of an increase how does that compare to playoff series in the end they'll be\nSure a it's a very different actually we see a pretty significant increase in a number of business categories but just to kind of recap how we do to a wobbly we\nCarry transaction dated for millions of small businesses that powers the software that are small businesses used but it also gives us an interesting look into all these patterns that are going on in local market in different states around transactions between\nConsumers and small businesses in the city so for example we can look at last year's performance or four different business categories\nIn towns where I'm a ... where there is a major league team in the playoffs in the what the impact is what we did is our data science team normalize\nOr what the average day for revenue looked like in the three months prior to the playoffs and then compared\nThe timeframe during the playoffs against that average and what we found was that there was a pretty significant change across the board so ah just looking at a a game day versus non game day on game days all these categories that we analyze thought thirty two percent increase in sales\nOn non game date you and they thought twenty five percent increase\nAnd then home in a way there wasn't a huge difference on a across the businesses that we analyzed and the difference that ... that were in the last last year was thirty two percent versus\nOr whether they were home our way but there are some like ... different as we look at when you look at specific markets like Boston or New York I'm On those different dimension\nBread can you talk a little bit about those a specific differences there\nSo let's take Boston for example so ah there is a major difference in the home versus away average there so again I mentioned that the home or if you look at just when the team is home how to restaurants and bars and lounges lodging businesses and transportation businesses fair\nI'm On average a across all of a city that thirty two percent increase its Seventy six percent increase in Boston and\nWhen there are when the team to the way you still use the uh a bump in those businesses though it's sixty seven percent in Boston and then again looking at the difference between a game day when the red Sox are playing versus the day when they're not playing during playoff season\nUm there's seven point spread\nIn that game day versus non gained day across all cities but in Boston it's much larger it's almost a twenty five percent though Seventy two percent with on game day forty six percent lift on non game day so in general\nPeople are responding to the fact that the team is in the playoffs and actually getting out of the house and spending money with these businesses on on a much higher level than ... other city\nLeaders looking at these ... metro areas as a whole or do you even get you know kind of neighborhood specific in this data\nSo it is difficult to get really specific because the sample sizes becomes smaller tens of thousands of businesses across all of these cities obviously we want to maintain a high bar or\nA you know the the repeat ability of the data so and the money that we're finding so in some cases there may be a like a code that has a high concentration of businesses but for this purpose we really just looked at this on a high level we all got to constrain the against\nYou know are these businesses that are are trained acting daily making sure that it's not you know sort of a business that's open all the you know two or three days a week that kind of thing\n[noise] very good bread we've got to run but thanks for joining us today thank you guy\nIt's ... from ... talking about the financial impact of the major league baseball playoffs are on the news that the teams are in we've only got about ten seconds left\nSo let's talk a little bit about those playoffs he got mad at soccer Yankees who Red Sox\nOkay we've got the red Sox Mike oh come on like this isn't even a reasonable who who you got the Sox got\nSocks and five [noise]\nI'm going socks and five as

you can have get all these trade issues behind us figure out ways to get infrastructure don't gets more people into the workforce\nIn the short term that's how you keep this party going for the next two three years that's that's the ... so there's a path there it's tough okay 'cause I don't see the issue with China going away anytime soon but I don't see us coming up with any ... any kind of big infrastructure plan\nThat actually can get through Congress anytime soon so\nThe bookcase I think it's a it's tougher to stretch that out more than twelve to Eighteen months I think we still have at least another year or two to three quarters of the minimum left here\nBefore this thing starts to get a little bit dicey but look I'll be honest if you continue to see wage growth like this that's going to stretch this thing out even more just because the concern is look if you don't have wage growth how to people spend they can only borrow so much if you have wage growth that question goes away\nYeah I was gonna say the barricades here you know it might not be great for the stock market you know as you see a slowdown in earnings that might not be Griffith stock market but it's probably not that bad of a case for the average American worker because I don't think unemployment is about to shoot up and I don't think that wage growth is about to stagnate\nDepends what causes it you know if it if it's caused by just a shortage of workers and things like that\nYeah you can you can figure that out eventually if these trade issues blow up and continue to get worse then then you've got some concerns because they've got suppliers and when you have supplies shoes you got prices going up not because you don't have\nA demand for stuff you have no problems actually getting stuff to people and it's you know we've gone through that with oil shortage is back in the seventies ... we've we've talked about those kinds of stuff before\nIt's not pretty if you see that so all this does bring us to our poll question\nIt does in our poll question of the day is up right now it's up on financial exchange show dot com you can go over there and vote in our poll question is have you received more than a three percent raise in the last year we say this or we ask that simply because we were talking about wage growth now we're finally seeing it\nThe early results thirty two percent of our listeners have received more than a third or more to me this three percent raised over the last year sixty eight percent of listeners received less than\nA three per cent raise and by the way we want to know so a respond to the poll but if you are someone that has or has not received\nA a raise in the last few years or the last year Texas Texas at six three five six six and tell us what industry the working man we're we're looking for some trends year I don't think we've quite seen any real big trends in terms of what industries are seeing real big wage increases in real small
