our podcast and you can submit your questions were taught to answer on the air well\nSusan we have yet another a power or or another arbitration agreement case out of Alabama\nActually went all the way up to the Alabama Supreme Court\nSo it started out with a I guess the state of Bobby gene Hicks sues\nThe nursing home for wrongful death mhm of course you know the facts the nursing home moves the court for arbitration saying wait a minute the daughter Rhonda stuffing signed the the uh on the date of admissions signed\nA arbitration agreement stating that\nIf anything happens in terms of negligence or a case like wrongful death or something that the at applicant to the nursing home has waived their right to a jury trial and you must go to arbitration to settle any such case\nThat's what an arbitration agreement does and that's apparently what Rhonda stuffing signed as the daughter when mom a gene Hicks went into er Bobby gene headaches went into the or a nursing home\nWell the original ... was\nWe're gonna go head to enforce the arbitration agreement well the Alabama Supreme Court\nReversed the lower court's order\nBecause the applicant when they came into the nursing home locked capacity in other words did not have the ability to give up parent authority or to a actual or a parent's authority to the daughter\nTo sign the arbitration agreement\nShe was incapacitated so she couldn't even grant the authority or early if she wanted to she was in the past to end\nThe facts of the case go on to say that\nThe daughter did not have any health care proxy or any power of attorney or in existence and really had no because of that had no legal authority at all they did in the daughter to sign an arbitration agreement effectively bind\nThe applicants to waive their right to a jury trial mhm\nI Would think that the nursing home would ask for a copy of your signing and someone's health care proxy or their power of attorney that they would actually asked for the backup document\nWhether they did or they didn't in this case they didn't exist\nRight well that's what I mean if you ask for it like I can I can ...\nSo what happened was she did she signed personally right and no one really thought it through about an individual signing personally\nAre you able to sign on behalf of someone else like if I have no legal documents for you Susan I Can't just go round signing your name I have no authority to do it whether it's apparent authority or Britain authority\nThere for my signatures is useless and that's really what happens here and so folks I think it's very important when you have a loved one or that you're admitting to a nursing home\nBeing mindful of all of the documents that are going to be put in front of you and make sure you don't sign if you are signing personally you don't sign anything that says you are personally responsible right that's the last thing you want to sign because then you could end up getting drawn in for the financial obligation of\nThe nursing home bill she didn't want that\nAnd you know what folks signing those forms of punted mittens is only part of it 'cause here we're talking about arbitration and wrongful death and neglect\nBut you need to protect your assets in advance them going in to the nursing home make sure you had your plan in place and make sure it's drafted properly Todd's written a guide for

short topic I received a copy of the power of attorney recently from a client that included both\nFor Linda it looks like she hasn't done any planning so we will create the trust now and we will put this house in it and we can set it up this way from the get go the language and the trust which say upon my death I Divide in allocate everything equally to the children\nHowever with regard to the property located at X Y Z street mhm that needs to be held in trust for the benefit of my son put the name and\nAnd the language in there should go on to say that my son can continue to live there the rest of his life but to put some teeth in it that says provided he pays all of the bills real estate taxes up jeep maintenance et cetera\nWhy because one there may be no money in the trust\nTo do that right and then what the house gets sold or by the real estate tax people put a lean on the house and force the sale you don't know ... right so you need money to maintain the least he can do is maintain it\nPlus the rest of the assets might have been divided equally to the kids and maybe you wanted them paid out so maybe the daughter got her piece mhm and the son got his peace well then use that money son to pay the bills\nAnd you'd be looking at an ear evoke will trust in this case because we want to make sure that houses there for the sun so they got to protect that\nThat's exactly right planning that would be done here would be an irrevocably trust so that the nursing home can't take it in case Linda\nFalls into one before she passes remember we still want to protect Linda ... it's all about Linda first and then the children but this would give you that ability to do that so and if and if she if he doesn't pay all the bills than the house can be sold\nAnd the money simply amongst the children so we've got just inherited the daughter\nInland and if you are any folks listening are interested in finding out how these very vocal tries to operate on a day to day basis great place to start is with education and Todd's guide that he's written\nFor the month of October it's designing ... trust this guy will show you exactly how they operate it will also include information about the drafting of your trust and information that\nAbsolutely must be in there and all those problematic clauses that absolutely must not be included in your trust you can call right now do it

on our website legal exchange show dot com\nTodd our last question comes from bill in ... burn math and bill writes my wife has MS and has very little assets in her own name years ago when she was first diagnosed I transferred the home\nOut of her name and put it in just mining my question is about my IRA that's worth around eight hundred thousand should I changed my primary beneficiary to my kids just in case I die before her she would like the likely have to live in a nursing home if I pass away before\nThis is a very interesting question and and it reminds me of some other real life stories and and you know the the idea of planning\nThrough short cuts is not always good planning or trying to do it in a you know a quick manner or some kind of a cheaper approach\nI I don't I don't think it always has the best and so when I look at this and I say OK I understand that my my wife has MS we don't know from this what stages she's putting the house and your name now really doesn't do anything\nYou could put the house and your name last minute if she goes in the nursing home putting it in your name now I guess of I'm not even sure why you would do it it doesn't help\nAt all because you can always do it last minute right and again I Would imagine that since she has MS that you guys would at least have powers of attorney in place now so that you could start signing her name and paying bills and transferring real estate in case she does go into a facility but more importantly\nThe fact that you've got and that that that your wife has MS should be saying never mind my house and my other non IRA money what should I Do\nWith forget the IRA from it all that other stuff\nYou're doing planning yeah not just sticking a house and your name what about your investment account that you didn't mention in here that might have you know five hundred thousand it let's take these assets and do\nRegular planning as if she didn't have MS mhm 'cause you know how long I messed takes ... can be a long time and there's lots of treatment and so we don't know so why not set up your state plan put as much as you can knock the Ira\nInto these Iraq as a couple of trust and learn how your life won't be affected learn how you can live in the property manage the money pay your bills live off the income sell the house mhm none of these things change when you put\nIt into the vocal trust but now you have a five year waiting period running\nThe clock starting you got to do it this is a big life event red flag\nHere and not just for the wife mhm but it's running for the husband remember just because one has MS doesn't mean the other couldn't have a stroke and end up paralyzed so the important thing is to get the clock running for both of you not try to plan just for her\nAnd what do you do with the IRA in this case if he assuming he does his his trust planning what would you do with the IRA\nSo the IRA you know you can't put it in a trust you can't do advanced planning because it'd be a huge income tax\nObviously it's going to stay in his name in between now and the time anybody goes to the nursing home\nThey will live off of it mhm I Will tell them ignore your other money for now live off the Ira that's money that's at risk spend it down over time\nSo that when the time comes and you need nursing home care we can do last minute planning with it via an annuity mhm and have smaller tax problems when we do that okay when we go to buy the annuity or liquidate the IRA whether or not I would change the beneficiary to the kids\nI suspect it's probably not a bad idea\nAlthough I'm not entirely sure if you die first and your spouse is living that that still may be considered a disqualifying transfer ... why because perhaps you could have gotten it and you didn't\nI'm not sure but I think at the end of the day doing that if you're worried\nAbout it going to hurt who might be in a nursing home at least it can't hurt\nFolks if you have a question like
