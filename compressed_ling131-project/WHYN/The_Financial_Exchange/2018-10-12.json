good luck from Youth Radio\nWHYY end of Fox\nNews alerts and American pastor detained in Turkey for two years set free I'm Dave Anthony and it was after Andrew Brunson was convicted of the trial\nIt can be resolved if Jay Powell or someone else who knows plugged in with the Federal Reserve comes out and says hey here's what we've been talking about and I know that you were concerned about Jay's comments from a couple of weeks ago but here's what's actually going on so I think in the short term you can kind of put that genie back in the bottle\nIn real good in the long run though\nI think the reason why you are seeing a sell off in treasuries over the last couple of weeks\nI don't think those reasons are going away and those rooms are the the rising inflation that does appear to be percolating not so much in the U.S at the moment but internationally which eventually it's going to feed into the U.S\nAnd also the fact that along with that you've got these emerging economies that are slowing down significantly and that's going to have an impact on the U.S with how tied in all of these supply chains are and how tied in the world economy is now so those things aren't going away and those are things that are going to be concerns heading into Nineteen\nBut I think that the fed can mitigate it in the short term just by saying\nHey we said this but here's what we actually met\nShirt can we do a little bit of interest rates one on one and why this all matters because it's not\nIt's not so intuitive it's not like oh banks went out of business and so the stock market's crashing when interest rates go up specifically the ten year treasury that is what you consider to be your risk free rate and so here is how I you know tend to explain it to folks which is\nAs investors were making decisions every day we're saying if you're investing in the stock market you're saying I Believe that the stock market is going and going to go up and it's going to go up more than their risk free rate that I can get on my money which\nThese days with a ten year treasury it's about three point two percent so you're saying hey I think that's stocks over the long term are going to beat out my risk free rate on treasuries\nAs that number gets higher it's tougher to justify\nSo why do you the you know the thirty five year old who is still working and saying yeah I don't care about the short term long term I'm sure it'll I'd beat out the risk ... says yeah still invest in stocks\nWell the Seventy five year old might be a little bit differently and they might be saying yeah you know there's the stock market has been pretty good to me but I can now go get a CD at my bag paying two and a half percent and that's good enough\nAnd so you've got that going on in also interest rates also change the pricing on other assets as well in that let's say that you are\nTucker and you are in the market for a home right now and you've been looking at homes over the course there's somebody said gee\nThe thirty year a mortgage rate right now I can get a mortgage at four and a half percent which means I can buy a home worth X number of dollars will if interest rates go up by half a percent effectively cuts you're buying power by five percent so with the way the math works let's say that you were originally looking at properties in the two hundred thousand dollar ...\nAnd all of a sudden rates go up by half a percent now you're kept out at a hundred and Ninety thousand it doesn't mean that your monthly payments going to be more about one Ninety versus two hundred but it doesn't mean if you're selling a home\nThe pool of buyers that you have might not be able to afford the way you were originally priced your homes home prices and other asset prices start to fall as a result of that so the concern then is one of the major ways that we grow our economy is through consumer spending largely financed by borrowing\nIf we can't borrow as much we can't grow the economy as much as right that's pretty much what we're looking at their so\nSorry for being a little bit technical and breaking things down to almost a dumb down version folks but it helps sometimes to get some context around why things seemed to be falling apart and falling apart so quickly\nThe other minor impact that may have been a factor this week that hasn't been talked about a lot is we're right in that in between stage where the quarter has ended\nA companies haven't yet reported earning ... so most of them don't do stock buybacks during that period of time and I don't know how big that impact is\nBut if all the companies that are out there that have been buying back their stock put a pause on that for a few weeks because they're potentially you know insider information problems\nThat can lead to a little bit of you know access ah down selling in that period of time does that worry\nYou in the long term if that's the case years in a short term impact so I look at it actually the opposite way it let's say that the market is being kept afloat largely by buybacks and ... and I'm I'm not saying it is but let's say the hypothesized that the market was being kept afloat by buybacks okay\nWell when the economy turns down companies stopped buying backstop which means that you're going to see a steep herself so it's something that concerns me from that perspective and that you know everyone always points to buybacks and says hey this buybacks grave it's gonna keep the company afloat\nBut what if the circumstances changed so that the company can't make the buyback anymore\nI agree with you I just don't think that that is what is actually you know floating up the stock market is I think it's just a small piece of things that might have added a little bit of extra volatility on the downside this week\nBut I just I always look at it people say yeah this buyback we'll put a floor on the stock and go what if the ... you know driving like you're assuming that the buyback is going to still be there\nAre some news coming out of China yesterday a China posting a record trade surplus with the U.S in September largely before or the latest round of tariffs went in and really more than anything else I think the signals that a lot of companies were trying to really you know speed up delivery of goods from China to get in before the\n... yeah I mean it was an attempt by a lot of companies that were buying steel that were buying chip processors to skirt around the terrorists before they went into place I\nI Would be much more interested to see what the surplus looks like next quarter\nYeah ... I think the next couple of months are going to be pretty instructive as far as paid we kind of go back to a baseline or\nDo we uh do we now have a new lower number\nThat we are going to see in terms of Chinese exports going into the U.S let's take a break right now and when we come back we're going to be joined by miles oh the one from Yahoo Finance here to get a market update on where things are going as we continue through friday that's right after this break on the financial exchange radio network\nSex gay were buried to six three five six six and let us know what you think of other stories we discuss your tuned to the financial exchange radio network\nMany of you listening today are most likely nearing retirement age and if you haven't thought deeply about planning for your retirement type ... has a message for you that will help you through the process many of you who are listening to talk on for years um illegal exchange radio program know that he's an expert an elder law in a state claiming\nSo if you're just starting or into the retirement process you're going to one your trust documents to be prepared properly so does your assets are protected from a nursing home\nIt takes five years to secure the protection and you need to make sure that you aren't wasting your time and your money on legal documents that don't work\nThis month taught has written a brand new guy called ... income only irrevocably trust that contains the specific language but must be included and more importantly language that must be avoided and your trust in order to protect your assets from a nursing home is yours for free by calling eight six six eight forty five six nine nine eight six six eight forty five six ...\nAnd used to author is a gambling problem for more information go to camp dash and nine died or the bucks ... weeknight starting at seven on news radio five sixty WHYY end thirties offered\nThrough security is America ink member ...

at all of their locations cult leader banking eight seven seven six nine one seven nine zero zero for more information so prior to that break\nWe were talking about the fact that postage rates going up on everything especially in particular or the parcels select service the Amazon uses for delivery so this does take us to our poll question of the day up right now it financial exchange show dot com should postage rates for Amazon\nGo up more than other customers so you can go over to financial exchange show dot com and vote on that if you want to text us your opinion as well just because I like to hear the reasoning behind it sometimes text us at six three five six six and let us know why\nAmazon should or should not pay more or less than other\nCustomers so again question isn't should Amazon Pay more because I think there's a lot of agreement that that the rates probably should go up for Amazon it's whether they should pay more than the other customers for the sand you know as a product\nExactly got a by the way so this uh this hike on postage rates would take the first class stamp for fifty cents up to fifty five cents\nOr just as a a an interesting little tidbit you go back to Nineteen Ninety One which is the first year that I remember posted traits they were twenty nine cents then glad about thirty thousand dollars worth of a forever stamps back then exactly right you don't want the ... was introduced I don't think it was either oh three or ... or it was somewhere in that ballpark\nUm we do have some tax on the post office anyways uh from nine seven eight the post office do a good deal overseas people pay much more for first class whether that is one hundred percent accurate\nFrom for one three privatize the post office\nI'm I don't know\nI I just I don't know if that actually saves any money big problem is the post office has had the last few years trying to get ahead on there a pension payments rather than than losing money just on their service actual you could\nPrivatize the post office you're just wouldn't have easy access to postage in rural areas anymore which is kind of the big problem right I mean and that's that's kind of been the big issue in the big cost is you know some remote town in Alaska needs to have a post office and that's really expensive [noise] what\nDo we talk a little bit about the ah the gas line explosions from a late last month that occurred in the Lawrence area causing all those explosions and fires or the NTSB is that with their preliminary report and it does not particularly good for Columbia\nGas it doesn't look particularly good for Columbia gas but honestly this report to me leave so many questions unanswered and effectively what the investigation found was that some work that was being done on a pipe\nFrom the early Nineteen hundreds or they were supposed to the contract and you're supposed to relocate in underground pressure censor from this band pipe and that didn't happen the big question mark that\nIs out there is was this the ... the fault of\nThe contractor that was doing the work was at Columbia gas prop Columbia gases fall because they didn't explain how the project is supposed to be done and how did was there no checks and balances here to make sure that you know something this severe didn't get followed up on a we have a lot more questions to be answered here\nYes so pretty much what you ended up with which is what I originally you know kind of thought was you at high pressure lines that ended up connected the low pressure systems which eventually they do but you're supposed to have monitoring in place so that they don't over pressurized and that monitoring was not present in\nSo occasionally the justice system works as you wanted to uh in this world a lot of times it doesn't but occasionally it gets things exactly right do the two of you remember ah the ah the fire festival from last\nYear yes the uh if if you're not familiar with it burning man no ah\nFire festival fire being spelled F. Y. R. E. this was the one that was supposed to be on a remote island in the Bahamas that was supposed to be a really exclusive festival and it costs like thousands of dollars to get there and he was supposed to have like a private cabana and they were the food was supposed to be professionally catered and it turned out that they had like\n... houses and literally cheese sandwiches [laughter] they they just did not plan to sing at all I remember the so it it it turned out that the guy running at this guy William McFarland\nPretty much made the entire thing up and had no idea how to put any of this on a and so he sold a\nEffectively he to fraud and investors of twenty six million dollars twenty ... twenty six million dollars and so this morning or he has put guilty and is sentenced to six years in jail as a result of a wire\nFraud and bank fraud that's a long time I only did was rip off a bunch of millionaires or so of the charge that actually got him in this case\nUm was she wrote a check using the name and account number of one of his employees without authorization man that we do it will get you just about every time I asked to do it I Would imagine he's not actually going to serve all six years that imagines probably in for two to four\nUm but you know obviously this is one of those cases where it does appear the justice has been served here in this case what I mean he's twenty six years old but just the dummy move it it's not good and\nI don't know if people ended up getting any money back who actually tried to go [laughter] so under the radar yesterday\nA there was a fairly big bill that was signed by the president uh with regards to music copyright uh in giving or just a little bit more protection or as we continue to make deeper inroads into the streaming age as that becomes the primary way that people access\nMusic what can you tell us about this Mike\nSo there are a number of just strange loopholes that are being closed here a there's you know small random things but it seems that I'm for streams songs that were created before Nineteen Seventy two artist weren't receiving royalties out those aged ... which is just very you know just random and strange so that's been cleared up\nThere's also it seems like it's also lowering the\nBarriers to entry for somebody knew to get into the streaming game because it allows you immediate access to an entire library of songs or rather than having to go to studio studio or so it basically could say you know\nMore competitors could jump into this a lot easier than the apple ... that are already out\nThere and I think the big thing here is\nIt eliminates some of the middlemen who may have been able to get in and previously take a cut of this without actually doing anything this allows the artist interface directly with\nAh the publishers here so that you don't necessarily have a middle man that setting prices and so forth so I have long been someone who has said that a lot of musicians in the stream model under compensated and under protected\nThis is not a perfect bill that signed but it gives them a whole bunch of benefits that they didn't have previously and you have all kinds of artist who have come out in favor of this bill this is a pretty big one\n... it's important to the report on because it's one of\nI don't know maybe two bills that I can think of in the last few years that saw wide bipartisan support so that means that it was you know pretty just needed to be done\nYou know this is a bill that had been introduced I think back in April so it took about six months or to to get to the point where it was passed it was passed by the way when we talk about bipartisan support\nFour hundred and Fifteen to zero in the house and unanimously in the Senate so again this is not something where you had people on opposite sides that was pretty much hate this is something that needs to get done here\nIt's somewhat encouraging that you know they're still something that we can all agree on\nThe uh the funny thing that you have here on this um is the original sponsor of the bill a is Senator Orrin hatch\nUm and the the idea of Orrin Hatch being the savior of music is a little bit funny you like it just it's not the person that you would expect I Would more expect him to be you know the bad guy from footloose it it's not who you just comes through on this one uh in knock this one out of the park so\nReally good news for artist you and again this bill originally sponsored\nBy Bob good a lot in the house and Orrin Hatch\nIn the Senate or in getting through a with unanimous support in both houses here BMW is going to be buying out a majority stake in their Chinese a division previously they only on twenty five percent of the joint venture they held over in China is going to be helping that Seventy five percent\nYeah and this is all just based on the laws that were in place and are now changing in China's a BMW it sounds like it was only allowed to own a twenty five percent venture in their\nChinese division and based on the new rules that were going to play some twenty twenty two they're allowed to acquire the majority stake of this joint venture now they still need to have a partnership with the Chinese entity up but there are allowed to own more of it you're going to see more of this\nSo it's a I guess and encouraging changing some Chinese policy but it's still to me doesn't change the core of the issue which is if you want to do business in China you must partner with a Chinese company so that they can effectively you know a skilled trade secrets and at least have access to them\nAnd to give you an idea of how big this is what this does mean for BMW they've sold five hundred and sixty thousand cars in China last year\nWhich is more than the United states in Germany combined yeah so this is a big market for the now I anticipate it's going to get bigger as you continue to see more people in China reaching those upper middle class levels\nSo all the time we have on this hour of the financial exchange but don't worry we've got a whole lot more coming up in just a little bit [laughter]\n\nGod I'm you'll be from them when he Carlos why not give it their money cows and experience out ten term in that area and\nAt much they make her way to account for two weekends October fun buffet of all no favorite German bands of plenty

is so what would happen is if the market false ten percent it's going to hit all of its circuit breakers pauses trading it could then fall in additional ten percent hit its breakers again and then continue to fall to get to twenty two\nWhen does it closed for the day isn't there a circuit breaker that kicks\nIn Iran now I I Know there might be now there's there's which to be honest I don't think there should be but just because it didn't do any now it doesn't um but I I you might be right on that I I Can't remember the specifics there just because we haven't seemed triggered um if you go back to October twenty eighth Nineteen twenty not again\nOctober kind of a trend here okay kicked off really be the great depression or with the wall street crash kicking off on the twenty eighth twelve point eight to ... percent so that would be somewhere in the ballpark\nOf around twenty eight hundred points right now and you continue down the list you know it would be we're talking thousands of points here if we saw five hundred yesterday we saw eight hundred the day before\nNot a whole lot of fun even if you combine those two days into one which doesn't make sense because they're two separate days it still doesn't even get into your ... your twenty worst days in doubt Jones history\nIt's the problems we love talking about the points to the points on the doubt it's irrelevant the percentages on these things that really are a relevant factor here and yeah I mean you know a couple of percent has nothing to sneeze at but it's not a hugely significant amount\nOr the ... the a circuit breakers by the way if you're a you see a seven percent decline that has a Fifteen minute hold\nA Thirteen percent decline is another Fifteen minute halt and if you see a twenty percent declined to any time during the day trading ... for the remainder of the trading day so not really that possible to have a twenty percent plus market decline these days\nWant to talk about volatility by the way we look at what happened in October of twenty nine okay\nAnd twenty eight on October twenty eighth of Nineteen twenty nine\nMarkets felt Thirteen percent the next day you sit there and they say oh gee maybe we'll get a relief rally nope down in additional twelve percent okay so you're pretty much down twenty percent in those two days the following day on the thirtieth\nBounces back up twelve percent okay and then five or six days later on the six of November back down in additional ten percent so like you you talk about what we're seeing now I get it it's uncomfortable if don't comfortable for every one\nThis is all happened before and it's all been way worse ship so\nTake heart in that but hey we've gotten through things that are worse will get through this we will okay\nLet's talk about some good news for Social Security recipients getting a to point eight percent boost or the Social Security administration announcing yesterday based on the average benefit people receive it's going to be about forty dollars more a month in Americans pocket\nAnd the really good and so the last time we talked about this uh was last year and there was a pretty big Social Security boost last year to the problem was it got eaten up by everyone is Medicare premiums that does not appear to be happening this time Medicare costs are expected to stay in check this year a\nPart B coverage which covers doctor visits other types about patient care is expected to increase between a dollar fifty and hundred thirty five which is an ex credibly wide range but they're not no I went down to one thirty five right yeah ... that's not a range oh sorry it's like one thirty four right now I got it yeah\nI'm poorly written growing up uh fifty ... buck fifty to one thirty five exactly so it's not a huge inflation in the health care costs are surprisingly this year so you're going to really see most of that increase in Social Security which is a nice surprise\nYeah and so again you know for I I Know that sometimes we look at forty dollars and say gee what's that mean for someone for the people who are living just on Social Security which again it's a lot of people I think it's close to forty percent of people\nLive only off their Social Security benefit once they're retired so it's a big chunk of the population\nThat forty dollars a month is real money you know it is something significant okay and so it's it shouldn't be pooh poohed I Know people say oh gee it's only two point eight percent\nForty dollars a month is real money to a lot of people hear it you know if the difference between being able to pay in some cases\nFor you know certain prescriptions that you may have the ability to you know around the holidays go out and buy a present for a niece and nephew a grand center a granddaughter is someone like that\nSo it's important to see this it's been really tough the last few years when we take a look at Social Security or the Cole is the cost of living adjustment\nIs what they call it um effectively\nIt really has not been significant in recent years the last time that we saw an adjustment this big was two thousand eleven and the only times we've always seen it twice in the last decade north of two point eight percent other than that it's been all two percent or below\nSo this is big for the for a lot of folks who are living on a fixed income because I Know that\nYou know we look at the inflation numbers that are out there and say oh gee you know inflation's pretty tame\nHey if you're on a fixed budget\nYou know the inflationary cost probably are higher than what the government tells you because of the way that they measure isn't\nEasy to forget how rampant inflation was back in the late seventies and eighties and Seventy nine and ten percent Colo increase right in eighty fourteen percent Ninety eighty one eleven percent that is just crazy\nSo Google a revealing a whole bunch of new devices or with their latest uh you know roll out of uh these different uh you know what what would you come smart devices I guess\nFor Google smart devices they also about their new version of their pixel phone or so it was a bit of a combination of different products for them uh and this is right on the heels of Facebook's owns smart home product which\nAt least from people that I've talked to has been a big flop and bad timing for the company or Google made a pretty smart decision I think with one of their smart home products what they do ... what what are they talking about doing here so Facebook let's start with what Facebook did which is they put a\nAlmost like an eye pad type device that uh you can do video chats with within your home and it runs on the Amazon or Alexa smart home device\nGoogle has put out a new product which it looks like it's again it's another smart home product it's using the Google smart devise a but it's mainly use for watching video not performing video calls and the thing that they\nI think a dress properly is the creepy factor they said you know was as big hang up on the right it's hey were brand new to this industry people are still getting over the fact that there is a speaker in their home listening to them they probably don't want a video camera watching them at the same time so\nThey admitted a camera on their version of this you can't do video conferencing with it\nBut I think that's you know for somebody that's looking for this maybe they're just looking to be able to watch a quick video and how to cook something\nI I think it's a smart

about it it the the programming is going to be produced by him GM's okay you got you know reputable firms that's going to be handling things there why does Wal Mart need to produce content\nThey don't they just see it being successful for everyone else and to me when I see a company like Wal Mart jumping into the contents production bandwagon right Amazon has been successful with Netflix has been successful with it\nWhen I see a company that has nothing to do with it jumping into it I said that the death of this huge expansion of original content that we said right you know it is right now the golden age of television as people are saying\nYeah it it it feels like over saturation this is kind of like that picture from about three years ago in China where you saw a guy sitting on the side of the road selling bananas in his computer\nHad the stock market up ... immediately after the Chinese market crash 'cause it was just okay that person has no business day trading stocks from the side of the road selling bananas in this case\nWalmart is sitting there on the side of the road they have no business being under selling bananas and they're saying hey I can do this and I just don't think they can yeah like you're in the same\nBoat I Am I I think this was a mistake for Walmart I don't think they're pouring that much money into it which I guess if we think it's gonna be a failure than that I guess the good thing but not putting that much but if you wanna do content production you can't just dip your toe now come out with one hits and say okay well that worked for\nUs so there's one other thing they're doing that I'm just curious how it works there also investing in a joint venture with a company called echo yeah that is in New York start up that focuses on quote interactive storytelling which is a video format that allows viewers to control the part of commercials and television episodes you remember those little books that you could read back into your own adventure but yeah\nYeah it's like that so I'm guessing this doesn't mean that you can control the commercial like everything that person does but hey if enough people vote hey here's what's gonna happen if enough people vote be here's what's gonna happen who who cares I don't know\nLike there's a reason why most books aren't choose your own adventure books\nHang on Netflix is doing that though are there oh yeah with black mirror they're doing a picture on storyline survivors bend a show of it and say I have an ... oh so good\nI feel like it would make me even more paranoid about technology than I

I've got a ton of them probably I probably average one or two a day I'm near right and there's no there's certainly no governmental organization dealing with that the carriers are definitely not dealing with it\nBut apple and Google are taking it upon themselves to come up with something because they know it's a huge complaint they want people to continue to use their phones obviously\nA so they are doing something with it and I I like I like a couple of the solutions actually why and stuff are they talking about so I like the one that Google is doing a particular 'cause I think it's just a need technology but what they're doing is they're going to have\nThey are going to roll out a a screen this call button\nSo have you pop up in your phone and it's raining and you look at the number and you say I think this is garbage there's a screen call button and the Google Assistant will hop on and they'll let the color no hey we're screening this call\nAnd ask them for their name and so you'll be basically just looking at the phone it'll region the transcript of what that person is saying on the phone and you'll be able to say oh yeah it's my\nLong lost cousin Becky and she's calling me or\nDavid ... how would you know that it's your long lost cousin Becky if she was a long long yeah good question I have a\nYou know says that but presumably it'll be a lot easier to tell if there's a human on the line or if it's just a you know recording which is Ninety nine percent of these calls that I go to your phone\nSo I liked that technology apple is treating in a different way they're trying to look at the data behind the incoming call to determine whether they're you know legitimate or whether they're you know for an Internet calls with fake phone number I don't understand the technology behind how they do that but if they do it well and that can be a good solution as well\nThey need to do something yeah somebody's got to shout ales off the weird part is is that the location is like the next town over from me every time oh yeah oh every ... or or where\nI did go through a brief maybe two or three month period where I was getting a lot of calls from Nevada but

exactly\nA story out of the wall Street Journal today according to a number of economists\nUh that were surveyed by the wall Street Journal or they are relatively ambivalent on this new deal with Canada and Mexico saying it's probably not going to boost the number of manufacturing jobs because of the changes are largely on the periphery and not really directed at any court component\nAnd this is this is soft data you know it's it's polling economists to determine what they think is going to happen and\nFrankly economists aren't always write a Seventy percent of them said they don't expect to big changes in the U.S economy [laughter] I'm among them I don't think that the new the written NAFTA deal is all that big of a change I wouldn't expect a huge impact to the economy either\nOr but you know I think there are parts of it there were largely good for the U.S economy and even if it's around the periphery it's something\nOn a largely takes the worst case scenario of not getting a
