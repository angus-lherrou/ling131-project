I mean James White had nine catches and the first half and he didn't have a ton of yards but he had the catches\nAnd when you have the ability of of a back out of the backfield to give you that kind of production and then you get back your number one slot option which as we know at a brief think he ever read the first two throes of the game to go to the bank he Edelman got thrown to the gate\nA gotta get 'em involved so just having those two weapons ... positions that aren't necessarily um a major ah air targets right I mean you're slot and you're running back aren't exactly you know uh your top spots there\nThat opens up the fields for Josh Gordon and I mean you know a guy like a a Chris Hogan who was non existent for the first half of the game but then started to get open 'cause the field was opened deep because they were killing the colds short\nWithout 'em and then and white and so a ... if this can continue they can keep this trend going\nAnd they can find themselves a ... a little bit more of a playbook and it a little bit better position for a guy like Josh Gordon watch out this ... could be really dangerous\nAnd one of the things I like about ... and as you said you know it's kind of nice for once I'm not like the main guy like it's a lot of pressure when he I mean the pressure that was on him to be the guy\nUh in Cleveland was huge and uh he's it I don't have to be the guy here it's great I Love it so I don't know maybe this new mindset is good for them\nMaybe he's got better ways to cover up or his drug test when he'd smoke in the ... I don't know what it is but so far so good with the uh Josh Gordon experiment and let's hope that continues I was going to talk Bruins but I mean look it's too early like you know you played two

in\nTo talk about planning for mom ... moms eighty one mom is healthy as an ox looks great no problems keep that in mind when you're listening and wondering whether or not to my too old to plan no you're not too old to plant K obviously we look at health but not too old to plant\nAnd then they tell me about what we've already done some planning but we want you to review it and we want to get some thoughts on what we should do going forward ... if anything\nTurns out to have a house and it's interesting because at the time she was married way back when she did this life estate arrangement\n[noise] she prepared a deed transfer husband or wife transferring the property with a life in reserve in a life a state so normally the deed would say you here by you know say Todd and Susan transfer the property\nTo ... in this case\nThe trustees of a nominee realty trust in the beneficiaries of the nominee realty trust for the for kids okay\nThat's really no different than just transferring it to the four kids so the nominee realty trust is kind of a ah it's optional it doesn't really do anything ... or in between there but it says Todd and Susan Grant a life a state\nToo\nTodd and Susan okay and the property to the kids ... well\nYou usually don't draft it that way so if any of you have done a life of state the first lesson we learn from this example is you don't draft of life a state that way if we owned the entire fee simple together Susan ...\nThen we need to say we we already own it we can write grant or something we we we kind of already own it mhm you reserve a life is to yeah you give away everything else but keep this little piece and called her life a state\nDoes it work this way we are going to take the position that it does mhm somehow we granted ourselves the life of state perhaps that's the same thing ... and and it probably is but I just want everybody to ... to be mindful of of that because I can tell you folks I'll bet you there's a lot of you out there who have done life estates on there and\nLook at the de grey yeah look at the deed and just make sure it just says that you know you gave it but reserved a life of state why so when I saw that the house is worth about three hundred and fifty thousand it's on the Cape not overly ... you know expensive but it's a\nFamily kind of thing mhm they want to keep it in the family\nAnd so I looked at that and I said well let's assume this has done right at this point at least although I might not have done it this way because all four kids now are exposed to the assets to their credit or yeah so four times divorce issues four times creditor issues more times anything\nAnd I explained that if you've ever wanted to sell it mom you would need for kids permission most of the money would end up going to those four kids so\nA lotta loss of control and and the loss of of an expose credit or risk here but you know what is protected from the nursing home and you're eighty one years old so I don't want to change that right I'm going to leave it the way it is\nAnd I almost said there's really not a lot of reason to do any planning all you have left as a hundred and fifty grand what do we do did her husband die or did well yeah ... yeah yeah okay and so I said you know\nWhat are we going to do with the hundred and fifty grand is all you have left it's at risk is it really worth it to to planning\nAnd you know what folks in may or may not be the right type of plan for you but maybe you're thinking about maybe I Want to check out how these very vocal about trust work maybe I Want to see if my ... trust will work when it comes time for me to actually\nPut it to use for me if if one of us goes into the nursing home\nTodd's guide that he has written for the month of October is designing an income only ... trust you need to have your trust drafted properly in order for it to work folks Todd's guide includes the information that absolutely must be included in your ... trust as well as\nSeveral troublesome problematic provisions that absolutely cannot be included in your local trust\nCall right now to request you're free copy of Todd's brand new

considered a gift and you have a five year waiting period for Medicaid eligibility\nIn case a mom\nGot sick after this transaction yeah even though she's living there\nOkay I get all that so do I still want to do it maybe it's okay I Would say no because I never ever want to give assets to children one I'm living\nNothing good can come from that mhm so those are the first two problems next\nI don't own any more son can kick me out anytime you want I can sell it I don't get the proceeds are exposed to my son's creditors who could have a divorce and I could lose my house to to their divorce\nOn and on and on and tax problems so nothing good comes from that one other problem I see\nIf I successfully given it away arguably I've lost the ability to get a step up and basis on the property especially here we are doing it sort of in exchange for the ability to live there\nI Know there's this case out there called the state of Gwen that allows people who give away assets to continue to enjoy what they give away yeah causes it to be included in their state to preserve the step up and basis\nSo at least I think Bob you'll probably be able to avail yourself of that case\nAnd if you sell the property after mom dies you might not have a capital gains tax problem [noise]\nBut you know what there's so many other problems here that I wouldn't do this and I would say Bob you can be in the very same place while protecting Mumbai having mom put it in this trust that we talk about here designing this trust put it in still a five year waiting period\nMom can live their moms in charge no risk of being kicked out mom can sell the property mom can avail herself the capital gains tax exclusions and you're going to get a full step up and basis when\nMom passes all the while the property protected from the nursing home mhm why would I\nGive it away right there is no benefit in doing that Bob or anybody listening\nYeah and you know what folks if you've been thinking about doing planning to protect those assets get your clock started\nEven if you do get your clock started made sure it started with the right type of document make sure that that ... trust is drafted properly\nTaught is written a brand new guide for the month of October it's designing in income only ... trust and we know this state is scrutinizing these applications that go in folks that you need to make sure you have a solid state plan that is drafted properly\nHis guide will show you the language that must be included in your trust as well as all of the problematic provisions that absolutely\nMust not be included in your trust call right now to request your pre copy of Todd's designing your ... trust guide brand new eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight\nFive six nine nine you can also download a free copy on our website legal exchange show dot com\nTodd our last question comes from Michael in deadly mass and Michael writes I live with my father in a home that we both purchased fifty fifty years ago and we are both on them that we are both on the mortgage\nIs my father allowed to pay off the home mortgage as a way to spend down his assets so he can qualify\nFor Medicaid down the road he is healthy now but is this a possibility\nSo again let's put a little analysis of this so that everybody can benefit from it\nWhen we talk about applying for Medicaid mhm and that's what Michael's\nWorried about here whether it's now or down the road and that's important when I say whether it's now are down the road because some of you listening might be faced with a nursing home situation right now mhm uh and if that's the case there might be looking for ways to to reduce assets that would otherwise make the individual\nIneligible for Medicaid benefits\nSpending down is always a beneficial way of reducing assets are for accountability purposes so in this case are you allowed to pay off your mortgage yes you are it's your mortgage and why is that not\nA disqualifying transfer or why is that a sign even a permissible transfer it's just not a disqualifying transfer\nBecause you are paying a debt\nThat you know oh you are not transferring something for less than fair market value you are transferring it to take care of something at fair market value you're paying off a liability that you have\nThat is not a gift to anybody else\nThat is paying your own debt now I say that here even though he's only fifty percent on the mortgage because all of you listeners out there who own property and our jointly on a mortgage what someone else mhm\nI Believe if you read the mortgage you will find that you are jointly and several reliable yeah or that liability I don't\nThink it usually says percentage wise of what ones responsible for the other one because if someone doesn't pay the other one's paying\nTheir ... yeah so I think you're going to run into that that problem so yes go ahead and pay off a mortgage certainly unacceptable way to spend down assets prior to nursing home\nAnd even if you have a mortgage you might be thinking I Can't do this very vocal trust clean because I have a mortgage it's still an option correct\nJust a great point I mean I think a lot of people worry that you know and I and I I shouldn't say that I mean I Know a lot of my clients have no debt by the time they are doing this kind of plant ice you know there's there's plenty that come in with either an ... an outstanding he lock out what they call home equity line of credit or\nA regular mortgage interest isn't paid off yeah I've got a hundred grand left on his fifty grand left on or whatever\nFolks you can keep your mortgage you might not be able to borrow again once again the trust without taking it out\nBut you can keep existing mortgages and here's where the tension of that life a state is critical mhm by reserve in your life has stayed in transferring the remainder interest to the trust and not to the kids I don't like it like our earlier story right I like it into the trust\nIt still retention of that property right known as a life a state or the right to live there that preserves the mortgage because you're still considered the owner of the property you haven't transferred it and will not trigger the due on sale cause so please plan with income property\nFolks if you have a
