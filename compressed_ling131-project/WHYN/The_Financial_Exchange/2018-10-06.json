on Dr Ford disrespected the entire survivor community we have a survivor community now\n[noise]\nA survivor of man community now is on CNN\nAnd here it is that ... is is that they've been even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target of attacks from Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the president for the other marking her like that because you can get Collins and Murkowski ended me what the way they vote means horrible you'd think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was stating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's

these people to hide under and I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done in such outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody he did it privately somebody has to say

I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's been to a girl but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women the pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them\nWho are coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN while they are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number can't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo get away ... ... ... ... that I Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned women's studies on campus\nThe the outright hatred for men and I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine McCann and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now\nThat men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers and it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today\nSo you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her but she may literally believe\nThat men don't have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my point she may really believed it\nGoes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped her all the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr do you ever um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not\nBut then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to run to hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine you know the look on the phone went up ... by the way here's this you're\nAlso random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me

guide\nEight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine can also download your copy on our website legal exchange show dot com\nSo Susan let's take a minute and go to Vermont Vermont's I Love ... I like for months pretty this time of year for sure\nSo this was a situation where we're dealing with a spousal husband wife\nAnd an IRA OK okay now I think it's important folks because a lot of you listening have IRAs or four O. one K. share you know the drill and maiming a designated beneficiary on these assets is so so important\nHow to do it who should be it can it be a trust cannot be a person you know and what are the ramifications of doing that and that's really what happens here so it was interesting uh Patricia\nHad a late estranged husband\nHe died but sounds like they were married just a strange D maybe somebody they're separated I don't I don't know from the facts but she died and I guess because they were estranged he had named his ...\nAnd nephew beneficiaries under the Ira\nBut so so not his spouse okay\nBut he did manage to have a will so he died testy number interstate means without a will mhm he died ... with a will that provided the personal unreal properties and the rest residue of his estate to Patricia okay so she took that\nSo that will did leave her\nThings mhm pretty much everything else except for those iris and remember folks Ira's with designated beneficiaries attached do not go to probate therefore they are not governed by the will mhm so that explains why they can be two separate ways in which these assets flowed\nOkay so what is Patricia do well she's not happy with this approach so she decides to file a claim saying that the beneficiary designation is void\nBecause of the interstates succession statute in the state of Vermont\nAnd by making it void of course then in her mind it would flow into her it would be no beneficiary mhm so folks if you have an Ira and you make nobody about a fishery then what happens is that the falls to the state yeah so now it gets into the probative state and in this case once it's there though will\nWould govern [laughter] so she knew that so since she was the beneficiary under the will she wanted to make the IRA beneficiary avoid having it go through the will which then would give it to her mhm on top of the other items that she got in the well\nOkay I get that well she filed and by the way that the statute or in Vermont and again this is a state driven statue folk so maybe a little different for your state but look for them\nAll states have an interstate succession statue and so the statue here says that spouses cannot convey\nTo others in an effort to deep fraud or deprive the surviving spouse in fraudulent way ... well the superior court in Vermont said well that is what happened here\nAnd we a rule in favor of the niece and nephew so they appealed to the appellate court and the appellate court said may lead to hang it depends on the court said we're from nieces and nephews when let me explain why\nAnd you know what folks if you have a trust plan in place you have to worry about any of this nonsense you will have your wishes in writing\nPretty ironclad as well as long as it is drafted properly that's what all of these trucks are all about if you are concerned not just about that bloodline planning where your assets go but you're also concerned about protection from long term care expenses from nursing home expenses\nYou need to have your ... trust in place that is drafted it properly\nTaught has written a brand new guide for the month of October it's designing in income only ... trust it will show you what clauses absolutely should never be in your trust as well as the language that must be in your ... call right now to request you're free copy ... brand new designing your test\nOr probably get there might be attacked from ... number one because if you sell it and dad gets a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar capital gains exclusion there might be more than two hundred and fifty thousand of gain built into the house right so you might have a capital gains tax liability don't know how to run those numbers\nEven at that though Todd now dad's got a big bucket calf\nShe's going to be booted off Medicaid unless you can either by a Medicaid annuity your throat into a pool trust mhm so not a great option right out and keep it\nHow else could you keep it you could rent it okay so if you rent it out now you'll have the money you need\nTo pay the bills because while that will be rental income for dad yeah income is treated differently than an asset so renting it is not going to cause him to come off Medicaid\nAnd let's say you rent it you get to use the rent dad gets to use the rent to pay all the bills and only the excess rent\nWould end up going to the nursing home and you don't care because that somebody else's money right and now the child the child's ability to borrow or pay for this property\nIs gone mhm it will be maintained especially with no debt that you know it will be maintained by their rent mhm you would definitely be able to generate enough rent to maintain the property\nWith access rent going to the nursing home to pay a bill\nAnd that will help to reduce the amount of the leading that's been placed on that home 'cause it's he's qualify for Medicaid so that will help you in the end as well so\nGood point Susan what Susan's talking about there is that even though this house for a single person is non accountable is ... ... so that means whatever amount of money the state is paying\nOn behalf of dad in this case\nIs a lean on the house and so if we have Social Security of two thousand going to the nursing home and now we can pick up a thousand a month extra on the rent yeah the net rent mhm now there's three thousand dollars a month going so the amount the state is paying drops from four to three right\nAnd so the lean is less I say four to three because full pay on Medicaid is about six mhm so that's a great 'cause that's where I mean when I Would go or here or rent it David so rent that I like the way to guys\nFolks if you would like to not have to worry about this last minute ... that you have to do with your assets you're planning in advance\nTodd has written a guide for all of us designing and income on your income only ... trust and it is the type of trust you need if you want to protect those assets from those long term care expenses\nGet your free copy right now by calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine or visit our website legal exchange show dot com or you can download your free copy\nTodd our last question comes from Brian in ... with math and Brian right my father died in a nursing home and twenty Seventeen while receiving medicate\nThe state contacted me with a bill for his nursing home care can they make me pay the bill he gave me is home seven years before he went into a nursing home and only held the life of state other than that he didn't own anything the bill was around sixty five thousand do I need to pay this\nYou know this is a great question and folks what they're driving\nHere and what Brian is sort of bringing to the forefront is\nThis thing called a state recovery mhm right ... we just talked about how they could have been a lean on a person's house right and when he died the state would say okay kids you're going to get a bill for what we paid on behalf of\nThe person who was in the nursing home that being said they're going to say you need to pay us because we have a lean on your on dad's house because dad in that previous example owned it in his name\nAgain d'alene was a friend that was still weigh less that would be do and you got to keep the house uh so you know take out a mortgage and pay it or sell it and pay it either way uh know taxable event\nIn this case this was the same thing so she had been in a nursing home and they'd been paying and now they're looking to say is there anything available for as state recovery to reimburse the state for the money paid on behalf of a dad dad in this case\nDance to the good news is in Massachusetts the answer looks like it's going to be no no meaning there's no assets available for state recovery and no Brian they can't make you pay it ... you are not personally liable for that\nDebt now why\nIn Massachusetts they can only recover from the probate estate\nKnock the gross a state so that means is only assets dad died owning in his own name with no beneficiary designation\nPeriod well in this case it appears that that only had a life a state in a house ... which means ... years ago he had given the house to the kids and reserved a life a state\nWell\nThe life a state expires on death mhm\nAnd like magic it avoids probate and the kids are automatically one hundred percent owners with a step up and basis and it was protected from the nursing home so while there was a lifetime lean on the property\nWhile there was a lifetime lean on the property and that's important to know right in case the\nKids want it to sell it during life like above yet or if David above wanted to sell it there would be a a a a lean to grab that money from the proceeds mhm here\nWhile there is a lifetime lean if they sold it they could get money back\nThe lifetime lean expires at death right because the life a state that it was attached to expired mhm and there's no ability to put an app to lean on so Brian in this case I Would say don't pay it and there's no estate recovery here allowed\nFolks if you have a question you would like to ask Todd visit our website legal exchange show dot com and click on the asked Todd tab maybe we'll be able to read your question
