Ronan Farrow reported on Deborah Ramirez on corroborated allegations of misconduct by Kavanaugh\nOut of eagerness to show a pattern of such behavior mayor told the\nL magazines and her recollection of the Thomas hearings and James yeah so having watched this before I knew the key issues would be whether the judge had a pattern of similar behaviors since that helps to stab me she was telling the truth when there's a standoff\nThere wasn't a pattern this is amazing\nShe ran uncorroborated story to illustrate a pattern\nI I'm almost speechless in my attempt to explain this\nThe first story that was run about Deborah Ramirez nobody could corroborate her story kept changing there was no evidence for it the New York times found that so bad they wouldn't they wouldn't allude to it much less reprint aspects of it and so Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow run a second story\nThat isn't true just to establish a pattern in other words we're going to lie twice we're going to run a false story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that when Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from ... Ford or be it for Ramirez or from ... client\nWas her name sweat Nick I mean this is a flat out admitted yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story alleging it and of course their buddies in the left will gladly accept an allegation is

comments that\nAre basically liberals don't need to be civil to conservatives anymore it reminded me\nOf a profound quote I came across ... years ago and maybe even used that it uh but here's the quote a society is either moving toward civility or barbarism and I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society\nAnd it's apparent that the liberal left his embrace the barbarism I just wanted to get your thoughts\nAre ... but the question is do I do I agree that uh our society has always trending toward a barber is what what barbarism in a\nSociety barbarism or civilly were trending one where we're not in the middle of either trending towards civility or barbarism off the clocks\nAnd the oh it's a constant flocks and so what what what what is your costs more Trump isn't it\nWell it seems as if uh the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working\nUh you know towards law and order a restoring it and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism right ah with all of their a character assassination attempts on Trump Kavanaugh antifa violent shooting\nThere's no there's no question about that it's an active choice I mean Hillary Clinton's endorsing it\nAbsolutely and uh it's it's sad to see because this is not the Democrat Party of my uh mother and father and I remember so well you know the conservatism here in Oklahoma where I live uh in fact most of the state\nWell let me ask you this was the Democratic party the Democratic party ... what was it when that was all button fine and dandy what word named

what they want but they're doing\nWell um the Democrats at at that time the basic uh issue was a labor laws and um when\nYeah but what purpose my part of the Democratic party hasn't changed that much is my point the Democratic party has always been rooted\nIn the modern era in our lifetimes in this century and the previous at the Democratic party has been rooted in anti capitalism has been rooted in pro socialism and big government\nThey've just now a band in any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all in on militants and violent socialism to achieve their means my point they're

the two together the promissory note and the annuity\nAnd give you guys an example as to how they should work and when to use it in why to use it okay so\nWe talked about the the promissory note right now the annuity\nThe annuity is and and I I Want to compare him right now back to back so this ... review a little bit okay\nSo the promissory note needs to be actual early sound yet and so does the annuity okay so the annuity needs to be actual early sound meeting when you purchase an annuity and we usually work with users and on this right and you would you would go to an insurance company and and what you and give them the money give\nThem the money basically in exchange they would give us sudden annuity contact\nAnd that that insurance company will pay back to the person who bought the contract all the money yes was it may be a wee bit of interest\nFor not yeah you're ... you're not doing it for a return it's basically you're buying these to stop the bleeding of the outflow of money that's going to the nursing home\nSo so the the annuity needs to be not the pay out of the annuity needs to be not longer than the life expectancy of the new one tenth the person buying it\nAnd the promissory note payout needs to be not longer than the person who borrow so they're both the same in that race in that regard next they both have to have level payments\nThe annuity will make monthly payments and a promissory note will receive monthly payments from the borrower yeah so those are fine\nOr the promissory note says no deferred or ballooned payments at the end well same kind of thing with the annuity\nThe annuity can't really defer longer than sixty days mhm so in that regard there might be a little difference the annuity the promissory note needs to pay out right away okay the annuity from the time you actually go to the uh annuity company in and purchased the annuity\nThey the first annuity payment can be sixty days later but no later than that yeah and we usually\nStarted within thirty days later when that contract is actually\nFind a lot so that's not again not a real big difference between the two and here's the final piece right the arrow vocal or the annuity also needs to be irrevocably non assign a bowl while the promissory note if there isn't a requirement but\nI don't think anyone would really assigned there promissory notes anybody but without a coat I suppose so it's not a requirement of and finally the annuity must\nBe up the beneficiary on the annuity must be the uh uh state well let me rephrase the beneficiary on the annuity must be the state to the extent\nPayments were receive Medicaid benefits were received by the uh knew a tent and his or by the institutionalized individual in case there's a spouse oh okay so whether it's a spouse or\nOr that are married or single or single you got to have this they'd be the beneficiary I guess the difference would be obviously if the state\nIf there's a single person than the beneficiary is clearly the state right unless there is a community spouse or a disabled child so single person doesn't have a spouse right so it's going to be the state yeah\nWhereas the a married couple the community spouse is the one buying the annuity right and then a fish Sherrie would need to be\nThe institutionalized\nSpouse right see so that's kind of the difference there but remember the community spouse the goal is because the beneficiary does ultimately need to be the state meaning there could be some estate recovery mhm\nYou tend to get in and out of these annuities quickly do a very short term yeah an annuity so even if under my Seventy five year old example it's a twelve year annuity you might only do five years ... years tied in and out of it quickly\nAnd you know what it is pretty complex folks that's why you don't do these things on your own and you know what maybe and you're thinking oh I don't even want to deal with any of this stuff\nThen do your planning in advance when we say advanced that's five years in advance books that's how long it takes to protect your assets once they are in in ... trust\nTodd's guide that he has written for the month of October it's designing an income only ... trust and it's a great guide for you to understand all of the information that absolutely must be in your ear evoke about trust and all of those problematic clauses that absolutely must not be in your area vocal trust\nYou can request year free copy of Todd's designing your your evoke about trust guide right now\nBy calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's

twenty three thick be left in her name and our IRA correct so that oh so you need to\nIt all out to come out so that two hundred becomes what\nYeah when something no one can take the whole two hundred oh no no I Know but after you pay the taxes on it right so now the mechanics are you have to take it out\nBecause I Can't allocated to her a hundred and twenty three ... but in terms of the annuity I'm going to purchase yes yes oh I've got fifty and then I'm gonna take two hundred and put it over to her side of the ledger now as you said Susan when I Do that\nThen I pull two hundred outta that Ira I'm going to create a income tax liability right\nGood news is maybe prior to going into the nursing home this year\nThis tax year they might have incurred some medical expenses ... if they did then this can offset oh yeah the ... tax hit\nBut yes it will be a taxable event ...\nFor the individual yeah okay so now I pay the taxes and and let's say we we lose twenty grand and taxes mhm okay I don't know even if you're going to the top rate\nYou know I I Can't imagine it's going to put you more than thirty percent bracket radio two times three sixty grand mhm so say so you lose fifty grand yet so you're down to a hundred and fifty plus you've got fifty mhm so now we're at two hundred thousand left yet\nWe know a hundred and twenty three six would be non accountable mhm so yes now that this community spouse has the money we can allocate it\nAnd then that leaves the excess the excess would then be a new attack so about Seventy five grand in this case gave her case so then we would take the Seventy five grand and we would buy an annuity\nIn the name of the healthy spouse and that would convert that asset into an income stream and it would it would the annuity company would pay a monthly check to the community spouse\nWhich is now non ... income right 'cause it's converted to income now\nSick spouse can go on Medicaid and we've saved\nSo in a minute not at risk for Brian 'cause it's in his name is not going to be in his ... on that we converted to is not at risk anymore and you know what folks if you have been thinking about creating an eerie vocal trust 'cause you're concerned about protecting those assets\nTodd's guide is going to be really helpful for you it's designing an income only eerie vocal trust in your trust is only as good as the drafting folks Todd's guide includes important language that must be included in your trust and maybe even more importantly and includes all those problematic troublesome clauses\nThat you do not want to have your in your trust don't matter what\nColor right now for your free copy of Todd's designing your ... trust guide eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight\nFive six nine nine or visit our website legal exchange show dot com you can download our guide you can download our podcast and you can submit your questions for taught to read on the air\nTaught our last question comes from Karen in hold in math and Karen writes my husband and I created revoke a trust in two thousand and seven\nThe attorney prepared deeds that transferred our home from joint tenants in the entirety to join tenants and common individually is this what you would recommend shouldn't the properties be transferred fifty fifty to our respective trust\n[noise] you know carrying I or Susan and care and I I have to tell you\nThat I have no idea what they're doing here I mean this is one of those things where I'm really just trying to scratch my head and see what do you actually gain from doing this if you have\nYou know revolt come across I I don't look at things and just\nDecide that it's wrong I I really try to think about what the attorney might have been doing here\nWhat the attorney might have been thinking here I don't know so it if we have revolt will trust let me explain to you folks would I Would do and what I think should be done here\nSo when you create revoke about trust and you all your listeners may have these right so if you've got revoke about trust the goal is to fund those revolt will trust share to put things into it mhm right like what like all your investment accounts not IRAs not for one case\nLike all your bank accounts like all your real estate\nSo that it avoids probate ... in all states and so that it can help\nFund the trust with valuable assets in your state to shelter for estate tax savings purposes mhm\nWhat was done here was they took the house from tenants by the entirety and just so you know what that means is if you and I own property as tenants by the entirety Susan and only husband and wife can own property this way you then get a\nCreditor protection so if somebody sues me yet because something I did they can't take our house right because they can't break\nThe tendency by the entire day without your signature so that gives you some creditor protect does it does so at least owning it that way provides some level of credit or protection and would avoid probate on death mhm 'cause it would pass the surviving joined owner yeah\nNot going to help from an an estate tax planning standpoint by any means so I'm not suggesting leaving it as a tendency by the entirety was a good idea\nBy any means that should have been transferred into their trust\nSo what they did instead even though they broke the benefits they got from having it as tendency by the entirety of which were some credit or protection and the uh uh avoidance appropriate they put it independence in common so what does that get them so\nThat gets them nothing now they're not even avoiding probing\nNow when they died there half mhm will not go to the survivor but we'll go through their probate estate and we'll end up likely if they've got to pour over will\nPutting it into their trust so it will get in their trust through probate but not until they're\n... till they're dead so they've lost their creditor protection and now they're going to ... yeah I I so I don't understand why they would do this\nThe right thing to do for all of you listening if you've got revolt will trust or irrevocably trust is to make sure you're deed conveys the property to the trustees of the trust so that it's funded inside the truck\nSo in this case would you recommend Cameron has deeds created that actually puts it into their trust that I Do okay I absolutely do All right well there you have it folks even if you do you're planning in advance sometimes you need to double check that planning than it was done because\nThese trust are only as good as they are drafted and Todd his guide for the month of October is designing and income only ... whether you have an existing trust or you're thinking about creating a new trust to protect those
