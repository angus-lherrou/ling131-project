Springfield\nSome kids born in America shouldn't be Americans I'm Dave Anthony Fox News that's what President Trump believes considering an executive order to undo the policy any baby born here whether the mothers in the country legally or not is a U.S citizen he tells act CEOs on HBO\nThat are doing very well so there's a little bit of a flight to safety here a little bit of a natural correction\nBut at the end of the day there's a lot of concern to your point\nAbout the impact of tariffs ... in in what that's going to mean the bottom lines and you know when you have your United Technologies which of course as a as a strong the wing when presidents they come out and say that uh\nAnd I have a dramatic impact on their costs and it's going to hurt the profitability and the the statistic that really concerns me the most vary\nIn terms of the fundamental things that matter here not just the rotation from high priced thoughts that that's just nature what concerns me fundamentally is when I heard a CNBC Stuart survey that said one third of the companies that they talk to are looking at reducing research and development\nBecause of the money drain of the extra costs from the tariff now so here's a ... it seems to defeat the purpose of giving them tax breaks\nThe rate is now going to pay for higher input cost\nSo ... and that's your criticism of the terrorists I think you have to recognize of John that\nIn a trade war and it's not ... and the key word there is not trade it's war and you know you've got an opponent in the Chinese who\nHas no integrity no morality mhm no respect for intellectual property and they simply they take whatever is not tied down and that's that's the way they act culturally that is the way they feel towards American products they you know we're going to get into a during the course of the show but\nThey some of the actions on the part of the Chinese that we're learning about that have been going on for ten and Twenty years\nThis is our response to it ... this is and and what else do you do you can't have a shooting war\nAnd again to your point I don't disagree I it may very well be the right thing to do but as investors we have to kind of step back and try not to get too emotional about this and say okay whether this was justified or not what does it mean\nIt means higher import costs you know it means inflation it means you're not a technologies will earn less money it would mean Boeing will earn less money so we have to take pen to paper and say\nYou know going by and Walmart may actually makes some sense compared to buying companies that are capital intensive and labor intensive\nBut what I think what a lot of people are listening to John and they're saying hey you know the market's down I've lost quite a bit of money in the last thirty days how do I react to that what do I do\nIt's a ... uh I'll tell you what makes it even more complicated the fact that I think that the forty year bond bull market ended twenty eight months ago yeah\nYou know you and I threw are lighter tenure treasury today three twenty three twenty three exactly so you know our whole investment live Mary we've always been supported\nBy knowing if we had thirty percent and bonds that was protecting us yeah that was giving us a safe six percent yup that was helping protect everything is easy now if you're like hedging your overpriced technology stocks with long blond now\nIt's like protecting your investment in kerosene with investing and matches now I mean you're you're you're in the ... so the answer is cash has not been more attractive than the last ten years and it's okay to have cash in by the way whenever you're getting a cash is going to keep going higher you know so that's in short term bonds safe bonds\nAnd I think the evidence stocks and I'll tell you something I've been may call me crazy\nI put most of my cash to work in the last three weeks of him\nBecause I see great opportunity in safe haven in stocks one after another and give us a couple of examples not that we think you should buy these stocks today but do like things that types of companies that you would look at I've been I've been buying funds and I'll give you an example I don't mean to indoor says but fidelity has a high\nDividend income from that is one hundred percent stocks all stock and\nAll different payers it's an ATF from you know so he T Africa and ... ... ... apple is a large holding so there's it's not like you're you're now you're a ... there's growth and there's financial kind of you you get four percent\nWow you know you know by by that you know but I Will\nYeah you put a hundred thousand into something like that and you say send me the day because you take the dip it in cash or you don't have to reinvest correct you take the ... in cash and they're going to send you a thousand bucks every quarter yep ... again ...\n... am I going to look stupid in six months that much but but yeah I could go to eighty but you're still going to get your four grand exactly and remember there's two folks about evidence these companies on average pay\nHalf pay outrageous fifty percent and that means they're making twice as much money as they need to afford the division and companies are very reluctant to cut dividend ... despite will\nBecome later with junk [laughter] but you know not one but\nGenerally most years they go up and I generally tend to not get caught so I I see opportunity and the other thing is the market is cheap and weren't right now as we speak the market is at fourteen point eight times earnings yeah that is not a lot of\nYeah but to your point earlier if these tariffs screw up earnings that were you know how reliable is that ... and that's why and that's why we're going maybe a little bit lower than we should\nBut the market is trying to stop today by the way folks yep ... hundred and Ninety seven so it's a weird day though it has futures are positive then they market opened up negative now the future and now the market's up two hundred points the president made a comment overnight but he looks forward to doing a good trade\nDeal I Wish Chinese shut up [laughter] oh he's doing is the stupid mistake he made yesterday well\nI'm just I'm just reporting the facts and the the the Chinese took that as a very positive statement and I'll tell you something the common belief here\nIs that the Chinese are going to do a darn thing before election day to make him look good and that may be come the end of November ... with all this stuff going on we could ever breakthrough if there is watch out ten percent of the market\n[laughter] I'm trying to make them feel good you are from your lips to God's Ears rising national debt is going to affect\nVoters mid term election decisions poll finds you buy that um I don't think people know and understand with the national debt and\nI thought that I Would like to believe that boy I just think that they're saying they're telling the pollsters what they'd like to believe you know they should feel that way but I our people are going to vote but if you if that's important are you going to vote for the Democrats or Republicans\nMe that [laughter] problem is John ... you know whoever is in part in power\nYou know points the finger at the other guy right there and says well you know if you vote for me I'm going to pay down the debt you know Trump said that Trump's that I'm going to balance the budget I'm going to pay down that debt while he's full of crap I mean he's added four point

I. V.\nA. yeah\nMan in the\nNews radio\nFly in and nobody wage why NFL ... Springfield [noise]\nOr maybe even just in the last year people have been over paying\nBut then you couple that with some wage growth fee that the thing that I think is going to where you're going to see inflationary pressure is on wages\nRight right and I think you're going to see dramatic wage increases in American workers have been getting screwed for I don't know Fifteen Years from now if the supply and demand you talk to any you talked to are advertisers any of our advertisers I've talked to a gym police do from one of our affiliates he said Perry\nHalf of the ads I read now are employers looking for workers yeah and you think about when you listen to the radio yeah but you hear a lot of lot of ads\nAnd and you know this is not a bad place to be it's been a long time\nSince our biggest concern was the economy seems almost too hot to be able to sing and you might laugh when I say it's too strong but a reflection of the fact that we might not be able to handle the degree of the economy is the fact that we don't have enough employ in wars employees you'd find a friend of mine who's\nA very good economists\nUh told me years ago he said berry you get into the twenty twenties and you're going to be reading about massive worker shortages unlike anything you've ever seen before a lot of it do to birth rate you know the birth rate declined in two thousand seven never came back\nUntil very very recently there's another that old aunt ... last year it was another bad year for babies I read anecdotally that that there's\n... there's going to be a good one the last three or four months and there's actually been quite a spike in the birth right now either I Know that's not Tucker where to go baby ... contributing you you're going to get this kid out of the womb by December thirty first better\nAs they do dates is twenty four yeah I could touch and go yeah I Know the background you twenty four the about twenty eight so I don't know like the way that tax deduction yeah exactly [laughter]\nBut that's another factor for the economy is is may be that long awaited jumping the birth rate doesn't help us for Eighteen years [laughter] well they still buy stuff I mean there's there's there's a better but also they need workers John\nI Know I Want to retire for work or you want to retire at ... yeah Johns one week away from retirement by the way I Would put that out there now John mood\nIs last show his last day of work is in one week [laughter] and I'm so envious what will know you have to deal with a massive labor shortage you can get help you\nDeal with millennials me when you retire means I have to spend more time with millennials so I still don't understand you're going to have to come to grips with your actual age which is actually old I Am because I think when when I leave just what you are the old guy and it's not even close\n[laughter] so you're not only have to deal with the fact that there's a labor shortage which means I'm pretty much irreplaceable yes but the fact that you are an old guy I'm I'm okay with that I kind of like when you deal with this yeah I think you need a vacation I I think I'll take one south [laughter] if they are okay\nA Costco you want bargains I Love I Love Costco and I'll be just two of my favorite shopping destinations yup Cosco is are there Black Friday is is\nYou don't ironically it's on a friday I I I thought we were not doing this story so I got really that they they normally open their stores yet at ten of them\nThey're going to open up on a November twenty third at Nineteen\nAnd you know this is a game that it's gotten more competitive and less competitive depending on how you look at it and uh there was that rush to get everybody to work on Thursday and people got really mad at that\nCompany started to realize hey we're we're going we can push a lot of our business online do the same sales have people might have to wait in long lines\nHave people not killing each other in long lines right and at the same business and give our employees a break so that's kinda nobody wants to work on Thanksgiving you know in an online world it seems like abuse yeah well you know if I don't have to be there why am I there and then all kinds of awful things are happening right\nPeople killing each other to get the big screen TV yeah that wasn't good no no you know in in the previous hour I I said I Wish the president periodically would just shut up [laughter] ... shots the hell up Mr President\nYesterday that the market took a tumble ... based on his comments regarding tariffs\nYeah I saw it hit the tape and he said that we're just going to put terrorists and everything yeah and we're we're looking at about ... and that's when we went down five hundred points right up market was\nStarted the day up to fifty was down to close to an changed the midday and then it just went into freefall after that but then John Mooney this morning comes in and says it's OK buried [laughter] it's okay 'cause he just said that he\nThinks he's going to what ... what did he think now today what what time is it is he the may may have changed his mind but he said oh we're going to get a great deal out of China he he\nMentioned overnight and the only reason I mentioned this is a big deal is because the the Chinese market reacted very favorably to this and I look we're just grasping at straws here you know there's a lot of back and forth there was a threat yesterday that just sunk the market overnight I think Trump ... maybe should have said that it but that's why he should shut up [laughter] [laughter]\nYeah well you know the markets are going up and down based on what a tweet about the border fine right shut up about the market and the tariffs well we have an ongoing negotiation\nIn a in a war of words ... with a she in China I your bottom line here is the Chinese are going to do nothing between now and next Tuesday to make Donald Trump look good you know he should understand that they're not going to do that how bad is it going to be next Tuesday\nA I've got I'm not sure how much power the socialists going [laughter]\nI've got the Democrats picking up thirty five seats and I in this in the house I've got the Republicans picking up to in the Senate and that gets us to a place where we were the last two years of Obama where gridlock yeah you're going to have a\nGovernment by executive order I think you'll see reduced um you know you see some stuff in the uh regulations run\nReduced more more you know and then you'll deal with issues like a possible Supreme Court nominees and the Democrats will simply a bring up investigations into who was doing what it was time freshmen in college and\nSaid bad stuff and let's look into it so yeah but they won't have the power to do anything\nAnd there are Republicans won't have all that much power to initiate much legislation so I think we're looking at gridlock\nAmerican tech firms are

another example of them arguably the most glaring example of why this really could hurt China a lot of when you start seeing this this really does bite into their economy so what we're seeing as we're
