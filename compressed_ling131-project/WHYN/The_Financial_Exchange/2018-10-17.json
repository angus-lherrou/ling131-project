election\nTime and we have some uh twenty twenty um you know elections suggestions I'm just I'm just 'cause I'm a helper\nI'm a helper stew you're a helper and we just want to help the Democratic socialist out uh we've got some extra spending maybe that they could consider some slogans necessarily think extra spending as possible or what their support we're going to do with um having a job that I don't think they've taken every dime\nTrue yeah I mean difficult to find more to spend the rest of your front ways to spend them ever ... millions remember the classic documentary or from the Nineteen eighties and would share Richard Pryor was forced to spend thirty million dollars and thirty days\nAnd if he did so successfully from a from a inheritance even received the full inherent as a three hundred um this is an important moment or in our culture\nUm but it was difficult because he couldn't take any assets so he couldn't buy thirty million dollar car right he had to zero at this at the end of it and the idea was kind of like the thing we do with your kids were you\nUh you know they don't actually do this but like in the legend of like you have your kids smoked three packs of cigarettes you get sick and never wants to smoke another cigarette right round so that's kind of make sure you get sick of spending money so you're good with money from that I was the idea in the in the documentary\nUm but how did he wind up actually and it's just a spoiler alert for Nineteen eighty three but how did he a wind up spending all the money he decided to run a political campaign it was the easiest way to get rid of all of a buddy at ... or so I think ah you know this is kind of at the aspect where the uh the the Democrats are which is\nTen they figure out another way to spend money\nWe may even do a little roosters millions or where you come up on stage and you are a\nDemocratic socialist [laughter] and do you have to spend sixty trillion dollars\nDo it harder than you think it is harder than giving can you do it\n... the socialist already have like can you do it very difficult right it's very difficult to do yeah when you go over that and then you are going back dot com slash tours place to go by the way to get to grab your tickets a Bill O'Reilly is coming up in just a few minutes and we have a lot to ah to talk to him about um I I\nI don't know if you've

not a hundred I [laughter] I sure it anymore I I think I Do think that the ... you know could be talked into it\nPretty quick all end if I probably could be a Roger Williams or the congressman pointed this out in an op ed he wrote for the Dallas Morning news talking about how he was a I don't know on a baseball field being shot at 'em and kind of remembers that and and it's maybe not so a positive on this new\nDemocratic um a way of thinking where they're saying ... or Eric Holder when Republicans go low we kick them\nI'm Cory Booker says get up in the face of Congress people Maxine Waters harassed members of the Trump Administration Hillary Clinton we cannot be civil all these things are are are maybe a little bit more impactful to someone who was being shot at by a Bernie Sanders volunteer on a baseball field and then watching Steve ... almost be killed but what's worse\nBut what's worth those things the guillotine\nOr horse face seriously what's worse wow that's a great I mean one of those things deserves twenty four seven cover it all I Know which one it is I Know that's on Twitter right it's a yeah it's horse race is actually got to be a serious issue and we all know

Springfield\nDrama in the air for the first lady I'm Dave Anthony Fox News a flight millennia Trump was taking the Philadelphia\nGlobally the previous quarter\nYeah you know it's like it the the reason to believe that they could slow is because they did for a quarter now I don't know if that's just because people you know just ... didn't you know didn't pick up the subscription as much I don't know if people said hey it doesn't make sense well we used to ... where they would miss and it was because they didn't spend enough money advertising for it\nSo it's I think there are questions there that that still need to be raised as far as hey this this stock is price really expensively\nAnd then you know the other question they do have out there\nIs you've got everyone in their grandmother starting up a streaming service now does that drive up content costs for them further\nIt it's definitely a competitive marketplace if you talk to people in that industry though they'd rather work for Netflix than they would Disney they'd rather work for Netflix than they would Fox\nThey'd rather work for Netflix than virtually anybody else because they have more creative work ah [noise] what am I trying to ... more latitude they they can more flexibility when they're working for Netflix and they would if they're working for ABC\nThat's when he sees the biggest competitor I don't think ABC is anymore you know\nYou know you talk if you're talking about the type of Amazon's a legit competitor wouldn't you say well I mean the the biggest one no one's ... H. B. O.\nYeah HBO is the big they they got forty million subscribers of their own in the United states like they are the biggest competitor out there no one likes to talk about it because you know the oh they're all have them or Iran or now AT and T. yeah\nBecause they tend to evolve over another ... oh dear and Eighteen tea is coming out with the streaming product that's largely going to be based around HBO ...\nI think you know there is competition out there and you know and I know that we always think hey you know ABC ... completely different product at this rate um the ones that are going to be threats are going to be places like Amazon like a you know Eighteen empty now that they have HBO under their umbrella\nUm those are going to be threats anyway that Amazon and Eighteen T could collaborate\nOr what what what are you thinking well you eat the the big issue is Amazon has this mode right now and they're spending what eight twelve\nBillion dollars a year I'm saying like ATM fees product on Amazon or something like that when you think I don't know of Amazon would want to kind of ... their own offering and that way you get into the telecom business I I just I don't know if that's where they want to be going ...\nYou know we'll see you say it is fascinating though Birch Bayh if we did a poll probably not what do you think Ninety percent of our listeners have watched a net flip over there\nThey don't ... it was lower remember when we asked how many people subscribe to Netflix\nWell yeah but that's a different different uh yeah like Tucker doesn't subscribe he's ... somebody else and no I have my own account thank you\nYou do for you that still counts as a subscription whether you're my thought on ... only moves no no it's just Chuck no my parents are moving off me that's right yeah well I have five ... pay back the pay them back for college Fifteen bucks at the time yep\nYep but um anyway that the uh the Netflix story goes on and by the way if you own the shares their up Twenty one dollars today\nNot bad did they formed enough not today\nMitch McConnell calls the rising budget deficit very disturbing\nHey you know there's there's a valid point here very when you have a bad economy if you if you're in a two thousand and eight and two thousand nine you should be running huge budget deficits right that that's when you run a\nTrillion dollar or two trillion dollar budget deficit to try to get people back to work when you have a four percent GDP you should either have a budget surplus or darn near a balanced budget\nYeah typically I don't really like to see surpluses just because it means that you're taking in more tax revenue than you need are closer to a budget balance a balance but you could see that so if if you go and take a look in terms of you know where the money is actually being spent ...\nIf you're talking discretionary areas 'cause that's really what we're talking about right now unless we want to talk about Social Security\nWhich we could that's what Mitch McConnell wants to do right\nNow wants to go after Social Security Medicare and Medicaid and I got to tell you is if I'm a disinterested party if I'm an actuary just looking at it financially\nOh yeah I said that's where you have to go you have to well it's really literally it's a nightmare it is and and and here's why it is the biggest issue that you have to go after if you will get all the projections not so much today but going forward as to where\nOur spending is going to be it is all going to be heading in that direction over the next Twenty years as we continue to age\nUm so you have to make adjustments to those programs just because they're not sustainable with the way they are set up today the system that was put in place you know originally Seventy years ago now it's simply is not up to date with how long Americans are living in the cost of medical care because of the two things that really don't work\nSocial Security is pretty easy to fix to be honest there's not much you need to do in order to fix it mhm you can play around the edges\nWe talk just increase the tax or you ... you don't even have so I can do this I there's a great website I every time we talked Social Security and bring it up there's a website from the committee for a responsible federal budget or called the Social Security reform you can go to yourself and by around\nUh I ... think tank I don't know who I I don't know you know what the cases actively but here's what you can do okay subject all wages to the payroll tax write that covers Seventy two percent of the deficit that Social Security has beyond that\nLimits spousal benefits for high earners okay so if you're in the top twenty five percent of earners you can limit spousal benefits how much does that cover or just four percent I don't need to have animals\nOr if you calculate benefits based on the highest thirty eight years of earning instead of highest thirty five that covers an additional eleven percent uh and then the last one that I had there was one or two at least thirty eight years though they\nAt least men are most most people tend to um and so if you do all of that there's one other thing that I did I Can't find what it was but it wasn't cutting benefits for raising taxes for Ninety percent of people up and it covers one hundred percent of the shortfall okay their Social Security Medicare\nMedicare you can't fix where you just raise the tax rate raise the raise the cost you ... you don't just raise the tax you have to pretty close to double the tax on medical ... that we raise for Medicare in order to cover\nWe got to do something at some point right in the longer we wait a more painful it's going to be yeah and McConnell I thought you know I Am not a ... I don't care for McConnell necessarily but he's at least being on a saying hey we have to address these three per and who can't spend all this money on medicate\nEvery year either well it it really is a question of how do you fix them if you simply go and cut all the benefits to make the programs work you know you're gonna end up with an awful lot of unhappy people because now they don't have the benefits that were promised to them for it so you have to have some kind of compromise here you have to deal with the problems is going to be some combination of raising taxes\nCutting spending and changing al eligibility ages ... ... you can't do just one 'cause otherwise you anger just a specific group of people my view is always been a good compromise leaves\nOne upset ... every everyone has to come out feeling like they lost and if if you do that if you make everyone feel like they lost you probably did it right\nOr pull question today is do you think we should cut spending on Social Security Medicare and Medicaid you can participate in our poll by visiting our website financial exchange showed dot com is there a generational divide on a topic like this they have like how generally speaking\nI can tell you baby boomers are going to say\nWell I don't want you to cut my Social Security benefits and I don't want to pay any more taxes and certainly don't want you to mess with Medicare\nKnow everyone wants to free lunch right you know so there's there's no divide in that sense and that look everyone wants everything to be free you can't have it you know it's we're getting to the point now where in the next Fifteen Years we're going to have to answer give us All right we're not the answer um otherwise we're going to get answered for kind of like when you don't change your oil for twenty or thirty thousand miles\nYeah it's ... eventually you're going to have to pay for it okay and and we're getting to the point now where you have to make adjustments and I don't think the the adjustments should simply be cutting programs because I think it hangs an awful lot of people out to dry who were depending on those programs and so we're all going to have to do things that we don't like that that's how you make it\nWork ... up next we'll be talking about Canada legalizing marijuana it started today this morning the first legal sales of recreational marijuana have occurred this morning in Canada that's our next topic on the financial exchange your whole\nBreaking financial news usa financial exchange with very Armstrong and ... on the financial exchange radio network\nIf you're a real estate or property management company you need a banking partner that has all the right tools to keep your operation\nEfficient leader bank is one of the premier banks and the\nProperty management and real estate space offering a suite of unique products and cash management services to help you collect rent manage condo association payments and digitized paper checks leader bank utilizes state of the art technology to offer convenient banking services to its real estate clients such as a C.

the attorney general of Massachusetts alleging that a hundred thousand Massachusetts residents which suppliers\nTo these companies that were advertising and then they were being overcharged for electricity or if\n... like a bait and switch a scheme to me Chuck where your bill might go down for three months and then all of a sudden it went up quite a bit\nYeah and and they're saying that this costs are somewhere around two hundred and sixty dollars per residential account so it's about a thirty million dollar a settlement that effectively the state of Massachusetts as looking for on this one um\nEverybody that got scammed it looks like you're on average about what two hundred and sixty bucks\nYeah somewhere right in that range there so it's you know this is kind of the first stage and trying to recoup this money\nI think they actually have a shot at getting it because apparently national grid is holding thirty million and and so I think they consumers I get screwed might actually

that does impact is your ability to buy a house and we ran through the six New England states and Florida\nIn Connecticut Chuck the median home price is two hundred and thirty eight thousand dollars so to buy that house theoretically you're going to take a mortgage out of a hundred and Ninety thousand dollars\nAt four point nine percent which is where mortgage rates are today that monthly payment is a thousand and Thirteen dollars but if the rates go up and here's what the president's fear is the rate goes from four point nine to six that payment goes from a thousand Thirteen to one thousand one hundred and forty four dollars if the home is still price the same ah which the\nWay I tend to look at it a lot of people and again\nPeople do this even though it's I don't usually recommend it mhm they buy at the top end of their price range they say hey the banks of that I could borrow three hundred and now I'm In a bar or three hundred thousand well if they're doing that\nIn rates go up the banks gonna come back to them and say hey rates went up one percent we can't lend you three hundred grand anymore we can learn to two hundred and Seventy yeah and so if that happens to enough people\nWent a sellers have to eventually say gee we can't get what we thought we were going to for the property and prices come down a little bit it makes it more sustainable I\nI think one of the biggest problems with low interest rates is that ... and it's not talked about a lot what say that you're saving ten percent of your money for home each year and you're making fifty thousand years you're saving five thousand a year\nFive years now you're going to have two hundred and fifty thousand dollars saved if ... twenty five thousand if rates go down there going to push the price of that property up which means that you're twenty five thousand represents a smaller percentage downpayment so it makes it more difficult for you to buy the place you want because he always borrow more\nYou know it's alarming\nIs rates are going up and you still have the millennial generation that hasn't bought a house the vast majority of your peers still do not own a home\nWell if you live and mom and dad's house long enough eventually they're going to be gone and you're just upstairs you know all kidding aside those generationally they there this is we've never seen anything like this happening\nTo I don't know about never I Would imagine during the great depression we met in the last four generations you know never ever see you got to go back to the twenties have you looked at thirty year olds and their homeownership rates\nRight haven't seen this before [noise] you know you have a part of it though if you haven't and the the issue for me is that if you think the fed is going to continue to be easy money in the long run it's a problem because those thirty year old you're gonna get left out of the appreciation that eventually comes in those properties\nSo move as quick as you can because you see they I think what\nI think you can anticipate and this is something I won't know the correct answer for Twenty years but I Would suggest to you folks\nThat inflation is going to run hotter than interest rates and I think the fed is okay with that and they kind of tell you communicated that you know they'll tell you that they want to see inflation running in that two percent range\nIf it ran at three I don't think they worry about it I tend to\nI mean ... said as much I Know he said that in his last you know they said that he wanted to be you know a little bit more hawkish it sounded like and I know everyone panicked on that earlier this year he said look if we have to run a little bit harder to get to a long term average of two and a two percent inflation will let it run hotter\nIn Florida the median home price is two hundred and twenty four thousand dollars median mortgages a hundred and Seventy nine so Chuck in Florida if your mortgage rate went from four point nine six that would be nine hundred and fifty three dollars a month to a thousand Seventy seven dollars from a\nHundred and twenty bucks yeah so ... rising rates are having an impact there is no doubt about it um but I Would make the case in the long run your building more stability and more normalcy back into the market\nI don't think it's a problem what do you make of this story though that Americans are starting to say gee renting is not so bad after all it's cheaper than owning and I'll tell you once you own you must be experiencing this you know living through your first year of owning a home yes every weekend right there is money out the door and home repairs and projects\nAnd oh there's always stuff going on I got I'm doing a big bold plan this week uh yeah I got a hundred and fifty bulbs then I'm going to be all around the ... the guy oh these are back on the oh yeah it'll be a whole lot of fun I won't be able to move well but yeah so you've got this uh this jumped now that Seventy eight percent of people now say that renting is more affordable than owning um\nWhich is not a great sign if you are someone who is looking to sell a place in the next couple of years 'cause you potentially last buyers that would have come into your you know kind of your orbit um I think that one of the things that is interesting on this is this is a very sentiment that could actually make homeownership\nMore affordable in the long run because if people\nSay look these prices don't make sense and I don't want to be buying I'm not going to buy him not even gonna look no those prices are going to eventually come down and you're going to be able to see people who say hey things have come it's it's a pendulum swings back and forth 'cause we're not seeing dramatic increases in inventory early\n[noise] no and and and we got permits and housing starts this morning that were ... she'll continue slowing um you know the the building that's going on just is not at the level that we want to see it I don't\nKnow now we're still run about twenty percent white\nAs far as what we see in a healthy market\nProbably coming up we're going to be talking about the largest

Chicago's been known for their unions\nAnd their unions in the best they have been in so this uh this local union in Chicago a there is one collective bargaining session left on October twenty fifth in twenty six on the union says hey we're approaching this in good faith\nBut if the company and this is a direct quote from union leadership but if the company continue doing what they did negotiations the last time we met which is basically saying to just a standard do nothing then that's the direction that we're going to move so pretty much they're saying look we want to get a deal done but give them the company says that there's nothing no changes being made\nIt looks like this Chicago UPS union is going to end up going on strike um and this is eighty five hundred workers in the Chicago area\nA Chicago is a major hub for you have these arrests started and this isn't something that would just affect the Chicago area this would potentially affect shipping through out the entire Midwest and really all parts of the country just because they have to cover that staffing\nFrom other place well you might find sympathy from other Teamsters and other parts of the country and where they say up to Chicago is going on strike it we we will go on strike but why don't we all call in sick you know for a few days\nI wouldn't be surprised if you see that I mean this this is this has the potential to be really\nBad for UPS just does the does the ah I I wouldn't be surprised if UPS goes back to the union and says look we need to clean this up especially in light of what Amazon has done\nRight right to Fifteen bucks an hour you can't have a minimum wage of Thirteen compete\nAh speaking of which UPS though is going to have something called brown friday that's this Friday October nineteenth and if you're looking for jobs should hold at something else you know like the name it doesn't sound good well brown friday\nOr they're gonna meet directly with job seekers and they expect to hire a hundred thousand seasonal employees at these fairs\nYes they're expecting to bring in a one hundred thousand employees pretty much all in one day you know um where are they going to get him I this is a big my big questions all these companies that want to hire seasonally I don't know where they're going to find the workers because a lot of the people that they used to be able to get have full time jobs now and so\nI Can't hire illegals\nThey have to have all kinds of documentation and paperwork I think there's going to be real questions here and look to talk about the scale UPS needs to ramp up too they deliver forty million packages of day during peak times forty million packages they it's it's absolutely nuts how crazy it gets a starting in late November So they're trying\nTo wrap this up early\nI Wonder if any of this Teamsters stuff plays in and I wonder if you have you know people standing outside of these places and they don't go into like I haven't heard anything from FedEx either have a\nMuch smaller than any anything no they usually do I think about forty to fifty thousand a year\nI over the last three years thirty five percent of UPS is seasonal hires were given a permanent position when the holidays rover that's pretty good\nIt is pretty solid I mean again with with these types of jobs to be able to say hey look if I Am in the top you know third of quote my class that you end up with a full time gig out of it it's not a bad place to be I I Do think like I I Wonder how many people will look at what's going on with the Teamsters and said gee I don't know if I Want to be a part\nOf that though applications to us business schools total one hundred and forty thousand eight hundred and sixty four year twenty Eighteen that is a decline of six point six percent from a hundred and fifty thousand the previous year\nWhy are less people applying to business school they used to be kind of the thing you would do you go to you do your four years at Dartmouth and you'd worked for anywhere from three to five years and then you would apply to grad school millennials taking a different route\nSo business schools are saying that it's because of the amount of undergraduate student loan debt or that a lot of students are carrying their saying that's the primary reason why you don't have as many people going to business school\nI Would make the case that since the economy is better than it was five years ago a lot of people are saying look I previously might have had to go back in order to get the extra wages I needed right maybe I don't need to because things are strong enough now that I don't feel I get the bank for my buck\nIs business school the ... have the same a credibility that may have had twenty or Thirty years ago twenty
