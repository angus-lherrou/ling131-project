the FBI continues a week long investigation in Canada second accuser was interviewed yesterday Republican Senator Tom cotton supports the nominee and told CBS\nAnd everyone sitting there going okay what's your direction going to be now it's ... we had a you know it's not going to change another six months we we still don't know where this company is going in the future now I don't know a whole lot about a cult other than you know we spend time and Dan her obviously\nI'm you know it's look you got to hope that they get this one right 'cause honestly if they get it wrong at this point\nYou sit there and you say ... where does this company go then and they're not going to go out of business you know this is this is not a company that is hemorrhaging cash but it's a company\nThat needs to figure out how to grow and so they're not making enough money to pay their dividend though for it no but that's different from hemorrhaging cash you know ... testable is hemorrhaging cache of you on must have not gotten this settlement\n... there was a problem with you know is that company going to exist\nGE he does not have a problem of have this company going to exist they will they're they're not going to go out of business so we don't need to get you know to that point\nBut GE he does have a case where hey if you want to have a future where you're growing and you're going to attract top talent you got away with a vision to get there and\nOne thing forever and never did and and I was critical for ... what are you going to do like what's going to be that killer was here on it you have that no one else can do\nWe never got an answer to that he never message we never got an answer to that question it was just well we're going to go through a strategic ...\nTell me what you want to do what you want to do what do you want to be good at\nIran Musk wants to make cars and he settled quite surprisingly on Saturday we're the spirit of conversation about Tesla and yuan Musk on friday\nAnd hey Chuck may have been questioning his sanity for turning down to deal with the SEC especially now when you look at the terms of the original offer from the SEC I think it was very generous\nWhat it was it was going to be a ten million dollar fine and he was going to have to step away is the chairman of the board for two years\nWhat now happens is that he has to pay a twenty million dollar fines of twice as big Tesla has to pay a twenty million dollar fine as well now that find becomes four times as big he gets an additional year away from being the chairman of the board so he's got a three year ban on that position\nAnd he also has to have\n... and quite literally Twitter supervision ... he needs someone to supervise him when tweeting\nWe're now you're in a way of life you that maybe he could share somebody with the president you know the president could have ... ... it's not a fulltime job right have you seen that much you on the streets [laughter] he won't be too much now\nBut uh so you will get this and this takes off the table I think the worst case scenario for Tesla which was that they can't fund raise and they're out of business by near the spring they still have some hurdles declare\nBut look this company as a going concern probably is not something that is you know imminent and that this company is going out of business but\nThey still have to figure out how to make cars profitably they still have to figure out you know if they have the demand in every year for four hundred thousand vehicles um and then you know just on who they might bring in ... have you heard anything on the rumor mill or which are the the chair words eats that opened up or the chairman heroin role\nThat's an important job because it's got to be somebody who's strong enough there's got to be very intelligent and they have to be able to stand up to you or mosque and say no you're not doing\nDo you think they need to be from this world the the kind of start up high tech world you know I think\nI think they need to spring manufacturing guy in the like uh somebody from Boeing\nUm what was the guy that ran for for years uh McNally a bomb the low alley Malawi allowing it can be a good fit their you know somebody that mosque would respect but understands the automobile business and supply chains and and manufacturing because that's\nThe their big issues they make it seem to remember about Tesla is they make a car in which there is a waiting list you want to buy a Tesla Model S remodeled three there's a waiting list that shows that they've got a good product\nThe problem is they have not been executing and yet somebody who's been proven winter in that capacity Aloul he's probably too old he's got to be close to eighty now\nI question though the waiting list though there who are way they're still not making cars for thirty five thousand there's been a lot of people turning turning down the ability to get all your waiting list because the only ones they're selling or forty five thousand up and people are saying look I don't you can't get I didn't want to buy a fifty two thousand dollar ... but you still can't get a fifty two thousand dollar watch go out\nGo out to next fall a year from now\nI don't know if you have much of a waiting list and and and that's the question that I always had his okay great you're going to sell five hundred thousand of these\nDo you have the demand for five hundred thousand more every year right 'cause that's what they were saying and and I I question that because when you look at\nThe vehicles people are buying today the most popular vehicles out there aren't the Toyota Corolla and the camera and the Honda Accord and the Ford Fusion it's not what people were buying today right people are buying route fours they're buying Honda see RVs they're buying Nissan robes and Tesla doesn't offer anything that competes with those anywhere near that\nPrice explain what this nine hundred and twenty million dollar convertible bond coming due in March is this is a big one is is\nYou know I think what may have happened I think I think he won must probably really wanted to fight the SCC and and I think what may have happened is the financial ramifications of that fight may have dawned on him because he's worth what twenty thirty billion dollars in that ballpark but it is tied up in Tesla's stock\nIt is I think he probably recognize that she you know this stock I'd go to twenty bucks a share in which case I'm wiped out in terms of my network\nSo here's the big funding question that test will has has they have this nearly nine hundred or nearly billion dollar\nConvertible bond that comes due in March splits a convertible bond so pretty much the way it works if the stock is above a certain price is simply converts into stock and they don't have to roll over and repay that debt they don't have to write a check for no they don't ... it comes it comes to knock and boom you don't have to worry about you know refinancing into\nIf it is below a certain price though that that does effectively expire and they have to go and raise capital in order to pay that off in his shoe new debt that's a tough\nBut that means they have to raise their prices their stock is up sixteen percent today truck and in order to avoid writing the check it has to go to three hundred and sixty bucks\nYeah so there are three o seven to share right now they've got to get north of three sixty effectively in order for this to convert equity and for them to not have to raise additional capital it's it's a real question I've been talking about this for about six months now if the stock is below that price it's going to be a little bit of a challenge for them to raise that\nCapital speculation that ah you know you get you get a chairman who's an adult right you've got to Sheryl Sandberg somebody that that can run in and work with the lawn\nAnd then you get another investor yet apple that says well we're going to buy a hundred billion dollars worth of the stock and and we're going to be a big player in tests or we're going to allow hundred billion dollars companies only worth fifty\n[noise] yeah ... ... well let's see how they bite chunk of Tesla right enough to get control the board how it wouldn't cost that\nWouldn't have much wouldn't happen went up to you on still controls so much of the company he's still got thirty percent of the company [noise] yeah but he's his powers been neutered\nSomewhat you know it's again this is this is a it just slightly big deal but it's like there's not a whole lot that's going to change here in my opinion we watch a couple of new boards like I look at it and I I go you won't get off the lightly just chairman\nOh you do get a very lightly but the chairman role I think is is really going to be interesting to watch I I if they do that right\nThen that could be a ... that could spell success for the company 'cause it would also it would a lay the fears of investors they'd say okay what do you eat we got it right we got a ... type person in there or\nYou got to get someone who's going to come in and not take any crap from me All right and and that's going to be it's gonna be tough to find because you on his ... you know whether you like him or hate him he's for medical you know most people don't like it the most people don't like working with him\nYeah it's it is you still get his executive is going to be interesting to see who they can get to come in and fill that role because it's it's a tough task\nUp next we'll be talking about what used to be called NAFTA it's no longer called ... is thinking about changing the name to parks and tacos\nWhat about the United states what do we get that you know we've got to think of something

I Would say I would\nThink automobile manufacturing myself you know maybe you're bringing a German I like I even ... even ... I Will\nGet it also do you you know that's the first place that you look what are the issues with Tesla all manufacturing related\nI think a lot of them are I think they've got great innovation in terms of their product right so I don't think you have this I I don't think people are going to say well the the products terrible he I think you have to say how do we make the product I mean I looked at the head count to build a Tesla versus the headcount to build a Cadillac there\nAnd it was a multiple Chuck I think it's like sixteen or Seventeen people touched every Tesla and I think it was four or five people were touching every Cadillac because\nThe other tests all his biggest problem right now is credibility I think that as as big if not a bigger problem than the manufacturing it's just because they've always had manufacturing issues ...\nRight but yet like in order to be profitable you have to overcome those you got to bring your expenses down they only have one facility that they manufacture them I I think it's just how\nComplex their vehicles are you know when you when you design you know an SUV that instead of having normal doors they open you know these ... it's like what the heck are you that was a dumb design decision but that but again that's not a manufacturing problem that's why we decided we wanted to say okay we need to be that cool like they got a credibility problem they\nWhat they have never delivered a single product on time and under budget\nI Know never [noise] why more Social Security recipients will see a real raise in twenty Nineteen we're estimating that the raise is going to be what two and a half to three percent print somewhere in that ballpark yeah so that means if the average payment\nIs fourteen hundred dollars ego three percent already five bucks yeah\nYou know the the unknown is is how much Medicare part B and Medicare part D as in David will increase this year plus your met a gap coverage ... typically a retiree is paying Medicare part B\nA there and at least Medicare part D as in David so how if those two premium increases are modest then maybe they'll be okay yeah\nIt's it's it's likely going to be the case that additional Medicare premiums eat up a chunk of that extra forty five dollars might be anywhere from a third to half of it then you get an extra twenty five bucks a month\nHey maybe your met a gap policy eats up a decent chunk of that as well so you might end up getting an extra ten to Fifteen bucks a month when he finally made it out right it's not a lot\nRight well we are those announces when we get the I think it's in October that we get the Medicare an outside\nSo leave so I don't know the exact date that we get them I think it's it's not as an allergy to four weeks yeah now\nRight [laughter] a red ink floods vi peel market this is a danger sign for stocks in my estimation more than eighty percent Chuck of us lifted initial public offerings and this year the first three quarters\nInvolve companies that lost money in the twelve months leading up to their debut so just think about it you're you're getting all excited about buying stock in a company that's going public\nAnd I and you know a lot of ... come to mind because of where we're located but ... percent of them are losing money we haven't seen numbers like this in a long time\nKnow in in this speaks to a fundamental change that we've seen in markets in the last decade um because this is different from what we've seen previously there there's always some companies that IPO's when they're losing money I mean it's it's part of the game like occasionally you see that\nBut what's interesting now is it's not just that you have companies that are losing money as they go public ...\nYou have companies

retirement may not be too far away for you and I saw an article by Lorrie Cornish him CNBC they talked about retirees going back to school good morning worry welcome to the show\nThat morning thank you so what ah why would a retiree you after they've wound down their career ended up going back to college at the conclusion of their working career\nWell why not retiring ... are you know holding on for a time in ... are active they are looking to stay engaged from one of the way of making sure that it by recalling their education\nSo it turns out that there are many options for someone who's looking at that and the good news is that it doesn't have to cut you a fortune\n... immigrants out yes some schools actually allow seniors to audit the classes free of charge that they\nAll community colleges\nAre programs that are available that yeah yeah\nAnd what's this ... program though I was reading it the it out act actually Berkshire community college all oh shirt lifelong learning Institute\nA lifelong learning is a work of one hundred twenty kids colleges and universities across the country that receive grant grid Bernard a shirt foundation and its\nLifelong learning programs that\nAllow you to become a number and then take classes throughout the year so these are classes that you know membership like at Berkshire for example around you know sixty dollars a year early or a membership and then ... ... dollars or class so it's really a fraction of the class that I'm On my\nPay if they were you know going back to school to answer here at the ... circuit that get these are programs that where you're not doing that but you're engaged long and learning and you know ... people\n... ... when I was in college I remember a number of my professors were retired CEOs I went to business school and they were you know the retired CEO of maybe Kodak or something like that are you seeing colleges and universities embrace retirees is professors are instructors\nWell at least lifelong learning and um\nIt many times it inside of the teachers so they are engaged in planning the programming and the colonel teachers and they also you know encourage mentors ship so if you're someone who's a retired lawyer for example they might\nHelp you connect with someone who wants to pursue that career so that you can provided by to them and sort of help them along as they curse that career\nVery interesting this sounds like this is the future of retirement continue going back to college I\nMean it sounds like a lot of fun for the people I talk to you you know there was a woman who had a career in theater and was able to continue to not only teach her or him another woman who has her attire earlier than she thought and because of the medical condition but was able to\nReally

E. employee Thirteen months into his tenure they say yeah you're not getting it done you're out of here you know it\nMight just be something where he eventually reached the level where\nHe couldn't cut it at that level you see it you see them sports in awful lot of give you the example of you look at football teams you know there are a lot of guys out there that are really good often for defensive coordinators that just can't be had coaches you know and it's not it's it's not a criticism of damage\nI work at a guy you know like Wade ... has had to read coaching jobs didn't do particularly well either one but it but it's just phenomenal defensive coordinator\nFlattery might be that guy where he says look but I'm In charge of a division give them clear directives and he can execute perfectly but he might not have the vision to be a CEO it might not have the personality to be one\nSo I look at the last three had Welsh and melt inflammatory all insiders now you go outside the company [noise]\nKind of had to in this case right you think and I think you had to I mean this is when when you have a situation like this where you need\nYou need to get people excited and thinking different wing of the same thinking hasn't worked for the last Twenty years maybe everybody pretty much since jak wealth left now things have tons of steadily gone downhill it hasn't been a very pretty picture I think you had to look ex turtle on\nThis one well they are they certainly did copper extends it's losing streak and the third quarter somewhat of a surprise when you say oh I'm In what way\nJust the ... you think about uh you know the uh the advent\nOf electric cars they use a lot of copper though I'm more copper and those products seat think housings pretty strong but evidently maybe maybe manufacturing is not as strong as we were led to believe I think\nThe the big thing when you look at who uses the most cop or is it is China\nUm they account for about half of the world's copper demand largely because of all the construction that's going on there in China's growth has been slowly over the last couple of years exacerbated a little bit this year by the trade war going on between the U.S and China we've talked about the impacts\nThat these tariffs have on the Chinese economy simply because they export so much to the United states and I think that's been a key reason why you're seeing some slack and in demand in ... uh cycling topper demand coming from China in this\nCase you are is a good point do you call it the ... China manufacturing purchasers index here okay sure um it's heavily weighted towards small private firms that fell to fifty from fifty one in August ending Fifteen straight months of expansion\nYeah fifty means that it's effectively ... neutral as far as growth versus expansion\nWhich means their economies these I don't know if you can call it ... you wouldn't say it's in recession would do you just say it's slowing\nDown it's heading there you know it certainly is heading there and and and that's you know when when you fall from fifty one to fifty of saying hey we're going from growth to neutral\nThe next step there and you've seen this you know you've seen this now for a couple of months was slowing and these numbers ... ... you wouldn't be surprised if you start to see contraction and a couple of areas\nAnd there were some a trial balloons floated by the Chinese central bank over the last couple of days saying hey we're ready to step in with monetary policy if need be in order to keep things they'll float here what does that mean\nA unclear at this point a historically when you talk about what it means with regards to China it's a lot more with um the reserve ratios and things along those lines than necessarily changing interest rates just because they are packed to the dollar any any ways\nBut it might just be hey you don't need to keep as much in reserve from a lending perspective we can lend a little bit more in order to encourage a little bit\nMore than one day if China is slowing down wouldn't that logically lead to a decrease in the price of oil because demand for oil would go down in ...\nIn theory yes but I don't think that you have the\nI I think the mechanics of the oil market are changing and I think that we are entering into a phase where over the next five to ten years the world is going to go from being unit polar as it's been for the last twenty five years since the Berlin Wall fell and I think you are moving into a multi polar\nA set up where it's not necessarily black and white like it's been for the last twenty five years you're going to see two separate but you are seeing two separate blocks developing between the U.S and China and come in countries that fall in line behind them\nBut the those countries whether they're behind China or whether the behind the United states are still consuming oil except\nWhat currency is purchased it does make a difference you know if\nIf you use the ... and I think you are going to see a shift where countries that do not have their long term strategic interests linked with the U.S are going to move more towards the Chinese side of things and I think that that is going to have a very real and very meaningful effect on the dollar over the next five to ten years what\nAre your
