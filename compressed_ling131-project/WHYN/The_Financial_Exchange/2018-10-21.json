to talk or I'd love to talk Bruins but uh I I I Do have to touch on that a patriot chief game last week which was by far one of the most exciting football games I've watched it a long time and like I'm not even\nA you know take if you take the patriots head off if you weren't a patriots fan and you watched that game from beginning to end the way that things started in the way it's finished I'm\nStill putting off a building that dream home [noise]\nNow the perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider will find you a loan them the right for\nCall us today

just\nTalking about the NFL how I think there are a lot of teams that are maybe\nBetter I'm Better than they'd\nAnd the chargers just one on what was just sort of a bone headed thing I think by the titans I mean I'm all for people getting aggressive but when you're down one with thirty second ... in case you missed it ... it was a seven point game\nThe titans go all the way down the field they scored a touchdown\nWith thirty seconds left and the game and instead of just kicking the extra point and go into overtime they go for two twice and didn't get it either timed it gives the first one there was a penalty which they accepted so they went for it twice didn't get it either time and then once I kicked it didn't get it and and the chargers won\nA so sort of bone headed of but been bowling that had to eat just now to do look now but here come the chargers\nToday's when puts them at five in two\nAnd you look at their schedule their losses are the chiefs and the rams okay two very good teams but they're wins the bills the niners\nRaiders the browns and the titans yuk you could argue that for those teams is the worst teams really do the bills niners raiders and brown\nI'm so you know again Philip ... rivers out there in San Diego but not garde numbers uh you know and then ... come playoff time he starts to ... meet some real good teams and then you never know [noise]\nUm so so I Want to go back to the patch uh chief's game if I could real quick because I first of all I thought it was the most exciting game I've seen a long time\nI think the Sony Michel is really fun to watch 'em and uh I you know usually I blame Andy Reid for screwing things up at the end and he made a couple of bone headed move snow but nothing that really costs in the game\nI was just I was so amazed that you know the chiefs where all the way down the field and scored on like two plays and they left three minutes of time left on the clock and ... while they're giving Tom Brady three minutes\nBut I mean what are you supposed to do there I mean that was what like Seventy five yard pass for touchdown with three minutes left in the game to take the lead in the fourth quarter\nLike Asian and you can't ask that guy to like like cut back in ... and like taking me at the two\nShe can kill more time in Denton scored the talk shows like so I mean what do you do there like you can't not score but you also can't leave Tom Brady three minutes of time and\nThat's unfortunately the rock and a hard place that the chief found himself and um but again you know ... what bothers me about the patriots defensively that game is they knew and I knew and you knew and everybody knew that this chief team wanted\nUh to to get the big play that was the idea was to get the big play and that's the only thing that had to defend and yet they they still couldn't figure it out they gave a big play after big play after big play so like when you know that's why you have to do defensively and you can't get it done that to me is where the problem is\nUm I think it'll be interesting today with Michel ... a quarterback for the bears a I got to the here's a young kid with a lot of hype it a lot of talent and I think could actually be legit I'm going up against the ... I think for the first time that's always a challenge for young quarterbacks\nUm you know and at this point ... got some film on them so\nI don't know if I'm the bears I tried my best to get the ball to do the running back Jordan Howard and and try to run the ball as much as I can ... again he want to do if you're the bears you want to do with the lions that\nAgainst the patriots you want to be able to run the ball\nKill time dominate time of possession\nKeep the ball away from Tom Brady and it's funny as I say that you're come the keys to the gate run bears Ron ... exactly right I mean exactly right a run the ball in the patriots there's just a susceptible to run they're going to run all over today\nAnd uh they they can be in trouble because they can't score without the ball so that's where the that's where it gets tough\nA Red Sox look this is going to be fun um uh as I said I'm I'm On board I'm On the bandwagon um because it's the world series and that's how I operate no I I I I think this has been fun um I I think that this team is is really really unique and special one of a guide you wouldn't\nThe games and the regular season that's awesome it's another thing to get to the playoffs and you have um you know they say that like what a ... there was a perfect game like it never happens without a couple of really good defensive plays\nA couple a lucky breaks right and that sort of been the the the story of the playoffs for me for the red Sox I mean not catch bending tend to be made to end the game was\nPerfect it was perfect it was it was talking about destiny although your destiny guy but man when you see a couple of breaks go like that um man oh man that that's that is nice to see\nSo um I I think the hard part for the red Sox was over it doesn't mean you don't you don't sell to close it out 'cause they do\nBut I think that the the other thing that Houston's the best team that they've played that's the best team that they're going to play and ah and now he but now you gotta ... out of the expectations of change do they need to win the world series\nOr and you got a closed without the against the against the Dodgers and by the way I'm so glad it's the Dodgers I don't know the Dodgers from the brewers but it would just be so uninteresting for playing Milwaukee\nMilwaukee no Red Sox Dodgers that's the way it should be [noise]\nFor me I'm an array

whether or not if you've already done you're planning if your trust is drafted properly and if you are just beginning the process of thinking about putting a plan in place\nTo protect those assets from long term care expenses this guy will give you a good baseline on what must be included in your ...\nUs as well as sixteen different provisions that absolutely cannot be included in your your

forty eight five six nine nine you can also visit our website legal exchange show doc Conway you can download our guides can download our podcast and you can submit your questions are tied to answer on the air\nSo Susan let's talk about this first story both of these interestingly enough deal with life estates\nThis one ... dad comes in and and explains that you know the houses in a nominee realty trust and reserved a life a state son or is the trustee and I believe son is the beneficiary and the nominee realty trust ...\n... ... it didn't really need the nominee realty trust here it was a complete flow through to the sun the sons the beneficiary\nAnd and the dad has a life a state All right I'm okay with that I I don't love that arrangement but he did it and we're probably not going to disrupt the based on the age of the father about this a juncture so\nAll the other assets are explained to me to be owned jointly with the sun\nExcept the life insurance policy and and their biggest concern was well what assets are exempt here from the state recovery\nAnd you know the answer the quick answer is well all of the assets are exempt from the state recovery because they're all going to avoid probing ... let me explain what a state recovery is and then let me explain all the other problems they're not thinking about here right\nI said well\nA life a state is something that you keep which is the right to live there are a property right mhm and when you die that goes away but because all you have is that life a state that it expires when you die it avoids probate you'd it passes immediately outside of probate to the\nRemainder men in this case the son who\nHas the remainder interest through the nominee real to trust like okay that that's why that avoids probate and remember everything in Massachusetts anyway and in most states but you need to check with your state here\nThat avoids probate then avoids the estate recovery because in Massachusetts a state recovery and when I say a state recovery I mean mass health saying hey we want to be paid back\nFrom the state of the deceit and\nFor what ever mass health benefits we provided to the deceit and while he was in the nursing home mhm that's a state recovery but they can only get paid back\nFrom the deceit in probate estate okay and things that avoid probate in this case our life estates and jointly owned bank accounts and jointly owned brokerage accounts with the sun all will avoid probate so they'll avoid the state recovery yeah\nAnd the life insurance policy will have a designated beneficiary so it will avoid probate\nJust as if you had an IRA you'd also have a beneficial and that avoiding probate\nExactly like that so now I I I have great I explained to them I go so you see all of this will avoid probate but I think we have a much bigger problem here than that and I assume that's why you're here because\nWhat you've done has not really done anything to protect the assets from the nursing home if that gets sick so there'll be no need for a state recovery 'cause he won't cars on Medicaid to begin with and and I think that's the part people you don't want to put the cart before the horse here right\nIn this case you got to say well what can we protect from the nursing home and after that might be in the nursing home and passes away\nThose assets cannot be taken again for a state recovery his\nQuestion sounds like it would have been a trick question on the bar exam you never get to that point if a a ... and you know what I think that you folks need to request a copy of Todd's guide\nThat he's written for the month of October it's designing in income only ... trust and it is a good baseline for you an excellent guide if you are considering protecting those assets\nFrom long term care expenses you can request year copy right now of Todd's designing an income only ... trust guide\nBy calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or visit our website legal exchange show dot com to download your ... died\nAnd so what are some of the other problems that are going on here that they really maybe weren't thinking about\nSo first and foremost what is protected from the nursing home anyway I Would argue that at least the life a state arrangement that they did while I don't like it and when you stay tuned for the second real life story you're going to see why we really don't like this arrangement\n'em now also the revolt will trust will allow you to direct how when when your nieces and nephews get the assets ...\nAnd and and that's important because you know maybe you want a divorce proof for for them maybe one creditor protected for them maybe there's things you want to do with these assets to protect them or to control them from the grave\nAnd the revolt ... trust in this example will do that now when you were a vocal trust would do that as well\nBut I'm Still kind of focused on the revolt couple so those would be too important reasons probate and how to get it to them maybe help excluded from their state for a state tax purposes as well as skip a generation maybe control it for the uh great nieces and nephews as well\nAnd if she doesn't have any plan in place right now including a well those assets those wouldn't land with her niece's they will go to a different succession plan right well\nI'm not really sure if you don't have a well you're you're you're correct you'd have to look to the interstate succession statute in it might be\nThey would go to the next closest next of kin which you know probably not parents if she's Seventy nine but that would be next right then it would be siblings so the fact that she's got nieces and nephews were telling me that she does have siblings and unless they pre deceased her um than those\nAssets we'll go to siblings first right and you're never really want to leave it across the generation you always want to leave it down a generation to save taxes\nAnd not to mention her siblings are probably the same age that she is in maybe have a Shia nursing homes\nAnd it could be a nursing home issue in the last comment would\nWhy not do that your vocal trust what she does have a decent amount of long term care insurance coverage which I think is helpful number one not enough to cover the full boat\nBut again having no immediate children her immediate need might not be all yeah it's very important that I save assets from the nursing home for my nieces and nephews more you know whatever's left they can have\nWell if that's the case then you don't coupled with the long term care insurance I'd probably be leaning towards the revolt couple of trust plan for her let's hang up based on this this fact\nBut some type of trust planned Brenda because you want to avoid probing you want to make sure those assets go where you want them to\nFolks if you are considering creating an eerie vocal trusting you're not sure really what you should be looking for when you sit down with the attorney that's going to draft your documents\nTodd has created a guide for the month of October it's titled designing and income only ... trust and it includes six provisions that absolutely must be in your ear evoke about trust and fix the provisions that absolutely must not\nBe included it's a great baseline to educate yourself on how these trust work folks\nYou can risk last year free copy of Todd's designing your eerie vulnerable trust guide\nBy calling eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six

Medicaid consider fair market value when selling a home would it be the assessed value I'd like to purchase my mother's home from her and she is willing to sell it to me\nAt a discount however I don't want to run into any issues down the road as she is in failing health well\nDon I'm going to start off by saying I'm not loving the idea of you buying the whole\nRight I mean can you buy the home and in fact I I had a student in my class asked a similar question what is fair market value and you know what if you sell the home right before you go to the nursing home is that going to be a disqualifying transfer\nIf I sell it for fair market value or if I sell it for less than fair market value\nWell certainly if you do anything in terms of transferring assets and not get back fair market value it will be a disqualifying transfer mhm so that's number one in terms of answering that kind of question number two what is fair market value\nThe assessed value will do it ... for a mass health purposes anyway for Medicaid purposes so\nThey only require the most recent real estate tax bill value okay to be considered fair market value\nWhich I think in most cases probably less than less than what I could sell it for\nI think so you get a little bone Arthur discount by buying it uh at at that value I wouldn't go lower than that because then it would fall below what is that fair market value threshold and it would create\nA disqualifying transfer mhm for Medicaid eligibility and what that means Donna is if you did let's say you bought it for a dollar you see these people and I bought it for a dollar\n... you didn't buy it for a dollar it was a gift right and so now you have a five year waiting period for Medicaid eligibility and based on this question anyway it doesn't appear that we have five years mhm ah with with whatever moms failing health means so\nWhy don't you like the idea of her buying a house or time\nWell so and so it's just so finished I saw it outright well okay let's say she does by than she does agree to buy for fair market value\nIt doesn't help mom get on Medicaid it might not be a disqualifying transfer but now mom has whatever it is three hundred thousand four hundred thousand or whatever the value of the house is ... oh now mom has those dollars sitting in her bank account right so all you did was swap one asset for another\nAnd it doesn't help you get eligible for Medicaid mhm uh in fact I was I said it's it's sometimes a little harder to protect dollars right and it is just to say it's the home and it's automatically non accountable because it's your primary residence that's one of the last minute techniques that we preach about uh on the on the on the show so\nI'm not excited about it but if she feels that that's the way for her to get the house and maybe the the daughter needs a place to live and just wants peace of mind then yeah you could buy it but it doesn't really help at the end of the day right now mom's gonna have to set up either a medicated annuity\nIf she gets the for failing health and puts her in a nursing home sooner rather than later I'm or we're going to have to set up a pool trust to transfer the assets to to get on Medicaid yeah we could still get on Medicaid and there'll be a pay back provision ah for these types of plans but at least we'll get on Medicaid so\nYeah Johnny you might want to consider I'm having a conversation with someone about what the best really solution would be based on why you are considering buying that home with mom and making sure that things are position properly\nFolks if you have a question you would like to ask Todd visit our website legal exchange show dot com click on the asked Todd tat\nMaybe we'll be able to read your question on the
