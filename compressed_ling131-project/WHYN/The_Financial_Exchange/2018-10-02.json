there the ... that's where they got their five hundred million if we lost space sex hustler you don't wanna lose that's national security right I think he's I I actually get the guy credit I think he realizes\nThe government needs him more than he needs the government and oh by the way you know one of the government do after the stock got slaughtered\nIn Moscow like well that's too bad government came back and said you know what we can make this work [laughter]\nI Know you said no deal but let's kind of get let's let's make this work I think we need them more than he needs\nUs it's an interesting theory they ah ten things to know about the NAFTA deal going to tell you the a lot of a noise is being made over this deal and then I looked at the damn thing not much different\nI said as I say it's nothing\nLike it we went from having access to two point eight five percent of Canada's dairy market to three point one five or so directly like we still don't have access to the dairy market\nUm and they were actually kind of mad that they have to give up like zero point five oh yeah we're giving into trouble and watch the uh the one thing that that's actually pretty good in there I think is especially from a national security standpoint is our cars now have to have Seventy five percent of their parts\nMade in North America\nAnd that's going to be phased in over five years but I Do like the idea is there are certain things that I think we do is there's too many places where we've [noise] um [noise] ...\nAnd did and an offshore on ... dangerous I'll give an example but um your your kids ever have strep throat where or when they're oh yeah you know all that stuff comes from China really know\nWhy it should not know that yeah so imagine you know like ... where to trade war with China you're right\nYou do we really want to get into like we we don't make any of that stuff for rabies any correct so yeah that's that's a whole separate issue and it's very important Seventy I you know you talked about the fact Seventy five percent of auto components must be built in North America\nRight now the requirement of sixty two and a half percent right so that's a bad I looked at as being pretty significant I I Would say the President Trump okay that's a that's a when I put that in the wind call it's incremental and Israeli increment even then it's phased in over five years\nDoes it also tell you how big a business dairy is though that there was this much squabbling about that yeah and both sides are saying wow this is a really big deal apparently Barry is a\nPretty big business yup well of course we have about every day or use it every day yeah cheese you know ... ... ... yeah exactly you know I mean dairy is a big deal um and we made some progress in that so that's good yeah I I thought another issue that kind of I didn't think it was that big a deal but apparently is that forty five percent of workers\nMust make sixteen dollars an hour or more that struck me as very honor is pay well it's a big deal in Mexico\nTrue that that's where in John has the Mexican workers in it you know like maybe because I'm counting the U. S. everybody's making over six right but in Mexico everybody's making five true and I wonder if that does something to well\nBasically the civil war than going on in Mexico may Mexico you talking about a violent place like don't go there on vacation yeah just don't know but I also wonder if in Mexico would be that affected by it because if we\nCount all the workers in Canada and we can count all the workers in the United states and then we add the huge factories in next true\nAnd also just yelled at ... at the margin this could keep a lot of jobs from going down there in the future I think that's the big concern yeah I think from Mexico's perspective they they they're they're looking at it and saying that the one thing that I'll mention though you average price of a new car\nOver thirty six thousand bucks now yeah and that brings us back to ... this is your NAFTA deal that we negotiated is going to make cars it won't be long before the average price of the new vehicles forty forty five thousand bucks and no one's going to buy him that well they're not buying them now I Know like if you look now\nEvery everybody but my next car is going to be used vehicle yeah I'm just not going to spend that kind of do on a new car that spread between the new car and the high quality used cars\nIs now a very very substantial spread ... it's moved a lot of people to the used car market particularly with some of these really high quality leases and we were low mileage and and in low miles\nNext topic that we're gonna talk about is is um China and how they systematically pride technology from U.S companies I saw this story\nI guess it was last week I saw it but we're going to be joined by Bob Davis\nAnd Bob's going to explain to us what China what kind of pressure China exerts on American companies that want to do business in China Starbucks comes to mind you're a big company that does a lot of business and try and they basically\nAre they've got 'em over a barrel

way mode is the name of the company that's a subsidiary that Google owns a they're planning to launch a public commercials service without anyone in the driver's seat\nNot an experiment they're actually going to roll it out and are there to be a taxi driver in Phoenix or a limo driver and the ah probably standing by saying oh let's see this work\nAh probably nervous that it it does work I'll think about it right like if you're over what is in overdrive or get Seventy five percent of the gross\nIs that I I'm I'm not sure I think that's what it orders okay so you take out that driver right now I'm just thinking what Google could do to undercut prices like say you live in a Sun City and you're going to the airport\nAnd that is normally a hundred dollar ride you know in a taxi or ... ...\n... what to cut costs you will do fifty twenty five I mean Google that's true but it is the whole cost of the service is ah the employees yeah Google coyote ... out of business as they roll this
