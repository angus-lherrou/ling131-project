{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "There even walk or hit by a pitch so every rotten that costs the plate was a freebie I'm like that's that's really annoying\nBut what are the chances that as bad as this patriots pitching staff and the and the the bullpen and particular as bad as they are what are the chances of that is going to happen again I mean statistically it's impossible and I know very landers good and then ... then you're playing Garrett coal\nAnd you're going to have to see Dallas title but this off and so the red Sox was too good I mean they only had three hits last night so it's the same question what are the chances that over the course of the next six games\nThe red Sox are held only three hits I just I find it hard to believe statistically and just based on the line up\nSo I don't know when you factor in both those things again like I said when you take all that suck\nAnd you spend it all on one game or maybe that's a good use already right you take the game film and whether it's in football you take the game film and you're like buried in the back yard you never look at it as good get all of that garbage packed into one nine inning game and then move on because I just I don't\nThink that statistically either of those two are getting terminal events to me those were the biggest problems that game I mean you could talk about and bought a new new as a third um you can talk about the way that ah the way that guy Cora got thrown out of the game there's a lot of different support the things that you can talk to talk about that happened in that game yesterday but\nTo me that the the two biggest things that stood out where you only had three hits and you gave away fourteen free bases and I just I don't I don't see that really happening again um so I I I again I I'm\nNot I don't know I Do not like I'm predicting guy like over the red Sox and seven I I don't know I'm not going to play that Gary pretend to know I'm going to just go based on what I'm seeing\nAnd um I think they'll be All right I think there'll be All right um I don't see either of these two horrible performances happening again and I say that knowing that David prices going to the mound tonight\nI'm mildly thing to watch out for is that they don't have a game three star yet and if David Price doesn't go along\nYou know you're going to have options like evil the and pour cello and ... Rodriguez any rod and you're going to have to decide if prices can only go to winnings today you're going to decide\nWhich one of those guys you want to go to and then who's going to start game three so it'll be interesting hopefully it's ... or you have to worry about it as much as Red Sox fans hate David Price would they love 'em to go out and mow guys down for seven innings I mean they would all external take that\nI'm so it'll be interesting today it's seven ... seven ten price against Garrett coal in game two a patriots chiefs tonight about eight thirty start there um I Want to just to bring up the the main thing that I think folks should look at I mean first of all get a good look at this quarterback Patrick moms or he is excellent\nAnd uh it's probably going to be ... a long time as long as the anti Reid doesn't screw it up\nWhich of course is more than possible um uh I well I'm On an anti react because I did promise I play this audio uh I think that any resource culturally now almost because all the other bad coaches have been fired it's pretty much human Marvin Lewis in Cincinnati or the worst\nUm and do you know how many times a A N e readers lost a Tom Brady like I don't know what the numbers because I was bored and it took too much of my time to go back in the archives and find out how many times Tom Brady\nHas curb stopped and he reads teams and so any reads talking about the game upcoming and this is what he had to say\nAnd they've got a heck of a football team Corvallis not too bad that you know he's a he's a good player so following all it's a it's a great organization um should be a great atmosphere for a football game\n[laughter] that's pretty good and\nA quarter of a void that team's pretty good\nQuarterback yeah the team in the quarterback that have kicked your rear end for the last Fifteen Years damn cake your rear end and you read and you're still like there were ... not too bad\nThat you know the quarterback took home for the court that oh my God that was my and toads that was a fan I Would be like debt this\nGet this loser out of here like that so I didn't even Pete Carroll's one things but that's so ... [laughter] ... [laughter] you know it it's great I Love ... will say ... [laughter] I mean that's what they read this like\n... not too bad that you know that that the bats due to you are going to get your doors blown off tonight if that's the way that the chiefs are are approaching this game based on their head coach [laughter] separating [laughter] here's pretty [laughter] they're\nGoing to get destroyed and I can't wait I'll stay up 'til twelve thirty at night watching it um but the one thing that you do need to watch for on the field that that aid to read or will eventually probably screw up um is just the speed\nAt the skill positions for the chiefs against the age of your defensive players covering them\nYou know these these weapons Sammy Watkins in the hunt and and all these\nFast quick small guys going up against them according twins let's be honest aren't exactly uh twenty four I'm I'll make an analogy to the WNBA\nA because that's the league that I Love and a follow a lot and I've said this in the past about sue bird who I think is now thirty eight\nAnd I I watch super when she came to Connecticut to play the sun and I I just I watched her on the court and you think about how these thirty eight year olds thirty nine forty Brady\nThe guy like jaromir ... like the only way they get to that point is by not wasting any energy not wasting steps\nThey get from point a to point B and the shortest amount of time possible like they don't they take good angles right they they make smart decisions they anticipate while they're not chasing plays they're not\nYou know we're moving this way you know ... if there's a screen coming you know you can go all the way around or you can just you know be smart and step here in the\n... when you watch them play any and Brady is like this like\n... doesn't waste energy running around the pocket it pretty threatened he's going to breed he's not he's not but he's not going to go do I go and I step to his ... over here to no he's he stays in his lane right don't people don't like that term nowadays I guess these days in his lane he doesn't\nHe doesn't fly all over the place to run around two birds like that she she\nDoes from point a to point B as quick as quickly as smartly as she can without expelling any energy and that's how you play until you're thirty eight\nAnd that's what we need to see from for instance them according to ... to incite defensively\nOr the patriots if they're running all over the place like chickens with their heads cut off trying to chase guys down\nIf it could be a long night for the patriots defensively but if they're smart if they stay in their lane if they anticipate well if they can get from point a to point B without totally exhausting themselves I think there'll be All right um but what I Would I assume happening is that the patriots just aren't going to give up the big play\nThey're going to say to this this young quarterback ma homes if you're going to beat us it's going to be by going you know eight or nine four sixty yards a you know and a punch in the goal\nBut you know they're not given up these they're going to knock on the ... they're gonna do what they can to avoid the Seventy four yard bomb I mean I anticipate it the the the back free safety for the patriots\nThey should or should set them up at the at the rent them out what's that's how far back they need to be don't let anything behind you um and ... and let's see if this can chip away three of you know three five six eight yards at a time like the Tom Brady method I talked about that all the time on the show\nYou know chipping away three or four or five yards at a time take away the big play and let's see if this kid can do it ...\nAnd I know he's good he's good he is legit um let's see a if Andy Reid ruined his career or be\nHe can come into ... and you know try to outsmart the patriots and again I Know this patriots revenge doesn't have the talent that it used to uh but that's still sort of a tall order you know going up against the the ...\nAnd uh you know they're they're they're called their big let's see if they can keep up with these kids these little speed stirs a book that you've got the way I think it can be fun game I'm a I'm actually really looking forward to it [noise]\n... hour weeks off the turn right around go across the street to the mat regional center thrilled by puck dropped today\nIn other words I'm excited to fear ... and in person\nI'm a guy that would have the chance to make the Bruins Ross or if it wasn't for Kevin Miller [noise]\n... and it would be on the ruins ... on the the big club [noise]\nBut you got to you know

Powers of financial advisor with the Armstrong advisory group and I'm joined by Todd ... apart and it was a law firm of Cushing an Dolan with a masters in taxation on today's show we had a brand new guy the tide has written\nFor the month of October it's designing an income only ... trust and it will give you the guidelines that you need to make sure that your trust is going to work when the time comes\nIf you or your spouse go into a nursing home it gives you all of the information that must be included in your area vocal trust as well as all of the closet that absolutely\nShould not be included in your trust you can call right now to request Jeffrey copy of Todd's designing tips\nAnd at eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine\nYou can also download your pre copy on our website legal exchange show\nDot com so Susan let's take a minute and look at the second story\nI have a husband and wife that come in one point two million and a home\nIn one point one million in an IRA mhm a small bank account those are the two es yes\nNow if you look at them they have kids and what not and\nThey're over to point three million what kind of planning do they do right now he's got the so much that they can't protect and then the answer that Iraq they're in their mid seventies mhm and you're right so you start looking at this and I and as I tell everybody when they come in and I go look folks\nI'm not here to advocate one way or another revolt ... I'm simply here to educate and then you will ultimately tell me what's important for you yet\nAnd so we started talking and I said you know you want to avoid probate oh yeah they said that would be a good thing although he's like well I\nDon't know exactly what's involved in it I suppose if it's costly we should avoid it might as well just said would you like to avoid this root canal I Know I think so [laughter] right I think it's that way\nBut it's just so you guys know what that means so many people still looked at me and say you know what is you know ... I got the deer in the headlights look what is what is ... yeah well you know it's time consuming takes at least a year lawyers get paid on an hourly basis usually to deal with this whole process everything's exposed accreditors that you haven't paid\nAnd a lack of privacy goes along with it to me those\nAre all enough reason to say why not just keep it private ... but the family come into the law office sit down and read the documents and move forward and not get anyone else involved especially the public and the courts right\nSo yes we want to avoid probing next you want to reduce taxes and these are things you should all be asking yourselves when you're putting your own facts pattern into this fact pattern right so there were two point three and they're like well yeah now remember currently\nFederally this is not a problem federally the exemption is eleven point one eight million per person with portability mhm so you really have the ability of doubling that amount as a married couple pretty easily know planning needed\nWell we don't have to worry about federal taxes there only a to point three I get it\nThis is where your state a state tax or needs to come into play mhm not every state has that we know Florida doesn't we know main does we know a Massachusetts does our exemptions are only a million the exemption in Florida or somewhere around one million five and change\nConnecticut still around two million\nA for an exemption so it's ... or so as New York\nSo you know New Hampshire another state with none so just got to look to your state\nTo figure out whether or not you have a state a state tax will they do we do in mass so yes they want to protect us that's from the state as they tax\nNext they said I said do you want to preserve the step up and basis on your property when you pass away because they were thinking artist give my house away no no we want to preserve the base to step up and lastly and this is really the twenty five thousand dollar question\nDo you want to protect the assets from the nursing home and what are the pros and cons of doing that and so we are going to talk about that to them\nAnd I'm going to explain to you know how to analyze this case now that you see the fact pattern and what the objectives are on the table how do we analyzed the case and determine which a path is right for them the revolt ... or ... irrevocably\nAnd you know what folks maybe you've been thinking about looking into drafting in ... trust because you're concerned about protecting those assets from those long term care expenses\nYou need to educate yourself I'm what should and should not be included in your trust and really get an idea of how these trust operate on a day to day basis fortunately for all of you listening Todd has written a guide for the month of October is designing in income only ... trust and it does a great place to start\nYour education and how these trust work\nCall right now to receive your free copy\nEight six six eight for eight five six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or visit our website\nLegal exchange show dot com where you can download our guide you can download our podcast and you can submit your questions for\nTodd so Susan this analysis right what are we going to look at their in and say well yeah I think I think we do want to protect us from the nursing home so those are some of the objectives that they came up with All right well first and foremost folks whenever I made a client or we meet a client Susan\nAnd so she doesn't own it if the surviving spouse doesn't own it then when the surviving spouse dies it's not taxable what if it grows though what if they're hurt your his trust grows to be twice as that\nDoesn't matter never doesn't matter how much it grows it will never be whatever's left in there when the surviving spouse dies is not owned by the surviving spouses therefore not taxable and surviving spouses estate\nBut because of that it would have been caused to be taxed in the\nFirst spouse to dies estate\nBut it's nine hundred thousand you said hey we got a formula built in there that says hey the amount up to the exemption goes in this budget mhm oh look it's less than a million so while it's subject to tax in the first spouses estate to die there's an exemption to use it up\nSo we file a tax return but we don't have to pay taxes\nGood question and the answer is no if it's less than ... million dollar filing threshold I don't even need to file nice the estate tax return and there's no tax too\nSo what about those folks that didn't get around to doing their planning we know federally you can use portability but is that available in the state can we\nThan ... of all in this state\nSo you lose that and just to play out the string what happens right because if you follow the string I just did with the planning mhm no tax on the first death less than a million surviving spouse dies I say there's nine hundred thousand in her trust ... less than a million no tax yeah period\nThis way because no planning was done everything a likely went to the surviving spouse mhm [noise]\nSurviving spouses now worth one point eight million which again this is why the marital deduction is so beneficial for the government not for us right it pumps up the surviving spouse as a state\nWith the deceased spouse has assets mhm so now she's at one point eight million which is greater than the million dollar exemption so when she dies there's about an eighty thousand dollar Massachusetts\nLiability do anything to be done with that now I Can't think of anything I assume they just have simple\nWills that leave everything to each other so if they have simple wells that leave everything to each other the only thing you can really do at this point would be file a disclaimer saying treat me surviving spouse as if I died and then everything would go ... that was going to come to me would go to my kids\nBut now it's not but now you don't have the spout right while you might be able to I don't necessarily think I like the result of that\nAnd you know folks failed clearly they put off they're planning a little too long I Know that his wife passed unexpectedly but get your planning in place folks there's so many benefits they can come from that and if you're concerned not just about estate taxes and bloodline cleaning and boating probably\nMaybe you're concerned about depleting those assets impoverishing your spouse if you go into a nursing home\nFind out how these eerie vocal tries to operate find out the information that absolutely must be in your trust as well as those clauses that absolutely must not be included in your trust\nCall right now to request you're free copy of Todd's designing ... trust guide at eight six six eight for eight\nFive six nine nine that's eight six six eight for eight five six nine nine or download a copy on our website legal exchange show dot com taught our last question comes from Karen in brain math and Karen writes I transferred money into my ear even a couple of trust for years ago\nI'd like to lend my daughter's some money to buy a house can I give her a loan from the trust that can be forgiven if I pass away and consider it as an advance on her inheritance I don't need the money so I'm fine if she doesn't actually we pay it to me\nSo you know shoes and this is a great example just to show a and really it goes to the materials how flexible\nAnd you were a vocal of trust can be right 'cause all the operational things that we do for these trust from day to day are also laid out in our material and so\nI Want you to see how something that seems like you when you read the sewers and you might be saying you know what it doesn't seem like you should be able to do this with a narrow vocal trust mhm but you can\nYou can explain why so in this case the trust is allowed to lend money\nBut never to the donor\nOkay so you can't lend money to the person who created the trust of all that's okay that's mom mhm mom doesn't want the money mom wants to lend money to Karen\nI assume from the trust yes so the answer is you can do it you make sure you prepare all the proper paperwork don't cheat here don't be you know take shortcuts\nPut together a promise airing no ... with interest where the payback schedule right signed by the trustee signed by the daughter the bar or so the lender and borrow or signs\nGet it all in place and then when the money mhm so the money is being distributed out of the trust to a child yet which by the way you can do\nAs an outright gift if you want without any paperwork so you really need the paperwork to make sure that you're categorizing this distribution not as a gift under the terms of the trust ... which are permitted\nBut under a separate paragraph the lending paragraph right of the trust so now we've got to characterized as a loan\nNow she could be paying back the trust these monthly payments that's fine ... or you could forgive each payment\nAnd as you forgive each payment then that's a gift yeah but\nSince it's from the trust it's not going to matter for Medicaid eligibility purposes right assume the house and the money has been in the trust more than five years since ... to ... and creating new five year waiting periods yes because it's coming from the trust right\nSo you can forgive it and just deal with any gift tax ramifications but again unless it's worth more than eleven point one million dollars right or you're you're not going to violate you're not going to have a gift tax liability 'cause you have that exemption\nOkay so so that's great and yes she can forgive it\nBut if on the date of death it's not paid ... and you want it terminated you can say that OK upon death I forgive whatever the outstanding balances you put this kind of language and the trust right I forgive whatever the outstanding balances on promissory note dated right to my daughter\nBut I treat that outstanding balance amount as an advancement\nSo that if there's fifty thousand outstanding that\n... is translated into English to mean that the first fifty thousand dollars goes to every one of my other kids first right to bring them up to the fifty that she's now already got as do it and don't treat them equally if you want and then the violence goes equally so yes you can treat it as an advancement\nFolks if you have a question you would like to ask Todd visit our website legal exchange dot com and click on the ask Todd tab\nMaybe we'll be able to read your
