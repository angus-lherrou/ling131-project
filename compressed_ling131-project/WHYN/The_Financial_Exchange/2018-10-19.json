H. Y. N. F. M. ACC Springfield [noise]\nBut our interest rates three point seven five percent tough to let go of that you go get one now you're looking at five so I mean I don't I don't know how I justify that and you know in all likelihood I don't see a situation where I Am very likely to look at a new home anytime soon\nAnd says this is the situation that I think the fed finds itself in as you're seeing signs that the housing market is slowing in in the housing market is a major engine for growth both in terms of what people were able to borrow in order to hate generate spending that way but also the the economic activity crates as far as jobs for plumbers carpenters electric under age ...\nYou name it you run down the list and so I think the fed is between a rock and a hard place because there is inflation coming because\nThe labor market is so tight right now and that's not going away anytime soon I don't think\nAt the same time you have a slowing economy as as these numbers indicate on this that I think is going to become an issue at some point next year ... can't have both they can't say hey we're going to chop inflation and we're going to have a strong housing market you can't have both at this point I think that's what this data is telling me\nThey're going to have to pick what is more important to them keeping inflation in check or keeping the economy moving\nIn that if you go back to the polls Volcker days Paul Volcker raised rates through the roof because he said it's more important to keep inflation in check and keep the dollar strong they keep the economy moving in the short term\nI don't know where Jay Powell is going to land on yeah but he's going to face it it's not going to be the magnitude of what Volcker faced but it's a similar decision and historical precedent says that Volcker was the outlier because every other time we've seen this ... chairs\nTypically say yeah let's keep things moving and try to keep the economy ... and that's what we've typically seen so that's where I come up with my thought hey we're probably seeing one hike next you're not the three they're guiding towards this data point is kind of the first one that really suggest hey there's there's really something that's going on here that the fed is going to have to\nPay attention to the data point that I think could easily offset this if you said okay we do have a declining housing market but we got some retail sales at the end of this year that just knocked the roof off that could that could change things for the fact that can really push them towards raising interest rates again in that two to three hikes next year rather than just one\nTo talk about what's going on in China they reported their second quarter or a third quarter GDP I'm Sorry a and it came in at six point five percent year over year which begs the question what the heck is the real GDP their cars six point five certainly isn't what's actually going on\nYeah I always tend to discount whenever whenever the Chinese government puts out bad economic data you always got discounted a little bit\nBut six point five percent for China's not very good anyway that's the worst GDP Growth number that they've seen since the first quarter of two thousand nine and a anyone falling at home you remember what the economy was like back in first quarter of two thousand and not\n[noise] yeah wasn't particularly strong no wasn't particularly good so ... ... ... again it raises the question hey if if they're telling you it's six point five percent and slowing\nHow slow is it actually has a three and a half to four and a half\nI have no idea but we know from you know just kind of what we've seen in divergence is before a numbers between what China tells you and then what their electricity consumption isn't their gas consumption\nWe know it's not usually what they're telling you it's just a question of how far off it is um but either way you look at this China is going through a period of slowing and I think you can\nDraw a pretty direct line there between what we're seeing from a trade perspective and the slowing growth that's going\nOn yeah I mean if you want to take the pessimistic view sure you can say the second largest world economy is slowing down but if you're an American you want to be optimistic view it appears that you know our trade tariffs are having a good impact it appears that we are intentionally trying to and succeeding and slowing down the Chinese economy\nSo this is going to be something that does bear watching you know we're ... it's gonna be interesting to see if this continues into the fourth quarter they're trying to coming in again with its slowest GDP Growth number since two thousand nine\nObviously an economy like that can't grow seven eight percent a year for ever but still it's suggestive things are not uh not all rosy in China at the moment cheer\nLet's talk tipping because this is a it is just a phenomenal topic to get into so that you two have been into you've gone into whether it's you know bakeries coffee shops\nWherever it may be that there's a lot of these new pointed fail terminals maybe they're run by square pay ... a ... there's a whole bunch of matter there where it's pretty much an eye pad and then the cashier enters in what you're going to pay and then they flip it over to sneak into signing your car sign your name and swipe and everything but when they flip it over and show it to you\nEven though you're just maybe picking up a coffee or maybe there's still a spot none of spot but the first prompted hey how much do you want to give in a lot of people are finding themselves in the awkward situation of saying well\nGee I'd I don't want to tip you anything just 'cause all you're doing is handing me something across the counter why am I tipping you for that what's what's going on here\nYeah or maybe in some circumstances you pay three fifty for something and you know leave the back in the day you and say okay here's the fifty cents and chair of job put that in the tip jar fright\nUm these are prompting much larger tests you know the general what you're seeing out there is if you're purchasing an item for less than ten dollars the options are one two or three dollars and if it's over ten that I think it's Fifteen\nNo Eighteen twenty or twenty five per cent tip levels as the default\nNow that ... can be changed by the individual uh owner okay so they say okay we want to change the default there\nBut a lot of them aren't necessarily doing that and so I guess both are individuals who are buying stuff as well as cashiers are saying man this is really awkward you know cashier flip it over and you know you bought it for you know two dollar muffin or something like that and is asking you if you want to give a two dollar\nTo pray and you're sitting there knew like look I really liked the cashier man but I'm not tipping you a hundred percent on that it's not like it's good but it's not that good and you're nice but you're not that nice and by the way it will smelly so hey let's let's get this cleaned up around here that OK well here's a practical example\nThat I'm gonna throw out that has driven me crazy there is a brewery that shall remain nameless that I frequent than go pick up\nI'll do I go buy a bunch of cans there because they don't sell them and liquor stores and to you know you have to go to the brewery to get them going there you might buy ... there have been occasions where I bought two hundred dollars worth of cans of beer and then you go to sign it and there's a default twenty per cent tip level for them to be who just\nCarried a case of beer over to the counter and gave it to me ... I've never tipped the guy the liquor store\nOr but I just don't understand why this prompt is coming up a yeah it's bothering me a little\nBut I'm going to go on a little different direction or while I Do think that there is added pressure when they do flip that I've had over to you\nYeah you know that's what's going to be telling hey if if it's if it's something where hey a year later if companies and individuals are still saying no we don't we don't want to do this pay then you've got something here but\nTo this like I I don't see anything that suggests that that's the case here and so I think that this is a relationship that's largely going to be back to the status quo when it's all said and done the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they both have a need for each other I think the u._s. probably needs the Saudis a little bit more right now just because\nThere aren't a whole lot of allies in that region um but I think that this is something where you're not going to see a change just because both countries recognize hey we might not agree on everything but we need to work together on things\nSo yeah I I I don't think you can change the relationship with the ... the general Saudi a government but you can choose which Saudi prince you deal with I mean I don't know if you can\nYeah I mean you don't want to I I suppose you don't want to push regime change I I'm not I'm not suggesting that but [noise] it it is yeah I don't know if you look\nAt this stuff is about as bad as it gets I mean you're talking about what appears to be and again this is based on rumors on the orange or a gruesome torture in likely murder a veteran of this journalist it's about as bad as it gets but I don't think you're going to see meaningful change\nOut of it quick break your when we come back we've got Wall Street wash and also talking about vending mow the digital payment service finally making money for pay ...

difficult for it to compete you know one of the areas of Proctor and gamble had really succeeded at in the past was getting that prime shelf space in grocery stores\nAnd you know Walmart is

as they're also signed up for it you just need to search for um\nUh you see there you know their profile picture a lot you know when you log in there and you can just seamlessly transfer them funds for free or there's no charge to transferring money between one individual to another individual\nTo the big thing that uh they saw on invincible by the way is owned by pay pal they bought them I think maybe four or five years ago now\nUm so the volume of payment that they process in the third quarter roast Seventy eight percent year over year to Seventeen billion dollars still only a little bit more than ten percent of pay ... hundred and forty three billion total volume for the quarter\nBut the big thing that they're starting to see is that more people are participating not just in the free transfers that you do to get money to a friend\nBut what they call monetize ... action twenty four percent of bend mobile users are participating in that type of transaction now that's up from Seventeen percent in the second quarter annoy Thirteen percent in May of this year ... almost doubling in a span of six months\nYeah and I I was always kind of curious when I first started using this happen exactly what Ben Miller was doing to make money and this appears to be there because they don't offer ads\nThey're not trying to sell you know thing on here which is not yet at least nice and refreshing yeah not not yet\nBut where they are monetize ing seems to be on consumer to business and business to business transactions where your linking a credit card to your account and say you're ordering a meal law for delivery and you use your ... to complete that transaction they're keeping a three percent transaction fee on that\nSo they're keeping that above and beyond what the credit card process I Believe\nSo yeah a which seems like it'd be pretty\nPretty substantial amount that you'd be paying you're talking like ... percent total then when you factor in credit card fees yeah so perhaps they have some sort of deal worked out with the credit cards to you know the lesson that a little bit but a\nPretty substantial uh but you know in the same thing happens with pay pal pay pal I think you pay two point nine percent than those same transactions so yeah I'm ... really where the opportunity lives for them is they're starting to get integrated with you know companies so\nWhen you log into grub hub or eat you can log your bend mo information right in there and you can just seamlessly you know not not enter any credit card information just boom ... real quick logging event though and complete the transaction\nLet's go back to our whole question of the day since this is somewhat related to this or do you feel more pressure to tip on eye pad cash registers Tucker what kind of results do we have to this\nPoint so far still pretty early here but fifty six point two percent of our listeners say no they do not feel more pressure when tipping on the I had a cash registers and we also have a couple techs coming in or one out of the five away or no pressure at all I hit no tip every time with al ...\nA year where you're not a waiter or waitress you don't serve me you don't get tips and then a out of the nine seven eight hey guys spot on with the tipping I refused to tip for take out\nSo that's the next place that I was going to do you get a tip on taking no\nNever I Do I Do unless it's a large order so to when I\nIt depends on the type of take out but if I'm buying something where they need to individually package a bunch of stuff that they would otherwise need to to serve on my plate I figure they're putting in at least as much work to some degree as a disturbing it so I tend to tip a few bucks when I'm doing take out if it's something like\nSushi where they've got you know kind of a complicated order to complete and separate if I'm buying a box of pizza that's a different story\nI typically on on takeout I'll still tip ten percent just 'cause a lotta times ah workers do share tips they have pool tips and a lot of restaurants fail and so on something that's takeout from what would normally be a sit down restaurant ... I'll still tip ten percent just because hey I'm I'm not getting the same service that I was outwardly if I were sitting down there but\nAll the back and work is still being done so I Do still tip ten percent on take out orders though obviously I'm not tipping you know twenty twenty\nFive and ... out to the delivery guy or in a day of the week obviously but um you know in a smaller water for two people I'm I'm not if it's a large order than yell to\nIt's time well spent WHYY in\nUse by becoming a member of berries brigade log on to financial exchange show done common sign up today\nHoover as they prepare for their IPO's now it sounds like it's going to be in the first half of next year they had that lovely a\nArticle in the wall Street Journal about how they're targeting a hundred and twenty billion dollar evaluation earlier this week which I think it was just pure messaging under the half of the banks that are working for them if they are now apparently testing a quote on demand the labor service uh in order to provide\nEmployees are temp employees pretty much for whether it's you know one off of events like weddings and things like that maybe it's you need someone to come in for a couple of weeks to do data entry but they're trying to get into this business which leads me to the question why on earth do they think they're going to be good at this I actually\nAm going to disagree with you here I I think that they\nHave the potential to be able to pull this off um you know they're already pretty good at dictating specific terms to a non contractors um they've got a pretty big network of people that they could potentially bring into this\nUm I think it will be difficult for them to do this in such a tight labor market but I think I think that they could be successful with this the only thing that I think prohibits them from it is that their reputation has taken such a hit over the last few years that people might be hesitant to sign up for it but\nYou know ... if let's say let's say you live in town and you don't own a car so you can't drive for ... uh but you're looking to pick up a few bucks I could've seen myself in my early twenties than yeah I'll go work at a uh I'll go work a wedding at a this place I've got to you know I've got a suit that I can wear and I'll go show up and go surf people there sure\nI guess my question isn't so much whether people would sign up to do the work yeah it's ... what's the incentive for if someone's having a wedding to go look at Hoover instead of someone who specialize in that exact particular thing that they probably already have relationships with I Would hope price\nThat's however succeeded in what they're currently doing loses money on that stuff they do you do I I just I look at it in in where's the long term value what can they what can they do that someone else can't I don't I just I I don't know if I see this being of real value for them\nI I yeah I think there's potential for them you know given their scale given they're already existing expertise on paying these people on\nGetting them into their network I think they have the potential to really do something here\nAnd if they do I can see them severely under cutting you know the other staffing agencies that currently do this today and yeah you know we always say well no this company's got such expertise in it that you couldn't just step in and do that but you know what there are plenty of companies that Cohen disrupt industries that you think might have an area of expertise and it\nIs a good point a story in the wall Street Journal the headline is oil prices could fall further on rising us oil supplies OPEC report says\nTo this I say well on those just say just a week ago all that we're hearing was oh it was

actually going to happen and if you want a clear example this go back to the end of twenty Fifteen or oil futures prices for most of twenty sixteen where the Seventy dollar a barrel range and we went down to twenty seven dollars a barrel in February of sixteen\nAnd none of the experts saw it coming so I discount an awful lot when it comes to quote for oil experts\nFolks do you have a trust to

a fair amount of work to be done I'm Dave Anthony Foxx noon as secretary of state Pompeo said arriving in Mexico city for talks about the caravan of thousands of Central American migrants headed to the U.S border I just\nShocked by even if you take a stance I don't I I don't yeah I feel the pressure but I still don't tip I like I there's still the absolutely feel that pressure there's still at arm's items that you it that I definitely feel the pressure to do it\nDo you feel more pressure from the cashier or from the customers judging you never mind who can see what you do know\nYou have to pick everything you you have to pay its a pocket of capital as a cashier put you on the cash or you got an ... year okay\nI feel more badly just by the customers and cast year they're going to get over it they'll figure it out yeah customers are the ones that no one behind you Chuck within I don't feel judged okay you know I can deal with cash years like I can deal with it you know but I wasn't cash you know worked that job I Know how it is so is it so\nDid you ... or you know did you like not appreciate customers as much because they weren't tipping\nTipping is what bothered me so much was customers who were actually route throughout any process more like typical like you don't know necessarily what a customer's going through they might be going through financial tough times maybe they can't tip you the same way that they normally would [laughter] so I don't blame customers you know 'cause you don't know what's going on under the hood there\nBut that doesn't mean again just 'cause like you can't tip doesn't mean you can't be nice because it doesn't cost anything to be nice to a cashier cars look it's a tough job sometimes so what what got more under my skin wasn't customers who didn't hit me it was customers who are rude to me for absolutely no reason because\nLook just ... and you don't have to do that that's something easily within your control\nA tech set of the five oh wait a I think feeling pressure or over this tipping situation is a little bit odd no one is putting pressure on you so maybe it's just guilt\n[noise] well yeah it could be you know\nMy mother worked hard on guilt maybe it's paying off [laughter] you know let's talk about doubt dupont they recorded a four point six billion dollar charge or in the agriculture unit what's this related to my\nUh you just have seen a pretty big slow down and you know declining valuations of the agricultural sector as a whole largely because of tariffs and so with all the accusations that acquisitions that they have made they've really had to take a good hard look at the value of their agriculture unit and in this case they had to record\nThat yeah you know what what we thought this stuff was worth was actually worth four point six billion dollars less than our initial estimates how much this the biggest trade related\nYou know\nA good chunk but I don't think you would take a four point six billion dollar charge off if you thought a hundred percent of that was trade related because trade related can be temporary ... so I I think a good portion of this has to be you know ... the goodwill and do other stuff here just isn't worth what it was um\n[noise] but some of it straight to live a good a good chunk of it's got to be but not all of it\nWe haven't talked in a while now about a Amazon H cute too which is probably the single biggest a project that somehow you know taxpayers don't realize they're going to be on the hook for when it's all said and done due to all these tax breaks that Amazon's likely going to get\nBut Amazon apparently is revisiting some cities as they are trying to wrap this decision making process up by the end of the year ah it was\nWhen was it that we first heard about this wasn't about a year ago now God I don't know it feels like decades ago that we've been talking about this I think it was about a year ago but apparently they are doing bad too so the production wall that we have was dating back to September seven twenty Seventeen just over a year or a year now\nAnd so I guess apparently they've gone back now to New York city to Newark New Jersey to Chicago they've also been following up with a couple of cities like Miami and DC are a couple of cities just haven't heard from them at all and a few months apparently Raleigh North Carolina hasn't heard from them I guess but so\nThe only thing that I think you can derive from this story ... because I feel like we do this every week oh Jeff Bezos responded in Texas do they do choose that says better tracking yeah I think the ... it's like a a a where's Waldo type of scenario here\nBut I I think the only real thing that I've been able to garner from this is there seems to be a slight\n... I don't know preference for a metro city area rather than more of a rural area\nI'm standing by my prediction that this is all miss direction they've already built in Boise Indiana voted no and if you're just going to they're just going to be hate like we've got Amazon Boise open ended no one had any group was coming in there it's done and it's finished that's that's what I'm sticking\nWith now I think it's going to be a very big city I I Would very much doubt that it can be in New York New York or Chicago I just don't think that those states have their rights tax situation to allow Amazon to be there but I can be wrong will say\nWell let's let's ask a different question we we've asked before you know where do we think Amazon ends up with the second headquarters when do you think they finally make a decision\nI I'd have to hope that they do it by and the year ... or\nDecember thirtieth December fifteenth\nNovember twenty nine oh All right I'm going November twenty ninth or making a decision that you can put those up on the\nProtests and might have to get what why else would I have done that higher there [laughter] there's no point in me doing that if when I put it on record I was December thirtieth Mike was saying the fifteenth\nAnd shock was actually no I'm I'm judging by you don't get ... get out I did it we ... no matter no you know at night and I know you're not changing one November twenty third now I Want the twenty third June ...
