with overall earnings of global corporations just to South Korea so heavy for manufacturing and they're they're they're they're kind of this key country where they export both to Asia which is growing rapidly\nAnd they're also big in terms of exports to Europe and the U.S which were developed there his sense on exactly Samsung elegy those types of companies Hyundai all and then you go down the list\nSouth Korean exports year over year for the month of September ...\nCame in at negative eight point two percent wow so you've got a proxy for China because China never tells the truth it's a proxy for China and forward demand in the U.S and so the last time that we saw numbers like this from South Korea ...\nWas back in late twenty Fifteen early twenties sixteen when we are all that money coming out of the global economy because of oil prices crying\nSo this is one of those things where I take a look at the chart and this number by the way if you go back a year okay\nA year ago that number was up plus thirty four percent you know\nShe and a lot of people would have thought that number would be increasing because you're hearing about American companies like a Costco stockpiling Walmart is stockpiling product because they're anticipating these tariffs\nAnd and I think what this suggests to me you could see\nThat what could you know you mentioned hey you know not enough workers can kick off the next recession\nIt could also be what we call inventory recession where companies have stockpiled so much product that they say look we don't need to order anything else in factory orders low for a couple of quarters and it puts you into a mild recession that doesn't mean the world comes to an end but it it does mean that hey you might see a little pull back and markets as you go forward twelve or Eighteen months\nYou know it is interesting the fed he yesterday a drone powers in Boston talking and he said you know I I'm not worried about labor markets overheating\nBoy I Am I I like I must be the only person that's concerned about it\nI I look at what's going on with with Amazon just did a and with other companies having difficulty hiring workers not a day goes by where we don't report on labor strikes where somebody's going out on strike or work or like a Mariette workers just went out on strike [noise]\nWhat's the problem with labor markets overheating [noise]\nIt means that wages go up\nAnd in the short term corporate profits go down why is that a bad thing it's not necessarily a bad thing in the long term in the short term it can cause us aid if all of a sudden Mariette Mrs their earnings estimates\nQuarter after quarter because they have to pay their workers more money or Amazon or BJ's or Cosco all these companies have to pay more money for their workers in the short term it hits their earnings per share in Wall Street will cause those stocks to go down may not be bad for the economy though the economy might actually benefit from higher wages to lower paid work\nIn my view also is that stress is stress stress is what produces forward progress in technology and into the economy it's when you have a company that saying gee we can't figure out how to ... earnings because our costs are going up to watch\nIt it's not a question of hey we don't have enough sales we can make it say what what ... what can we do to innovate to figure out how to to generate better profits and I like to see that 'cause that's where a company like Marriott says\nGee you know what we're going to figure out a way we're going to get better technology for our cleaning staff so that instead of cleaning eight rooms a day they can do nine and instead of\nUh having our kitchen work in this way we're going to have that I like to see that I liked companies that are a little stress because it forces them to innovate sure I don't like when companies are all comfortable in saying oh gee we got low borrowing costs low wage they would have companies had to do the last eight years to make money hasn't been too hard\nIt is it and they haven't had to innovate Tucker or when your son is born are you going to limit his\n... son
