think\nFly in and W. H. Y. N. F. M. ACC Springfield\nYeah I mean one of the things that they have been watching as the fact that capital could start flooding out of those countries that have have not seen since the two thousand eight global financial crisis\nNow you know a lot of people who are trying to get capital out of those countries are attracted actually to the rising us interest rates yep so that's putting pressure on those markets the strength of the dollar is also putting pressure on them because it's um causing reduction in you know those you know countries currencies\nSo you know you're seeing you know the potential for our capital fled for market corrections in for foreign exchange moving across the board which ... which can lead to the crisis\nThis looks an awful lot and it feels an awful lot like what we saw back in Nineteen Ninety seven where you had the Asian financial crisis that really started in Thailand um and started largely because at the time uh the the tide currency was it it gives known as the box\nAnd tied bought was effectively pegged to the U.S dollar in order to keep it stable at the time well what happened was that the government couldn't maintain that pig and they had the floated\nA in order to you know effectively tried to\nUm you know keep the currency afloat and keep the country afloat and it ended up causing all kinds of problems throughout the region that ended up spilling over into the U.S as well um for a short time period there what worries me about this in this emerging market situations were far more tied into these markets\nThan we were Twenty years ago it could have a bigger effect on the U.S and the effect is pretty significant even back in Ninety seven well\nAnd not to mention that foreign exchange on you know currency fluctuations aside their vulnerabilities and the government debt to stress area you know you have 'em over forty five percent of these low income countries at a higher risk that distress or already experiencing it according to the IMF\nWhich is compared to only twenty five percent five years ago and in fact\nWe've already had a couple of these countries you know seek bailouts from the IMF and two of them yeah Pakistan you know aspirin IMF bail out you know earlier this year I Ching teenagers now the thing that\nSaid this high levels of debt or really concerning and like you said have a clear impact because we are such an intertwined globally client economy today\nAnd and this is clearly when you when if you point to what is causing this is the strength of the dollar over the course of this year as you mentioned\nA you know investors flocking back to the dollar with higher rates and you have the dollar up about eight percent for the course of the year\nAnd that makes it very difficult if you are in these other countries\nTo keep capital in your local currency just because investors will say gee why do I want to hold the Argentinean pay so if it's losing forty percent against the dollar I could make fifty percent but still when we get ten percent of my money it doesn't make sense for me to hold back currency and that's why you see money flocking out of those countries here\nAlong with this or a statement that was made yesterday by Dallas Fred president Robert Kaplan\nSo that he wanted the fed to hike rage three more times one in December and then two more at sometime next year and then pause at that point to see if any additional increases are ...\nDefinitely there watching you know productivity as one of the indicators are watching inflation they're watching whether or not or starting a season bubbles and some of the asset and that people trade and\nUm you know and they're trying to figure out what you know it's their right what they called the neutral rate which is a a level of um rate that neither ... nor slows growth and that's that's kind of tricky I mean some some you know economic forecast put that in a meeting estimate about three percent\nUm you know some say it's lower so it's going to be interesting to see what they decide\nLooking at what today's data has done I was a going earlier and I was checking out what we call the fed funds futures which uh predictions for where the ... going to raise rates are going forward into the next year generally the predictions on this they go out about twelve month so we can see to really next October at this point we can't see beyond that to the end of the year\nUh but the median projection if you're looking at it\nThere's a thirty six percent chance now that there are three hikes\nIn interest rates prior to next October largely unchanged from a day ago but that's up from just the twenty five percent chance\nA month ago and that's why you have seen interest rates rise a little bit over this time period is people are saying hey look I don't want to get caught behind the eight ball and you'll be holding long term debt we need to sell this off because we're thinking rates are going to be moving up a little bit quicker than expected by the way\nTucker and and I believe you have this on the board at this point\nI Am on team we're going to have less hikes than expected because I don't think the Fed's going to be able to hike yeah I think your production you're official production is one hiking twenty Nineteen that it just fine that's where I'm at I'm hiking Nineteen so\nWe'll see what happens or I Will take a victory lap because it looks like I was going to be right this year yep so pat myself on that for that one out but it's always a New Years so we'll see if we get into\nA as we had the next year some sad news for an American or a great American company Sears hiring advisors to prepare for bankruptcy filing\nYeah I mean definitely sad because it's such an iconic brand in such a part of Americana and a lot of ways but ah not surprising at all I mean given the rising online retailing where they haven't been able to keep up\nAnd also just you know lack of investment in their stores um you know fears you know malls no longer really need those anchor stories as much anymore because the mall traffic is down overall um so uh so unfortunately you know Sears is feeling the impact of all this trend\nThis also does give me the opportunity to talk about my favorite items from the Sears catalogs that used to be around and and there's all kinds of websites that have these by the way but some of the things that they offered a back in the day this one is from\nIt looks like night teen boat to this is the falls and I you know two and they had the Heidelberg electric belt which sent electric current through kind of your your your droid effectively to cure quote a week or deranged nervous system\nThis is a real thing that's always reliable they sold it for Eighteen dollars back then [laughter] other things that we have from Nineteen oh uh actually I'm Sorry the fall Nineteen hundred catalog\nGot into fashion with ladies plush capes really so you could have a Cape and these look like they were going for eight dollars and thirty five cents they were very nice I Believe there for a massive\nBeen considered really high end at the time huh\nI Would imagine you know everyone was walking around and capes then but the best thing that we had a we're still in this one from fall Nineteen thirty two uh the whole kits where you could literally order all the materials for a house or they deliver it right to where you wanted to build it and you'd be able to build your house or wherever you wanted\nA this is a home kit that was a Fifteen hundred and twenty nine dollars for the entire kittens to be able to build your house it looks like he was about twelve hundred square feet so about a dollar per square foot um and it's it's still is one of I think the most amazing things that\nYou know this is a company that would literally deliver you the materials to build an entire house\nAnd now they're going out of business because they lost out to companies that want to deliver to your house\nExactly well and so unfortunate too because I mean they did you know carry on that strong tradition of supplying the home and the Kenmore brand is such a wonderful brand appliances and everything and it's a real shame\nLet's take a break here when we come back we're going to talk about whether or not you're going to want to get on a plane when your pilot is a

if a on the Apollo moon landing a Armstrong takeover due to a computer ... well here's the thing when we talk about hacking you're assuming that that computers networked and connected to other computers\nIf it's not ... not really a problem you like you can't hack a super Nintendo you can't hack in Atari because it's not connected to the Internet\nOr needs to be connected to air traffic control somehow why does the computer I have to be because they need to go ahead to land\nBut what you're missing you're you're missing the the critical point here why does that stack why does that section of the operating system have to be connected to what actually flies the\nPlane or you need somebody whoever's in air traffic control the land the plane to give it go ahead so that there needs to be some sort of line of communication between the tower and the plane\nBut why does that system have to be connected to the one that actually flies that is what is what I'm getting at\nI just literally told you talk to each\nOther no no no no you're saying that air traffic control has to be able to talk to one system on the plane without saying is why does that others just math to be networked in and it doesn't have to be thinking about it this way Tucker when you go and if you've got what we do have an iPhone six iPhone death success does that have the uh the fingerprint on it yet\nWhen you press the fingerprint mhm do you know where that fingerprint goes\nNo take a guess on the phone\nExactly it stays on the phone the entire time right it doesn't actually send it back to anywhere on it it's not actually talking to apple ... how would the Plano when to land think about it this way when you made it out of so many planes when when you make an apple pay purchased a\nYou use your phone and in that fingerprint scanner write write your fingerprint is never sent to the ... which is where the transactions process no ... yeah I understand what you're saying and I think\nThat that's a different analogy isn't it because I think what ... saying is that like there has to be a connection between the receiver of the joint production in the sky and and and then\nI I agree with that analogy Austin's on the plane I I agree with that but what it doesn't have to do is it doesn't have to be interface with what actually steers the plane\nI don't think you get what I'm saying I I I Do because there's there's going to be planes that are delayed or so running I had I had it all ended up by a plane landing at at him so what's the concern when when you talk about hacking the plane what what what is that if the concern is that somebody else is going to take control the plane right\nIn what I'm saying is you separate the control right from what actually what tells the point where to go in that\nWay I'm not even now I have I'm not even talking about hacking I'm Talking about everyday use of the plane and landing but what I'm telling you you could Saturday Night and said oh ahead go ahead for America to\nKnow what they need to go ahead but the doctor when when I give apple to go ahead right why actually send the my fingerprint no exactly that's what I'm saying ... so you can separate those systems only has the greatest analogy you know the exact same thing yeah I don't think it is [laughter]\nYou're not going to stray me on that one needs to be some

percent no apparently no one wants to find a robot playing with me which means I'm going to have a whole row to myself\nWhich is going to be phenomenal you all can stick on those full piloted flights but I'll have a whole row to myself and\nBe cheaper you think or it'd be the same price nothing will change\nI think they would try to keep it the same as much as they can yeah\nMy guess would be pretty close to me the biggest cost the airline have are are typically fuel costs followed pretty closely\nUm I think by just all the regulatory stuff you know William Gates and this and that I Know pilots are obviously expensive but\nYou know pilots they're not making you know a hundred thousand dollars a flight rights okay that you know there are legitimate expense but I don't think he'd be a huge shift in ticket costs just as you know fuel and maintenance or such big pieces there um but I can pull up some data on that\nUh as we go here some breaking news that we just got flashing across earlier that CBS the deal or that my kid mentioned was likely to get approval today\nDid get approval today that will done\nWith condition with conditions are likely condition we're still trying to get some data or some information on what exactly those or\nOr it looks like the condition is that there's going to have to sell its Medicare part D drug plan business over to well care health um but I don't see any other potential conditions um but will continue to keep you updated on that\nTravelers the insurance company is going to start selling home security gear on Amazon this is an interesting mix year Christie\nYeah I found it really interesting but it's a it's really a move by travelers to try to meet customers where they are not as many customers are buying 'em through agents in fact there is a shift towards that buying things on line\nAnd said travelers is making a move by getting on to Amazon and and selling all these homes security products at a discount to current travelers customers\nAnd then encouraging people to purchase insurance travelers let's say\nI Do want to go back to the airline story briefly about pilots just I'm again I'm I'm a wolf airplanes so I get kind of caught up on these things\nUp fuel costs typically this is according to the uh airlines for America website who knows a few expenses make up about Twenty one percent of all expenses that you pay for in a fight\nFederal government taxes makeup twenty percent labor makes up Seventeen percent now labor keep in mind is not just the pilot is also your gate agents your flight attendants\nUh your maintenance crews and so forth luggage and then non labor in non fuel expense is making forty one percent but those are you know a whole bunch of different areas but waiver overall makes up Seventeen percent my guess is the pilots are probably\nBetween twenty and thirty percent of that so if you had no pilot it might be five percent cheaper but I don't think you get much below that will be my guess I'm\nNot back to this Amazon store sorry for the railing 'cause I like planes uh when we talked about this Amazon and and travelers story here\nI Do think it's interesting uh the travelers is is moving in this direction here\nJust because you know again the incentive for travelers as well get more people have security devices and rain monitors and so forth\nIt becomes cheaper for them to ensure against losses would I'm curious about is your travelers isn't filling their own products it's you know different brands I'm curious how travelers ends up making money off of this when it's all said and done\nWell it's more about establishing I think a presence on Amazon for Amazon itself moves into insurance do you think they will yeah I mean I think Amazon is slowly finding different markets that it can take over and the fact is is that there is rising interest in buying insurance and filing insurance claims on line\nTo travelers is leveraging a platform that exists and is is saying okay we're going to meet you where you are\nDo you work with a dedicated insurance agent or do you just go on to you know whatever website you go onto and buy it online which how how do you typically\nDo right now I work with an agent but I Do that because I Do my research on line so I could see more and more people will be buying this on line up severely\nInteresting all the time we have on this hour of the show but we'll be back in just a bit with a whole lot more on the financial exchange radio network [laughter]\nHi this is Barry Armstrong and I know that many of you who

people are stressed out enough as it is where the humans in the ... yeah now you're going to take them out of the cockpit but but Tucker that's up people problem not a robot I Know I fully unlike anything that the people if if people can't wrap their minds around the fact that something might be safer now\nThat's not the robots fall no it's not you know that's that's like saying\nOh well we we shouldn't like I I Can't even I'm trying to figure out like a comparable\nHere just something that's like me to a huge difference over the last like ten years that yeah it's a little scary to think about but it actually works way better um if anyone has new ideas you can test in but I just I find it amazing that we're so distrustful of robots and yet we just trust humans\nWe say oh yeah humans can handle it when it's been proven time and time again that we can't do a lot of cases it's\nIt's not that I don't trust pilots it's just that robots are really really good at what they do ... and I said I'm\nJust a big believer and I was having a backup plan to do with the humans have a backup plan that the robots that the robots have a backup plan and humans I just think let's combine the two\nYou know teamwork is always the better option\nHere's another problem with continuing to have a pilot's operating in smaller and smaller roles is robots do more is there's actually been a number of studies done are with regards to pilots the pilots that are trained today and they grow up onto the systems\nDon't actually pick up the skills they need to be able to react in a crisis because they're not piling the plane enough to be able to know what to do\nSo pretty much they're still rely on the auto pilot and on their instruments and so forth that when something goes wrong they don't know what to do the same way that the pilot ... who who had been trained Thirty years ago knows what to do because they grew up in an era when they were much more hands on with the plane so I didn't even make the argument that because of the way pilots are trained today\nShorter training times as well as more reliance on systems\nNewer pilots that are being trained don't necessarily have the skills to be able to do that anyway\nSo I mean that just guys can kind of a fundamental kind of\nIssue across the board across different industries in terms of education exposure to a different situation I mean you see that even healthcare though is that\nThere is a story recently about um can innovations in maternity ward in the hospital I Believe in the south shore on and how they were looking at trying to reduce the Syrian birth on because there have been such a reliance on trying to control the birth snatch ... through the roof\nAnd a lot of doctors didn't have the skills and to to be able to handle you know breach birth and unusual press so they're trying to bring that back\nThrough a team model and not I just think it's interesting just you know we rely ON Technology so much that like you said we're not giving ourselves the time we need in order to develop skills and I think that there is an argument to be made across the board across different industries reinvest singing that education and teaching people how to do that\nYou did bring up in this this actually I'm I'm gonna hijack you're pointing completely has tried to make my point I'm Sorry in advance [laughter] but\nRobotic assisted surgery we see this used in a ton of common procedures right now are all over the place we see robots that are being used to do surgery that traditionally had been done by hand with a doctor but we see them being used because\nThey're often more efficient and more precise than a doctor can be in some of these surgeries we don't say no I Want a doctor there to do that we say hey the robots\nJust as good if not better in some cases in doctors have said yeah you know what they actually are and so you see robots being used more commonly in a lot of these cases if we can trust robots with surgery can we trust them to fly a plane\nNo [laughter]\nI guess that's where we said on that so you can either text in just six three five six six and I'll continue to take

a bill act man who's a hedge fund is just not had a great couple of years here\nIs taking a stake in Starbucks or rather revealing a stake in Starbucks\nYeah he's been historically known as an activist investor although I'm not really sure he's positioned himself as that and Starbucks but it's interesting the Starbucks you know Starbucks has been facing a number of challenges in one of them it's just the fact that people don't want to sugary drinks for their ... aren't quite as far as they used to be\nBut they've also had to kind of slow growth and a lot of ways on they announce closures to that a hundred and fifty stories coming up and typically are twenty Nineteen which is three times the average number of closures that they've had previously\nUm they're looking at the urban markets to open up but they're slowly gross for their license stories as well as the store and you see in supermarkets and you're like that\n... definitely a lot of challenges there it's going to be interesting to see whether or not he kind of activates and that decides to push rather changes\nStarbucks is one of those companies each time\nTheir former CEO Howard Schultz has left you know he's left twice now and each time the company has struggled to find direction and I I I really you know if it happens once you say well maybe it was just a fluke or something I Will get that and I I just wonder if it's one of those rare companies that need\nThat specific person there in order to make it successful because yeah there is a person who's that transformational well announces he's he's still\nWilling to try new things right right I mean everything from like the new products you see that he sells you know adding and things like music and stuff like that\nOn you definitely see you know how this creativity plays into the stores and he comes back and\nThere's definitely there's definitely has creativity in a a I guess new idea I'm open mindedness in terms of Starbucks but the one thing that they really gave up on soon it through in the white flag our white talent on was the wine to remember that it only\nLasts for maybe like six months to a year they were\nTrying wine at some of the stores and it barely lasted a year and it's just like I feel like that could have been a really nice niche therefore Starbucks you know ... you know right around you know seven o'clock there still technically open but you can go for coffee and dessert or you have a glass of wine and wine tasting or something like that and I'll\nYou know what I Wonder about on that is if maybe I I I almost think that it could have been successful\nBut they just needed a different brand to put it under yeah you know is its own they I don't know what you call like you're not going to call wind box but whatever you want to call you know one thing that actually sounds smart but just you know Starbucks is a place where people sit down you know they might spend the afternoon working on their novel or on a business plan or something and then a couple of people come in to see them\nBut it might just not be the right atmosphere for hey I Want to stop and for you know a couple of hours in the afternoon just for a glass of wine to catch up with someone I almost wonder if they just needed a different brands of put it under yeah it's a small place it's not a bar it's still more of that cafe fielder but just a different\nBrand yeah the environment just doesn't Timmy lend itself to kind of a wine bar when you think ... that is kind of like ... you know not really that the cafes they wonder about licensing because you know and the town you up you know put up some hot area that's tough yeah and you really have to go like town by town\nAnd I'm sitting there should be like a wine bar or you know the Marshfield Starbucks or something like that but it's something in downtown Boston or something like you know somewhere near Boston yeah I think I could see that happening a\nWeekly mortgage applications down one point seven percent we know of interest rates above a rather mortgage rates above five percent a thirty year fixed mortgages which just psychologically feels like a huge difference I mean don't get me wrong it is a big difference from where we were a\nYear and a half ago at three and a half percent but it just when you see that five in front of you know the the decimal can we haven't seen that he's alive [laughter] like\nI I think about it for someone like me and I'm someone who again by the time I got out of college rates were bottoming out okay I look at it and I say I've never seen that that five number up their consistently when I've been in the market for house it just feels different\nYep yep well not to mention the market in general is also
