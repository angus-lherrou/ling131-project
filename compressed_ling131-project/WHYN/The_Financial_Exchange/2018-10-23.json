Springfield\nAnd have fair trade with China what with their bunch of damn thieves you know you look if you look down the case study I'll give you an example they they you'll get a judgment against the Chinese company for intellectual property theft and you know what they'll do they'll sue you in China with the crooked court system and get the same judgment young China going their way\nAnd that you know you've got apple stores in China\nThat are not apple stores I mean they they it that the list goes on the amount of fraud and the amount of thievery that goes on the Chinese it's just unbelievable and it may be something where we have to say we may have to go into a recession\nIn order to spank them and that I think that maybe what the market as anticipated I totally agree and by the way\nWhen I said this is more barest than I thought I'm not saying this is what I think we should not do I'm saying from a market perspective from a market that gets forty to forty five percent of its earnings non us you know the idea of us becoming a little more insular the idea of us having a spat with\nThe costs that did okay this country like them or not and China represents forty percent of all of the world's growth and\nIt represents the growth story for great American companies like caterpillar like General Motors I could go on and on this movie very well justified but if this is the new reality in his blood um airport and said whoever wins the war for a high winds the world now\nThat is the world we're in and we have Peter Navarro calling the shots it may be the right thing and you're right but what are the consequences of investor I say it's more barest now that it was eight weeks on the fundamental of what's going on in the world so you just from the stock\nOkay let's talk from an investor perspective you got the Dow down four hundred and twenty seven points when does ... when does it become a buying opportunity I think now because here's here's the reality in a truck and I were\nTalking about this excuse me I have to leave I'm going to go buy some stock [laughter]\nI'll tell you why because I ... you know where it's sixteen point nine times forward earnings trucks is nowhere like fourteen Fifteen I said no I checked a month ago we're at sixteen point nine now we're at Fifteen that's assuming you get to eat correct but we're getting the the ease or even above\n... expectations are so that number is real that number is substantial and it Fifteen times earnings that's the average price to earnings ratio ... which means we could have a major backup an interest rates and still\nJustify these stock price yeah but the ... you could have a price to earnings ratio go to eleven what was it back in two thousand eight and nine\nBut we have growing earnings even by what we've talked about which is barest of earnings will go eight or nine percent that's environment that will be very supportive of a Fifteen multiple on stocks and ... and it would allow us to go to four and a half percent on the long bond that's just my substantive fundamental\nRight you're on your and you are you're you're not a technical trader who and who are fundamental and you're not worried you so you would by today\nAnd not worry about it because you're holding the stocks for five years ten years absolutely what if you're the guy though that's got to pay a tuition bill next August or being stocks or what have you made a couple that has to uh\nThey they there has to uh you know pay a for a wedding you know they ... they I guess that what you're saying is that money ... your long term you're fine in the short term you a little nervous my issue\nIs I don't I never know the short term my theory is whatever you have today that's created a little bit of wealth that states to what you did five years ago as thanks for ten years ago what you do today influences your life five years ten years from now if you got tuition bills coming up next year\nI was any forecast is going to say you should be in stocks like ever because look\nBad markets can get worse right in the short term the market as voting machine in the long term it's weighing machine mhm\nI not the lecture here but I I just feel like for a longer term money this actually is a rational entry points good and it's not a good time to sell if you have more money that's just my God you're not selling today I'll tell you one one thing I'm doing in terms of in terms of acid allocation if this turns into a panic\nThat forces money into bonds against in my opinion it would be a dumb move to do to commit heavily at the ball right right but if it causes your bond that you like to get out of to go up in price right you might be able to pair off some of that and by some cheap stocks or lead again the money market where you are the same up\nTake any risk you heard it here first of all this is my opinion by John ... doing a lot to bring down my blood pressure is ... very appreciate you know we should do is let's take a look at the yield on the ten year treasury\nOr the ten year treasury three Thirteen seat under the gun there you go now if that gets down around three and the VIX is only twenty three which is yeah your blood pressure's like around one forty seven right now [laughter] I Know I I look I'm not yours but my heart I remember the victims\nRemember back in the in in in twenty seven twenty twenty ... twenty seven and a twenty or eat them in February\nYeah I Know you've got an you're thirty that it's like panic time yesterday is all a\nJump off a bridge well we'll see I mean time will tell\nAnd you know John raises some good points if you need the money in the short term to pay tuition do our wedding you shouldn't be invested in stocks it's just it's just too volatile no you're you're you're you're wrecking a very valid argument but like I said I mean we always tell people stand stay put ...\nI mean the time to buy insurance for your house is not when you

Russia pumps the gas and then they simply put it in a pipeline and they send it to Germany so obviously their costs are quite a bit lower than ours because we have to\nPump the gas in the pipeline we have to freeze it and we used to put her on a boat and then we have to ship it and then we have to I thought and then put it in another pipelines are costs are considerably higher than those of Russia but the problem is\nRussia is corrupt if you look at what I did that you know I don't know if you remember this but\nSeveral years ago Russia just said to Ukraine who is misbehaving right\nWe're not gonna we're gonna turn the heat off in January and they did [laughter] these are not nice people and they could do the same thing to Germany and we defend Germany yet right we spend hundreds of millions of dollars defending Germany and Angela Merkel saying well we want to buy it from Russian 'cause it's cheaper will find you want to do do business with Iran\nHow much longer do you think it's going to be cheaper and soon as you start buying it from the U.S ear price is going to go up from Russia and not to mention the fact that we are an ally and they are from right exactly there and if not an enemy certainly a potential enemy and and this is a case where you know the president did talk about\nEurope needs to come around and be a better friend ... and give us a little bit more of an advantage for all that we do and I think this is directly tied to the president's personal lobbying efforts to get your up in Germany in particular\nTo be friendlier to the United states and to give us more of their business and he intensely lobby Europe\nTo by significant amounts of el ingenious part of that as opposed to Russia who's held more German most than any other country in Germany has killed more Russians than any other country this is a case where I think the president was right\nI think is right now I take the case and and he had the total law on his side it's good for Germany to absolutely because they're not beholden to Russia rough [laughter]\nIt's like being beholden to the mob right\nYou don't want to open ... anything no no you do now he's not a good guy to be indebted
