companies are on the failure to use radio five sixty\nWhy in an WHYY NSM ACC Springfield [noise]\nAlternatives to the bond market and guaranteed types of things I think about the utility sector\nOr in a traditionally a very conservative area of the stock market a grim guaranteed profits are regulated by the states say national grid paying a dividend yield right now of nearly six percent per year and dividends that's pretty attractive but the tenure treacherous paying three and a quarter\nYeah I Wonder how big how high\nThe CD rates need to get before investors say hey\nWhat am I why am I investing in these companies at\nThe ... at the margin there was a little bit of a difference all the time but like your question is at what point do you crack when I go okay collectively let's get out of this stuff and let's go way to fix type stuff\nUh I think that number is in the four percent four and a half percent area and you people might laugh at that but you know what in Nineteen Ninety nine last time we had a robust rock and roll stock market that ended up becoming too expensive\nThe ten year treasury was six point two percent yeah OK up ... and people were not buying the guaranteed six point two they all wanted on stocks right we've learned our lesson sure um so the question now is in the real normal world what is that right probably another hundred basis points higher would be real competition for stocks\nSome more practical examples writer so I have a thirty year mortgage rate locked in at three point eight seven five percent\nOkay I'm very happy with that right when I have extra money I have a choice I can invest that extra money\nOr I can pay down by ... those are two of my options I could also go blow it on a National Guard but that's just not an me [laughter]\nBut at three point seven five I Would rather invested in the stock market over ten year time horizon I Believe that the stock market's gonna beat out the cost of my mortgage I fight a five percent mortgage and I'd be a much tougher conversation for me and much more difficult a math equation\nAnd you know what the the the exercise you're doing right now is an explanation of what's going on right now with the stock market because well what you're talking about doing with your with your mortgage you know is what investors every day think about that incremental extra dollar they have to invest\nWhat do I get to safe what do I get for risk right and in Nineteen Ninety nine they were all willing to take a risk at any cost and we learned the pain of doing that sure right now you're seeing you know the the the people who are very nervous because they're worried that it's one of those moments I don't think we're there yet though unless we had a really large quick increase\nYou're going to still see twenty percent earnings get growth yep overwhelm these issues were talking about\nIt it's the story of a lot of different markets right you know people are worried about the real estate markets well it's slowing down that doesn't mean it's heading for a crash it just means that prices aren't continuing to grow at seven eight percent per year nationwide\nOr you know when I look at the stock market yeah I I I see some cracks when I look at the U.S economy I see some cracks in the foundation but\nIt doesn't mean that or you know suddenly ... you know suddenly publicly traded companies are just gonna start losing money hand over foot it just means that well maybe instead of earnings growth growing at twenty percent maybe it comes down to ten or Fifteen Years on and on\nTop of that there there's another issue I mean you're talking about the overall market which absolutely is true with in the market what we've had and you can understand the complacency that happens if Amazon works in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand sixteen and two thousand Seventy investor just kind of get used to\nRolling their money at all the companies that worked as an investment now he's a great business is what we're seeing happening right now is a rather dramatic rotation\nOut of that which we just got used to buying any price ... and into a lot of the really good value that exist in the stock market in places like financials and places like some of these industrial southern overlooked\nUh we're seeing some of the out of favor stocks now doing really well and some of the real high flyers coming down to earth that's a healthy correction yep yeah and we're not even there yet and we're not even there in terms of correction ... random initial socks we're seeing some go Jared others combat that's a nice healthy thing when you get the expensive stuff kind of coming down\nThe inexpensive stuff going up that get you to a more normal valuation yep so\nYes we have seen volatility yes than as acts down almost four percent so far in October but still up twelve percent year to date so it you know we have to keep all of this\nAh in mind and consider the backdrop of what we're dealing with today are right now by the looks of it uh in terms of the odds and looks like they're the forty one percent probability that the fed raises rates three or more times by the end of\nJune of twenty Nineteen and that's the big concern going forward I mean look we'll that stopped the economy no no but uh it will take out some access and we can we talk about Pina there is no alternative that's a theme that you know buried I've been talking about for years\nUp there actually is a little bit of alternative and you can now get three percent and next year if we have three increases you know you're gonna be taking a look at that mortgage or you can be looking at that you know money market account and saying you know what\nI'm not going to be in such a rush to put that money to work and my money market accounts them getting three percent right um that's a competitive return so these ... and again this we should point out that that earnings are increasing at a twenty percent right there and that's very very healthy\nUm I don't want to be the dead horse on China here but let's talk about this meeting because at least from what I have seen a U.S relations with China while\nVery difficult and and privately we talk about how bad they are but I've never really recalled a public meeting between us and Chinese officials that was this fraught with\nContention yeah secretary of state Mike Pompeo exchange rather testy words with Chinese foreign minister and he was I thought he the pump a it was actually the ... one of the two when he was going crazy yeah [laughter] I mean they're not happy and we we understand that\nA and this is complicating other issues in terms of international relations namely the anticipated summit with North Korea yeah\nSo it's kind of a mess out there and politics is overriding this I mean they're watching our politics and we're watching their situation\nThat got to me that the north Korea issue to me is the only regrettable part\nOf our current policy towards China I pretty much agree with all of the\nMaybe not the cause of you to avoid public he said about the terrorists but the fact that we implemented these terrorists in our sticking to them right now I'm generally\nA big supporter of because of China's actions around or you know stealing proprietary information yeah the only piece that aside impact that is regrettable to me is North Korea so unpredictable and we might have been close to wrapping something up there but that that might really take a hit\nBecause of these relations yeah I mean I at the same time you know we do have a good communication with the north Koreans and and really we can't trust them completely completely you can't buy T you can stop war but you can't really buy these\nAre the fact of the matter is that we have an improving relations with them and they can't be launching nuclear weapons while they're talking to us so that's that's the kind of good news but it's a complicated situation and my fear is that China I've heard rumors that China may be looking to the United states and saying\nYou know Trump is being so tough on us we're just going to suck it up for the next year or so and hope to get someone better and twenty twenty\nThat's the case we could have quite a stand up I like breaking news Nikki Haley has resigned as UN ambassador according to a source on CNBC that's huge news because she is a rising star is on the national scene a and a surprising fries resignation yet resigning as as you went to Vassar what we're going to cover that story\nI when we come back we're all going to be talking about the data breach of the week coming out of Google so we'll be covering that story as well stay tuned right here on the financial exchange radio network\nTex gay weren't barrier to six three five six six and let us know where do you think of other stories we discuss your tuned to the financial exchange radio network\nMany of you listening today are most likely nearing retirement age and if you haven't thought deeply about planning for your retirement type ... as a message for you there will help you through the process\nMany of you listen to talk on for years I'm illegal exchange radio program know that he's an expert an elder law in a state planning\nIt was on a on a a media call he made a third person reference to a um a bad\nWord racial slur a racial slur ... I I don't know if the media conference or an internal conference call but nonetheless he was ousted because of that and that was the reason I I've heard that uh\nThe culture papa Johns was was also part of it because I got to believe is more than him just saying I don't think there was Abraham Lincoln referred to so and so as being something that would make you lose your your business literally\nOut what's happening right now is the agency who partners up with John who has thirty percent of the stock and what happens so that's that's where we stand right now trying on his considered considering a takeover of papa Johns and there's other companies also that could be in the building you know\nThey own Wendy's they own dominoes at one point you know an arby's to I Believe uh it would make some sense that what they haven't dealt with I haven't seen try and dealing with a company in big\nPublic turmoil before you know they haven't they haven't to address that issue of a papa John's type of scenario they haven't you know they haven't dealt with the company a lot of these companies you know CBS type of scenario where you're dealing with a CEO has been who has been in the spotlight\nAnd is very polarizing they dealt with you know issues within companies about sales and profits and things like that but not a big\nI Want to start a fight type of story because of the CEOs actions\nYou know and and this is the key point the key point is it's pizza\nAnd you can get decent pizza at a lot of different places or\nWhat differentiates you in that business is image an image alone leave that images tarnished you're stuck with a piece of pizza that that anybody can get where ever they want a ... however they want and and the problem the question that the sixty four thousand dollar question is\nHow damage is that brand damage on they had a\nPretty good ad that I saw I think during the super during the football game on Sunday maybe ah with all the franchise owners lawn they they just you know had clips of ten second clips of a bunch of different franchise owners or a papa John's right basically saying\nYou know that's not us still come to our store a ... a diverse group of people trying to really put that behind them because that's what's hurting it yeah it's hurting the stock papa John's but it's really hurting the franchise owners\nAnd here's the thing at the end of the day we talk about your ... which is which is controversial\nBut you're totally has something kind of proprietary and they're going to have a lot of challenges no question about that but you know they can overcome it by saying we actually have different food we actually have a different presentation we actually have something you can't get a whole lot of other places\nEvery town has like five pizza shops and so it's going to be a real challenge them but if they can come through this and they had the backing of a company that is really good at the food business and they're part of that chain you know it could work out\nAnd I mean papa Johns was the main reason that I put on Fifteen to twenty dollars so I mean I I'm a big supporter or they weren't around I was I wasn't even bigger supporter at one point you know twenty pounds bigger [laughter] what'd you could have been equally twenty pounds bigger with pizza I could've\nOr does or dominoes I could've papa John's is the only one that was on the ah the college meal plan so that that was for\nMe dominoes just delivered you know two thirty AM and college and uh did that many weekends\nYeah and nothing to be proud of mine is I Would take my pizza but I'm going to regret this poll questions Davis now all I'm going to be thinking about his pizza for the next hour and twenty minutes you do have a poll question up on financial exchange show dot com Tucker once you walk through it yeah our a poll question today is what is your favorite national\nPizza chain not not local or anything like a like Bob

I. O. N. G. transport and also import most recently though the spot rate or transport searched\nA couple of months ago on a on a show a season of outside a lot of about forty thousand dollars they operate in the last week that there's over a hundred thousand dollars per day\nWow so demand growth is definitely strong we know that and that's that's part of the reason for what's going on do you fear though that might be peaking\nOr no not at all it back the or the ... or ... ... ... twenty Twenty one on meanwhile the demand is protected to grow between ten and ... percent per year going forward so we're actually very ... on the for two and a half to three years in fact I think we're just getting started ... ...\nWhat do you see the upside on this stock and whenever you talk about their earnings you know a little bit about the financial just you know how healthy they are and how expensive the stock is\nYeah absolutely so the last quarter or we actually had pretty low bar it's like I was saying they're lower forty thousand dollars a this summer going forward or the current rates are about a hundred thousand dollars per day it was just the earnings the sky rocket a the third quarter is going to go up\nI we don't exactly on the earnings it's easier to forecast the but the there's a lotta up right off the stuff like that\nBut we should be a three pick up a lot or they already raised or give it into a hundred and fifty percent on the last quarter and they've got it they going forward as the uh the the docking increase the evidence also increased us I think will always be a that David and potentially a much has doubled over the next year\nAnd then as a further transport right get locked in on longer term charters which are the more stability there\nWhat kind of field is that right now\nBut you've pretty low on on dealing gee it's more growth like okay uh pasta right now the ... yeah right now the yoga only around ... percent ... I'm going for it like I said when they walk in those long term charters but the more\nSort of getting an above a money market yield for waiting which which which is nice any other ... in that sector or is this the one company really like and what are some of their competitors\nYes or their main competitor as gas log in both the L O G ... the main other transport way and we like them as well but the valuations just aren't quite as good\nAs a fact Gore and oh as he has more spots are than gas locked out\nAnd yet it's not really factored into the valuation if you look at the last six months or so of stock trade but the stock chart you'll see that a lot of gas logged already see more of a game in that short another player that we like is that you Cale and partners yeah ...\nAnd that's more of a foreign income play other might or might appeal more to some of the folks on her show their\nExcellence will ... minutes Myer uh from seeking out for the stock again his goal R. L. N. G. symbol G. L. N. G.\nJay thanks very much like you are doing you\nKnow I think the the big thing you need to be worried about and I don't know how much a G L and jeeze businesses coming directly out of the United states in terms of what we export but China did just slap tariffs on us Ellen gee\nYeah I'm ... that's got to be one of the main things you're thinking about if you are you're an investor in the you know specifically the United states Ellen gee export business uh that that could that could certainly throw a\nWrench into thing you know I think about how many times we're talking about individual stocks yeah and we say exactly that the impact that terrorists could be substantial or it might not it depends how this plays out\nThere's two things that I worry about what I'm Talking about buying any stock today what is Amazon going to do to it I don't think Amazon is going to get in the ... space but what is you know what are the China trade tariffs going to do to it and that ... that one could impact is stuck so interesting sector to be operating\nAnd I always ask myself what can we do domestically how how how good is this business right here at home and if they're doing really well at home and they make their stuff here we don't have to worry about the terrorists we don't\nYeah you know ... that may impact prices overall remains to be seen that's it for this hour the financial exchange coming up on the next hour we're gonna be talking about the storm bearing down on Florida right now and uh get back a little bit into that Google story and the data breach that we saw state you're in here the financial shape\nDad can you believe I'm counting on my ... year when you add applied mark ...\nThat's amazing lens timeshare flies wait until you've been in it for over Thirty years and your original client's children and even grandchildren are calling you to help them with their mortgages well\nMy friends I guess buying their first towns now so let's not rush them on the kids and grandkids yet but I'll be around to help and I'm ...\nThe documents ... there's a quote from the wall Street Journal the document shows Google officials felt that disclosure could have serious ramifications revealing the incident would likely result in us coming into the spotlight along side or even instead of Facebook despite having stayed under the radar throughout the Cambridge analytical scandal\nThis is so much worse yeah there there's just so much worse than having been alongside Facebook during that issue\nAnd think about what they're saying is Facebook has got a lot of bad publicity\nLet's not get on the way that type of listening now let's just make sure all the best that listen to this right under the rug is all Cambridge Analytica and all the issues Facebook has let's keep our problems quiet yep on top of the fact that the major technology companies were invited to Washington to discuss issues\nAnd I you know I I'm I defend the government they kept that seat empty\nGoogle nobody showed up now and they won't face the music and they have a lot of issues to deal with in terms of privacy and the way in which they regulate themselves it's basically a self regulation is like a whole different world\nYeah it's not good chief executive officer a cinder ... almost definitely going to be testifying in Congress now we are now we are no doubt about it a subpoena time exotic they're they're lucky Europeans GDP the ... journal data protection regulation just went into effect in may whereas this incident took place in March\nOr that new law requires companies to notify regulators breaches within ... hours so if this law had been to place than Google it'd be facing a massive fine from the European regulators as\nThere are kind of in a gray area now as to what's actually going to happen if there will be any fines for probably there when I went to ... I Will give European regulators a lot of credit because they've been pretty good rule\nYeah it's a great role and they've been way out in front of the rest of the world when it comes to issues concerning Google ... ... and it was at a point of it you're disappointed the United states does not have a law like this on the books it is\nOr the lack of regulation is really troublesome because uh there's millions and millions of people who are using these products\nThey're following us everywhere we go they're listening to our conversations they know more about us than we think we know about ourselves on the other hand and they and they operate independently and it's like don't bother us we're not accountable and and I know\nThe argument the other hand as well if you don't like it don't sound on Facebook\nFair but there are some services that it's really difficult to you know there's some online services that's pretty difficult to not participate in ... it's tough to not have an email address these days yeah although there are ... yeah there are options though there are options that are more secure than yoga agreed but hey you still need to have data protection laws in place to protect us from\n... it's very difficult to ... had no on line a personality today to have no online presence whatsoever is very very difficult in this day and age it's hard not to be on Facebook\n... or ... especially if you're in business a major and if you're in business if you have a if you're trying to keep up with family down the main reason that I use it uh all of my\nIn my family ah in my wife's family is on Facebook and wants pictures of my kids and it's just a heck of a lot easier [laughter]\nWe've got great pictures of your kids and I can I can tell you that it's one of the highlights of Facebook at least\nOn my ... the European general data protection regulation by the way a threatens penalties up to two percent of your world of the companies worldwide revenue if they fail to adhere to these rules so I'm pretty stiff regulation that unfortunately was not in place when Google broke these rules\nAre so we will see what happens with school based on these results they're beginning to be held accountable that is good news and the good news if your Google investor on the other hand is\nFortunately this isn't all that Google does Oh absolutely now a Facebook
