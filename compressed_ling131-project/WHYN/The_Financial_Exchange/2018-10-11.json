I I Know we have to get into politics on this but the uh the cabinet thing has awakened to the Republican base in a lot of the country in a way nobody saw but does that change anything from a policy perspective\nA you um that's a good point because you wind up with sort of the kind of divided paralyzed the main thing they have now with the exception of what happens in the house and\nYou know to what extent is even a station pinned down by multiple investigations out of the house of representatives so I I look at this and I say yeah they ... there's not much moving into you aside from these inflation fears and when I look at something along those lines\nThose are things that the market can overcome in the long run because we we saw earlier this year they they did okay the inflation that we thought we were going to see over the first six months to this year didn't materialize at least not in miserable for you know didn't show up in the CPI the PC or any of those numbers that we look at\nAnd so those are things that the market can get over what it can't get over okay if you do have a material change from a political perspective Italy decides look we can't get along with Germany and we need to leave the euro zone hey that's the material change from how the world is today\nThat something that you don't just get over that you have to completely rebuild your model of how the world looks and how it works so from my perspective worries about inflation\nThings that you can get over especially because Jay Powell could come out tomorrow and say\nHey I Know I said this last week but here's what I really meant by it and all of a sudden this whole thing goes away just like that it's done so and I tend to look at interest rate hikes from the ... we've had bizarrely low interest rates for ten years and you know it's actually it's banned the fed\nGiving the kids a sugar water for ten years and the faster we get back to normal interest rates that can be lowered you know when there's an actual or economic downturn to stimulate the economy the factory unwind the whole ...\nOr you know taking the streets down to zero experiment the better as far as I'm concerned if it's a little painful in the short term and let's talk about that a little bit here okay because I think there was a really good case in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis hey we've got to get rates low in order to make sure that the whole thing doesn't fall apart\nBut then keeping them low for so long I think a lot of investors got accustomed to it and they stopped looking at stocks on a fundamental basis of what company can actually continue to exist if things normalized and they said hey the punch bowls open why don't we buy shares of Tesla because\nIf it's not going to let them go out of business they'll keep rates low so they can keep borrowing that's not normal though which the Fed's job and this is my not just my view this is how their charters written ... job is not to keep companies in business\nDoesn't say that anywhere in their mandate it's not hey let's keep the stock market up and keep companies in business the feds mandate control inflation make sure that we are as close to full employment as possible correct so from my perspective I think a lot of investors got a little bit complacent\nAnd when they finally got down in and said jeep Powell signaling this and now you've got a little inflation showing up in a couple of places they panicked because they may you may have been out over their skis a little bit\nPanics reversible you know it's again you can you can put that genie back in the bottle it takes time took three months to kind of get the market back to normal this spring but it did so I work at this it's a short term fluctuation I think you're going to see continued volatility do you think\nI mean these things don't go away overnight would you agree no I mean you're at the point where are you know let's remember that were nine and a half years into you know one of the greatest bull markets of all time and you know they don't go on forever and there are\nA corrections and there are changes and you know you've seen in the pressured market or to see treasury straighten round three point to an end to seven years yeah and you know when the summer they were two point eight so that's been\nYou know for a forty point move in the treasury market or in just a matter of weeks is you know rarely do you describe the treasury market as dramatic but that's pretty dramatic\nIt certainly is so let's take a quick break and when we come

hard today both of them down close to one percent a healthcare also in the red as well\nBut tech having a nice little bounce back up point three percent communication services which is you know the new sector that was created it has a lot of the social media companies and so forth up about a quarter percent for some of the hardest to companies\nBouncing back initially I think time will tell us whether this is a dead\nCat bounce here or something that's for real another thing that I find fascinating Delta Airlines up close to five percent or improving as of right now you met a continental up a two point nine percent\nMakes me wonder if a ... got a little oversold yesterday on fears of jet fuel disruptions at a hurricane Michael but that's that was an interesting surprise to me I was wondering what have you been a do many flights planned or the rest of the fall or the holiday season or anything that lasted for Thanksgiving\nWhat have you seen price wise they can't get my wife to agree on what we're going to fly so no you know it's a it's a a flying around Thanksgiving is just paint you know I just buy the ticket and cause mass\nIt seems like those prices are a lot higher this year than one or two years ago and I wonder just of the airlines being able to if they're seeing hey we can actually push through some price increases because the demand is there right\nNow people are you know a three point seven percent unemployment and a comedy doing better and you know I always feel like I'm all the things I waste money on airfare for Thanksgiving to be with family that's something I'm pretty happy to waste money on but you know it's our\nTruck I was going to ask her are you doing you're a annual a fly on the day after Thanksgiving this year\nNot this year and find two days earlier do are going down a little bit earlier otherwise would have been absolutely fine but I'm going to ... the big thing so I'm going after a Christmas this year I'm heading down to a Florida for a few days and just you know get a little bit of sun and you know kind of reset for early winter into force\nAnd the big thing that I'm seeing is the fights are just nutty right now like eight hundred dollars plus unless you want to fly on Christmas Day or on New Year's day pretty much ... um so it's it's just nuts wears in previous years\nYou know it'd be able to find stuff you know half that cost a lot of cases even not on those May Day so it's definitely a lot more expensive it seems like I even got to the point where I was poking around on spirit that's how desperate I'd gotten to find a cheap flight\nAnd careful somebody's going to come on board with the squirrels but by the time I finally like figure it out like how much it was all going to cost if I actually had a seat on the plane if I had to carry on bag it was still going to be like almost the same amount as anyone else yeah so\nI punted on that just because I flew spirit one's going to Atlantic City but uh you know there's a difference and being stuck on a plane for forty five minutes like\nThat and Brian block on one like it sounds like a really great trip you fly on spirit airlines and then when you get off the plane you're in Atlantic City [noise] yeah it it everything kinda\nMatches you know it's just like okay I I I Know what I'm getting into on this on all counts but I just for a longer fight I'm just not sure that it's it's quite\nWhat I Want not comprised three trips to Atlantic City an spirit or what what's third more of them nine trips\nAnyway is that is Wall Street watch presented by leader bank and the rent the landlord stop chasing down late payments and skip the trip to the bank now he can sit back relax while we rent collection rebel trunk we signed up today is the rent dot net or call Seventy one six for one eight six nine one\nFor details so the CBS at the bill finally getting approval by the Justice Department\nHuge news for our ah listen there are a listener audience a given that you could CBS and one second Rhode Island at night in Hartford\nAnd a part of the CBS has at least promising for now they're going to keep a several thousand jobs in Hartford for a for there's a but if this you know is a move that really kind of solidifies\nAre both companies at night and a CBS you know as you see Wal Mart getting into health insurance to so much cause pressure uh this'll be a very interesting deal to see if the rationale behind it really uh plays out\nYeah in a matter of fact we can learn what happened\nToday before and here's what I'm getting at I'm going back to Nineteen fifty during all markets and this is certainly a bull market there had been twenty times when the ... five hundred created down at least three percent on one single day\nAnd then if you look forward to month\nThe U.S and the five hundred and Ninety percent of the time has rallied almost seven percent\nSo hey we've seen this before is where is it is and being these kinds of movies and bull market do happen typically their opportunities to buy in rats deliberately right\nNothing fundamentally changed yesterday and if anything headline that the wall Street Journal literally just put out\nProbably you were calling me on is that a President Trump and she plans to speak at the G twenty coming up in November and from my point of view that actually is is a change and it's good news um so you know that that that's my take on on where we are at this moment\nThat on the book to drill down to specific issues or if you're looking around at a individual stocks anything that's looking interesting to you today because it took maybe too much of a pounding over the last week\nCalling yeah my whole portfolio although in in you know I'm I'm kind of ... look I'm I'm Still up you know call at six and a half percent um I gave up three percentage points over the past two weeks so that's been painful you know you go from ten to six and a half but there'll be it\nUm as I look at my portfolio now and I have forty nine name in condition um I've been adding to them on the field that I think are most apropos certainly our listeners um believe it or not China I think China's gotten way over to and I'm looking at Ali Baba ... be a be a\n... and that way though take or W. B. just a quick comment on each of these em Ali bother secret Gulf right it's not just the Amazon if China\nThe Amazon of Asia um they operate thirty difference the city areas are growing thirty five percent now trading ... burning stocks down about\n... thirty five forty percent from a high way though the Twitter of China has all of the Chinese celebrities that ad revenues are and they sell them\nOn like you know art where all these celebrities imaginative came crashing were selling you know for whatever line on on on Twitter I'm so they they monetize that revenues are growing fifty five percent it it could with trading under twenty times on and on\nAnd it's down sixty percent from hot so you know that's my point there's a real opportunity I wouldn't want to talk about by China but guess what that would be value but right now and I am buying\nInteresting country and take on China why the heck doesn't Twitter allow what you just described\n[laughter] I don't know I Wish they would in fact I'm On Facebook I bought Facebook on that the one of my favorite scene when great companies you know certainly been you know plenty of stumbles at Facebook and if they would just start\nMonetize the platform yes with failed they're starting to do that on Instagram one quick yup here's how it works and you see the sun it's got a fascinating but then you go to Google and you um you know you go to Patagonia because you like to buy the the board shorts OK fine or you don't buy any well\nAll the cookies are stored on your machine and now Facebook has access to those cookies Facebook and see that you went to Google that's how you start getting Google as well\nAnd Instagram now they're creating these um and then again they do that the way beyond China big you're getting these one quick thing so in your Instagram feed it a have those words short you just saw on Patagonia by them with one click\nClick and boom you buy them and to me that is the way forward a fact they're doing it on Instagram things just to me they might start doing it on the main Facebook Platform that's the kind of monitors ... that I Love it\nOut I'm looking at a inflation I Want to circle back to that briefly just 'cause it's been in focus the last week both with again Jerome Powell talking a jobs report on friday showing you know three point nine percent wage rules for the third quarter which is outstanding to see and then obviously this PIN number we got the other day\nAnd then all of a sudden you get one of these today where the CPI comes in we weaker than it is no way we weaker than expected what is going do you have any idea what's happening inflation was ... I I continue to look at all these numbers\nAnd they don't pay any consistent picture from one to the ... I I I feel with the last\nAh well I'm In you're absolutely right there's so many different measures that they should be able to say is traditionally looked at a what's called the king the core yup um and that's running it one night or two you can look at headline CPI depending upon the month 'cause it's a volatile number you\nKnow it it might be who's seven to nine but they're all these different measures of inflation um the thing that I'm watching more closely than any of those headline that place numbers his way to grow\nAnd you know you just mentioned the one number you know the bureau has six I'm number I'm also looking at companies the fact that Starbucks is not going to start paying everybody Fifteen dollars the fact that that ... one of my long\nUm and it got hit somewhat up today by the way but um but it got it a couple of weeks ago when it noted on a conference call that it's going to start paying people more ah that'll cut in the margins lately\nI also expect they're going to pass that on the on the wage ... of the a wage price\nSpiral is what my former economics professor Alan Blinder it prints that used to always talk about it goes when when you start um spiraling wages and prices that when you have a nation fortunately I'm we're still\nWay below where that becomes an issue um with the last number it to point nine percent it's not until you get to about three eight three nine that it's it's a worry but um wages that that's what I'm focused on more than anything else they're finally starting to move which is good\nHard working Americans make or they spend more than ... earnings it's one of the reasons the polish but it's not yet it hasn't yet crossed over where it scares me\nAre good at and we've got to run but thanks for joining us\nA truck Peter I wish we could keep going if they want to talk about the time for having me\nAbsolutely that's Adam Johnson from ...

Florida Panhandle I'm Dave Anthony Fox News homes are gone\nWhen you're building a portfolio make sure that you have the right instrument for what you're trying to do stocks are great if you're trying to build money over to build wealth over the long term if you're trying to you know focus on short term spending needs\nStocks might be the single worst thing you can oh\nOkay I was stocks but I don't hold them for you know my car payment I Need to make next month it just doesn't make sense and you know the one upside uh to what we're seeing with interest rates is you know you look go shopping for an online CD or online savings account and those numbers are\nFinally starting to look you can you can find two years CDs or two seven five almost three percent now and if that's money you need twenty four months from now or you know in in my experience\nUh the last upside to you know money that you could have had in the stock market for two years is so much less painful than the downside of money left in the stock market to what what\nYou've got ten thousand dollars that you put away for a car you know you need a car in the next year okay is it worth trying to get that up to eleven thousand with the danger that it could fall down to seven\nIn my book it's not just because you don't know what the market's going to do in the short term so I I tend to agree with you on this does lead us to our poll question of the day how worried are you about the markets sell off very worried slightly worried are not worried at all Tucker what kind of results are we seeing in a in the ...\nA leading the way right now is a amongst our listeners are not worried at all at forty two percent fall by slightly worried at forty percent and uh finishing distant third is very worried at Seventeen percent\nAnd I I like already and I think they've dealt with threats you know it's ... and again it's not saying that you know you should look at this and say gee that's interesting that the market felt you know three and a half percent yesterday\nBut if you've allocated yourself properly it shouldn't make a difference in your overall long term plan and that's that's the big thing that you need to be focused on what to talk a little bit about what President Trump is focused on because we had a couple of comments from him yesterday specifically are with regards to the Federal Reserve\nA with him saying that the fed had quote\nDon logo arose rather was going loco\nHe he's bilingual who knew what's what's your take on\nIt it's a\nYou know it's a unique approach to ah speaking about the fed or president has unique approach to speaking out a lot of different things for you know the past forty four presidents typically a you had them not making critical comments about fed and fed policy and sort of\nYou know trying to stay out of that and um you know it's part of the whole deal that I think you get with this current president he's going to speak his mind you know a way that we have not\nBeen a particularly accustomed to before this\nAnd um you know I Would say on the on the merits of it um it looks to me like the fed is being anything but logo you know now is the time with what we're seeing with inflation with economic growth if now is not the time to get back to a scene interest rate policy when is [noise]\nAnd and I think the you know a lot of people talk about okay is you know is it appropriate that the president's talking about the fed and this and that and what the Fed's a bunch of grown ups thinking fend for themselves so I'm not worried about you know to the president break the fourth wall and talk to the fed when\nThey're grown ups they can deal with themselves they're all adults they all knew how to handle themselves they're all mature people who can you know deal with things like this what I'm curious about in in what I kind of get out of this you know because everyone will go through that and said oh you know the ... supposed to be independent how could you do this I Will get it and ask\nWhat if he's right okay where is he writes ... is the wrong in from my perspective\nI don't think he's right on this but here's why I don't think he's right when you look at what the fed is doing here they have a dual mandate okay their mandate is to keep inflation in check and maintain full employment okay they're supposed to do both of those things\nWith the current policy that they are are they are doing both of those things inflation is in check it's not too hot and we are at full employment so when I look at what the fed is doing\nI don't really have a huge problem with it in the interim okay now they could get to a point where they start to escalate to quickly and maybe they start to cause a slowdown that leads the unemployment okay\nHasn't happened yet hasn't happened so I'm not going to criticize them for something that they haven't done to this point they don't have a mandate to maintain stock prices in a narrow range\nSo I don't really get upset at the fed if the market you know it was kind of waking up to this and saying gee there's a threat here that we didn't really price improperly and now we need the prices then that's the markets fault not the feds\nAnd you don't have to worry about mid term elections for weeks\nNo no it's ... and so when when I look at this I say you know it's it's it's interesting 'cause everyone jumped right to oh should the president be doing this I see what it doesn't matter whether he should or not the fed can handle themselves\nThe question is is he right is is he on the money on this end to this point the fed has neither caused a recession nor have they caused additional inflation and so when I look at it I say\nHey I don't think the criticisms warranted if he wants to say go ahead to drill pelican handle themselves and if you're shocked by the president saying shocking things\nYou probably need to get a wake up wake up ... wherever you been for the last three years so I don't have a problem with him saying it because again the fed can deal with it\nBut the interesting thing is pay like ... if their merit behind this and that's where I think the meat really is on this

I mean look at all the overtime games this year or two\nTon of 'em and and the the the games the more competitive\nAnd there's a or B ... is a quarterback driven league at this point oh yeah of all the rules against the defense of yeah there are so many good quarterback like whether you're talking you know people make their first starts like Patrick homes or someone like that\nYou have interesting stories in terms of quarterbacks to new locations you got her cousin's going up to Minnesota you know you've got a lot of good quarterbacks now where'd you go back you know five or ten years ago\nAnd the picture was just\nLike there were a lot of teams that just didn't have a chance you know they they get on the field and it's\nA great you're starting you know Chad Pennington again great you're going to look like you have nothing you can do their wares this year it's\nHey you know we're the Cleveland Browns we've been awful forever\nBut let's see what Baker may feel you know it's just ... there's a little bit more interest especially in some cities that I think down and out for a while there are other cities that are going to continue to be down and out for a while but it seems to be more competitive as a whole\nSo the anthem protests everything like that has had zero effect on the ratings this year you know and all the time they're not showing the old for that\nAnymore and I also wonder you know we're way has the uh Colin Kaepernick Nike ad campaign\nIn some ways it at that too and that sort of pulled some energy on that whole issue away from the NFL but it into Nike and that's probably good for football [noise] the thing that I still find fascinating on that whole thing is you know you of Nike sponsoring the NFL", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Financial Exchange", "city": "Springfield", "day": "11"}
