tell you I'm I\nI just disagree with everything you're saying Sally and and I say that with respect I think that you are\nI Can't say misinterpreting but I think that you are not properly contextualize ing how a person like Kavanaugh would feel under the circumstances\nI think that you're taking a lot of your outside observations about as you say preppy spoiled kids and and try and supposing that onto a man when it doesn't matter if other people have done terrible things when they're in prep school it doesn't matter a fraternity brothers are off in\nA in coherently drunk and there's far too much sexual misconduct among them none of that actually matters\nWhen you're looking at the innocent or guilty of an individual\nDid cabin all do this thing is there evidence to believe he did this thing I answer those questions no and no\nAnd I also think that your your being far too kind to Dr Ford's very selective memory and her recall is such that she cannot be challenged on anything and\nShe's only certain that Kavanaugh's the bad guy I find that a little too convenient I don't believe it\nI don't believe that her memory is accurate maybe she believes that this

convince me of their side or just have a different voice heard so don't feel like I'm In any way trying to shut you down or shut you down I I just have to tell you why I strongly disagree with your

college or if she ever complain of any other instance of sexual assault or having been molested aren't these things that we should note to assess the reliability of her memories from thirty six years ago\nMax let me tell you uh I I agree in the sense that your question here is why is it that we don't get any answers about lousy for\nWhy is it that lousy Ford\nIs a sacrosanct she cannot be cross examined she cannot be challenged her sexual history when she was in high school her sexual history in college or as an adult beyond that none of that can be discussed that meanwhile Kavanaugh can be trashed why is that\nBecause he's accused\nI'm Sorry but we have a system of justice that relies upon oppositional narratives\nAnd it's not just you get the first crack at somebody and then they don't get to come back and tell their side of the story or this is fundamental to our justice system we are letting it'd be abused in front of us right now because there are so many people that\nJust want to believe lousy for desperately want to believe in for reasons of politics for reasons of their own emotional attachment to the notion of sexual abuse is something that has not taken seriously I reject that by the way I think the sexual abuse has taken very seriously\nThere's a reason that sexual abuse in many different ... you know many different iterations is a very serious felonies people go to prison for a long time so I I reject this narrative of sexual abuse is not taken seriously which a lot of people seem to want to believe\nJennifer I'd say their pocket cash listener here first

think it's a scam quite honestly I think the polygraphs aren't used in court for good reason\nAnd I think that we should all be very clear that what's going on here\nIs all coordinated if you didn't

I said to him I said you know you look at what they you know\nThe project for new American Century you look at what they wrote about in the new Pearl Harbor idea that they produce that the demand the signatories on the on the document\nAnd said you look at the ... you look at what they've written about new Pearl Harbor and then they then they said that there was going to be or there can be a even a a biological attack since or a biological attack\nThat could happen and ah it would certainly uh make differences in political move that would change the way politics would run and of course I'm In nine eleven you know during the nine eleven attacks after nine eleven attacks in fact I Believe it was a\nJust a few weeks or a week afterwards and everything you know started happening and it wasn't until about like October fourth I Believe of ah of two thousand one where we started to see that many people were dying from exposure to anthrax\nAnd so I'm Joan said to me you know when I was on the air with him I said what\nDo you think the final ... going to be and I says I said to him I said well I you know I kind of hesitated bit because I I I was afraid to commit to something because you know you commit to something like if you if you if you're a born again preaching say the world's going to and\nLike if it's going to end at the end of the ... you know damn good well it's not going to write because just saying it makes it not happen um so I told him I said I'll tell you it's a biological attack on the United states\nAnd ah I said\nYou know things are just kind of bizarre right now I talked about the Kleenex exercise and it talked about the the er the pandemic and they told them about how they're all being but they're all preparing we have all these uh you know tabletop exercise about biological pandemic events biological attacks\nAnd um you know the idea of a biological attack or some sort of biological chemical weapon being use I you know he speculated on many different ways of this would happen would be carried out whether it would be through an arrow slides attack or you know maybe mosquitoes it'd be released I I was very surprised though\nUm\nIt was very surprised and I and I and I wasn't I guess because I I Wonder when it was going to happen I didn't think it would happen today but I read today that the Pentagon reporter that envelopes containing the biological poison and rice and arrived at the Pentagon I'm the opposite president Senator Ted Cruz is up\nSo I'm a\nBiological attack a happen today a\nBiological poison rice in uh taken from caster beans I remember when you know back in the day we made you drink castor oil in order to purge crap in your body will there's a reason why is castor bean can be made into poison\nAnd um it's a it's it's ...\nAnd it was reported in the two packages containing rice in were intercepted on the way the Pentagon\nHe was confirmed by the department of defense officials that the parcels were there they indicated that the um the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged mail delivery building which is located next door to the defense department's massive headquarters in Washington DC\nAnd you know I'm\nThe FBI now is involved with this and they they're actually been called in to\nLead the investigation into the packages were to address the secretary of defense James Mattis and cheaper naval operations admiral John Richardson and of course there was a letter sent to the president um here's the FBI statement they said uh this is the FBI or the statement they they issued\nOn Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents to possession of too suspicious armed groups that have been screened at the Pentagon male facility those on the lips are currently undergoing further testing as this is ongoing we will have no further comment\nSo as the Washington DC area work to determine the origin of the rice attack\nNews also broke out the two individuals have been hospitalized after being exposed to a powdery substance in the mail center the Texas set to Texas it was a actually a ... it wasn't in Texas it was um\nIt ... I maybe I'm trying to figure out it was his office said Cruz's office where it happened yes there was in Houston, Texas Houston, Texas they sent a Senator Ted Cruz is off as a a rifleman as well or two people were hospitalized or we don't know um how they're doing\nA cruises office said they received a piece of mail\nAddress the Senator Cruz this morning when the male is open to contain the white powdery substance the ninth floor of the Phoenix tower\nWas evacuated after the packages found the Pentagon also reported that rice it was attacked it in the mail and of course writes them since President Trump so um\nYou know so as we predicted um this has happened much like what happened I mean if you remember half a dozen leather letters um\nContaining anthrax spores were mailed to journalists and politicians beginning one week after the nine eleven attacks for leaders was spores and threaten messages have been some recovered all were posts mark from Trenton New Jersey which meant that they had been process at the post and distribution center in uh actually near Hamilton\nJewish or post September Eighteenth one address the Tom Brokaw NBC TV\nAnd another was sent to the editor of the New York post the other two letters were stamped October ninth an address to senators Thomas ... can Patrick Leahy so as people became infected in September October and November\nLocal responses revealed gaps in preparedness for biological attack for example the first confirmation of anthrax case was on October fourth\nIn more than two weeks after the initial as her male so I mean we look at the retrospective assessments of all this and um\nWe we learned that nine people\nThey were exposed to um the rice in African ... about the rising and sorry the anthrax that already contract is that the the or their illness previously had been missed identified because faulty diagnosis erroneous laboratory tests but in the end the final result at the end or in the end twenty two people had become infected\nFive of them died I mean while they were buildings that were\nBelatedly found to be contaminated with anthrax spores and they'd leave from the letters or at least thirty thousand people who are deemed at risk required prophylactic antibiotics like separate and millions more fearful and many of them anxious about opening their own mail after that\nNow\nOf this information that I'm telling you right now about the anthrax attacks I'm sure many people have forgotten\nAnd there's a lot of stuff that after doing research I found out that I did not know about I I did not know there were plenty of other buildings that were leaking some of his uh some of this uh you know biological a powder and uh the anthrax spores I had no idea\nAnd so the seriousness of the rice and attack I Believe I'm you know warrants a lot of questions one is is this would this be considered the first assassination attempt on the president [noise]\nThat's usually dumped on the president [noise] and um [noise]\nWhen you look at all will be attacked was this done in order to slow down [noise] ah the FBI's a report on the Kavanaugh Ford case [noise]\nOrdered to leave the boat [noise] and uh that wouldn't be out of the question either so are there are a lot of things going on right now but I'd sure raise the ... question\nAs to what happened to be with the rights of sexual it's like you're more about that coming up on a Tripoli six seven three three seven hundred\nTripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero\nAnd we'll be back coast to coast am with George ... mornings at one of my news radio ...

happening and ah it's all happening at once and they said this is a is is again of these again and force exercise\nAnd ah I said you know something is going to happen where are the real thing is going to go down and when it does you know we'll know that this the beginning it was the beginning of the final blow them and so I actually well and it could have been ... through the camp trails that could be you\nKnow given through mosquitoes and so today I read that the Pentagon reporter the envelopes containing biological poison rice and arrived at the Pentagon or the office of the president and senator Senator Ted Cruz's campaign office\nSo two packages containing rice and\nWhere is intercepted by on the way to the Pentagon and the existence of the suspected packages was had been confirmed by the department of defense officials who indicated the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged in the mail delivery building on Monday\nBut in an ounce and they were here until Tuesday that was located next door to the defense department and right there is at its headquarters the FBI has been called in now\nTo lead the investigation ended up packages which we're addressing the secretary of defense James ... there was an address to James Mattis\nCheaper naval operations admiral John Richardson and the president Ted Cruz's office they're released this statement\nThis was a statement from the FBI on Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents took possession of too suspicious single ups that had been screened at the Pentagon mail facility\nIs envelopes are currently undergoing further testing and this is ongoing will have no further comment on this\nShow as Washington DC has been working to figure out of this you know this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz has often said they received a piece of mail it was addressed that Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is open it contained white powder\nAnd so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated after packages found Pentagon also reports that rice and was detected and that uh and and so we're having a full on biological attack biological a poison and rice and\nAnd just reminded me if you remember when I was talking about the project for the new American Century I said something to the fact that ah one of the other ways that they can change the direction of anything politically is to use biological warfare and\nEven biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark a you know biological markers that would that would actually activate this stuff and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested or if it's injected if you inhale it and so you can\nSurvive a inhaling a rice and it's just that you can die if you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four\nThe Russian each called here in Oregon tried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote\nOr in Dallas, Oregon\nAnd ah I think here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way to a\nDistract us from it or there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time it's that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night on the ground zero lounge they probably will have this investigation wrapped up by Wednesday\nThey'll hand down their decision and the American people probably won't hear what the decision is and they don't have to be happy I doesn't have to reveal\nAnything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and Kevin I'm going to be confirmed and I think it would trigger a lot of anger with a lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually becomes chief justice\nAnd so tomorrow it to Eighteen eastern time they're gonna be doing that tested emergency test on your telephone so as I said timing is everything this is peculiar\nAnd uh I think we should have a discussion about this because I think that uh you know as we were predicting it I predict it on our showing the show I talked about it at great length on this program for a good long time and people who is this program know that I've done this people who let's this program know that if I'm On it\nSomething and I see the patterns these things go down and when they go down it's not necessarily to the exact numbers that remember who talked about the pope stepping down when Ratzinger step down\nAnd we said oh you know he would probably lead retired die within three months he left the ear you love the papacy and one of my friends has really blown away by this but it was because we could see you know the talk we heard that we heard the Marines and rumors coming up from Rome\nAnd there are several other times it instances where we have a pretty much reported ... be prepared for this and it's happened we're not always right before damn close believe it or not or damn close and so we're obviously seeing the beginnings of what would be the final blow\nIf this gets out of hand but they'd be prepared because if it weren't goes down tomorrow about capping off some people aren't pleased we can see some more civil unrest in some of the major cities across the country [noise] and we have to prepare for that not that it

[laughter] but uh no I have a couple of different thoughts um\nI Do I like how you a ... you always see these patterns and it is interesting we're right before that that called the more that that takes tomorrow um the the thing I keep thinking is is a couple of things is\nYou know is it possible that\nI think it's a anything's possible but is it possible that this could also be a distraction or I use that word by word but\nCould it be that actually the right side the right wing so to speak or be putting this on as a distraction or whatever I'm too you know get some sympathy or whatever\nAnd then the other thing would be is um it's kind of interesting that they're targeting a course Donald Trump you know he's the head of the right and then you have Ted Cruz which if you cruise Facebook you know everybody seems to have Ted Cruz even though he's not really in the U.S while it anymore\nAnd the other interesting thing is is that\nTed Cruz at one point wasn't he kind of a a guy that would have been considered to be a good a Supreme Court nominee so\nWell I don't know forgetting to bench a secretary of defense James Mattis was targeting also chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson was it was also targeted\n[noise] sure yeah I don't I don't know where their political affiliations wide but\nBut see that's the thing is that if it was I mean obviously this is politically motivated\nOr we don't know do that for what reason it was politically motivated I Would say it was to thwart the investigation and the vote the confirmation vote\nI think that would give them a reason to we're going to stop this right now and we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI's already made the decision\nAnd and I know they've already made the decision because um you know uh actually we were to ground zero Adams discussing missing somebody said to me they said well they're going to wrap this

cover up bad to have a back but uh I Would say that you know they're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many
