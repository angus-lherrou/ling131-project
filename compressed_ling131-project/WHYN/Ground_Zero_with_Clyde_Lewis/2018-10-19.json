experiments\nAnd nice experience France didn't find\nAny you know came out in the sense that\n\n[noise]\n\nI'm\nQuite Louis [noise] you are listening to ground zero [noise] we are now seeing the arrival of something called me and PC [noise] although it would be these have been around for a long time what they are really is their computer control characters in video games and the problem\nWith it that they have these limited scripted responses like the show up and they go here try this or here here's lying three or would you like to go here that's what it is it basically gives you an idea where you need to go now although I I don't know if there are any and PCs in Fort Night because I've been watching we in place for it I don't really know of any\nReally 'cause it's not like the squads no fighting everything else but I mean like in skyrim or fall out there are\nCharacters that are known as in the seats they basically babble scripted responses they're limited they don't really do anything they just give the parameters the game\nSo that's why they call\nWhy they're using this and PC me which is basically this nondescript looking character to describe those who repeat the script\nOr the left and what we're talking about is is like for example you know orange guy oh it's orange guy you know calling President Trump orange guy that's an NBC term or um what's another one a dog President Trump doesn't like immigrants well why is his wife and immigrant you know NBC\nOr it's just a bunch of things where you you've heard them right like you know KKK everybody who's outright as KKK everybody who's the conservatives KKK or they're they're racist that's an MP the\n\nMeaning these people have a limited they have a limited fountain to draw from an hour's drive from the same things and they always say the same things to people who are trying to express themselves and and and even if you sound just a little bit on the right\nThe un PC left will come in and they'll say well they'll do that and so that's why they're called NBC's may have caused a lot of anger\nBecause those who see them feel that they're ... the humanizing well this is a humanizing us that's the point [laughter] I mean yeah if you don't like them and create your own\nUh yeah it is there to humanize him basically saying you're robots your robots they're following a program and you're listening to the programming\nAnd it goes on the other side too I have heard so many programmed response is whenever you say anything that even in this little bit of criticism to Donald Trump people go how Jared you he's a man of God and you're like what\nHe's up president of the United states he's\nNot a man of God he's not the messiah he's not going to turn water into wine\nAlthough he can't turn wine into something else many cancer\n[laughter]\nI'm just saying you can't do that\nFor some reason in this country so there's NBC name mocks so left basically making them out to be an expression listed the parents bought like in behavior\n\nI mean that's sort of a causal observers right they just stand there occasionally say oh this is the door\nMake a left here it's like it's like being one of those talking maps make a left three hundred feet ... that's kind of a an NBC just kind of giving you directions that does it has a limited script and says the same thing over and over again and so if you go to Facebook or if you go to you know Twitter or read it or ...\n... are being program they just say well I mean part of the game right\nSo we struggle with primary consciousness uh we used to be that we would just take for granted that we have primary conscious now there are people out there\nThey're becoming apathetic they're ... they're becoming critique there are people out there just don't care at all anymore and you know it's really scary is is that if people are being bred not care if they're creating this a nurse ship there if they're\nCreating his um any entropy they're creating all this what this does this creates monsters\n\nBecause if you wanted to find a monster you can save the starling beef like you\nKnow in the bushes or it's a startling be sweating the rating the pounds to predator yeah that's that's one definition of a monster but there is a definition of monsters I think fits\nAnd it's something I think when you take into account and that is the definition of a monster is a person who just doesn't care anymore\n\nAnd that's what we're struggling with right we're struggling with the idea of ... if we even care\n\nAnd I think it's unfortunate that we're seeing more people respond to the electronic illusion\nAnd they are becoming a non player characters or NBC's as a matter of habit and in some cases people do this because they wanted to survive they don't want to get involved and so this is where we are now we're in a position where we don't know whether to go left or right\nSo some people don't go anywhere at all and see I've always said this I say I I always say if you want to really get Americans to do nothing at\nAll you have to do is obfuscate all you have to do was confuse them and ... and they won't make a decision and say well if I'm confused I don't want to do this because I'm damned if I Do\nAnd damned if I don't\nThink that's why you see less people vote\nI think when they're all saying get out and vote get out and vote red white and blue eyes whatever way they're talking about they're getting they're encouraging people to go out and do something even when they're confused\n\nAnd it's hard to sell people when they're confused [noise] and so if you're confused what do you do well out of necessity in\nWithout looking stupid you decide to read the script you decided to follow the script it's put before you

Kanye West is that as an n word that can read or this is what happens with an n word can read [noise] and I'm thinking are you ... well yeah I mean this is business out there is a yeah is that the responses our cities in the field and I think explained it a lot that\nOf a reality breakdown but I'm watching it right now a lot of us just seeing it right now I mean I see that my out here in Portland because we have all the stuff going on and what is what's happening in Portland well you know what's gonna happen where you live too because I mean you have to consider that the narrative or is responsible for this\nReality redo we're going through a retro causality creating conspiracy theories that really are more than theories but attempts to somehow put reality into perspective without letting anyone know but secretly tucked away and all of our utility drawers he's a tin foil hat that will probably where it because we know that no one truly lives of the universe is fully object\n\nWe're hearing about how there are different dimensions we're hearing about there are different ways of thinking we're hearing that you know we're hearing in the quantum immortality I mean science is basically going all\nParanormal\nI didn't want to quantify all the paranormal in a scientific way scientific way like ah they want to be halfway with their religion they want to be half way with the conscious that they want to do ... and this is where I was smoking aboard about how\nHere we are in a ship this ... this is a a major paradigm shift and we have a gym pro blind spot in some regard because events happened or we perceive they do and then later we're schooled on the idea that everything we perceived\nAs wrong\nIs that what we think we know is not exactly what is that somehow we reach a point\nWhere we're satisfied with their opinion and and all that it's based on his bowl nebulous stimuli we all agree that this and it's like this is my opinion and this is my truth and you say well it's not truth it's just what you think it is the it's all about your selective perception\nAnd we know the selective perception is necessary because we didn't have selective perception we'll be transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory overload we're now getting today our brains are being filled with all sorts of sensory overload thing about it we have simple perceptions of light lifelike love survival spirituality God you know\nAnd then we're exposed to media print television Internet videogames\nCell phones many other things that you know there are pushing the brain further and further\nAnd all that stimulus his place in a limited area known right there in Atlanta compartmentalize area called the brain we don't know if the brain is limitless and we have we learned that in old age would boost memory and we lose perception of time I mean the brain can be objective if it chooses to however it's\nEmotion that is driving these guys and so there's this war going on between the brain\nAnd subjective experience and this is what they call the explanatory gap where we've had to bridge the brain conscious is experiencing motion critical announces we're struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experiences worth feeling at all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\n\nAnd of course now we experienced a virtual meeting hyper reality from electronic allusion\nIt's unfortunate that we're seeing more and more people\nResponding to the electronic illusion they're becoming a non player they're becoming a person who just sits there and watch it watch things or you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script that it is to follow the follow their own hearts follow their own mind\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting fatigue right now\nOver what George Orwell called double speak double speak actually disguises the nature of the truth\nGiving new meaning to words with what appeared to be scripted dialogue and provided by the party and it's never ending propaganda that keeps pushing and pushing and pushing see many people that have not had the the time nor the I guess desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four\nAh by George Orwell usually you know they say things that were big brother's watching you ride ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they know a few lines right\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones are groomed to follow the which is the ministry of love\nThe George Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to

and they seem to be a form of kind of propaganda against the liberal left\nNow\nNBC is I mean there are there are and the season games gamers do it and the seas are okay or actual NBC's or computer controlled characters and video games with limited scripted responses I'm given the parameters of the games which they appear for example NBC's bad sign missions to a player like in skyrim\nOr they joined the players a companion like in fall out\nThey create is NBC mean and what it is is that it's basically there to um to attack or a mock what it's called left wing propaganda and I think\nIs cleverly I I think it's being used cleverly to exploit what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like fascism\n\nWhere it's like not being overused outright connections to the KKK
