that it represented sexual perversion uh the killing of babies and sacrifice now we're getting into the numbers game we're getting into numbers and we're getting into a what is coming maybe a a footing a war in the future\nAnd these numbers are all adding up give us an idea of what the black cube is and what it represents and how it is sort of a a a voice box or recorder for what is going to happen\nFirst off on the subject of ball or bell ball or bell in relation to sexuality is interesting because ball or bell is a fertility got ... of the black cube if we look at\nReligion and we look at history we fly if we find the black you all over the world we find the Jews used the black cube called the capital and a little kid where they have a piece of paper inside of it with a prayer on it we have the holy of holy and Solomon's Temple the perfect cube we have the ...\nIs a black you located centrally within all ... all around the sacred site of Muslims at mecca and then we have the cube in a modern day Azerbaijan which is a fire cult I'm an area where there was a fire called a and historical days and that Cuba's representation of those fire deities\nSo you see this throughout a religion you see this throughout history but when you start to break the cube down it takes you into more magical and more a cult studies and one of those studies is the study of what is called the magic square\nSo you have each of the seven classical planet that has its own magical square which is derived from the number of that planetary intelligence and it said that each of these intelligence is has a form of consciousness that is free from the body free from flash it seem more it'll end of the ... and all things\nThat are that are of God if you will and and so this legal son is typically broken down for example into the spiritual Sunday intellectual sun and the material sun and in the ... ... you have a mix of Muslim and Jewish believes there\nThe intelligence of the sun is called ... which is a name and the metro area equivalent to one one one the spiritual son is known as so Ross and that's new at that numerical value is six six six and both of those numbers\nBoth of those spiritual essence is are derived from the magic square of the sun which is a square with six columns and six rows each line all of the numbers in every direction add up to one one one and every grow every line one one one time the six\nColumns in rows equals six six six so that is a number of the sun than they are of course there's the magic square of Saturn which has a square with three columns and three rows each line adds to the number Fifteen\nAnd numerically the number Fifteen if you look at that numerically and apply it to numerology when you count to ten and just start over again one two three four five six seven eight nine\nTen is one again and so on and so forth a number Fifteen become sick so Fifteen Fifteen Fifteen for each of those three lines equals six six six and that's where we get the\nMagic square of Saturn ... six six six Saturn is the father I heard you and Alex Jones earlier today and you mentioned Jupiter and it's interesting because Jupiter is Jew Peter and

magician at the beginning of the deck and the devil tarot card a representation of man's binding to the material world\nWhat was interesting is that I was very ah fixated on something of Fort Night or in one of the seasons Liam place for it and I\nI was noticing that there was a a black cube that showed up from out of nowhere that was in a uh the area there that ah Lee and was trying to figure out how to conquer it and ah I don't know exactly what happened but apparently the Cuban transformed itself into a floating land mass over the area and I was fascinated by this because the cube itself\nHad what looked like a Jewish riding on it\nIt had a number of things that looked like gold or Hebrew writings and I I was curious as to why that would show up in a game it had to it at a very a cult or I guess overtone in symbolism to it that I was very ah mesmerized by it I figured this image is not going to go away his image\nIs going to be appearing in a lot of ways\nAnd not only that but it's also the perfect component for the holy moly permit component [noise] for a where they put a when they treat for an altar if you will an altered to uh open to uh the elements that open up to

became man for the one throws rebelled against a God ... well actually with the same kind of fallen angels\nAnd what the numbers and the secret is these ... near extra fascinating because what you have is well this quickly the will go to Ryan a hundred and forty four thousand divided by two sixteen get your sixth extinction for item\nTwo thirds or two divided by three six six six six ... six times except fixes to sixteen you divide one hundred forty four thousand by six six six you get to sixteen to sixteen to sixteen adding food item so the numbers when you put 'em all to give it creates the big black Cuba\nOr the oracle of God's some say it's the either the benevolent God some say it is the eye of Saturn Ryan gave all with us on ground zero\nYou know there's a lot of uh indications that he sat in return or or some things about the fall of this country we're looking at ah the changing of the guard and the beginning of what is called the war footing ... what do you see in the

scientists have or\nHave had a look at these images many researchers had a look at these images and found the famous hexagon storm on the north pole of the planet Saturn that was photographed by

the ... the minds of the men are given hope and working for a positive future we can we can make major change in the ... and what's happening right now in the world and it's not like we're\nNot we're just one person or whatever we can work together on this and we can make big changes of the skull\nAh you know when you some people see it they say they don't think of it as something positive because they have these thoughts and their mind about uh schools but when you see that especially in the Mitchell head just go\nAnd you see the workman ship and the love that went into it and the uh just there's a special energy that you you can you can feel the energy and it's a it's a really really neat so that's what we do\nYeah and every time I mean this is an amazing ... this is the one that ah I've always admired for its workman ship and how beautiful it is and the power it's certainly possesses incense through and the power in the room we have tonight and what we're feeling it's certainly a is inspiring a and\nAnd I guess for people who know nothing about the schools why is this crystal skull so important and why is president so important in the room tonight\nWell it's a considered one of the ancient skulls and like you say the skull stores knowledge for everything it's seen been around for all the years and so\nUh it's believed to be a receptor cola mind and it is for ... mind has

... and\nYou may understand that I couldn't let go anymore\nThat is how I started to search to wait and then it interesting in that time is up many assaults calls rounds so on the Internet ... which

the that I co organized and that is what I saw this call but in the meantime I've been studying calls I'm trying to understand and it was interesting what you were saying about the ... the black box a cube is that's the right name of that\nLike ... like you know at a\nBecause the key words I think as soon as you start working with is crystal skull is\nConsciousness yeah and you were mentioning and that's absolutely true you also work with material that calls for a mother earth so it links and to the earth but it also links into the fact that the ancient people\nOr putting information in a system as well the best systems or you\nAre without their knowledge or you can put information and that is quite right or they use these ancient courts as a storage of information that'd be now try to access you know and a lot of the interesting things and that is is\nWe have not being very successful\nYes there are channels and that it isn't that are that is far more information and officials call [noise] so people are searching for how can you access even this information they got them in jail and yet still contains Charlotte's inflation I remember a story of\nA I don't think the other which which a company was working with pieces of course they were putting inflation into\nThis tiny piece of artificial girl and crystal and they say that the size of a sugar lung chicken put almost whole library\nWell and you imagine you know looking at the Mitchell heads as personal it's called how much information that can be an ... no brain and the human brain that can really get all that information\nSo I think the reason why there are so many crystals called out in the wall nuns asked to give people the opportunity to train\nBut you still need to solve it with a brain in order to be
