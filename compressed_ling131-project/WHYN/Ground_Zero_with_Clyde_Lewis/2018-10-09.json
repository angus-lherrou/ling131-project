Lori next up here ... book I Love love love the godfather but I miss your voice when you're not around for a few days well thank you Laura miss you guys to\nMy concern around this whole SCOTUS thing is my middle of the road think they're informed but go with the lunatic flow just read the headline and believe it with vigor friends\nIt drives me insane it's a much deeper conversation wherever willing to have I find myself after leading a few hard truths throwing in the towel exasperated and not even sure where to start again not because I don't want to fight the good fight but because it feels like we're having two different conversations\nI won't so badly to find a way to ... make my case just to get them to explore the truth outside of the talking points\nBut I Can't even get there\nThere's so much education or information lacking on their part how do you do this five mornings a week on your show I commend you for that just venting frustration I Know you understand thanks for all you do Laurie\nLaurie I don't know how to do it to be honest with you know I'm I'm a I'm an incredibly patient and a\nPsychologically durable fellow I don't know it's not an easy thing you get up super in the morning and talked to any lips are never mind my pal crystal who's as I've said many times delightful person we just disagree on politics are so yeah that's it's not an easy thing to do we're trying to do it and I wonder how much of a\nCompletely honest I Wonder how much of a market there is for it to both sides of the stories what we call it you know here's\nHere's the issue here's what the last thing she was with the right things but not an eight one side loses fashion\nBecause that's the way they do it on cable news right now we're trying to not do that here's the best case ... years the best case from the right no one's supposed to show up and go where I don't remember anything just pounding on TV in front of voter and like a moron we don't do that\nWe don't do that when you're not shame conservatives we do not own lives on rising we own lives here in the freedom out though we own them all the time\nA shooting pool rides the Democrats centers are complaining the justice Kavanaugh's biased against the Democrats from his comments when to defend themselves should disqualify him why is nobody in the right asking\nThe left how RPG can continue on SCOTUS well small cars there hypocrites and they have no principles and they lie so I Do have a good answer for you there because that is the answer\nBrand in a row quite a lawyer shows I I listen to your knowledge it's past few weeks about Cavanaugh I could tell angry were because the tone of your voice a and a few swear words whoa\nUm\nI didn't swear I mean maybe I said damn or something but is that really is where where you know it's interesting to hear you know there's always we always have very clean language on this show but what is considered a swear I got in trouble for saying crap with somebody in this audience which I which is a word that you can use that not considered a square anywhere that I'm aware of\nAnd there was oh I also said gosh darn and I got in trouble because somebody said well you might as well say the other G D and I said well no that's if I if I start my\nTone I yell out of college at the top of my lungs that's not a curse right that's that that's the not curse\nThing uh\nBut it is what it is um [noise]\nAnyway you rent a road uh I watch the vote in the sense that I Am so proud judge Kavanaugh didn't give up so but it and give up hope you're west coast trip went well thank you Brandon and I'm Glad he did not give up as well uh\nNate in my opinion the Democrats jumped the shark with ... and sweat next accusations it was so over the top and destroy the argument that victims never lie\nTo independently minded observers do you think the Democrats wanted ... to come forward you suspect as I Do that one sweat next accusations occurred they knew it was actually damaging to their credibility\nI I think that's why it was a disaster for the Democrats because she was a it was ... it was it was obviously incredibly disruptive and dust and disgusting but it was completely non believable and I know that you guys all say that you listen to the show so you don't need me to tell you when I'm right 'cause you know what I'm right\nBut I did not waiver for a signal that not one moment on Kavanaugh's\nInnocence and that he should get through in this process not one moment just want to take a little bit of a you know take a moment for myself with that

and I tell the story as to why and how we came to this and\nThe general support was already been pouring in for Janine\nHe's amazing and I'm so thankful and grateful and Janine even since her love and thanks for all of the prayers and all the support\nAnd ah we do have a goal but we're going to try and see if we can surpass that goal because that would give us more incentive to at least get some more things in check that she can use to get better quickly\nUm and and what we're doing is we're we're ... we're literally having to plan\n... kind of been a two month way or how to get around all

this go just go to my go find me page I put out for Janine help us out please I really appreciate that very much\nAnd I show is a is going to be a mind bender for everybody and the reason why it's so fun subject for me or you know one of the weirder\nAspects of quantum mechanics could be explained by an equally weird idea but I've always talked about that's retro causality we're talking about causation\nRuns backwards in time but then it can also run forwards and time\nEinstein came up with the idea of spooky action at a distance quantum mechanics he said that's how you can be a radical explain or bring about evidence to show that retro causality exists which is the particle equivalent of you getting a stomach ache today Thanks to tomorrow's bad lunch\nAt the idea that you got a stomach ache but there was nothing that you ate the gave me the stomach ache but something that you're about to eat is going to give you the stomach I does that make any sense\nI don't like explaining it that way that's kind of a waste science would explain I like explaining it as for example\nYou're in a bar or somewhere like ah like let's say that a guy sitting in a bar and a woman comes up to him and says I Want to marry you and they want to marry you on this date so you set a date\nWhen the marriage is going to happen right set a date for that\nAnd uh and she says but there's one thing you need to do you need to cut your hair you\nShave your beard and you'd get yourself a suit and tie and I want to house okay\nSo you're thinking okay I'm going to marry this woman and this is what I got to do and you don't even know if it's going to happen\nYou just do there is a date set ahead and that that future date is going to be affecting the president and the past okay so they passed after you you know after president goes away and continue using continues so vinyl you do go to the day and you find out that all this stuff you prep for was retro causal\nOkay so you're you're preparing for something that may not happen but it's happening it's it's because the futures influencing president passed in in that way\nWhich is you know a simple way of explaining it probably not\nIt's probably too simplistic maybe but that's that's the way I see it as the way it works this is causality you know there's cause and effect but what does it affect happens before the cars\nAnd that's something that's hard for science to grass although there is a pair of physicist right now from you from a from the United states and Canada that actually took a closer look at some basic assumptions in quantum theory undecided unless we discovered time necessarily rent one way measurements made to a particle could echo back in time as well as forward\nSo we have kind of a a shadow or an echo in transit pretty much we all know quantum mechanics is is where you're right we we know that part of that we're just comes down to the fact that at a fundamental level\nParticles don't act like solid billiard balls rolling down the table but rather like a blurry cloud of possibility shifting around the room\nNow Stephen Hawking that told me all about this when I met him\nLong time ago when we were discussing Heisenberg uncertainty principles and Adams and all kinds of other you know who are particles moving about and we're talking about the blurry cloudy and ... and and the ... cloud comes into sharp focus will be tried to measure particles meaning that we can\nOnly ever see a white ball hitting a black one into a corner pocket but we can never see the countless white ball sitting by balls in every pocket okay we can have we can face forward okay and we see everything in front of us right at our feet\nBut behind as there are so many possibilities going on behind this but we don't even if we take a look back\nWe see what's going on but with our back turned there are so many things are happening that we don't understand\nWhere we can't understand it all at once otherwise our brains would explode\nSo this is all about and maybe this might happen this could happen right so when we're dealing with maybe than what is\nI mean these are these are all part of a of causal progression it's all part of the trends that the ... the transient move whether it's an echo or whether it's cause and effect whether it's a fact before cause whether or not you're going and loops so\nHave you can prevent me just a minute\n[laughter] misrepresent these maybe these clouds ... represents something very real\nPossibilities on a positive level can be very real see that's why I don't like the idea that you know we're all feeling like we're doomed to some fate\nWhere everything falls apart and collapses I mean some some reasonable in that mindset when there's always hope for something to go better\nWe should always try and focus on that hope that things are going to go better you know what I'm saying so if if if it does represent something real of all the particles are like bouncing around and we don't see the possibility is behind this but we only see what it wants in front of a sometimes with getting you see behind beyond our own feet so this is just a convenient\nRepresentation of what can happen [noise]\nTime goes by time goes back and forth [noise]\nAh [noise] it's beginning we are beginning to see that it's kind of like [noise] having a a [noise] kind of like a [noise] a knob where you can push you hadn't time go back in time that sort of thing [noise] and it's becoming more evident that the future [noise]\nIs changing the pan\nAnd

thirty seven hundred [noise]\nTerrible eighty seven three seven hundred\nRetro causality has always been one of my topic [noise] favorite\nOf mine because it it it's always kind of weird to think that yes maybe something in the future could influence the past or vice versa and I and I started thinking about that back during the nine eleven days seriously um it was because of the fact when nine eleven happened I just felt like time stopped\nAnd I felt like a ... there were some things that happened during that that that era that reminded me of things in the past the quite possibly were affected by that very moment in time and I and I don't know why my brain went that way\nBut it just happened to go that way for some reason I mean when you're in the realm of fringe analytics I like saying that it's been a conspiracy theory we should start using that right\nWere fringe analysts [laughter] like that idea rather than saying you're conspiracy theorist you're fringe analyst and that means you analyze everything that's fringe including paranormal unfair political\nBut ah in the realm of fringe analytics and and being a fringe a\nAnalysts there's a whole lot of maybe ... and coincidences that should never be ignored even when they sound outrageous\nAnd so when I played that audio just now\nThe broadcast the man on the tape or the man on the radio back in Nineteen forty five he could have made a lucky guess right\nBut I'm a sucker for time travel and prophecy especially when it has that paranormal vibe to it and how it lead you down the roads that take you to what it's called the further beyond the modern conspiracy theory there is a notion of predicted programming\nAnd we talk about this all the time as it seems to be a pervasive way to approximate or otherwise for structure of the future in some way\nIt is propose that through what is called revolution of the methods\nThat were warned or were being prepared to accept certain ideas means or ideology\nWe see it in film and TV shows and many things eventually come to pass but we see like for example I don't know about you but if you if you go on the Internet a lot you see The Simpsons predicted a lot of things even even the nine eleven attack people predicted the election of Donald Trump which I think it's fascinating\nSo\nWhen we see these things happen we wonder about retro causality we wonder how these people who are in the arts can somehow predict the future or at least give us something to think about in future tense like science fiction I remember I was at a uh a convention one time and\nAt the convention and we I was on a panel discussing just what science fiction writers got it right there was this one science fiction writer that I was sitting there so I didn't know who he was he was a local\nScience fiction writer he's eyes science fiction is never gotten it right and I says I beg to differ man I says you write it you're right science I read it okay I I read the comics I read the books I see the movies and there are a lot of things\nThat people like Harlan Ellison who just passed away got ... for people like Ray Bradbury or Isaac Asimov got right Philip K Dick amazing right he he got allows surprise um and and so when you're when you're thinking about this revelation to the method it's a it's a very deep\nFascinating conduit to time travel and to the fantastical concepts and most people considered the stuff of science fiction and while the idea that someone can Journey Through time and change the course of history\nHideous terrifyingly tantalize I mean it's simply just not thought to be possible\nI Need you for for the moment right I Need you to think of the words plus ultra\nThat you need to remember the term plus ultra because um they will be the two words\nBill connected dots in this journey phenomena allergy\nSo phenomena allergy there's another one but I'm analogy a fringe analytics that sort of thing that's what we're going to try and and do for each other kind of a kind of a mind magic thing that I think you're really going to enjoy\nSo I'm so think about plus ultra think about the fictional secret society okay think about the fictional secret society and the movie to Marilyn thing of all the I guess you could call them be I'm thinking of all of\nThe connections between people like Mark Twain\nNikola Tesla Thomas Edison H. G. wells\nAll of these people think of all their connections and how they did have connections because I mean Tesla did work for Addison at one time he was friends with a Mark Twain Samuel Clemens a Ray Bradbury was a visionary a disco down the list H. G. wells was visionary all of these visionaries had some idea\nEven Bradbury or have you read the Martian chronicles or you read the illustrated man you'll see that they all have this vision of the future as them up had a vision of the future of Philip K Dick had a vision of the future all these guys part of plus ultra they weren't\nAware of aiding other dimension where they could go to actually um you know get away from it all okay that's the fictional part but the reality is that yes there was a secret\nSociety or a secret group within Disneyland called the clubs thirty three it was a barrel VIPs door are allowed in there and other people not allowed in there\nSo and you know that does the was part of the demos ... society a thirty third degree Scottish right free masonry duty was bat and so put all that together and you get plus ultra plus ultra means\nFurther beyond so what we're going to do is want to go further beyond plus ultra [noise]\nAnd you're really going to find out some things are going to blow your mind about what's happening now what could have been shaped in the past or what is being shaped now in the future or what is happening right now [noise] okay [noise] so where do you go on a little journey now mental journey use a little fringe analytics and ... and a\nDomino H.

important [noise] I mean it it said it was Nineteen forty five and fight I mean you can question the validity of it but it's like this guy really\nI mean when you think about it he said it but not all

replay you comes from Nineteen forty five and\nI played it in some guy called left already says oh it's a hoax and I'm thinking well okay if it's a hoax and who benefits from it that's what I Want to know who benefits from a hoax at this is a hoax\nIt just sounds like a typical guy on a radio making super addiction is all it is and so I don't know why this guy which is so hung up on the idea of the big thought it was a hoax well what I Want to do was on a plane you this broadcast the man who's been recorded off the radio could have made a lucky guess\nBut I'm a sucker for time travel and prophecy especially when it has the paranormal by to it so I'm gonna play this for you again\nAnd ah there's no fear mongering here at all even though the guys do this this is big business the intent is to scare people know this is not to scare people but it's here to make you think listen to what this guy says like I said Nineteen forty five it's a radio broadcasts where a guy attempted to\nActually predict the future what would happen in the year twenty forty five years ago\nAnd gentlemen welcome back in the program today we'll talk about a rather serious topic\n... what does your child today will make some predictions maybe someday my back on such protections yeah as you know is Nineteen forty five hundred years from now and\nProbably twenty forty five it is difficult to imagine the state of the world and what not and and yes we have seen before the oil has changed\nDrastically and the boss is just one hundred years ago in the year Eighteen ... pine\nCone of self our frying machine seemed as ridiculous than I Am an avid to many that's great and dust colonel revolution going around seeing all changed in the fall came to mind\nAs we go over our predictions for the next one hundred years and one hundred years I put it that man will have stepped foot on all the celestial bodies such as I'm On the planet Mars\nAnd one hundred years I put it that the average man will get his news and entertainment from a variety of sources big companies will no longer have a monopoly on the news and entertainment people enjoy I predict that in one hundred years\nCost alone can be constrained for the crown and we'll have the ability to fight and the average will and the energy that powers the cost will come from the sun and one is that the television sets we'll get increasingly smaller I predict the television sets\nTo the point that they can get on our ... I think that in what is that it will be filmed cameras at every street corner they won't be put in place in the name of a safety\nBut our freedoms increasingly vanish wheeler trade our freedom a safety we allow our rights around here because they offer hands tell us and we'll keep our children are safe now remember these protections north say maybe some of the future man we're back on them ... day\nWell future man looking back on them and they are pretty interesting productions if their predictions that come from Nineteen forty five\nAnd a some of them are accurate some are little ... by just a tad I think\nBut when you're dealing with something called revolution of the method we have science fiction people all the time making predictions and having them come true I mean we're warned through this type of predicted programming about how we should be prepared to accept certain ideas\nCertain ... certain ideologies\nWe see in film and TV shows many things that have been so they come to pass and would they do we wonder about the theory of retro causality unreal time travel is these physicists have been talking about retro causality and whether or not there are things that\nShape the past future shaping the path\nTime travel is a fantastical concept but most would consider the stuff of science fiction and yet we hear more and more that the idea of dream through time he's he's he's quite possible actually ah but to change the course of history\nYeah I don't know I mean we're we're told that there are different timelines that if you go back in time uh and you kill baby Hitler that won't matter\nBecause they'll be another time my little form after that that kind of thing I don't know but um it is possible we're hearing more and more about time travel is becoming more and more possible plausible but um\nThere are those who before us have had insight to see the future or they say they've come from the future to let us do\nYou know through science fiction but time travel is possible and his happen from time to time and time after time or or time for an item and and that's\nIt and yet as you may know like I said I Am in the last hour I I just stumbled upon a film that I saw before called tomorrow and there was a Disney film with George Clooney in it\nWhat I found most interesting is in the film or they discuss a secret society called plus ultra\nNow according to the fictional history of the film I did some studying on this uh the story goes that good stuff Eiffel\nMet Jules Verne and Thomas Edison and his power apartment just started a secret society of optimist plus ultra was founded it'd be Eighteen eighty nine world's fair in Paris, France\nThe organizations purpose is to create moderate and expand upon new scientific advancements for humanity\nNow key members of this group included people like H. G. wells Ray Bradbury Amelia Earhart Mark Twain Nikola Tesla and other scientific figures Walt Disney eventually became a member as well so it started\nIn Eighteen eighty nine and there were people who became members of this plus ultra group and what plus ultra was was a group that created a breakaway civilization in another dimension okay so\nI Know science fiction right but is there any truth to it that's the question well\nAs we do as we dig deeper into this story okay\nIt says now this is according to the movie fiction this is this is the story tomorrow land in Nineteen fifty nine had an expansion at Disneyland it was actually about and this is what they said in the film that tomorrow land was actually a training facility\nFor future societies future members of societies they were training them for a journey to an alternate universe\nAnd at this alternate universe was found and later developed by plus ultra\nNow the blueprints for the expansion he'll keep technologies that enabled the journey including something called a super transport key VIPs were encouraged to join plus ultra were given special VIP audio tour tours the world's fair\nOr the attraction there there was Ford's magic skyway there was the it's a small world world ride and for those who couldn't attend the fair there was a there was a record player or record that they could play to get information about the details now what does the had the it's a small world attraction at the Pepsi Cola pavilion in the Nineteen sixty four New York world's fair\nThat believed to contain of portraits tomorrow in\nIn reality does he does have a secret place\nAnd it's near the pirates of the Caribbean it's below the pirates of the Caribbean ride it's called club thirty three it's a private club\nA club thirty three is not acceptable to the public and it's for exclusive use of its members and is the only location at Disneyland that serves alcohol\nAt an editor club thirty three I guess has to press a buzz buzz around an intercom it's concealed by hidden paneling a doorway and Walt Disney was a young boy he was a member of the demo they society and they sign a quarter and so a lot of people believe that the thirty three is related to the thirty third degree a Scottish right free masonry so\nA fictional secret society that is a dimensional secret breakaway civilization called plus ultra\nI started wondering is there something like plus ultra but I can present for you tonight that would be sort of a revealing that there may be some dimensional breakaway civilization or there may be some ties to time travel\nOf men they wanted to establish a future world order they believed that they wouldn't see the future world order in their lifetimes it gradually be many people out there secret order they would continue to push for this socialist world order now he wrote a book published in Nineteen forty called the new world order\nAnd the book addressed the ideal of a world without war in which law and order emanating from a global is government would occur is by the leader that's how wells side of the future out prior to that book wells wrote the shape of things to come\nNow the thing about the shape of things to come is is this eerily prophetic book\nBecause it gave the world a dose of predicted programming probably one of the first books to do so and it was a story dealing with new technologies innovations a World War predicted to start in Nineteen forty\nAnd the world brought into a new order by criminal dictator who fortified the war machine so the part of this book\nActually approximate it'd be rivals the Nazis in World War two\nNow he wrote several books and several of his books he wrote that the mission of a shadow government\nIs to create a new world order that would replace world religion in world government he stated that at all will be replaced by collective isn't\nAny state of the collective it some would eventually kill religion by replacing it as the new religion philosophy will certainly was a visionary whether or not he was a time travelers a compelling argument whether or not you know a ... his ideas are going to happen or just like that radio broadcast that we played\nSo when you talk about H. G. wells K. and all the things he wrote the I'm going back tomorrow several things that he he was he was responsible\nFor the idea of a DNA changing the idea of a aliens invading like in war of the world's he's written all of these\nFantastic science fiction story one of the things about wells is\nThat he had a counterpart in the United states gang that counterpart was done other than Nikola Tesla now\nThis is where it gets even more interesting because well of course predicted a lot of things in his books and that was the Eighteen hundreds or will predicted a lot of things in his book Nineteen eighty four also animal farm was also an allegory for government change and strange this\nSo we got these visionaries they were in you know the earlier\nThat we're giving us information the earlier twentieth century and also towards the end of the nineteenth century\nSo yeah people even ... Charles for would be in that category got Charles for you got each two wells you've got a you've got a you know George Orwell just go down the list of all of these visionaries they've seen the future or that they they had a vision of the future that we're all living in today\nSo somehow the future that they saw with the future that was happening right now [noise]\nAnd it was influencing these men in the past\nDoes that make sense that's retro causality right so we moved from H. G. wells K.\nTo Nikola Tesla and what he did and we're going to talk about Nikola Tesla coming up is going to get even more the print interesting as we go ... six seven three thirty seven hundred us AAA\nSix seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\nTime capsule reveals use traffic and weather stations use radio feisty W.

G. wells Nikola Tesla Thomas Edison they all had connections in some way throughout history but Nikola Tesla he was considered one of the most innovative and mysterious band whoever lip\nAnd test those inventions went far beyond electricity he may groundbreaking discoveries such as wireless radio communications turbine engines and helicopters although da Vinci came up with the idea at first I'm\nJust thought it was also the inventor of fluorescent and beyond lights torpedoes and the X ray among other innovations but by the time of his death Tesla nearly well he had nearly seven hundred worldwide ... a few days after Tesla died on January a Nineteen forty three\nHis possessions were seized by officials from the amazingly name government office of alien property\nAbout three weeks after that all of Tesla's things an documents were given a thorough examination by a group of FBI agents that included none other than John Gee Trump\nJohn gene Trump was the uncle of president Donald J Trump\nTrump's on coal was by all accounts a very accomplished an intelligent man an MIT professor of engineering he helped design X ray machines for cancer patients and did radar research work for the army during World War two\nJon Jeter Trump's analysis of tests those papers concluded that quote Tesla's thoughts an effort staring at least the past Fifteen Years we're primarily a speculative philosophical and somewhat promotional character but quote did not\nInclude new sound working with principals or methods for realizing such result\nA lotta people that are fans of Nikola Tesla would disagree with what John Gee Trump said about Tesla\nDonald Trump on the other hand once referred to as uncle John ah as\nHis intelligence he said uh\nThat his intelligence sort of a voucher for his own genetic and historical pedigree saying well you know I'm a brilliant mind just like my uncle John was brilliant mind in fact Trump said in one interview according to New York or New Yorker magazine you said my uncle used to tell me about nuclear before nuclear was even nuclear\nThat's what Donald Trump says now this would likely be referring to hydrogen bombs rather than the first nuclear bombs because Trump was born in Nineteen forty six after the atomic age is already upon is right that would be timeline friendly right they're\nAnd how history seems to be repeating itself war it's kind of repeating itself and rhyming in such a way that it's confusing the masses plus ultra this is something that he goes beyond anything that I can even come up with but it's true if you look at the mar a Lago tiles I've got pictures of\nThe mar a Lago tiles it says plus all true but it's written in the ... way it's P.

a movie\nCalled tomorrow in but you look at John gene Trump the uncle of Donald Trump and how much he praises him for his intellect and how he had all the papers of Nikola Tesla and the possibility of a time machine\nNot only that but you see that plus ultra are on the tiles all over mar a Lago where President Trump is called the king\nAbout that for a moment\nSo what Donald Trump be fully aware of the fact that there were books written about a young\nMan named a barren Trump who was advised by a man named John\nThese are some very interesting synchronous season coincidences that made me wonder about plus ultra and whatnot plus ultra is a real group it's going to Robert in Ohio Hi Robert you're on ground zero\nAnd ... are you doing you love your show with what you're talking about it for another as usual mind thinking situation that\nYou always open the candle can and let the mind begin to think that great I Love that you knew that thank you so much and let me get started by saying that a person who makes predictions and things like that\nYou know generally a person should have a totally open mind on that because one never knows what's going to possibly happen in the future anyway right and there's a person has come up with the idea that the U.S away something good because you'll notice what protections a lot of times and says hey there's something good comes up or something bad happened\nActually enjoy one or the other and ah so you know as far as people predicting things and people who are in the past it protected thing\nYes that's Nineteen forty five show for instance that you're listening to\nUh put on there earlier with ah probably something that was played after World War two an angle and ... the gentleman talking\nAs it sounds like he's anguish and he's just trying to bring hope people don't make them realize someday there'll be no more face to worry about right yeah so that that's that's what that in my opinion is what that's all about as far as people making production and stuff sometimes they're good sometimes they're bad\nNow for the the secret society thing now I totally believe that also too as your\nAnd they alter plus a possibility I don't know I don't know myself or what but with the way the world is today and the way it is today and the way the politicians are in the way everything is in this country is right up there is probably secret\nBoth my mind is the you know here we have John Trump who is a Donald Trump cynical who had all of the test was work you had all these papers and of course a Trump was\nA pretty much a a a big help and grieving X ray machines much of what tests was work was about and large Catholic created a depth re a bit ah most certainly\nYou know it's speculated there but it's like well John Trump said well nothing was found that was a very important but yet John Trump\nWent along it became a bit bit bits in this [noise] and then Donald Trump of course at mar a Lago he stays at mar a Lago and this is worried kind of hangs out his resort for all the dignitaries and all over the walls is is the term plus ultra plus ultra plus ultra\nFrom beyond and it it you know just amazing the way that all comes together like that it makes you wonder about [noise] uh also the ah the story about Baron Trump\nAnd the story about the last president it's just been amazing uh kinda coincidence that all this went down in the Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nWell one thing you'll you'll you'll ... easily find out what she criticized Clyde too is the fact that usually it's the people that have the
