yeah of course uh the guy will you Peter bloody the guy that made The Exorcist book you also a had William freaking along it was applied noting that the staircase existed and so now a hop wants to a ball he's doing community relations for a local\nUniversity spearheading the effort to have the Seventy five stone steps where the where are the priest threw himself\nDown the steps and killed himself in The Exorcist kind of a creepy or when mark they want to have in George to I think it should be a landmark it's kind of an interesting in\nFact while I was in Washington DC I plum forgot\nAbout seeing the steps was in Washington DC I mean now we we'd have enough time I mean we were walking most of Washington DC is walking at the psyche part\nLike a you know you could drive to the White House you're driving washing up on your we park to watch the minute we walked all the way over to the south side of the White House\nAnd we were there\nAngela Merkel just happened to be in town and so ah we were kind of uh dealing with security at the time\nAnd so it slowed down our process than is getting around and do things and so I didn't get a chance to see those steps but um they certainly are creepy and they want to make them a landmark so certainly um you know we were on it [laughter] I mean Halloween and all we do we try and give you the best we can I mean it's time of ... it's basically the time of year\nWhere we find another excuse to party although I've got all my party in out in the twenty seven\n\nKids done costumes of course ah I was really excited when Janine sent me a picture of Liam he is a he addressed as tomato head from Fort Night he's got the mask and everything he's got a pizza suit it it's just really cool I saw his picture and ah yeah tomato head from Port night and um\nBut those of you that um have beggars that come to your door for candy that's another thing that a Halloween is all about and it's certainly a tradition that has a\nI don't know Halloween is sending mixed messages this year and what I mean by that is is I don't know if you've heard of this petition\nBut parents want to petition that Halloween be the the last Saturday of every October instead of the thirty first asked me last Saturday in October\nAnd what's interesting about that is is that I I think people that do that people are saying that you know don't know that Halloween has traditions that are well Steve better you know the data all the way back to you know the sixteen hundreds\n\nAnd Halloween the course of the day before all saints day or the ... there was one of those the day of the same day of the dead and so it's kinda like a tradition that the night before uh we pay respects to the dead the dead walked the earth and we pay attention to\nNot only the spirit world but also some of the darker Dennis ... of the spirit world we we um we make jacko letters to ward off people's spirits but ah the evil spirits\nYou know they pass over our house is if we do what we're supposed to that's what trick or treaters is supposed to be this supposed to be the evil spirits if you don't give them treats they do tricks and that's why it's called trick or treating this year I just think that there were a lot of mixed messages being sent and it it seemed to you know\nWe're living in times where where there's this devil does your hiding in every discussion dealing with politics and religion\nMiniature in particular I I had a well I really late heavy on the devil is aspects of the holiday because from a social studies perspective I think we've reached their time in history where we are definitely in the shadow what can be labeled be gotten anti Christ\nMeaning that you know even though people may not be able to identify the anti Christ or\nThe bits that will bear humans in heat right now let's just put it this way I mean I I don't mean to mince words but it just seems to me the dog that birth the anti Christ and certainly in heat right now and and people are just waiting for this to having\nA legend of the darkest one at all which is the anti Christ that came out of a desire\nTo better understand the last judgment and the science specifically those that Harold the arrival of this tyrannical figure this this anti ... we were told to be vigilant will be watching the signs were told in the Bible\nWatched the signs and they may warned of a coming of the end days watch the science they may be the warning the coming of the anti Christ the coming of the of the apostrophe\nOr many men fall to to the ills of evil and scripture and like he is a suggestion cool commentary and never fully addresses a exactly who\nWho is figure is who who would proceed the coming of Jesus I mean it's really an anomaly and everyone who has a particular celebrity or politician they hate will often choose them to be the anti Christ especially the Irish have there\nBeen rolling the dice and say my bets on this guy by bets on this got my bets on Trump my bets on\nYou know and you just go down the list I remember when bronco bottom was president many people thought that he was the anti Christ\nBut I I Would say that this study or\nRevelation of a modern anti Christ is a truly hard sell for most people mainly because\nIn a secular world and we're we are in in you know them the anti Christ is simply a marketing term it's a it's a buzz word for for Christians who see that they are being persecuted in their faith is being destroyed by any number of groups and therefore\nWe can say the devil is in them the devil is in them any meaning mighty mow the devils anew the devil is this group the devil is back with the devil is the right the devils the lab the devils everywhere\nDon't you know this the devil is everywhere and this leads to\nNot conspiracy theory but the idea that a conspiracy exist a darker conspiracy exist that\nIs here to bring down mankind and so when you look and conspiracy history you have to take into account biblical history has well this is something I mean I I think this gets confused sometimes when people say well when you're thinking of America you gotta figure the Christian values that America stands on well what it is is you need to look at the Christian conspiracy\nOr the conspiracy against Christianity because here we have this this you know this all out battle\nAgainst people in America we're fighting against the I mean and when you're looking conspiracy history it all has its roots in biblical over Jersey engine ritual as world events are not simply circumstantial but they are the result of an organized campaign by an elite group of unseen in widely unknown world leaders\nAnd of course we pointed out that they have beliefs in ancient symbolism\nSecret suicidal cultures amend ritual magic and that affects us any it's not about what I Believe it's about what they believe they're the ones in power and so if you say to me well you talked about this all the time you must believe it it's not about how how I Believe it or what I Believe\nI just don't what's there\nAnd I know that causal engineering and ritual magic affects everyone regardless\nOf religious believes regardless of what you practice or what you say you're ... I mean these groups\nI mean these groups they um they\nAh they answered other philosophy secretly and [noise]\nOutwardly they're they're using you know new waves use biblical symbolism and they use it to exercise absolute dictatorial control [noise] over the world and they're trying to establish this new world order [noise]\nAnd they play on your beliefs and manipulate you and if you if you're the have you heard the ah the media lately they've been strategically changing [noise] what globalization means saying that well if you're saying that [noise] you know you're against global if that makes you an anti\nSemite well no it does not [noise]\nSaying that you're not for global as a means you're not for a world order that is going to be led by a beef system certainly [noise]\nHas been part of privacy for a long time [noise]\nAnd so tonight for a little deeper is that we're talking about the anti Christ you're talking about the empire of the darkness the dark way of approaching\nThe dark tsunami demons that we've been warned about [noise]\nBe prepared because we will be feeling the impact of the ...

already check it out now I\nTake all your favorite Paul\nGround zero week nights at ten on news radio five sixty WHYY end\n... this is where I become a you know a man who focuses on his guitar allergy because it's thrown into literature movies show much\nI mean many believe these movies have been a detriment to the fate because well much of what he's shown a written in these books or are these movies put these movies are not based on any scripture Kennan doctrine and that\nYou know that that that the scene and and uh it's actually absorb so much of the stuff that was as been written about the end of the world a bunch of stuff has been written about the anti Christ are performed or shown\nCan be considered heresy I\nMean many movies and many uh stories around Halloween take liberties\nWith passages of scripture with interpretations of apocalyptic themes I mean you can take a look at ... for example know Saddam's has been bastard die so much who knows what\nYou know does too damaged his teacher gets any more I remember back in the seventies they can you remember people always say look what know Saddam is out to say look what no and I don't I barely heard people about no Saddam is now people are now back to the book of Daniel people are now back to the book of the apocalypse the revelation\nPeople want to read apocryphal books but to try to determine what the future hold some guy called me last night and said that he started reading a Antonio basic panic books his Bible ... and that's where I mean look whatever the future is the\n... image thunder is rumbling now into the president it's ... it's it's an ominous future and it's causing the it it just causing us to think that the end times are approaching into some you know we hear those trumpet in this guys you know the the ones that make the trumping noises\nAnd we hear those were wondering my wonder if\nThat's something we should be paying attention to are those the trumpet\nDinner blown by the angels and we just kind of ride them off or something else science tries to explain to but in reality the are the trumpets being blown [noise]\nWhen you're looking at the beginning of the events in our reality and the exploitation of science and religion and everything else it's always making us wonder [noise]\nIf we're really now in the midst of in times reality or in a sense of hyper awareness because of how we been desensitized your baby and brainwashed with Hollywood and then maybe\nYou know people speaking of his stuff I mean when you're reading about how the Vatican has a [noise]\nYou know they focus their attention on extraterrestrial research and then he hired a group of a whole squad or a whole army of exercises you know and and when they're telescope looking at the sky is called looser per you hear all of these you know the these references to lose the for the\nOr something to say that with social media and the lack of the faithful to keep the trust of the youth the devil looks like you're inviting dark father\nAnd speaking of a devil tonight we have the ... with us he um this is probably is a I don't know maybe his third or fourth Halloween with us sometimes we bring them in on Halloween dabbles rex work on the ground zero place cry for having me now I used to introduce you as be\nWhere do you call the magistrate or a bad just drove the church or said I was a magistrate in the church so you're a manager of the church said now you've created the carry on may ...\nYeah I have my own my own order\nNow you know what kind of order is it is it a six eight and a shorter is it a witch order wizard order what kind of magic quarter isn't\nThe case and Perry miss the most advanced black magical order in the world and essentially we see the prince of dark as a a ... and being at a doesn't exist inside of physical space time he's outside of that is not involved\nUm and does not center around the idea of worship but that to this being can actually be contacted through a actions involving um the highest forms of black magic\nAnd uh we see this being something that we can learn from directly because we can become like it it's the our position is to become God like beings\nAre in a in the elation of his first foreign principle which is responsible for all ... life in the cosmos\nSo we're talking about a dark figure that you have this contract with\nWhether it's on it's dark has its misadventures eating right it's not state Satan in in of itself as a\nAs a a a kind of a dumbed down I'm a\nIdea of this super consciousness inside of physical space time it's a and this guy stiff 'em rebellion\nAnd a a decadence and I'm a hedonism but uh the ultimate\nElevated form of this is a stoic looser furry and for which is where we are\nAre actively involved in so I'm\nForever action there's an opposite ... equal reaction so as you see manifestations of a forms going to a a higher spiritual form or as a decision to to forcefully moved the intellect and the psych through some physical space toward a higher\nForm you're going to the replica ripples\nIn in its back wash that are going to manifest themselves as decadence in degenerate but we're also living inside of the cyclic nature of the ...\nWhich is a an understanding of cyclic time in this position that's happening right now is the degenerate\nI'm a sales oriented um cosmological construct within the human physical uh action and form that is at its lowest a\nContinuum it's it's the worst possible position we can actually live in so you're going to see this like all across the board politics philosophy art music\nUm you know a cultures et cetera\nIs this something that ah the chaos ... do they relish this or were they like to see a higher form of been lightened meant there would be more refined satanism runny actually act\nAbsolutely no interest in what happens to the rest of the world no interest at all no we we're we're we're poll bearers of western civilization or we're just watching it happened the rest of us are just moving toward something that's a continually outside of that\nSo you're waiting for all of us to destroy each other than you guys moving debates we'd be be and why no\nWe're not even interested in in in the earth we're interested in transcending me on even that position so transcend any one thing that they are really unhappy about is the fact that there were so much a destruction of the beauty of this planet and a lot of that manifested in ...\nSuch as an animal abused child abuse this type of thing we think this kind of thing is really a a really horrific actually animal abuse even worse as far as we're concerned because of the true I'm\nA a\nHolders of the of the planet you know they were here before we were and we've come along with like eradicated\nOr their land um\nTheir position in the world you know they're they're ... they're simple rights to live so well actually I don't really like to live well it is is that the you know we we completely overrun all of that and I just think that there should be some kind of vengeful action against that type of\nThe bench will actually get federal abusing child oh yeah absolutely um you know it's interesting because I said that statement earlier I said satanism now it's harder to find black magically well yeah I mean you will for more you are you talking about ... magic but I'm Talking about how now with the ... the definition of what satanism is it's not easy I remember when I first met you and I talked over\nA back when you were part of the C O s\nI uh I I was trying to put a handle on what's Satan is believed or at least the way and famous believed\nAnd uh before it wasn't easy to find satanism it's getting even more difficult to divide said that the ... say that the one seat business anymore because\nWe'd go for like a like I said we go for the most ridiculous definitions to the more psychotic definitions of what it is and I was just curious if this why you left the church is safe\nYou know a ... which is a fairly universally and philosophically recognized as the first manifestation of a true a church devoted to satanism too I'm an acknowledgement the devil I'm as a a as a symbol for I'm\nI'm a form of personal internal evolution and that each and every man and woman is there oh satanic deity moving to try and become something greater than what they are um there's\nWithin the like the last Twenty years there has been literature that has flooded the literal\nA cottage industry of books that have come out claiming to have been some type of a former age old undiscovered um clandestine form of a of the satanic worship\nThat um that you can tap into and that's just not true\nI'm a scholar of black magic in satanism and I researched it and it's\nIt's either a um [noise] highly embellished ideas around a satanic Didi or be blatantly meal a manifestation created\nBy people who are who are betting that you don't know anything more about it than they do what\nMost people that I remember when I first was interviewing you there are a lot of people by what you say they were saying well we identify with what rex who say we we we'd been and are either of them and say well I find uncomfortable because I find it uncover all that I agree with what he said because of\nYour position in the church who said now you have your own group of black
