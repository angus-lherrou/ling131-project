never heard anyone talk about what the polls looked like before the red wave that put a lot of Tea Party candidates in Congress what were the predictions back then\nI'm Michael that's a that's a good question I don't know I don't know uh I'll have to check it out I'm not really sure what the exact productions where I'd say that's a very good point um\nGo Michael writes but out of pocket this week

thank you for writing and and yeah the media did circle the wagons around war and it was a disgrace but that's what they did go to close up shop in the freedom to night gene excited to be with you every day this week every day\nEvery week pretty much what I go to bill\nBut a a joke tomorrow one request do one friend down with the books that can show pocket on apple Baucus and then you'll die\nFeel like you have to use one of these social media sites that you know is infected with all kinds of left wing bias or they have all this conversational health nonsense going on and they are constantly trying to find ways to kill the table toward the left to\nGo to a place where your opinion is valued and where you don't have to worry about shadow banning or any other nonsense that's been going on because of a left wing dominance\nOr really have like a mild illness like the common cold but then it it creates a serious complication especially in France and people would weaken immune systems where a fitness and ... a paralyzing or conditions take place\nThis outbreak and the fact that it was so surprising in my opinion is proof but diseases are evolving into the FDA and the CDC or having a hard time keeping up with the evolution of diseases down I Would tell you that bacteria\nAntibiotic resistant bacteria is one of the biggest problems we're facing right now as a nation because many people are getting MRSA and other problems that flushing disorders\nBut a warning went out\nAbout this increase in ah the AFL this acute foot a plastic my light is\nThis has been a significant increase since twenty Seventeen\nAnd a worrying perpetuation of a disease which there is little understanding they don't know where it's coming from and why it's happening other cases that we're announcing the two have been confirmed and twenty two states\nUh surges baffled help officials who announced a change in the way the agency is counting cases they also wanted to raise awareness about the conditions for the parents can seek medical care if their child develop symptoms and fill positions can quickly relate reports of the potential illness to the CDC\nBe increasing cases are started happening in twenty fourteen\nCDC was tracking this but every year since then usually in August or September the CDC is log in spike of it a spike in this ... virus but it it's a ... the ... the spikes are significantly high right now\nAre back in twenty Seventeen the C. D. C. reported that a child died from this disorder instance officials have been able to or they haven't been able to determine how the disease spreads\nThey're starting to count suspected cases as well as confirmed too bitter anticipate increases over the coming months so uh I can tell you know it's too early\nTo know whether the total of twenty people surpass those the previous years but the data is showing a substantially larger number than in previous months this year\nSo\nAnd and the bad thing is there's no treatment for it\nLong term outcomes or a crap shoot\nWhat happens is whatever this is you know and we were talking about things like eat quaint and several lightest we're talking about all these other disorders that are certainly affect the brain and the nervous system this affects the nervous system\nEspecially with a specifically the spinal cord neurological conditions like you'd have a variety of causes such ... viruses environmental toxins and genetic disorders among the case is under investigation\nAre basically there are five reported to the Maryland health officials in recent weeks a health department spokesman said that Maryland's first case was reported September twenty first no known cases have been reporting Virginia or the district this year\nThere were three confirmed cases Virginian twenty sixteen and that's what health department officials upset\nNow we know that medical science\nContinually making rapid advances we've got new medications that treatments all these things are developed and they're introducing a rapid pace our water supply and demand I often kind of be the possibility that pharmaceutical companies can cut corners and they get very sloppy\n\nNow we're always assured that it might be at the age or buy health organizations that our system for screening\nOr is superior than most are are drug screening as superior than most are back scene screenings are superior than most\nBut now can be argued that I after Jay consequences are not necessarily the problem with a doctor but it may just be the fall of the manufacture of these medications or\nWhatever it is re introduced into the system we're looking at a toxic environment of drugs are toxic environment vaccines kids are reacting to him in various ways I don't think the CDC or the FBI or anyone would come forward and say that perhaps a vaccine caused this\nOr some other drug I mean we know\nOur biological systems are constantly evolving\nAnd if we go by scientific hypothesis we also surmise that disease causing organisms are evolving too\n\nAnd so this raises a lot of questions and a lot of eyebrows about whether or not treatments in pills they kill the ills are killing the patient or in this case\nCourting and Tara viruses that cannot be altered\nAnd like I you know we look at biological systems all biological systems ... disease causing organisms and\nAnd of course the victims that people they all they they evolve and they adapt sometime they evolve and the dapper\nCertain diseases don't bother them anymore they run its course kind of like a virus that runs its course it doesn't uh it it goes dormant for a while and then comes back with a vengeance but right now we need to start understanding the evolution of what is happening and how can make a big difference\nIn how we treat disease\nI mean the evolution of disease causing organisms they outpaced our ability to invent new treatments and it may even al pays for I Believe the ease pain and suffering\n\nI can tell you that it appears\n\nThe failures of the past have given way to the most unexpected successes and some of those unexpected rises or rate raising of disease and biologically altered diseases as well\nNew problems of course and ribs in\nAnd this new paralyzing disease is harming our children and we know the accidents related to Karen medication in particular multiplied\n\nAnd we begin to worry about health care and health care professional we we hear about drug induced I after Jenike artifacts\n\nWe hear about adverse effects or even adverse drug events we hear about adverse effects from vaccines and the minute you bring this up somebody says I didn't know you were to anti bacterial they start ridiculing you but\nJust think about all the accidents at all the mistakes have been made\nWhen the pharmaceutical companies don't evolved with people and don't have all the ... would be a diseases that are coming on board now either we can say that this is all being plan\n\nWe can say that it's all being done for the call the aspects and for the for the eliminating the walk but\n\nYou're not helpless to fight it you're not helpless to stop it you're not helpless to uh do do things to make yourself better\n\nAnd and so we have available many things that they can put us uh in in a situation where we can build our immune systems we can build a new bill all sorts of things that we just know the right things to eat the right things to do the right supplements to take the right drugs\nI mean I I worry now because uh I heard before\nWe were hearing about the the biological weapons we're hearing about the biological attacks we were hearing about\nMosquitoes actually infecting people and giving them equine except for white is or giving them some sort of a eastern equine suffer why does or some other a disease that affects\nThe spinal cord with a brain or hemorrhaging or what have you and I don't think anybody is is pushing the pandemic button yet\nAlthough we are right now at the doorstep of the new flu season and I would hate to think that the virus would attack a child\nAnd then the officials are saying now that for twenty eight team they believe that it's going to surpass the previous year\nSo\nKeep in mind this ... this is a rare condition it's affecting less than one in you know one in a million people pay so I mean it's as a parent myself I worry for my ... my child where I worked for my step son it's a dramatic disease and health\nOfficials want to raise awareness about the symptoms to ensure parents seek medical care immediately if their children's ... sudden onset of weakness in their arms and legs\nAre\nThey saying that polio is not the cause of it because of the CDC has tested every single stool specimens from patients and none of tested positive for polio\n\nUm West Nile virus is not causing this way of a rule that ruled out west Nile um but there is some virus that starts out is it respiratory illness\nSo we had his respiratory illness that sets in so it's like having the flu and then suddenly you start noticing that your children cannot control their arms of the legs\n\nAnd so they don't have a pathogen identified yet consistently being detected inpatient spinal fluid with regard to FM\n\nSo it all goes back to the same old same old idea of washing the hands staying up to a you know is basically wash their hands using insect repellent is this is the thing that's interesting they were saying you must you'd order to prevent this we we suggest that you use mosquito repellent\nSo what does that tell you [laughter] where where does that tell you it tells you that this is this is probably being spread by mosquitoes the very thing that we said we'd be responsible for a biological attack on the country or one of the very few things will be used for again a function exercise would be mosquitoes\nA Bill Gates released mosquitoes one time in a in a meeting that he added a Ted Talk to demonstrate how mosquitoes are more dangerous than sharks\nAnd so once again it's the idea that\nYou know we're we're in the middle of an evolving if it's the\nBalding ... through the balding diseases bobbing are evolving drugs and and having to having to prevent things but we have to have well I called prophylactic ... protection\nWhat you mean to protect us from the beginning of protect your children from the beginning from what it is it's coming and this is something that most certainly you wouldn't want your children to go through [noise]\nDribbling fix every three thirty seven hundred that's trouble eight six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nAre we watching the evolution of diseases\nAnd the pharmaceutical companies are are the pharmaceutical companies evolving with those diseases I don't believe they are\nI think that they are at a loss for a lot of things eighty thousand people dead from the flu last year I think is proof of that [noise] dribbling six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA fix every three thirty seven

hospitalized [laughter]\n[noise]\nNerves\nMuch more than\nTime last year\nFriends are real leverage and to drink plenty of like a vaccine\nI'm quite Lewis\nYou are listening to ground zero that it was called and I believe six seven three thirty seven hundred\nThe pharmaceutical companies are not keeping up\nWith the evolution of diseases and they're not keeping up with pain and how pain is evolving as well so what they've done is their teaming up with advertising agencies\nThey're creating public service announcements and they're and they're basically pushing certain attitudes ideas about vaccines and drugs now selling that you you know ... it's trying to outsell\nTrying out sell your ability to heal yourself and the reason why is because I think as we speculated last year ... bio labs have created these new superbug superbug super diseases evolve into something else we have a respiratory viruses down turning into an ... virus\nWe have a flu virus that turns into a pneumonia that kills people\nOkay\nAnd so everyone working in the pharmaceutical industry cannot help but notice that it's undergoing a vigorous\nEvolution we're going through an evolutionary period that only for health but for the pharmaceutical companies\nAnd much has been written about how you know pharmaceutical companies will need to change and how they are offering the public or\nIneffective drugs ineffective vaccine in effect the ineffective I after Jenike artifacts basically where the cure kills you know CBO affects instead of placebo it's those the boats no benefit at all\nAnd so this is why I I think it's important we should talk about that\nWe should bring this up because I I think the word of warning should go out\n\nIf you have you ever have you have a compromised immune system\nI Would say use your judgment and and and perhaps use your better judgment maybe get a flu vaccine I I'm not sure I don't think a flu vaccine is for everyone but after what I've read about what happened last year and how people who've gotten the flu vaccine eventually had floated evolved into something else\nI'd be really really really suspicious of this\nYou can't sue the pharmaceutical company rock Obama put that into law who's Baxter International course was one of his major contributors and back to international course makes the flu vaccine and several other vaccines that of course we're being pimped and pushed on the American people for the longest time\n\nNow here we are with everything they tell us get your vaccine get desk at this get busy and nothing's working\n\nNow they are our children are now getting ... viruses non polio internal viruses where they first start out as a respiratory illness and then they're paralyzed same thing with the ... you started getting assuming a sickness and your paralyze me to gain a function exercises where people are getting rice in sent to them\nWhere they end up getting sick and and they end up\nUh you know it's like\nWe're we're in the middle of this right now we don't even realize it's happening but the CDC says well this is happening we don't know what to do but will tell you about to watch your kids make sure they don't take up the symptoms and get them an owned by the way the way to prevent it put on something put on some sort of a mosquito repellent so they don't get bitten by mosquitoes\nThat should speak volumes to everybody shouldn't it especially when we talked about this before and how it's being done\n\nThe mainstream it's not going to report this to you they're just not\nI mean they'll report it probably eventually but then I can report or like we're reporting it and they haven't been following it since we've been following the Kleenex exercise from the beginning to what has been happening and slowly but surely the game to puncture an exercise viewed everybody's sick or to get in a certain group of people sick\nAnd the idea that using DNA from these twenty three Indian ancestry is to sell to places like GlaxoSmithKline Pfizer\nEllen ten minutes from uh Ashville so these these mosquitoes are moving in line and they're moving into areas that they've never been in\nAnd they're they're they're bigger now they're big ... yeah and people are saying that there are huge is a thumbnail they're they're just as you mentioned something as big of a thumbnail stabbing you it's one of these natural hybrid interview given you you know whatever it is you know just passing along whatever it may be and it just ...\nSomething to me why are the children in different parts of the country coming down with the polio taught flu so it was is that being spread through the Kim trail although\nI I just don't know if they don't know and I certainly looking into why would happen but it just it just stands to reason they're saying now the cases of like doubled his twenty fourteen\nYeah I mean they're saying well this is a rare thing will be how rare is it was one of the you know so many million people get this well that that sounds to me like there's some sort of a test run for something else because then a lot more kids could be getting this and they would be paralyzed that it can take the river recovered from the browsers just\nIn different parts of the country at what's going on with that\nYeah it ah to me it it sounds a little fishy and like I said it's something that's evolving and somebody is changing again a mutation but like last year's flu eighty thousand people dead\nAnd we were discussing how it just seemed to me this is a flu that was going around with the ball begin mutating into something a lot worse than respiratory illness that it was hard to recover from hard to breathe that was it was pneumonia literally\nWill take a look at the mercy of the most of the book

Spanish civil war maybe after the stash American War\nOf ... up there are a lot of Mexican started to come over here in the early part of the twenty century\nAnd they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and a government got his great ideas to uh to uh\nTo prohibit marijuana wall with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana 'cause nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made a they created in the campaign around reefer madness this idea that smoke pot you would go crazy and there's a funny movie now wasn't funny at the time covering for Madison talks about all of\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana tax that\nWhich I don't know if you heard of that a marijuana tax act a ... put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana and they put a tax on marijuana and they said\nDidn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually completely ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana illegal and it's been illegal ever said but the fact of the matter is\nIs that people have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our ... our jail are still\nWith people who are they are simply because they were selling or smoking or possessing marijuana\nAnd like you said earlier we've created at least a police state around are around people are a surround people who simply want to get high whether it's through\nA marijuana or ... or even with opiates why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol what we do and that's marijuana clogged I'll tell\nYou this is the thing that uh you know and and for me I guess it fits me apart from a lot of a talk show hosts are mostly conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd ah when I did and it was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times and I never touched it again it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I don't think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with the law did every day the feeling of ah\nA foggy had all this stuff felt bad one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you try something and it looked as though no no no I Can't do this\nAnd he says what's wrong he says I said I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not going to and he said no give it a try he says I'm a uses and and and it was a guy that it would just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try cannabis and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know some idiot ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind in one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about uh things like a cannabis that they ah let them use CBD Oil Somalian does it as an ointment on their joints\nAnd ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given it to end brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a using a kind of a a a a an ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs in this country have such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world they they treat or this type of a crisis\nNot with jail time in and punishment they they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest where they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated and and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and ah and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better\nOr a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not\nFeeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help and they're in need of a ... they are in need of medical care and I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments\nAnd I think that the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack\nOr uh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions\nYou know everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people put them in facilities and have them is not going as criminals and be trained to be put into the position of criminals there actually put into hospitals where they were under a medical arrest\nThat would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people that have gone through this because\nThe problem is bad and you can agree with me I Know the doctors do not know how to actually get rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said at the beginning but it evolves over time and you even brought up existential paying you brought up\nDeep pain inside the body that is not pain but it's felt physically but it's pain that is spelled on a on a I guess you could call on a conscious level or or your consciousness is he in pain or wracked with pain\nExplain I don't have those work on that I hey they do yes absolutely that's why people do it yeah I I don't I Can't speak from personal experience but I Know that people I've spoken to many people who say that they like\nThings like ... and uh I don't know if you've heard of that is a similar to opiate similar they went over it or or biking than or Percocet\nBecause it makes them they say it makes them feel good\nAnd what they really mean is that it makes them it takes them out of their painter the pain of existence you know we we live our lives as the roast that most people live their life was quite a sense of quiet desperation mhm and like we get beaten down over time\nAnd that creates this sense of I don't want to be alive they said well you know what I mean one of the\nScariest things one of the scariest things about opiates and I'll tell you this this was a scary for me I remember\nWhen I had my first cancer surgery and uh I was given a pain mad I don't remember what it was I was in the hospital\nAnd all of a sudden I felt balance I felt no pain and I felt great because you know after you're dealing with the initial pain and you're feeling the stitches and you're and this is my got here it's been caught you know you can't move because you know you your core has been cut and you can't move\nAnd it was really weird it was a weird experience to have something that takes the pain completely away and you feel balanced and that's exactly how I felt when I needed the pain medication or to get rid of my pain\nAnd see that's the thing is it's the idea of the balance at times\nFeeling that balance when the pain will not go away and you have that balance of of calm where you have that moment where the ... the the warmth Russia's over you and the pan is gone but like I said before there's dependence where you take that pain away because you're dependent on appeal to take the pain away\nAnd then when the pain is gone and you still take the pill that's when you realize maybe I'm addicted or maybe have an addiction to the smell\nDoes your body down regulate its own natural production\nSo all of a sudden your decision you're out like you say you're out a ballot what's really interesting to me why and how much of this stuff and we talk about his ex essential pain for example could be related to
