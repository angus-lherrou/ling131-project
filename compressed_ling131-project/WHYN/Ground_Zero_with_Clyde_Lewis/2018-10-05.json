H. Y. N. [noise]\nMichael ... and on this throwback Thursday night I cannot believe the show goes by and the blink of an NIH and we've\nCovered so many different things are real special thanks to Gordon Chang joined us midway in the show and explain what the heck is going on with China and North Korea and why we should be paying more attention\nUh and uh to my buddy or Randy Sutton with law enforcement and so much to do and do you the listeners who've been there\nThroughout the whole show really helped out a one more caller hanging out on the buck phone lines Kenny in Boston Welcome to the show Kenny how are you\nI'm Mike ... kind of like a an obscure Chester you're all it just might give somebody\nIt does but it's not it's actually it's a a maneuver that they the Romans used to use they would say for tests no no but they would say in Latin\nAnd uh I Would take\nTheir shields that's why I buck says shields high because when you inhale tests do do it meant to put your shields over your head and everybody would then form a like a like a tortoise that's what to do do meant in Latin\nAnd the shields would form this impenetrable barrier so the arrows ... spears would bounce off and they could approach whatever they were going to fight so that's the way we yell tests do do and shield tie on this show\nBeautiful\nListen I wanted to talk about the um the test the FEMA test the presidential alert yeah I didn't get one myself right before when I understand this has been in a in a work search Benny there since ... Bush\nAnd that and it was expanded under Obama macho include cell phones but it only right now got a implemented\nAnd so this doesn't really have much to do but the timing of it seems to me you know like why not why did it almost seems like they did not but the thing in Hawaii when they had that alert their missiles are incumbent I'm sure the deep state thing but I'm a little bit of a um stretch there I suppose\nWell you're you're right when you do the history on it and say started under Bush and then it was approved under Obama\nAnd it's just sometimes a coincidental when this government program finally takes action now is it you know I have friends who say\nThey must know something's going to happen and they want to tell us what what really bothers me Kenny is that now the government's got my cell phone number\nI already get four million uh unsolicited phone calls a day from people who say did you know you're eligible for free back brace her neck brace push one to get your information push nine to be on the do not call list\nAnd I used to push nine but now I realize when I push nine all it says is they can sell your number to somebody else\nThey can sell that number to someone else who's going to then call me ten times a day so I now push one and I talked to him\nAnd and I try and engage them because the longer there on the phone without making a sale\nThe I'm frustrating that so I'm doing it so you won't we won't get that call but I don't know that that ... um\nYou know Michael Moore thinks it is but I don't it just bothers me that now the government has my cell phone but they don't have yours you didn't get a call\nYeah this I I didn't get an ish reading it but there's an article on line and it says some people did not get the call I now I did not get it\nWell consider yourself lucky unless there's an attack then you're going to be walking around and go where the health everybody going\nThat are sort of\nYeah may maybe just but keep your eye out everybody else you you can't miss it like I said I was on the golf course in my phone's going and ... or whatever was\nYou're not supposed to make the noise because they don't make a mess but Kenney a I gotta I'm almost outta here the Soros machine is approaching rapidly quickly do you think Kavanaugh gets through or not\nA I'm going to give it about a Seventy percent\nOkay I'm sixty five thirty five right now so we're pretty close and I think mentioned climbs over and maybe Collins fold sits just one of those things that I'm predicting but thanks Kenny\nAppreciate you Michael Palin in for a buck Sexton tonight we like that so much maybe I'll be back tomorrow night and if I Am a ... if it's a friday and I'm here\nThen it's crazy time and all bets are off\nSo get ready if a if you tune in tomorrow and I hope you do\nOr going to have some fun Michael Palin saying tests due to all my friends is too though [noise]\nThe FBI calls home titles that one of the fastest growing crimes my friend's brace yourselves if you've ever had your credit card stone it's nothing compared to the hell you're in for when the steals your homes title everything's online these days including your homes titled domestic and international thieves\nThis is just how evil this is this how terrifying it is when you consider\nWell when you consider\nAs I said earlier as I was talking with some of my staff and and other people I work with I said you know\nIf you just dig into the twilight language just becomes\nVery appropriate as we're getting closer to Halloween and it's hard to explain this as I said if you get an inkling and and and you're not you can't be honest totally with people about it you can be for you before it's frightening say well yeah this is what is happening but then you tell them but this could be something that is diabolical\nAnd it's something that could be a curse and it's something that could be this and this because all of the\nParanormal points are being connected all the dots in the paranormal and the and the paranoia or connect the dots that are happening to the puzzle pieces are coming together the patterns are showing themselves\nAnd I know that many of you\nHave picked up on my subtle hints such as\nReferences to the numbers like nine\nAnd eleven talking about plagues and passed on biological terror it'd be evil duff the Julian Assange so brilliantly describes as being put everywhere for the surveillance apparatus\nBut I Know some of you have not been lost on any and all of the metaphors\nThe means the name drops the word drops the you know ... there's this there's a metaphor home at a Ford and saw last on any of you in the toilet languages have been used not only by me but by\nThe media now twilight language for those of you but don't know twilight languages the languages symbols numbers and\nPins sign posts all these things that point to a supernatural or paranormal explanation as to why things happen in the world strange things\nTo kill your things things that don't make sense to you and trust me the next few days things are not going to make much sense to you especially those who are completely ensconced in the cabinet Ford saga okay ... and many of you know me\n\nAnd he you know many many of you listening to me all these years I understand that I see the world in patterns of a personal weapon detect symbolic language and\nSymbolic actions and numbers and all these things that renders the mind waiting for a kind of synchronous city to unfold you understand what I'm trying to say I mean when you share this type of thinking what people they're not always receptive and tend to think that you're\nProne to magical thinking and this is what you can can you can't say everything until\nIt's more evidence you know most prophecy most things that are paranormal or I actually talked about attribute back I'm jumping on it now just so you know how my mind is going and how\nThe dark place is it I Am now in that dark place at the moment right doesn't mean I'm suicidal doesn't mean I'm I'm losing my mind it means right now\nMy mind is in a dark place and I can assure you that when I'm going to talk about tonight is not magical thinking\nIt's merely me pattern seeking any knowledge that a lot of coincidences meaningful and if it can be the result of calling upon a competent stricter\nNow can be intentionally run in central however I can see that\nThe confidence trickster we all know there's been some and and we all know who that confidence trickster is am I right I mean you can picture in your mind\nWho the competence trickster is what the competence stricter brings to the table death destruction riots civil upheaval anger\nDismay and all this was brought by that one character accomplished trickster known as the devil and the devil comes quickly with rap because as the Bible says\nHe knows his time is short and he has to act quickly when some and and when he is acting we can call it as it's happening we can\nTalk about a little by little and deliver pieces of the puzzle every show which I've been doing little pieces of the puzzle little metaphors little ideas\nLittle things all seem to come together that's the ... program okay it's not coast to coast they Amazon Alex Jones because they don't do what it is they don't understand this part of it\nYeah\nBut he played monopoly you can play risk you Billy all aboard games in the world but none of them compared to the board game that takes you to the edge\n\nBecause there's ... there's plenty of edge that I'm looking over right now that I see right now\n\nIs it all gets peculiar and it gets in tents and it gets stranger and I'm sure that people listening to me tonight are going to go oh wow really\n'cause that's what I was thinking that's what I was thinking when I was at home this morning and I got up late and I threw myself into the shower drag myself into the bathroom\nYou know messed my hair up put everything together throwing the clothes and go wait a minute\n\nI Can't believe this it was right in front of me and I didn't say it in time and hopefully I'm In the same time\nAnd it's going to open minds to what's going on what is truly going on\nSo following me now this is about to get weird okay about the weird on September twenty six twenty Eighteen September twenty six twenty Eighteen the Institute for digital archeology\nUnveiled a replica of the Palmyra Syria iconic triumphal arch dedicated to the horn God bail on the national mall in Washington DC\n\nThe following day\nChristine

hearings took place well you look you know\nIf I Want to be so bold just identify some say Catholic alliance that basically would somehow influenced the rulers of the world we can say well it's a little bit on the plot\n\nAnd we could identify it as some ancient devotion to the got fortresses big coca Saturn the cult of bail I mean look\nThe gods from the sky the gods of air bail is the God of all of this guy bail is or let me all of these established connections with bail ... we we now have to take into consideration there's there's a curious parallel between\nVests and other false gods

this program every night every major step\nIn the development of the new world order from a simple ideology joy worldwide super state can be traced back\nTo specific ideologies which uphold ruled by a chosen body of spiritual elite secret Brotherhood's from behind the scenes the Brotherhood whatever it may be or the sisterhood if you want to be equal\n\nAll plays a role in the hidden hand that guides us towards disorder and it can also be seen as a manifestation of elusive theory and spirituality the professors to enlighten practitioners through mysticism and magic\nAnd I kind of alluded to it in the last hour I used the word synergy\nThere was a guy by the name of a job civil exonerees say knives\nAnd he\nHad an opposition to the rise of anarchy and the second half of the nineteenth century\n\nAnd to him the ideal state was a rigid social hierarchy topped by an elite that is pre destined to rule absolutely at odds with the band emerging concepts of democracy\nAnd so he decided that the only way to win and to gain power which do you use the supernatural as a weapon\n\nAnd so he wanted to transmit the secret synergy throughout the ages basically coming in coordination and cooperation with a divine rule meaning that\nSome spiritual fathers do not exist on this planet and they must be conjured up contacted and one of the spiritual fathers or some of the spiritual fathers are set are key were of course the knights Templar and other groups that you know actually spawned and and and new ideas and\nAnd mysterious mysterious subjects and hitting meanings and certain con dreams and all these things\n\nAnd I said before that it seems to me that you know be beyond the deep state in the dark state or whatever state you want to point to as a problem there is a darker\nType of rule of dark command that actually uses the darker powers to create a sin arcade may be in power right now the government it's run\nAnd it's not our government into towel but what it is it is a government of some kind of group a conspiracy of men or women that form a priesthood and are ruled by a secret society open societies are not always the ones\nThat are named by conspiracy theorists all of them however it played a role in establishing\nTheir power plays within the United states and within the world\nThe formation of this nation was perhaps the mother of all conspiracies but from there there were other conspiracy groups\nOther secret societies and I know many Christians in America believe that the establishment or the United states was based on Christian values and ideologies business half true because the rebellious nature of the insurrection was purely Syrian\n\nAny bordered on things like her medic arcane them announced it says um except for the very beginning we always had that group\n\nThat are simply observers they they they are custodians and they make things happen and they call themselves into a different opinion that of the Christians or the Jews are the Muslims and they're in systematic opposition\n\nTo the apostles to the disciples to those who've adopted the views of Christianity Islam and Judaism and they're against the general teaching of any gospel whatsoever any word there would be connected to a God\nA God that they don't approve of\n\nAnd they are on the opinion that the dog was of any gospel are not good for anyone\n\nAnd this is why they're really ... in most respects has a secret doctrine which is reserved for the elite\n\nAnd this is why when you see things happen that don't sincerely seem\nGodly or or Chrysler like or or or anything you you look at the symbolic language you look at the actions you look at the numbers and all the numbers in the symbolic actions in the language and all of them are puzzle pieces to a greater picture and not always do you have the greater picture and even I Do\n\nThat's why you know I gave a few clues gave it a few hands and I said a couple of nights ago I said you know I'm not\nGonna give you an exact date I Can't give you a decay exact date or anything I'm not here to tell you the world ending I I\nThat would be stupid to do something like this and many people say and many people are used to the idea that people who talk like I taught or wanting to just gather everyone together and say the world is ending do yourselves then that's it no I'm not a cult leader on a talk show host\n\nAnd know what I'm Talking about it's not magical thinking it's really patterns taking it it's it's basically knowledge drink a lot of the coincidences diamond seeing lately are meaningful at least to me they are they might not\nBe they might not be meaningful to you [noise] and it can be intentional or unintentional but I see that there is a confidence stricter a foot with what is happening between the uh the situation with the four cabinet meetings the FBI and what's about to be set [noise]\nWhere the votes about debate [noise]\nAs I said and I always say prepare yourself for anything anything happen after\nOr what is what is excluded included is anyone [noise]\nThe devil is in the details but the gentleman and I mean that literally AAA fix every three thirty seven hundred us AAA fix every three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis you're listening to ground zero will be\nHeld and shell dining on you\n\n\n\nMine\nAnd I mean\n\nStill putting off a building that dream home\nNow perfect time to talk with us about a mortgage loan\nMany options to consider find you a loan them he writes for\nCall today and we'll start\nDivision title stature I heart radio weekends for each time capsule ground zero weeknight said ten on news radio five sixty WHYY end\n\n[laughter] [noise]\nThat were originally associated [noise]\nSo\nDon't honestly in Washington DC and all very [noise]\n\n\nYou know it's time\nI'm quite sure where\nYou are listening to ground zero\nBut they're just a dial AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred symbols read anything do you do numbers mean anything do you\nDo they tap into some of the darkest\nPowers that exist and maybe this is why we're the situation we're in would be for Kavanaugh decision about promiscuity\nFacts but death of\nChildren all wrapped up into the same God to bail for which the arch of bail representatives in Washington DC right now are wrecked it on the same\nDay as the Senate Judiciary hearings and this\nDoesn't feel like a coincidence especially with what's at stake\nIn what's happening\nWhat do you think Tripoli picks up at three thirty seven hundred that's AAA picks up at three thirty seven hundred is go to Todd in Kentucky I taught during ground zero\nSo Clyde thanks for taking my call you about\nA love your show topics so super interesting as a spare feel Christian I Am so excited\nAnd just about to die but uh I was wanting to offer some information that I thought would help people understand where we're at and us simplify it and also solidify a lot of what you're saying I'm\nNow getting right to the chase long time ago I was in church and our the preacher so to say this and I had time while I was on hold the hammered out real quick okay but if you take the computer\nAnd a U.S Senate alphabetical a position numerically he likes the being three oh being Fifteen damage Thirteen pay is sixteen easily be Twenty one key is twenty\nHe is five and or is Eighteen\nNow if you add those up it comes to want a weapon ... and I think we could all agree that the number of man according to I think John the revel later in revelations number land would be six\nNephew multiplied that low and behold we come up with mark either based six six six\nAnd a number of guy I think numbers don't lie but I found it totally amazing that man bought two thousand years ago or so I didn't know what he was saying but here we are having the computers have taken over a\nWell if you if you want if you want a really good creepy so um when you look at the Hebrew alphabet okay and the Hebrew numerical systems and you say to yourself ah WWW is an acronym for the worldwide Web WWW and it's\nBack to the pre picks WWW and so if you look at the Hebrew and Greek alphabet he doesn't have several characters are outlets are numbers and letters they describe certain letters and numbers together\nSo there are letters that have numerical value so if you look at the Hebrew equivalent of our W the letter is vi V. A. V. vibe or it's Bob and so the number of value of Bob he's six\nSo Bob Bob Bob or WWW numerically it's six six six\nThat is correct and I think again solidifies uh everything you're saying mhm and ah I just want people to know\nWhat have you take the Roman looking as if you take the Roman numeral or you take the Roman numerals six okay which is vi you'll vi vi vi and then you connect to be I'd be I'd be I it's uh WWW so you have another six six six", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Springfield", "day": "05"}
