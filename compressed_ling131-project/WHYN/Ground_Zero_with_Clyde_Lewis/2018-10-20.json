around the world we have him tonight Thomas shared and welcome to ground zero\n\nHigh tide delighted to be here again\nIt's good to have you and like I said ah it it's it's just amazing to\nBe able to have you in such a time I mean as I was explaining there seems to be like this shift in attitudes towards I guess you could call it conjuring attitudes towards what would be considered darker magic or some of the darker arts why do you think that this is starting up now why do you think there's a newfound interest in this\n\nI think people will they brought these ideas for for all kinds of reasons I think you'll have people who will be drawn to choose things like social stairs\nThere's a sense that there's an insecurity within society you see that happening in Brooklyn tomorrow at these these wages are going to bind cabinet is other people look at things like you know\nQuantum physics and these ideas that reality is malleable to a certain extent and that they wanna they let you want to test these ideas and they want to say well you know is it you know is the five cents reality is it malleable is it\nKind of change it cannot ultra towards my will and still the only effective mechanism out there to do this as things like magic and so people are drawn to it for that reason as well I think also there's that there's a kind of the maturing going on at the moment that its oil is living in the age where\nYou know people that look the especially in recent years we've seen like the ... the major religions and the crimes of the Catholic Church and other organizations have been exposed quite readily and people have said themselves at these guys have done a polling things and here they are telling us that you know which ... evil so\nIt is evil really considering the source that's coming from and then I I think that's got a lot to do it I think a lot of people have a kind of a hunger now to see if they can test the boundaries of reality using their will\nAnd it's becoming more apparent that they can uh I was just talking last night with Chris Jones Riggio we were talking about this new medium that is on the Internet right now that certainly is causing the the left wing of the United states to be disturbed because they say it's the humanizing it it's certainly\nA it's called the NBC or the non playing character meaning that it's a symbol of those who sound like they are repetitive Lee speaking from a script and it's very effective and I was saying to ah Chris last night I said isn't that interesting that this character\nKind of resembles the ... of alchemy and it seems to be very powerful it's just a simple silk like looking character grand color very simple way drawn but it's supposed to be there is some sort of a a I guess you could call it a toga or some sort of mean that that is spreading and certainly going viral and this is a form of magic\n\nI'd been taken a great interest in this as soon as it came to fruition on the electromagnetic spectrum last weekend I knew this was going to be something special\nThe like I I've been watching this whole thing around for ... and the way these people have been using them ethics for years now and we are in a different world there's a basically a a generation of\nInstinctual chaos magicians who are using things like means to actually mold reality in terms of the political structure now this and this and PC name is ... is quite fascinating and not so much in its was putting out there but the reaction\nTo it it's it's it's tapped into something very visceral and frightening in deep within the people it's been it's been aimed at it's almost like the you know that that the judgment is the mirror and the mirror has been held up to these are these kind of like a\nCultural relaxes repeaters or whether you want to call them and they're not happy they're not happy because they wanted to believe they were special and certainly they're realizing that the only thing special about them is that they're probably just like androids\nYeah and that's the thing is that they're saying oh it's the humanizing it hurts us but you're right it's like putting a mirror up to them and say look at what you're saying look at what you're doing look at what you're acting upon\nAnd it just reminded me when I saw that as a you know a several characters that have just been ... characters that have been effective in the past like the ... that was discovered\nA that was actually created that are probably a a created the among kill it said he had a uh the uh the one that was called the way that uh he had that looked like a a a huge balding\nKind of a self like character but it's just a simple thing it's a simple name is repeating or at least showing them this is the mirror you're looking through this is looking through a glass darkly and it's making people uncomfortable\n\nAnd the simplicity of it as well and it's nothing it's not like anything complex so it's almost like ed targeting the subconscious mind is a very powerful you'll be in time to aspect to all this as well the shadow of the ...\nThe ... job and use them the activists left of recent times has been very much based on attacking people calling them names the humanizing them ironic right that anyone has a slightly [noise] right it's located in his own ... and that's something\nRight this is more effective though I think and it's really simplistic and that's what magic is it can be very simplistic can be very complicated times the book is called sorcery the indication of strangeness Thomas shared and the author the guest somebody showed it on tonight you're gonna find out about magic and ...\nAnd all of that is going on around us it's amazing you'll get a whole new life within tonight on ground zero Tripoli
