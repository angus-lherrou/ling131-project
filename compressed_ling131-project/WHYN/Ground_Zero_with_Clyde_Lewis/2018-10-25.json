simultaneously say ... a Trump is in Putin's pocket\nWhile saying he will start a nuclear arms race with Russia maybe they're flipping out over Trump's handling of the show the incident trying to

the message\nAnd it just goes to show you that uh we are not look we're not when the war in Afghanistan my friends and we're not holding the line either in Afghanistan we're losing our area of control is receding\nAnd we think that\nBecause we don't have that many of our soldiers during frontline patrols every day that they're not quite in the same you know they're they're not really in harm's way quite the way that would be at other stages of this war\nBut there's still a threat and if things go really badly then it's going to be all hands on deck so to speak and that means our men and women

even think that it would be part of the mainstream to say\nWhich is gathering from all over that area are banding together\nTo put a curse on Donald Trump it's something more than a binding spell on Donald Trump's cabinet though got the worst of his was a harm spell\nHis was the harm spell\nWe had a cold writer Thomas shared it on the program exist Sherman in the cold writer and he said you know\nHe called us we're on with him he's in Ireland we were talking with him and he says these spells will somehow backfire\nAnd cause harm to America cause harm to the families cause harm to the

taking place there are those who see the material world crumbling with geopolitical tensions that went analyze you know when you analyze them\nThoroughly it would be considered civil war in other countries I mean they say well look at every ... we're on the outside looking into what's going on here we'd say ooh that country's in civil war\nToday I woke up with the news about these suspicious packages that originally contain pipe bombs were sent to the Clintons the Obamas\nAnd to CNN's offices in New York and this happened today after George Soros the yeah the suspected explosive device putting his mailbox\n\nWell this is ... mass hysteria and the news rooms that are predominantly left wing and and and and the the the left wing mouth pieces are simply speaking for the resistance now and it's all Trump's fault\nAgain but this is happening it's got to turn down the rhetoric stop saying the news is fake all these they use the excuse is to just ... I mean the attack is similar to\nThe rice in biological attacks had happened before the Kavanaugh decision was made it is I reported there would be a final blow event\nIt would certainly affect us remember I said that the final blow and I said it would be a biological attack and I was asked to be on the Alex Jones show and I declared there I said it will be a biological attack\nAnd when it happened I was suspicious of it because um it failed and and it didn't\nYou know it was the biological scare day when I was thinking that this would be a trigger that would create copycat attacks\nSo I was asked to go on the uh go up to begin to go into the ... one of the infowars again\nAnd Alex asked me what is next quiet what do you think is going to happen next and I said well we're not going to bend would start a war footing in the United states\nAnd he said I agree I agree\nNotified it'd be tempted bombings and it was sent an email that featured in October third twenty Eighteen article for the Daily Beast and this was the headline said\nKevin are could be the final blow for Democratic Senate everything happening around the issues the final blow is about cabin on Senate war what comes with is asymmetrical these ... symmetrical attempts\nAt a decapitation strike all is it appears to be perpetrated by deep intelligence conspirators within the opposite agencies\nAnd you can call it an inside job if you want but in order declared a false flag which I hear everybody calling it there has to be\nA suspect in order for the accusation mystic but I mean by that is we need to see what they decide or who they decided to bring forward as a suspect in so far there is no suspect which it makes it even more suspicious that this\nUh this is a bad false flag if it if it's a false flag it'll pay it really did happen yes the pipe bombs were sent me didn't blow up any one but I Want to know who they decide dependent on and then we'll know just how keeping\n'em any gaping holes are are in the story there already gaping hole in the story now and I'm sure I'm not some guess on the pointed out we have a a few people that are ... you know well versed in this stuff they're not conspiracy theorists they're very\nImportant people and you'll be hearing from him soon but the final blow issue you know whether or not you know we reached that point now I mean what does happen today I mean like I said you can call them inside job I mean no bombs were detonated it makes the entire attack a bit of political theater in order to create a terrorist bogeyman that\nAttacks the left in order to gain sympathy for the vote and this is what they do and the third world you know they're just in third world countries\nAnd most of the time the suspects are always traced rogue intelligence or rogue military actors I mean like the guy who sent the for the rice and he was from Logan, Utah and I think he was an ex marine but yeah rogue military actors are rogue intelligence actors but do that somebody who was involved with intelligence or military\nOr is usually the suspect they they they choose or they they use a scapegoat or a Patsy\nAnd this is where the false flag starts to ... starts to materialize mean these extra always carried out for what are called decapitation strikes which of course is a military strategy which is aimed at removing the leadership or command and control of what is perceived to be a hospital government or group\nSo it's a tactic of civil war or strategist with the government ... military generals or even political leaders you know if you recall the rice and the tax\nWere aimed at the president and military leaders in the latest bomb attacks are aimed at Democrats who are former leaders\nSo this is a tit for tat exercises his big copycat exercise this is part of the final blow affect it all started back when Kavanaugh was appointed chief justice\nA\nBomb that was sent to Eric Holder ended up being re routed to the return address of Debbie Wasserman Schultz in Florida and there was no package address to her but multiple packages had her address I as a return address on them so\nAh it looks like the CNN package got all the way to the mail room one or more of the package is also contain envelopes that had an unknown white powder inside so not only was there this possibility of of a pipe bomb possibly a more rights than perhaps anthrax who knows\nOr any potential said during a press conference at the device into CNN was a pipe bomb NYPD said the device sent to CNN was a lie of explosive device and the implication is that they that the city and the other devices had the capacity to kill\n\nNone of the devices went off their lethality is not yet been confirmed by bomb technicians we have not heard the lethality of\nOf these so called bombs other pets disclose a drink any of the press conferences exactly what was in the packages they said well it's consistent with the other packages let's just put it that way so we have the investigation is ongoing\nOf\nSo many crazy things have been done a lot of what we call security theater happening I heard something about New York and the national guard being called out why how's that going to prevent the mail from refining its best to teach\nIt it's just I just find it interesting now do you remember back when we were doing the rice and report remember that remember that I was talking about the rice report and how it's going to you know all those people that I said wow this is a biological attack I guess I I I predicted\nAnd I was all over it and I was reporting it there was not really that much of any type of reporting going on in the mainstream\nFrom CNN or or or MSNBC or any group I I Know the Fox was all over because this was an attack on the president\nBut now this has happened to democratic leaders this has got you know this has got the most attention I've ever seen and the truth is is that the rice and was sent to these uh to the mail rooms with these leaders was activity\nCould've poison someone and made\nA few staff members that Ted Cruz's opposite sick\nBut not one of these bombs went off\nSo they were sending a a pipe bomb with the triggering mechanism on it you know they weren't there those those bombs were in there to take anybody out there were there to scare people they were they were they were basically scare type of tools there were there do ah they weren't there to a a kill anyone\n\nAnd uh and so that raises my my eyebrows just a little bit but I also saw the John\nBrennan or ... or bumble oh they they said the bomb below John Brennan time\nWarner CNN ten Columbus Circle New York New York just sit there and apparently all we have are just maybe six stamps there are no post marks on the\nOn the package so I'm Wondering if it was courier hand delivered or what [noise]\nBut um\nHe he just there's so many things that I have to get to tonight to make this a thorough report as one of those situations where\nI wanted to get on with Halloween and uh I'm\nI'm\nI'm committed to getting the story tonight I got gas and everything lined up at the store to you about what's happening what's really happening and what to think about here what this is meaning for all of us so\nFast that you're a high heart radio weekends for each time capsule ground zero week nights at ten on news radio five sixty WHYY end [noise]\nRoss I fought over political to somebody you rent a car they weren't you should put a shallow ideological\nWhat kind of got was\nCapitalism called communism or coming in from just wanting a violent why why am I on for a while can turn on those laws fought out here\nSo we just say All right we're going to do to stop\n... you don't want anything to do like his\nTalking about things in France together point out are some differences because that's how I Am here about\n\nGround zero [noise] um [noise] you know it's really\nTough and it's annoying when you uh read headlines [noise] that ah [noise]\nWell for example let me go here this is a headline I just got a mainstream media blames Trump Alex Jones pipe bomb false flag infowars\nMid term as it's like uh okay I Want to make some things clear and this is why I waited day usually went away to date 'cause I don't want to go anywhere near Halloween with this nonsense I Want to do it on the same day but I Want to say this first and foremost local and federal for it when you look at local and federal authorities here\nThey're investigating this now they have not commented on who who the bomb maker or the bomb makers may be they don't know what their motives would be I mean we can get their motives are\nTrump condemned the X. today the White House was it or not built for CNN no\nBut he did a\nBut the whole lack of evidence the whole mystery I mean there are holes in the script I agree\nBut\nYou know the fringe voices on both ... both right and left make this a prime opportunity for misinformation\nAnd [laughter]\nYou know eight Chen or on the Internet said that something was going to go down in fact they said it was some sort of a plot to stay just shooting at a rally or something like that and that there was some sort of political stunt in the works\nUp and even though you see the media going after chewing on and you go after all these others or you go after a Alex Jones there are a lot of liberal people too and they're they're just as quick to pin the blame on Republicans without knowing anything\nAbout the barbers identity or motives you know I thought wait till you own this GOP every last ugly I oughta but structure of our democracy you oh this this is\nInsanity okay\nOr the other person a Philly uh Philippe rhyme who is actually a Clinton advisor said President Trump visits on you and this is all about due process now think about the rice and attacks\nAnd know condemnation of the rise even though President Trump was the target even with the generals were target\nThere's also some reporter the bomb being sent to the White House there were no bombs in the White House\n\nCNN reported it and then of course CNN being the factual news organization they are we're wrong okay and then of course governor pale and Sarah Palin she shared it wrong so I mean uh nothing happened the home of the president it was all\nThese democratic you know outspoken chicken when they're down types that they've got that stuff\nSo\nThis is the first and foremost thing that I Want to kind of cover as as soon as this is my job I guess to be a conspiracy analysts for misinformation buster\nHey these bombs elopes the bomb scares all that this is going to create a perfect storm for misinformation\nI mean what you get\nAnd then I Am I'm being kind of an an a and and\nDoing some analysis I mean the analysts here what you get as you get breaking news reports and we read from we we've proven is with nine eleven the nine eleven shall we did a while back I wanted to I Want to just kind of reiterate this\nYear breaking news reports which are always riddled with holes there's a lot of unanswered questions there's a lot of a gag and going on where they the gag police officers and FBI\nIn gauge against skirmishes along overlapping edges of their networks everyone has a place in this faction of civil war\nAnd just say it's not a civil war I think you're blind because after the attempted bombing today will be seeing occasional high value terror attacks against soft and hard targets mark my words\nAnd this is going to continue we have bombs going off we have we have a the rice and being sent to leadership soon it will be schools again it will be it'll be neighborhoods\n\nAnd people tell me oh quite well not in a civil war or you don't want I mean this is one civil war is I mean I Lived through one in order to do this civil war [noise]\nIt is\nAnd and it's done with the ... in the guise of oh we we don't know what's going on and what we've got a caravan come and see that look distraction distractions we got to care of incoming oh well we got some bonds being sent to all of our people you\nKnow that this is an attack on the left what about the attack on the president and the generals and the staff and Ted Cruz what about policy what about I mean [noise] Maxine Waters saying when she said [noise]\nI don't know if

Republican from Maine received a suspicious letter and again earlier this month president Donald Trump defense secretary James Mattis and cheaper naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and\nAnd more than a year ago there was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressman during a journey baseball game\nI noticed how I mean this does not seem to register with the media today this is all about being attacked on the on the left\n\nContinued attacks on all political figures from shootings to attempted bombings or part but civil war tactic but it's becoming more and more pervasive means or a tax on the road\nPublic and the intelligence linked to the resistance is using it for sympathy the truth is Democrats are not unique snowflakes they too will suffer the consequences of the civil war that they wanted to perpetuate\nAnd conservatives will also suffer these attacks are happening to a lot more people in the Clintons the Obamas we need to wait to hell up and realize that from the two thousand one anthrax attacks to the Unabomber case is\nUsing the mail or other services to deliver deadly weapons has long been this this ah it's been a frightening history and reality here in the United states anytime things happen like that it's a it's a wake up call\nTo wake up call\nSo tonight I I decided that I think it'd be\nWise to turn some time over to a\nA good friend and informative the program\nWe we uh we had him a on before John ... and he's a veteran law enforcement officer over twenty five years John worked for the U.S Secret Service San Diego police department us been police in the U.S customs service in his capacity within the secret service in Nineteen Seventy four the Nineteen Seventy seven\nHe served for over three years John was

regarding these vitally important issue since Nineteen Ninety five John Kerman welcome to ground zero\n[noise] good to be back blood or are you doing today\nI'm doing great I just uh you know I run into a a a I guess you could call it a quandary a kind of a confusion here because\nYou know when you jump on a story this soon especially something like this that appears to be\nA dare I say in an inside job but it inside players within the intelligence community is responsible for this you know people tend to want to play politics again with this and it's not it's it's an attack on the Republican we've had Republican a leadership being attacked with rice and we've had\nA congressman attempted assassination attempts we've got all these things going on and people are saying well since nobody died it's really not a civil war but no this is this this civil war would you agree\nThat those type of response as you're getting her from the left for educators\nThey're just trying to throw a monkey wrench into your relation you are the four runner and you are the best of the information I talked to and I'm\nTelling you your head and so on line with this stuff that's all they're left to do is to try and you know the people to tell them other responses this stuff has been going on for years I mean I I keep thinking 'cause I was quoted in some other national magazines about a dozen usual this\nSchool year ring a bell yeah a friend of mine area where this goes back\nAnd there's another reporter Gary Webb dead I mean how many hours they kill I say ... you know said riches Gary Webb that's another reporter John ... I mean a copy editor Carroll arrow yeah Danny council narrow he he got killed I mean\nYou did it on the legs this takes me back to the nineties\nWhen I was working closely with Mike roofer LAPD who helped expose John Dory each of the CIA or the excesses of the ... about the cocaine in infiltrated the black communities where the ... freeway Rosner the rapper\nAnd I knew area with I got a picture of me and Maxine Waters in my page on page to cause corruption dot com [laughter] she didn't do anything to help us out really related Feinstein I'm Sorry there's a big D right after each of those names right\nRight right well we're just seeing or just seeing how you know we had the rice in attacks just to just a little while ago and there wasn't that much commotion with the rice and the tax and even at a suspect within you know what a day or all\nYeah yeah the um the um uh miss using my words or the special being rice and beans and it's um\nThe the and it wasn't actually the process account or being you know the castor bean that's right so when they're shoving a tons of castor beans in the mail is like wow really I mean\nLet's say is that this stuff goes back years so if you're part of the stuff like you do and I do and I know rod those you sift through intelligence and information you guys are on top of this stuff and that that's good because that means that\nUh I don't have to explain too much but it's like with all my background and training I mean I was within two or three hundred yards of explosions at the Russian embassy or sixteenth street which is two to three blocks away from the White House of Venezuelan embassy ring a bell yeah yeah and\nAlso outside the White House a couple of times Seventy five Seventy six right around that time frame that was for it and then\nSo are we safe to say is it safe to say that this has all the earmarks of a criminal element within the intelligence operations that allowed this to go down to that was a somehow put together by a a number of aerobics I guess you'd call them rogue agents or I mean I hate to use the word deep say 'cause that's kind of you know innate\nLeft wing left wing Democrat socialist or oh this is what you're saying is that we believe yeah that's what those guys are yeah\nOkay so you're ... so do you believe that that's what this was it was it was basically staged by what ... extreme left group\nYeah they're stressed out they don't have anywhere to throw a little arguments like max saying you know block this ... that they'll let them do this created a crowd or you know why it riot and all of a sudden the stuff that sorry but that's a that's a felony and that's an exciting to riot\nWell do you think though that you know I Know Donald Trump has been also raising the rhetoric and I find it weird that with all the rhetoric has been raised elsewhere immediately be seize upon Donald Trump you know Donald Trump is contributing Hillary Clinton actually contributed to this is why when she said well if you want civility you gotta put Democrats in the Senate\nAnd then Donald Trump said well if Republicans don't mean to say that there will be violence so you have the president saying there'll be violence you have a you know who the one who wanted to be president saying that there would be violence in the balance will continue until they get what we want\nNow we have bombs being sent to people I mean it's like why don't we get the equal opportunity to everybody that's in signing the violence and and actually encouraging it\nRight and they've had assassinations already already brought up Seth Rich I'm very familiar I was working on something on that that I'm not going to talk about\nUm there was some other cases where people were assassinated and um it's all tied in with the shooting at the ball or ISI says a thing so all these things are excited but when they talk about violence and things like that there is a philosophy from the left that\nIt's okay to lose if the communist philosophy it's okay to lose half of your country or half of your population as long as you with\nJohn Carmen with us on ground zero for the you know the former Secret Service us Secret Service or customs us when police or has background he also served a President Ford under President Ford and President Carter\nUm he also are protected the vice president and his family first family and the president and and I can comment on what happened with these bombs that were sent to a number of a democratic leaders Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Lewis Ulysses ground zero and we'll be\nBack W.

was still monitoring as we go this is a ongoing road you know I mean these people are doing stuff to aggravate and then so any mention of because of the midterms and they're doing it right before the midterms and then that's going to activate something that the President Trump may or may not do\nSo it's all good you know we've had rioting and all these and these are groups and so you know hey Soros rioters really you know you know when did you ever hear about stuff like that in the fifties or sixties hey right\nNow the question I have to is is that wasn't it always ... situation where\nI guess so roses addresses kind of private no one really knows where he lives\nAnd yet they're able yeah onto his house I I always wondered about that because you know I guess maybe his addresses common knowledge but I'd never really knew anything about George ... these kind of like that phantom and then when he gets a bumped into him doing sit right to his mailbox I'm thinking All right that's interesting\nAnd I'm sure somebody Google that right yeah I mean ... can you really get that easy to get\nSomebody address like joined sources address\nThat depends on how he touches your permission because most of those people don't even have a real regular address\nUm I used to represent bodyguard work for a movie stars and stuff like that they usually go through their attorney so if you look

is\nGiven a law chances are came from the until community to cause the false flag incident so that they use it for targeted I haven't heard anybody Republicans target of you\nKnow but that was done with the rice and the fact that it was a rumor and it was a rumor that the president got bumped into him but that was immediately taken at CNN actually reported that and uh they made a mistake there was no bumps into the White House\nWell which one I mean the president gets tons of stuff they don't want you to know about\nReady to have been proven didn't ... didn't he get bumped into him\nWhile ago while comic of course\nI I ... through and actually had an assassination attempt across the street where else that's part of our training and there was a least one White House police officers

your workload but what if there were a business degree that further your career and give you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule\nIgnored negated it's been abused it's been misinterpreted but ... yeah the constitution is what we\nUse as our cornerstone of law and order in this country\n\nWe trust our system of government enough that we abide by its outcomes even though we may disagree with that\nIt's always been the case Americans even if they disagreed with ... with the government\nOr a a form of government or something going on a government disagree they bring their differences to light a boat they use constitutional law we use law and order which is based on a constitution but solid\nFor centuries\nNearly centuries almost two centuries\nBut\nMore than two centuries actually yeah more than two centuries with over\nNow we've had disagreements in the past and that's something that this country does it we have a debate and we have conversations we talk we have dialogue\nHopefully dialogue with his balanced and ah and and that's something I think we're lacking right now I mean we're writing off people because we disagree with him and that's nonsense\nIn Eighteen sixty one\nThere's only one time in our history and Eighteen sixty one where\n\nWe distrust of the systems so much that we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil I don't know if we decided the civil war broke out because we didn't agree with such a disagreement about how our system was run we have a ... we had a civil war\nThere was so much instability at that time but civil war broke out it wasn't declared it broke out there were divisions on on a on frontline there were a you know border divisions and things of that nature it was clear cut it short of civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability\nIs increasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\n\nBut I Know it's difficult to see that the civil war is happening because we always thought it would be an armed conflict that one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pulp and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country\nWhen he established with a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration\nHas proposed by none other than John McCain who now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we will be shooting other Americans every day with the police will be forced to shoot Americans every day we're martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment the symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed by the majority of the people\nAnd most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but be ... be declared the aftermath\n\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military\nHad identified illustrated the point by point sign post\nAs to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on\nContemporary standards not the standards of the Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there are major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned and and and actually executed by those in the deep state against President Kennedy\n\nBut a new civil war in America look something like this according to\nMilitary planners number one the country would be in Princeton national polarization with no obvious meeting place for resolution\nNumber two\nThere would be increasingly divisive press coverage and information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\nNumber three there will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimacy and the illegitimate evasion of violence\nTo solve any and all disputes\nNow I Know that that's pretty damning to actually point all these out\nAnd of course we have been analyzing and speculating about deep state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told us conspiracy analyst that this is a an invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shuttle governor has always been the dark command that leads from the shadows\nBut it needs to be clear here\nWhile we're looking under rocks for false why ... why we're having these disputes\nAnd the symptoms of war here in the United states be effected working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs it'll moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins Republican from Maine received a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump defense secretary James Mattis and chief of naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and and more\nClick right now between America and there'd be American shooting Americans well I mean American shoot Americans every day or Chicago or it seems
