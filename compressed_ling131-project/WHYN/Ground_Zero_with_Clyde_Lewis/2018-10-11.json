ago really in terms of our day to day needs and and all of that um but that does not necessarily make somebody happy does not make them feel hole and happiness is not just about\nPleasure that's

S. for myself I was looking at the footage but I didn't see the UFO I saw whites but I don't know what you call that something that's outer space but you know\nI guess if the person you know when they heard the bike you show said well you know you hear the UFOs supposed to be seen and that was what Carol David Davis was saying\nIt would be a UFO that would seem to be at three o'clock in the evening east coast time so I don't know um I don't know if that counts you know like I told some of that so you're sixty percent of the time I think the cubes right you know the times I don't know but uh you know it just depends on you know if you can really understanding here\nWhat's being said and so you know unless you use something like that but then again it's still specious as to what you're getting and like I said a lot of ... indirect methods to contact or at least try to find a\nSigns of intelligent life ... ... there's also the small problem of not knowing exactly what to look for\nAnd I think you know while we've had many people saying well this is what you're supposed to look for these are many UFO researchers and writers that of take it upon themselves to the researchers and writers scientists are going to we don't know exactly what we're looking for\nSo they're arguing over synthetic lives are arguing over extraterrestrial biological life they're arguing over small celled organisms are arguing over aquatic life maybe like on cell it is or you know\nOther uh ice planets are icy moons like hop in Star Wars if intelligent life does exist beyond our solar system\nI've always wondered well okay you want to communicate with alien well how are they going to communicate with us I mean a would they even communicate like we do I mean would they use radio transmitters that use other forms of technology to communicate I'm probably not\nAnd while people say well they shouldn't be advanced enough to know our language not necessarily I mean there are plenty of\nSmart or intellectually advanced human beings who don't speak the language you speak and sometimes we if they don't speak our language are misconstrued is being not as smart and that and that was one of the problems I had\nWhen I was learning a foreign language and uh you know as a young kid and I was like you know I was learning a language but I forgot but you know when I'm listening to someone else speak English from a different country you know they're trying to speak the language\nAnd sometimes we say well listen to them the way they speak they they don't know language enough so we we misinterpret that is not being very smart but the truth the matter is that the fact that he can foreigners that they can even formed sentences the fact that they can even formed sentences that are even intelligible makes them intelligent\nIt's like the argument over whether or not millennia Trump was smart or whether or not being an underwear model major stupid and they were comparing and Michelle Obama and I thought well God you know yeah I'm a shell has her good points uh and she's pretty smart but then they said no millennia Trump's stoop and they wait wait wait wait wait she speaks like what eight different languages\nAnd uh you know it's so ... I don't know how many that that Michelle Obama speaks but come on I mean if a person can speak that many languages are really smart and if they're able to keep track of those languages they're pretty smart in fact I envy producers he speaks Mandarin Chinese\nHe speaks ... I Would love to learn how to speak Mandarin Chinese because then I'd be able to say I speak English I speak Spanish and I speak Mandarin Chinese\nThe three languages that most people should learn if they want to get ahead in business only got two of them Spanish and English\nAnd Spanish is the language of labor or English and Mandarin will be the language big business because we all know the future we all know where China is in our future so Mandarin Chinese baby\nGotta learn Mandarin so you can get around and you know order things on the menu other than general ... chicken so that sets important of course if you want to be in business but see that's the thing you know communicating with alien so that's a bigger deal\nDoing human language of the of of other people's air on this planet ancient languages would be difficult I don't know if anybody speaks aromatic\nI'm a you know\nMade up languages I guess that's Broncos made up we're going on is made up and you can still be going on in Esperanto but are using radio transmitters using other things are lights signals hell even smoke signals these are a ways of\nCommunicating and so\nThis seems to be what the preoccupation is right now [noise] I mean it used to\nBe well we want proven aliens arrived we want them to land on the White House lawn well Sadie and Medi\nHorse to search for extraterrestrial intelligence and Medi messaging extraterrestrial intelligence international these groups are don't care aliens on on the White House\nThey want to be able to get a signal a techno signature they won't be able to get something\nThat can prove that they're out they're communicating they they and and believe me or I'm going to tell you this today I was looking over notes and what prompted me to do this show tonight was an article in business insider\nOkay Business Insider talking about what we were talking about you nights ago\nWith regard to extraterrestrials with regards to um the numbers with regard to techno signatures with regard to listening for the communication looking up at the sky seeing whatever it is it's out there keeping your mind open looking for extraterrestrials in space\nOr looking for a you know that moment you know we should be looking for those moments because those moments are happening more than we realize\nLast night there was a um\nThere was a a huge media I guess the crash in a place called ...

are the reports are now you know making me wonder if [noise]\nYou know all this preoccupation about contact and all this preoccupation about aliens speaking to us [noise]\nIf this isn't just an indication that they found something they're confident they found something and they're just waiting for the way to tell us the truth about it\nAnd I'll tell you more about that coming on Tripoli six

to pay and you're even getting up at night to go this is not okay\nListen the makers of super beta prostate the number one prostate formula are introducing a new wonder pill super beta prostate piece three and vast with three key ingredients that are great for your prostate it's like taking three prostate supplements in one to celebrate we're sending free bottles to men who want to cut down on bathroom trips yes you're\nMay no they don't necessarily I think demonstrate that but they took years to come up with the idea on how to communicate with the alien\nAnd we've been shown up various ways that the aliens would make contact with us and uh most of what we see in films are like ... you know we see this radar blip you know what is it oh it'd be aliens trying to talk or we have found signals that can be a\nDecoded by the magic of computer tech and mathematics remembering contact\nThey had been scraping noise\nAnd when they were able to do that because of scraping noise it sent back a video clip of the Olympics and they saw Hitler and everybody panicked and and ah because they didn't know that was what they were getting was one of the first television program\nIt was broadcast and ah this is what they saw and they send it back but it was saying oh they're not Caesar's based on the though my God I thought that was pretty I I thought it was pretty scary actually me to think that you know the aliens first signals send back to assert or signals from the you know German Olympics\nThe Nineteen thirties so I mean\nWe show in various ways ah the aliens can talk to us through mathematics computer tech as well speaking through a computer or this is another way that we've always imagined see this is where our imaginations limited especially now when apparently something has happened\nWe're both SETI enmity are beginning to act as though they are located something in space but they're not capable of explaining it to the public I get that feeling I don't know if you get that feeling but I get that feeling I get the feeling\nThat after their ah techno signatures workshop in Texas\nI get the feeling that after a members of the group like such shows back in and are they going to Jill Tarter but he said well you know they bet in Irvine, California and they said we ... we need to rethink our position here as a\nAs astronomers and scientists and those who wanted to find communication we may have it already\nBut we have in the form of technological signatures we don't have in fact we don't have aliens chirping at us from another planet we don't have signals coming from the planet we have fast radio burst that are big flashes of light that come in that could be\nYou know from spaceships they're saying alien spaceship could produce vast radio birds but there's something else though or something else we touched on a few few days ago or maybe in a week ago you've ah from what I've been reading lately but take notice things you're clues are far more advanced\nAs we've been told we also maybe under the control of some of these techno signatures of the human ear as picked up on the signal that they say maybe this was creepy okay\nThere are indications I don't want to panic you but there are indications that the aliens have been sending signals\nAnd only certain people have picked up on them because they're so faint or they they're they're they're buried in the noise of the cities\nAnd sometimes when you went in the mountains or got in the desert you can hear these signals being sent and some people are far more acute they ... they ... and they're able to hear these sounds and their ... okay um [noise]\nAnd this is where it gets weird because it makes you wonder if the aliens have been sending a some sort of a sonic sound you know like those horns those angel horns we've been hearing well yeah they said that they were solar storms and maybe they were the result of sort of storms or maybe kind of a funder caused by a ... a ...\nBut it's also the theory that these are sounds\nThat are being picked up by the human ear that are actually part of these waves that they'd been detecting over the planet and only certain people can hear them in some of them have even been recorded [noise] so we got a few recordings story tonight and these are really eerie because I'm sure many of you've heard the sounds of thought [noise]\nRadio by the way you know I [noise]\nI'm not no no no no no no no I have here in front of me this morning [laughter] right [laughter] Hi\nThis is [laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nWhy why\nWouldn't you love\nMake other civilizations\nOn [laughter] [laughter] [laughter]\nAnd a lot of friends found her hair all around and go oh there are more corn or even for his last\nOur our painting says all serious [noise]\nYeah [noise] yeah\nNumbers but I sure will eat six seven three thirty seven hundred shoveling the Seventy three thirty seven hundred\nShow for when I've been reading lately [noise]\nTechno sick it's your clues are far more advanced so we've been told\nOkay and uh [noise]\nMaybe under the control of some of these signals signatures because the human ear has picked up on the signal and unbeknownst to most people it's affecting them a different way\nOkay now that's that's pretty huge now there's no need to panic but there is a cause for concern because we don't know who are being exposed to the sound and those were really listening for the men as I said many people just got it right up tonight is or something else\nTreat is the universe he's a Washington extraterrestrial signals that we cannot even perceive or know about it unless someone else here's the wants to show you that they're here\nNow the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and and and the uh\nYou know sending of extraterrestrial intelligence that many practitioners although it's been a lot of time wondering how these messages are being transmitted and they're hoping they can find the shores before more people pick up on the sounds but at the moment are buried in the background of your noise\nYeah here's a little secret some people already hearing pulse heat waves that are hovering above us\nAnd for those if you did it hurt it I'll describe it deceive vibrating low um which is usually hurt\nAway from the city enforce deserts and are there a turtle over the world\nOkay so\n\nRecently there was a story out of sweeten where there was a mysterious humming ... it was recorded sound was a constant pulsing hum according to witnesses lasted forty five minute\nEerie scene was filmed by a man named Renee ...\nBack in December but only recently did he catch the attention of paranormal investigator according to the world are witness Mr ...\nNoticed he basically noticed that there was this odd sound in northern Sweden he said that he was after snowstorm big snowstorm covered mountain top beautiful area quiet morning\nAnd get pretty ski it said this is really says that the humming noise was constant and seemed to almost by breathing the air above me\nAlthough he expressed certainty that the harm was coming from the sky ... conceded that he couldn't quite determined from which direction was emanating from as it appeared to be coming from every direction in the sky above me also noted the he had visited location before\nAnd that it's unusually very quiet there which was weird because that home could be hurting a quiet area which made the ... it would just be the more mystifying for him and he's you know what it what\nYou said that after about an hour you said the noise dissipated exhibit a move somewhere else\nYeah how\nMany of you probably if your Internet uh ... it probably already heard that song because it's it's making the rounds cause it's an amazing sound especially when it's out in the middle of nowhere in in the snow in in northern sweet\nSo here is that sound it is a pulse wave sound that came from out of nowhere and or will explain more about this pulse wave sound in what might be going not listen to this or we go\n[noise]\n\nAnd it sounds it sounds almost the same right it sounds the same uh but you know they see something that sounds like a large diesel motor rubbing up and then of course taking off but he said it's just you know so compelling\nHere these officers you know\nYou know talking with one another\nAbout what they're experiencing what they're seeing\nNothing was said during these to Homs because they just wanted everybody get the feeling of the home I'm sure they didn't want to say anything I mean there is a sequence if you look up the video up on the Internet there is a sequence where you hear a snowmobile go by which I think ruins the mood\nBut I mean uh I'm sure the guy is still a bill didn't care that the guy was doing when he was doing their own civil bill's really didn't hear it but in the quiet do you really can't hear that rumble and you'll be hearing rumbling in the sky [noise]\nSo uh so this is where you know we have to wonder what are these rumbles we have to know what are these sounds you know these are signals being sent to us from space are they extraterrestrial aircraft\nOr the something else I mean look [noise] they ... they were saying ah just recently the aliens can be trying to contact us by other means [noise] and I would say that ah [noise] what's going on right now is the city is setting us up ... up\nThey are setting us up for a yes\n... up on the other day a week this setting us up I think for disclosure or at least\nTo tell us we have detected something but they do not know how to report it\nNor do they know how to identify it [noise] but yet the sounds are skipping in these little rumbles these horn sounds all this stuff happening [noise] makes you wonder if they're all connected Tripoli success at three thirty seven hundred will be back [noise]\nW.

why oh why oh yeah\nI get what I think so you didn't think it was an alien or anything to do when you first saw\nNow I Know that's good old Tyler how old are you know you're almost ten was\nThat your first fireball you've ever seen have you seen it before\nIt was one twenty\nWhile what'd you in and that's an amazing thing you first big of a firework men when you see it explode and you go wait a

thought oh my God this is a big fireball gonna hit the planet and we were gone we're Garner's\nSo that's good you're still around to talk about you'd be able to tell everybody about oh did you make a

appreciate it\nHorrible storm passes overhead\nAnd so it was my little shot up tonight's all the people there in Florida and Georgia\nPlaces being affected by hurricane Michael\nSo anyway so what we were talking about today let me just to get back to what we're talking about night so I Am really I'm fascinated here and that are not going to let up until I get to the bottom is okay I'm\nFascinated by the comments coming out of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and a messaging extraterrestrial intelligence that city in ... and they're beginning to act as though they located some okay they're not telling us they've located something that I've had several meetings one in California University of California\nIrvine they had a workshop in Texas just a few weeks ago on how to identify technical signatures\nIn space it's one of the reasons why we brought the black Cuban skull on because we wanted to talk about this techno signatures maybe some people be out there we can pick up on low frequency higher frequency whatever\nSo\nWe have to look at various ways\nAnd aliens would be able to make contact with us or how we make contact with that money on this program as well I mean not just the black you but we've also at times even run brought this up we've used it to reduce\nWe blow into did reduce and we'd blow them over the over the air blow they did reduce over the air so in hopes that the signal would go out on all the radios all over the country and all the signals all over the country we send this huge orange found this ancient sound\nI'm sure aliens would understand and listened to\n\nAnd uh you know and and nights we do this we've had like UFO sightings you had all kinds of cool things going on just last night we had a a a huge fireball come down out of the sky silent Oregon in Lincoln county uh people were telling you about it or we just got\nTired and Jeremiah calling the program the last are saying that they thought that was the only guy reported it and they saw they wonder if anybody else side\nAnd apparently it had an impact little bit of boom there\nBut see I've been reading a lot of things lately about this whole techno signature clues stuff and for more advanced uh you know what they're looking for more advanced civilizations using these take the signatures well\nI also was reading that there are some people that are that are believing that uh that there's more to it than just listening for the techno signatures and that we may be\nUnder the control of some of these techno signatures as a human ears picked up on the signals and unbeknownst to most people it's affecting them in different ways so far there's been no need to panic because they don't know what is how the sequels affecting people but it certainly is affecting people in the truth is\nThat there are plenty of extraterrestrial signals out there the world the whole universe is a Washington extraterrestrial signals that we can't even perceive\nOr do you even know about unless someone else hears them and basically says listen that you hear that that's what we're looking at right now the and so city and many\nThe guys that run the city and met he spent a lot of time wondering how these messages are being transmitted they're hoping they can find the source before more people pick up on that sound at the moment they you know because they've married actually buried in the\nBackground of earth noise but uh\nLike I said some people were already hearing his pulsing sound I recently there was a a story out of Sweden where a mysterious humming sound

in your ground zero\nHigh high\nUp on this topic very interesting and um so I did a little research on it it was understanding that you know neutrino generally just pay right during my research I found out they were getting neutrino from a number or a ...\nLaw that shouldn't have to do it well\nAnd and there are no Nineteen eighty seven eight mhm and and\nAnd and the fact that neutrino or detectors have to be buried so very very deep and the ground and they have to be extremely large or what where are where it came to my attention is this has been in Arkansas where are you know at the poll\nA media right in in media or they're they're all they're they're found very easily and and it's commonplace to find things that just fall who stay in in that and touch region of our planet right um so ... you know it came to my a lot of tension that what\nWhile they were building this neutrino detectors that that has to be so deep in the ground so large that they ran across something they found something that lady shouldn't have been ... you know ... and and and that may explain these new I'm\nA microorganism will see that you know in my ... from from whatever they may have filed was building there's detectors or the question is what is the ball out\nWhy does it go against the the uh what do you call the classic model beast go against everything the classic model opera so you're right not son particles\nHe's aren't new part these aren't these are not neutrinos from the sun these neutrinos from perhaps the quasars something else these neutrinos from or what we call break off\nFrom any kind of I guess nuclear fuel or anything it would be similar to nuclear fuel so this is it is it's something that doesn't belong on this planet is being ... for the in order to get into space\nExactly because you know neutrinos generally follow one path and um the majority of them\nWas perpendicular throughout pointed and we're finding they're detecting large numbers of these\nAre coming from the poll you know they're they're they're\nThey're a bit odd out you know make a magnetic field or or whatever even affect the trajectory of the report right and ... and you know\nIt it is really concerns me 'cause we're you know\n... ... ... is detected out to be buried deep underground in meal with a water\nAnd in in order to it you know to detect neutrinos that large numbers of them it has to bounce off a particle right ... ... a heavy water 'em out right and it ... when it hits that he'd be water molecule it creates a flash\nThat that the detector can detect and that's how they detected neutrinos now while they're building this incredibly large apparatus this you know this isn't used they train our detectors are not quite well you're not quite as wide Leno as the uh ... hey a drawn a collider right and these bills things are\nMild twenty miles law in input come at least the taping neutrino detectors they're not quite as large right but they are in the vicinity of\nAt gargantuan nature and when they're taking down into their eyes that has not been sister or hundreds of thousands of years I mean\nI'm we made they look they may have found a a a a thing literally yeah like the movie yes they moved around a thing as it ended in and and they could open our planet up something we're not ready to him\nAnd they and that's why they had to bring down a Russian Orthodox a patriarch a president ...\nAll the all these ... all of these I'm a\nPublic figure in and politicians in and scientists to look for what you know it it it's scary\nCome really come see what we discovered come see the alien that we've discovered come see the the the creature that lives on\nPractically nothing lives on Aaron sunshine doesn't live on any food lives in harsh conditions and look what is putting up putting off neutrinos that are not the classic model sending a signal out into space and then we're getting a signal back and this is why we're so concerned about ... technical signatures SETI\nThey could just do the microorganism whatever they found carry you know we carry microorganism bacteria or in our bodies\nAre foreigner just to live just for us to survive you know a
