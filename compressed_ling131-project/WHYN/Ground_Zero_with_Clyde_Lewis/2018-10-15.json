uh it was very good but I Love since the queen city I Love the queen city\nLet's talk about what happened today with a pastor Brunson yeah major accomplishment you're like the hostage receiving president all over the world they're coming in how important was or to get back this religious leader who was being persecuted in Turkey\nWell he is that he's a great religious leader and who was a you know they accused him of things that he didn't do\nWell we got him back and we got back I uh we got back many people actually if you look at it as like seems like all the time we're bringing back people and ah I Know President Obama pay one point eight billion for nothing to bring back a few people from around one point eight billion\nAnd uh we got him back and he's going to be safe for short leaves in the air just he literally just took off\nAnd he'll be in the office he'll be in the oval office big welcome a big welcome yeah you know evangelical Christians everybody everybody wanted a back what happened to them was incredible and he was held hostage but now he's a he's going to be happy I'm sure he's very happy\nRight now about your wife is that you have to Africa sure which is unbelievable what happened there talk about what was the goal in what was accomplished with Maloney in Africa\nWell she's a terrific first lady and the great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much\nAbout it some very good stuff but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live and she made for substance you also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special\nBut uh and the poverty is incredible the level of poverty it was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful\nThey loved her and she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they needed it's not a question of it's not a question of defense it's not a question of it it's just such on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a bill she really\nHad a big impact on me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deals probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that caused Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea to kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat us\nWhat did you do with the trade deal and we're also the piggy bank that everybody wants to come and then Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told her look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and frankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and\nWe made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us\nBecause NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know the better the nominee you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out I don't know what they were thinking so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused\nSo we call it the U.S MCA and its works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe were unable to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they're very happy with I Hope everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just made a deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a a much improved approved deal you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton do you remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty thousand jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty\nIt was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea\nSo how many jobs and talking to my Everytime I cannot Mexico we talking about a million\nWas you're talking about millions of jobs for attention don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally closed or not if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent tariff people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent tariff they make a big deal of they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada and\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which of absolutely taken advantage of our country and the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we how can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they are they're very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "year":
