I like the fact that they're finding these wonder as things in space right now but what I don't like when I have is they're not talking about it enough on the news no they're not\n\nIn fact the truth about what is out there\nAnd the seriousness of the seriousness of what is coming sounds even more outrageous because the corporate media will not touch the stories and so we're experiencing a sort of self imposed cover up based on political interests in division\nYou want to know what's hard I'll tell you what's hard see for the past week came I mean every once in a while this happens in the ...

clippings services a news outlets to provide inspiration for many of the topics on my program have now been brought to the forefront and the topic of conspiracy\nOkay not a theory not conspiracy theory not a theory of conspiracy or a hypothesis but conspiracy\n\nOkay now I Hope I'm not confusing because conspiracy theory is a theory about a conspiracy meaning there is a there are groups that are conspiring to make something happen to the conspiring to cover up something okay that's the theory you have no proof\nOf circumstantial evidence of the theory but you don't have proof\nBut see this is a conspiracy theory I'm Talking about it's it's a bona fide proven conspiracy being put forward by the world's leaders and of course our leaders\nHave now decided that a lack of civility is the option\nGetting what they want and that is control of the country we are witnessing the collaborative process organized by conspirators to solidify a coordinated active insurrection\nIn order to meet the political goal\nAmerica's politicians of both parties want to use the power of government to silence\nTheir enemies it sounds to vote some of the university community seek to drive it from their campuses and an entire generation of Americans are being taught the free speech she'd be curtailed issues it make someone else feel\nUncomfortable\nOn the current trajectory our nation's dynamic marketplace of ideas will soon be replaced by either disengaged intellectual silos\nOr even a stagnant ideological conformity ... says the goal\n... the masses take away all of its uncomfortable all of its inconvenient\nNothing nothing to make the mind reach out keep bet rigid thinking coming because the rigid thinking is what they want they want us all to be ignorant they want to be [noise]\nI don't know what does okay and and I mean the New York post agreed with me yesterday and was most disconcerting is while the media will say that Trump's words are to be expected they failed to expound upon the comment that Hillary Clinton made no one not even an interviewer stop and asked her\nWhat she was saying could be considered reckless or fueling the fire it was already started consequences be damned civil war has to happen in order to take over the Senate that's what\nThat's what I got from both of them\nTrump says violence if we lose Hillary Clinton says violence until we win\nNow what should we do what should we do how are we supposed to vote either way we're screwed right he this is a quagmire\nThis this this is a quagmire this we're we have two leaders okay\nAnd and Hillary Clinton's leader I don't care what you say she's the leader of a group of people ... she's the leader of the resistance OK she says we will not be civil until we when Trump says if you when they are the the the Republicans won't be filled\n... we're at war with ourselves\nAnd the mob namely those who have been attacking politicians namely those who've been you know creating the road road blocks okay ... those who have been pounding on the doors of Congress during the cabinet on hearing\nAll of this mob mentality is is right now being contain but one day it won't be contain gay and one day the mob will rule the mob is ruling are already you have two people that should know better\nBecause what they're doing now is they're meddling in our own election meddling OK Hillary Clinton is meddling Donald Trump is meddling they're both meddling and they're giving threats of violence if it doesn't go their way [noise]\nThis is what is terrifying okay this is why I say civil war

causing the fact that we're already in one and while no one will attribute school shootings to beat the gate shootings Las Vegas attacks the symptoms of civil war in progress our leaders both left and right now is that violence will be an inevitability in this country after the after the November election\n\nPresident Trump warned that there will be violence if the Republican Party loses the November's midterm elections and he stated that the rights of the American people were under threat from violent people\nAnd I'm sure he mentioned he did mention that they were on the on the left many people have told me the left or violent quiet you gotta start talking about how the left or violent yes they are violent I've seen it myself here in my own home town I seen it all over the country now

with each other then I'll Try to destroy each other\nWell certainly I Would love to see us return to civility listening to one another or working out our differences that is not the Republican Party that exist today and that is certainly not the administration that we have in power right now\nWhen the Republican Senate\nDenied the right of President Obama for had his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland a Kurd\nI think anything that they stole a justice from the ...\nI think they did I mean to keep it from the court said open for a year or to deny distinguished Jared they could have voted down they could have said well for ideological reasons philosophical reason that we're not going to vote for him but no they fell in love\nAnd that was such a breach or an ethic and the

there a black bloc okay that I didn't call to talk about any phone\nWhat has been done by Hillary\nIn the service of whoever's putting out the black box and all the other thing is a lot more insidious than simply saying we cannot be violent anymore we have to be violent now that's not what she said remember that most you you prove this the other night when\nYou did your show that\nMost Americans have no idea what the word civil war means it does not mean a civil war\nNo not necessarily all means no not necessarily not at all civil mean state Sable civil means within the state or city or something else it it means it means within state instead of with other states\nThat is what civil war means nothing to do is civility nothing however\n\nThe exact opposite\nOf go do a the pilots that the civil what she did no one is realizing is they use of the word civil\nSuggesting exactly the opposite of what she is saying she's calling on all the people who don't understand what civil war means and using that word as a seat it's a dog whistle\nIt's so subtle that you didn't pick up on it\nWow\nShe all she had was dropped that word because it confuses too many people and that way she's not saying anything that she's not inciting any violence she's just saying I'm don't be nice but\nShe's using that word because we don't understand it and it has a lot of connotations that we don't even understand\nBut in that case then she's going to have a backfire on her\nWhen you agree what do you mean well I mean if she was too if it was a dog whistle and and you've seen or how you know people have acted towards a conservatives you've seen you know like Ted Cruz being harassed I'm not ... you know\nI'm I'm not sure she knows what she did I'm not sure she goes and she said I think somebody encouraged her to say that\nWell but it's obviously got the New York post printing out newspapers said during the Clinton just declared civil war\nThat's right that Hillary doesn't doesn't control the post no the post controls Hillary them media controls Hillary and media controls Trump because the media is controlled by those who want the civil war and the media doesn't know it\n...
