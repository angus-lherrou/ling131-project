you just think about\nWhat is happening now\nAnd we're always in the short term thinking when it should be expedient but we think in the long term because pretty soon\nWe're we're going to end up\nWith a lack of strategic caution and with a with a like a strategic caution someone's going to step in\n\nAnd they're going to recreate everything that we worked for\nAnd that's the sad

long as the money keeps going into these news programs that are long as the the the the scandal and everything keeps everybody divided\n\nWe're going to see some very ugly things transpire if we

at first I was getting the fatigue from Russian meddling now I'm getting fatigue from he said she said\nAnd so\nMany times we've asked the question why do they hate us well why do we heat ourselves why do we have are still so much that we have no knowledge or sense of history\nOr even a sense of the future that what happens as far more relevant questions\nAs to what's happening and what we'll be happening\nAnd how complacent some of us a bit and how we don't even think that there are other things going on\nBut deserve our attention\nBut we desire a different reality we desire the reality that they're giving us every night on the nightly news\nThis is a gamble it's a gamble on the spirituality of this nation okay\nAnd we're going to see so many dirty secrets in the future being a thrown out

younger generation\nBathroom pick on millennials\nI mean many people between the ages of forty five and sixty five of dealt with millennials in the workforce and have a hard time understanding how they tick but I I think it's time to start looking at the next\nGeneration\nI mean the millennials are establishing themselves now okay calmed down about millennials I Want to start talking to a generation Z\nGeneration Z they were born\nProximity between Nineteen Ninety five and twenty four team pay that includes my step son\nMy other son's millennial when he's pretty well established

one\nThey're very adept at communication on social media tech savvy they've always had a high speed Internet always they won't remember a time where we had the low Internet\nIt could be could be quick

desktop and tablet most of them started working on a tablet at age to\n\n... they were just searching among them for different purposes\n\nAs a comparison millennials used three screens on average I'd say my generation uses to that is if they were introduced to the Internet and they do have a phone\nSo it'd be a phone and maybe a laptop and you have your laptop at work or you have a laptop at home and you use it for who knows what\n\nAnd then if you want to count the TV screen it when you sit in front of the TV and veggie occasionally I just watch cartoons usually or science fiction really bad

talked about the ... project with which is another nano technology type of project and\nNano domestic Quayle was was something that we were talking about in the theory in the in the deliverance of the of the notion in the energy classified statements and we said well look barren hurt but hey everybody has them everybody has picked up on them\nAnd of course a lot to that said well and everybody knows that this nano particulate is actually connected to more gallons and I'm a Brad Olson called the program who's a writer and he said he has had more gallons or has more gallons\nHe said that everyone can be tested for it and we all have their their propensity to develop is because of the nano particles that are in our body\n\nAnd man I'll tell you people were like going this is nonsense as a pseudo science this is crazy and now Julian Assange\nHe said that he made this he made the statement before he's he's last this was this was his last broadcast that he said before and we don't know what's going on with Julian Assange right now\nJust today\nWell I don't know if I have time to get right into it but uh it was funny because ah today as I was looking over some of the reports and in the in the clip service I go in every day and they check out the clip service don't these reports have links all kinds of stuff in the stuff that I use the stuff that I don't use\nBut I always have to see things in a follow up senses I talked about the beginning of the program the blowback of course there's always blow back to some of this stuff but when you're talking about in all blows back\nAnd you have to say well look this is this is how it is now before we were talking about if you were like God\nMatt and now it's like this is the real deal people smart cities uh they're they're saying well we have trillions without one trillion sensors that we have to put in place by the you're twenty twenty\nThe FCC saying you got six Ninety Days to start figuring out how we're going in so smart city networks in your part of the woods\nAnd you got to do it quick because if you don't we're going to go in and do it for you\nSo let's roll control spectrum is gonna be mandatory by twenty twenty or at least moving into twenty thirty\nRight\nAnd so the FCC say it's got to be done it's got to be done it's got to be done and people are gonna be moving like crazy and of course you're going to have to pay for this installment of his new matrix of surveillance matrix they want to put in there but how are they going to have all those sensors\nHow they had him put trillions of sensors in place by twenty twenty that's a lot\nBecause that's a lot of sensors to put in by but within two years or even less than two years\nSo how do they how how do they fix that problem evil intelligent dust that's the way they do it it's\nEasier to drop trillions of nano particles\nThe size of a grain of sand or a grain of salt and they can do it in that less amount of time I'm sure they're reporting sensors in that are bigger and and and more capable and and fiber optic and all this stuff that could put that in\nAnd yeah being restructure is going to change and yeah the matrix of all things are going to change your city of tomorrow weights but while they're still trying to get things settled while they're trying to get the antennas in place for five gee they will dust off\nIf they
