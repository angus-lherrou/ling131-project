to be lazy wow we have a lot of emails in here OK sorry sorry guys or if I'm going to be on the official team bucked at Gmail\nDot com is the is the box that we use here so visual team bucket you know the comedy like email\nA shark Wright's book\nDo you remember the scene in Minority Report after Cruz shoots the child predator the FBI agent is looking at all the evidence in the bedroom and says that it is an incredible amount so we have this bomber with an incredible amount of evidence inner ponds and plenty of DNA fingerprinting serial numbers all set up in the same area\nIn one state in one county\nPossibly one city did it come with a are you here assigned to him I just paranoid or is this way too much good luck Chuck Chuck ah I've never seen Minority Report so I Can't speak to that part I Know right parked in the Minority Report kind of weird can't speak to that\nBut um I'll give it some thought here we go Kyle Wright's book random question for a poll\nWhat if God Forbid remember this coming to us from official team bucket Gmail dot com or what if God Forbid there was another attack like nine eleven\nWill be do the whole Iraq invasion thing again to another country trying to hunt the perpetrators in their home country or not walk but basically what would be our response in this day and age I'm curious because the whole side of situation so let me know um\nIf there was another nine eleven would we hunt them in their home country uh yes the answer is yes Kyle in fact I think if there was another nine eleven\nWe would probably take a more World War two version\nOf what our response would be which is a mass destruction of any area that we think plays a was giving safe haven to them um I think the American people's rats if there were another day when we lost three thousand people in one terrorist attack would be a a fearsome and biblical thing\nThat's my that's my sense of it but you know it would depend on a lot of factors Andrew writes\nBook I'm thirty two years old and never voted in the mid term election just presidential years this year the exact uh exception I'm so sick of the crap but Democrats are pulling that I made sure my registration was up to date and I'm voting I really doubt that I'm Alone on this one thanks book\nWell Andrew good for you man uh hopefully well I don't think he told me what state you're from here

communism do we have the state or federal prison the pay to play corruption and complete sense of powerlessness will stay with me forever\nDefinitely gives me a healthy love for freedom and our constitution republic lately I think Republicans fears of felons voting is misplaced just purely anecdotal but all the possible lip voters I encountered in prison\nProbably wouldn't go to ... dependent on it and not very impressive people\nThat's kinda where they send us keep up the good fight shields high in Georgia Matt Matt ... really interesting\nTo hear from a man I appreciate getting a perspective from somebody who has a has served time\nFor a felony and that can speak to what it's like being a prisoner and also what what the political vibe is on on the inside and hey man you know

didn't have any deaths but I mean you know there seems to be\nA lot of these test runs see that's what these are the test runs and or you can see that their test runs different parents for something bigger\n\nAnd you know the truth is I guess it's not going to mean anything to anyone until we have a few people that die\n\nI mean death is the great equalizer is that right and that's what Halloween is all about you know thinking about the dead praising the martyrs in the [noise] praising the saints and are remembering the dead are that's why you have did there was one of those are all saints day on November first\nYou know the real you know we focus on the uh the darker side on the thirty first and then of course November set aside for the sacred November first set aside for the sacred a lotta people forget that and even though we see a lot of schools that a lot of you know that kind of ornate\nA type of decorations for you know\nAll saints day or day of the dead or did\nThey weren't those people in a mini cultures have long believed that communication with the debt is possible and throughout time many people have claimed to speak to those who have shaken this mortal coil\nI've experienced the VP I've I've been in you know goes and kept ghost hunts it but I've been on goes stunts every Thursday VP I felt what a\nFellow at ah to me\nSeemed like an attack by it in such a um so uh I was on the air when it happened in um\n\nIt was terrifying and I and I uh I always tell a story that when I was there and it was all going down\nUm\nI felt a little sick to my stomach because it was like\nA something was suddenly surrounding me and I could not break away from it and I started crying I was on the air when it happened and I always tell people the reason why I was crying was not because of the fact I was scared I mean I knew that something was going on and it was like\nWho was uncomfortable because it's the thought of not being able to say goodbye to your wife\nIs that was in California and ah I was on the air and uh just the thought of not being able to see my wife\nAnd if it was going to be the end of me I I just thought it would be so devastating that um you don't get a chance to say goodbye to both my mother and my father\nMy mother and her own little way had a chance to say goodbye to me before she passed away and my father said goodbye to me twenty minutes before he passed away\nOn the phone\nIt was in good spirits are just there was told that he'd have to have um his tube removed and it's a two was going to be removed he died and he didn't want to be resuscitated and so he passed away\n\nAnd uh you know a lot of people have had those moments where after a loved one has passed away they have contacts somehow in a dream or they see him in a crowd or\nSome even have claimed to you know gotten a phone call and a lot of people of course you know they say hey you know this happens but I never got maybe it's because I got the good buys from my my parents before they passed\nThat some people aren't that lucky they don't have the goodbyes and so sometimes I'm sure and they say sixty percent of the time this happens is that\nMost people you know come in contact with a dead loved one within days after they pass away that come to a minute dream or they appear to them in a room where you see them in a crowd or you know something indicates that there with you that their presence was there\nAnd\nYou know a lot of people say well there are no such things as goes well I Would I Would beg to differ there's something about\nThe other side there's something about the spirit realm it's it's fascinating I mean go shore spirit and demonic communication they show up often in classic literature including mythology there in the Bible or I remember Shakespeare utilized go a lot in his place\n\nAnd you all are back to a going back to a Victorian England and it was fashionable then in many circles to conduct say on says\nUm and they had ... back then I mean you go all the way back then they they had something similar to ... three legged tables candles\nA table tapping all those things they were used to try and contact the dead Edison actually Thomas Edison created a uh he's tried to create and make it as we can use Reagan contact the dad and what happened was instead of contacting the daddy he created somebody can record the debt\n\nAnd what I mean by that is that we listen to a Jim Morrison album we know he's dead but we can still hear his voice Patsy Cline like a ghost you listen to on a record and she's singing crazy\nLike you're listening to a ghost mean prince Michael Jackson are both gone but yet we're hearing them on record there like goes goes on phonograph dose recorded for posterity something that Edison\nHad done rather than communicating with that we are able to keep a dead in a bottle we can play them or listen to them or talk to them in that way\n\nAnd then of course there are those who say that they preserved a lot of the dead thinking a lot of what the debt possessed by writing pages and pages of what can be called automatic writing I mean the psychics hands allegedly guide the goes to convey these like be handwritten messages and said since that time\nSince the time of all the you know the communications you know go seem to have lost their will or ability to writer even communicate effectively now so we have to use electronic voice for them we have these ... electronic voices\nAnd so the spirits can be channeled through mediums where they can be channeled through electronic means that can come through your computer or your phone and I always had this experience because we've done these shows about this before\n\nBut see a lot of the time when you're dealing with the spirit world to get this big nebulous information and always leads to\nInterpret it moment where the so called experience or the medium or whatever is given a word or a science which is knocking or tapping that indicate that something from\nThe serial round\nWhich is to make some sort of contact now horror films they began to reflect the public's belief and concern that contacting of a dead could not only be the gateway to a more simple satanic neck romance see but invites possession\nBy evil spirit\nIf you remember The Exorcist I was actually watching the Internet on the Internet they look at the some of the\nScary moments in people's lives and they always talk about The Exorcist I mean talking about Reagan McNeil the little girl um she was first contacted through a seemingly innocent encounter with the ... and the entity she thought she was communicating with and who are mother chalked up to us an imaginary friend called himself captain howdy\nBut later we reveal that he's the demon Sosa or the demon ... and what's interesting is that this demon ... so\nCaptain ... a lot of people after The Exorcist came out and said that they were experiencing the contact with so so ... are on the board okay\nSo um [noise] you know [noise]\nHead [noise]\nProbably or influence a lot of people into thinking that we usually boards are ah [noise] and uh I don't think I'm bored itself is evil I mean [noise] you know there's no monastery with demon in which is making weeding boards everywhere going that are ... and then putting them in boxes and telling kids to go out and scary so\nThe more we were seeing these strange happenings going on\nSo when you had the hoax or just doing the hopes that you had the people that were really interested in really wanted to make\nThese things happen\nTo be Nineteen sixty the Nineteen seventies and it wasn't until after the movie The Exorcist came out that the spiritual moving was put under the microscope by the born again Christian movement\nBut people are still rebuilding in the sixties and seventies young people started to defy church leaders by participating what could be called party rituals\nWhether you were doing a lot of frightening rituals carried out by young people during sleep over some parties in the wage board was one of those things they always show up you know parents would directly say do not play with it don't touch a which board don't ... board\nBut then you know came the improvisation then came the ritual is ticking off it effective ways of\nTalking to the dead and it turned out that it scared a lot of people when they called upon the spirits come speak to them I mean to be used to the board was for bitten forgiven Asian [noise]\nYoung people just opposite [noise] take one [noise]\nAnd they do all sorts of other things too that if we wanted to get a candle to get a mirror they sit in a small room but the bloody Mary bloody Mary bloody Mary in front of a mirror was just

bad man and I remember his eyes and smile his eyes were narrowly space ... like the eyes of a toy he smiles crooked and fixed and the chief slightly bucked to me he was frightening and I'm the few occasions you visited us he\nWas never allowed to be alone with me Bob contended to certain family members but he was a serial killer who traveled the country and a station wagon\nSatisfying his blood

of these victims having someone from the darkness of the living world haunted Bob for the rest of his life\nPlunging him into madness according to my grandfather Bob had moved about the country and an effort to escape the ghost of his victims\n\nAnd I'm a native December first Nineteen Seventy seven\nWalked into the ocean near the boardwalk prominence in Ocean City New Jersey his body was never recovered\nSo\nTonight I have with me what they called Bob's board\nAnd Bob's board is a is a spirit board not like it you know not unlike ... board but it's different the different board and tonight I wanted to bring am on the show and talk with him a bit about\nThis board so let's bring 'em on AM higher on ground zero card thank you for having me on the show so uh first of all I Want to thank you for the board up I got one sent to me and uh it it's really odd how all these things seem to come to his run Halloween the the the serial killers or\nYou know we had a one time we had somebody show up with it getting shingles up his up his shed and now we've got aboard tell me a little bit about you are a great uncle it's your great uncle correct you know I didn't tell me about my great uncle you remember ... remember about him\nAnd you just have that energy and he would come over and we were closest my grandfather was his brother and we moved around a fair amount because my dad worked for the military he was in like the food service end of it mhm and um [noise]\n\nHe would come over and shoot you know maybe six seven ties with the more I think about it it was more times but he was he had a very\nUm scary quality and then I guess the thing that really he would he was a a always bragging and telling us is you know my my uncle and my father and the\nStories that he was always trying to make them so if I said he worked for like ... Hoover and all these kinds of things but he ... the thing that he always with him around to was\nThat\nHe just took care of business you would say he was he took care of business a lot of times they would travel around the always had women I guess women issues and he told my grandfather was really is\nIs the only friends you know whose brother that he would kill people when they got really um overall it and\nAnd he would do it and he always drove around him into the places where they were park you know where the kids would park and stuff all over the country and he said that she didn't ever get it was never suspect\nOfficially but he felt they were after him a couple of times and uh I guess like Portland, Oregon in San Francisco\nAnd he was you know a couple of times he was there and and I for example my dog I had a dog was my best friend and he very protective\nAnd he'd growled at him and then the dog disappeared you know we never found him and my dad said he'd probably took the dog or something and then\nWe had a cat none of the time and we found the cat and Bob was walking with us and the cat was cut in half and he said raccoons car that you know and then when he went inside my dad said\nTo me\nThere's no raccoons got that because raccoons don't carry knives and\nEvery time he was around something like that happen and then the the last time we saw him was he was a after Martin Luther king was killed and they were burning we're living in New Jersey\nAnd they were burning down a lot of the buildings in Trenton New Jersey like riding\nAnd my grandfather was actually when he got it in a fight with argument with Bob so that my dad because he was saying they should just shoot all the people you know the black people who are writing and so they got furious about the\nFires and said you know they're just live so he left and then like three days later on in the garage we separate garage\nAnd it burned down with a car and that and we only had one car at that time and my dad was serious 'cause she thought you know\nHe did it you know Bob and Bob Bennett and so Bob never face jail time no\nHe was very he was very personable no way you know you but you knew 'cause his eyes was scary to me [noise]\nSo it was the main thing I remember about it so they were scary eyes and we were and talk more with him about\nBob and find out more about his background and find out more about him background too [noise] uh we have with us to make bombs blew it is a spirit board will talk about how Bob came to make this board and why\nAnd why this is being of this is available to people it's available to people if you'd like to purchase the board I Will give you the details on that as well as those that are collectors of a\nSerial killer material or even ... this will be a great collectors item for if you want to buy a buy one for the Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred that's AAA thinks Seventy three thirty seven hundred back with more ground zero them go way dump\nBut I'm I'm a nice person I just\n... it's not I don't I'm a little ashamed of that this is what I Would make my living you know ...

I've been to grow rice milk\nOkay but there's a place called the ... which are very kind of creepy but there's a place than in Tom's river and and it was near there that he had a\nPlace and then in his garage yet you had a lot of projects that he was always doing some creative stuff when he settled down a little bit right and in this one little bag was the board\nAnd it was the board because he felt guilty wanted to contact his dead victim's is that why he made the board\nThat's right he was he was very scary person\nAnd I think he was up to a lot of things and he would always do my dad he said he would always show pictures of girls that he was dating all the time you know ... and my dad thought that was\nFully because he said he was homosexual and he and he told me when I got older that he thought those people that he had done things to\nAll the pictures and so when we when he died we went to the places that just remember it was kind of like an average looking to house on the edge of the ... and they had\nAll his clothes and all that stuff and he had he was making posters to sell you know 'cause it's just like in the seventies system\nAnd um they threw at all that stuff but I asked my uncle was like the ... like an executive guy taking over the state where nothing of value\nBut he let me have the board and he said this is explained that this was the thing to think that he built for that reason because when he had a very bad car accident\nAnd um they thought he was going to make it but he didn't make it and it it changed his personality and my dad said\nThat he got a conscience because he didn't have one even though he was like charming to us there was some scary about him and then when he had the uh the accident\nIt changed he changed ... that's when he made this you know he had some skill as an artist like a graphic artist you know\nAnd\nThat's when he made the board and then he he basically left to the you\nKnow you just it was just in the garage part he didn't give it when I took it took it [noise]\n\nAnd it's ... and ... and this is how you survive by making money off his ...\nYeah to some other stuff I'm trying to be like a writer but I'm
