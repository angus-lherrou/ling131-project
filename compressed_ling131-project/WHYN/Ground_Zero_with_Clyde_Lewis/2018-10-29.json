borders and David Wray will once again welcome to the bill Cunningham show and David how you doing\nDoing great my friend that you\nGo let me share with the American people something you ever put forth and one of your mission and that is what's going on with all this stuff going on with the mailing in the bombs and all that stuff going on and the victims and and the potential arrest all that stuff something else is happening I think much more important in the southern border the media is covering for obvious reasons\nAnd that is that this is something being used by the mainstream media to attack the Republicans and Donald Trump but you say among other things in his article the caravan of an estimated seven thousand some say it's closer to Fifteen thousand at this point\nOf Central American migrants is now you know well into Mexico with the Claritin tend to bridging us border where the migrants intend to seek political asylum\nThe impetus for this latest Caribbean is not\nA humanitarian crisis in Central America but rather as accurately described by the wall Street Journal and organized done by political agitator is an activist who are intent on using migration is a political weapon to foment border chaos and I might add\nTo the to hurt Donald J Trump I could not conceive on a particular day at a particular time at a particular place all of a sudden seven to ten thousand on doing just showed up together in one place and said let's walk through America two thousand miles away no one believes that\nSo what happened with the political agitator isn't the activist who got this together explained that the mainstream media won't do it\nWell you know build a thanks for highlighting this and this is the other example of ... you know weaponized migration if you recall Nineteen eighty Mariel boatlift when the Dell Castro sent a hundred and twenty five thousand\nDisenfranchised in criminal and mentally ill ah Cuban immigration to South Florida and the idea was to use population as a way to destabilize and disrupt\nA you know competing country and once again we have here where we have a leftist politician in Honduras former member of Congress\nA who's a according to vice president Pence getting backing from the Venezuelan government no friend of the United states\nWho has stirred up and created a caravan of some Thirteen thousand as many as Thirteen thousand people some of whom are our economic migrants and they say they're coming here just to work\nBut others are MS Thirteen a gang members deportees there's also\nA man of working age from Asia and from a a East Asia or East Asia and South Asia coming this way what you have here is ah if you just watch on TV where they try to do this you know people are just are are coming along and doing it on their\nMeals are suddenly appearing ... suddenly appearing medical care is suddenly appealing this this is not\nSomething that just happened on its own nobody is coordinating this and paying for this if you don't believe me why don't you take your wife and kids and try walk in Louisville, Kentucky and see where you end up tonight to who puts the tent up for you with the medical care and the\nFree hot food I mean it just doesn't happen like that these things are coordinated\nAnd there are a government behind this that are trying to destabilize the United states and let's let's be honest here is that a coincidence that this is happening just ten days away probably\nThe most important mid term election and your and my lifetime you know I mean that is not a coincidence vibrant and on top of that there are now three caravans coming\nTo now because the media doesn't cover this because all the news that fits they print and this doesn't fit the narrative the megaphone to the Democratic party\nExplained why here we're getting ready for a week from Tuesday is going to be a very important election all of a sudden tens of thousands of my door and show up at the same place the same time\nWith precision began marching together ... along with food and I'm an army marches on its belly along with water intensive medical care all these things just just came out of nowhere and now there's three events happening with the media will cover what are they\nWell you know there there are three separate\nUh caravans that are formed the largest one that we're talking about now and then to to smaller ones in El Salvador one that hasn't even left yet\nBut I mean on the one hand the reporters are saying these are women\nPushing their baby strollers and then the ... you know they make the mistake of up panning the crowd and showing the visual and I've seen a pictures of people handing out money to these folks I've seen trays of hot meals being handed I've seen medical supplies\nAnd so on they are you know trying to uh I think that you know how the Mariel boatlift are not only destabilize South Florida but it ended up leading probably\nTwo or Jimmy Carter's a election down fall and the following election although Jimmy Carter help that out quite a bit\nAnd Im self [noise] I think that that this is an attempt by leftist government and perhaps some of the open borders advocates around the world to destabilize the United states and to embarrass Donald Trump right before the most important mid term election of his lifetime\nI think it's embarrassing him because on balance because it was going politically against the Democrats\nAll of a sudden a bomb scares the bomb threats began as if now the media doesn't deal at all with the migration that look so
