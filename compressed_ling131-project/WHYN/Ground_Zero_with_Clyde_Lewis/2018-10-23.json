the hardliners used the reporters debt as a martyr to arrest the westernization of Islam\nSo far as everyone has canceled deals with it it seems to work shields Hi Adam I don't think so but I Do have to admit that nobody really knows exactly what has happened just quite yet so let's keep keep our eyes and ears open on this one and hope to get\nMore facts more information more data\nUpon which to base our analyses shoot Julianne right which\nThe way you hear the news talking about the reporter ... at first I thought it was one of ours this is not our issue not our citizen and not on our territory I feel like this wouldn't have been so big an issue of Trump\nHad notches succeeded in getting our pastor ... and not just succeeded in getting her past her back\nOr why are these people not getting arrested Gen do you mean the people the Saudi people that are because they were arrested or are we talking about the caravan I'm not clear right me again and let me know ...\nBook my wife and I just returned from our annual trip to Albuquerque and for the international ballooned fiesta and we always worked in a couple of days in El Paso well out there\nI like to watch a lot of local news whenever I'm Out of town and during the commercial breaks there obviously tons of political ads several which featured the highly touted Beto O'Rourke this was my first experience\nAt length with send your or ... or send your or send your O'Rourke sorry to send your or ... easy to say and I came with a thoroughly non plus he's not all that photogenic he can speak incomplete sentences but the crappy throws out is purely style over substance\nHe of course accused Republicans of a smear campaign against him with his DWI attempted escape and when he threw out it's not a Democrat or Republican thing I stop worrying about him Obama concern me two thousand for this speech at the DNC or concerns me zero empty suit except he seems to issue shoots whenever possible\nDale Dale I I think that they are going to try to make a better way national figure I I think that they do believe\nThat even though he couldn't win in Texas\nOr they might think of him as a presidential contender because that's the

Chad\nWright's book love your stuff\nHowever you don't have the knowledge or experience to take on the vaccine topic either learn more about both sides of the issue or just don't talk about it it's no elitist liberals who choose not to vaccinate many conservatives like my wife and I was over forty years in the health care field between us don't vaccinate our six kids\nIf you want to understand both sides and when the answer any questions you may have for many it's always and accept the risk until it happens to their child good parents aren't the ones unwilling to look at both sides shield side shot OK chat\nUm I I don't pretend to have any knowledge about this other than just what I can read and what I can learn on my own I I have no professional experience in medicine or health at all I Do have access to a number of people in my personal and professional network\nWho I Believe would be considered world class MDs including somebody who is a chief of infectious disease at one of the biggest and most well regarded hospitals in New York City\nAnd they I can just tell you they have no time for the vaccines cause autism discussion and debate they think that it's essentially like saying that the moon landing didn't happen they do not take it seriously at all as an intellectual position worthy of debate\nSo I I can pass that along the ... by the way they're conservatives so that there are people that politically I happen to agree with that that doesn't matter for this discussion but they're not a liberal so caught up in some kind of a fad\nI've asked them about this a few of them\nAnd they're very definitive and I know people get very mad at me I'm just the messenger here man I have yet to meet a doctor in fact that would be my challenge you give me\nA well regarded or epidemiologist or a or MD\nWith decades of experience and an incredibly a acclaimed record\nWho will tell me that vaccines are dangerous and people should not get vaccinated and then I'm happy to take that on board as something that might sway me to one side of the argument the other I can just tell you chat I've never come across that and I've asked a lot of people about this\nAnd all I get are people that get mad at me and then they send me a link to a blog that has nothing other than just somebody posting other blog link articles\nAnd that's it so I I asked him when it when I talk about the global warming debate or climate change whatever they call it the other side says well there are no\nThere are no well regarded scientists who disagree with us and I know that's alive because I can name well regarded scientists Richard lens in a you know there there there are well regarded scientist on the record who say that it is not true that climate change is the threat that we are led to believe\nI just wanted a well regarded MD to tell me that is a an insight to studies with the research for it and then I'll take that on board I just people get mad at me for this I Know they're very passionate about the topic\nI Am never given any reference or research that serious I'm just giving people that say well look at Suzie so and so who talked to Bobby so and so\nWho knows the guy who's like a really important researcher and says that vaccines cause autism ... people can get mad at me all they want I just I'll change my opinion when I have some facts were some research that's all I don't know so I appreciate your writing in shadow I'm Glad to you\nMuch stuff and uh I Hope you don't get mad at me for this response do but I Am before because I Know people get mad at me for this one including my own team\nI don't know what they want me to say give me some evidence and not something that's a you know like looks like it's linked off the world met daily website give

character\nUm\nBut they say time means everything when following and I was in the mood really to do a spooky showed at night and I just didn't know where to start you know you got so many things to choose from you just don't know where to go sort of ... [laughter] today I was I was I was looking over my science articles for my coping service\nI saw one of the most\nGod awful looking creatures today oh my gosh\n... is with skin crawl thinking about it okay so this creature looked like a bright red chicken without a head and was swimming and writing in water\nUp by ... it gave me the creeps it really did\nI mean\nThis this creature okay I'm not kidding he looked like a floating chicken with its head chopped off\nOkay it's strange it was it was his pinky shred it was an entity with a body like a slump brush didn't decapitated chicken ... and\nThey called it the Hitler's chicken monster this is true it was the mice I science ... I mean scientists that ... if it's all you know true science because you have to look at the true science as human beings real earnings bake so I saw this thing and I'm thinking it's gotta be CGI it's gotta be crazy right but no [laughter]\nI spent I spent the whole afternoon literally\nReading about the headless chicken monster you're probably laughing but it's true headless chicken\nAnd you know ... chicken those who have listened to my show know about the famous if I can find it I'll play it they know about the famous chicken rent okay\nIt's a well known story the legendary ground zero story about how I went to a Halloween party and I came back just a little bit tipsy ... on the air first time I've ever done that good I don't go on the air and drunk or you know higher or anything\nBut I went on the air this was when I was local and I was feeling a little test you went to a great party in the afternoon who was one of the afternoon parties\n... came on the air and I just started you know talking shooting from the hip shooting from the hip I started getting to how terrified I was of chickens okay\nAnd the reason why I'm terrified of chickens is because when I was a kid I once tried to sneak in my backyard from a field okay and there was the barbed wire fences next door to this this family the we because we lived out in this rural area called mid veiled Utah\nAnd next door to us was this a Mexican family I mean they were they spoke Spanish they just beginning she kept kids spoke English but uh just barely and uh I used to have this kid named junior ... he was really Jose and he spoke English ... broken English but I decided to sneak home from school\nGo through the field\nAll through the barbed wire is barb wire fence and to keep the roosters and the chickens from\nGetting I crawled into the ... got attacked\nBy the head rooster just poking my face is the debt tacking me and it was like I'm bleeding I'm getting attacked it's like something out of Alfred Hitchcock's the birds right but it's chickens chickens roosters just attacking\nMe right and just talking at my face\nAnd Iran to my mom Iran and my dad I'm bleeding and so my dad goes over of course the old man's over there man he's drunk ... drunk and my dad says you're rooster my son and blood is new\nAnd so I guess Miguel who is one of the older\nKids saw me bleeding and he said oh that's it so we went and he got himself a rake and he went any chased after the rooster would the raking finally hit it and there'd been goes and it just stops\nSo he grabs a knife and he grabs the nicotine a chicken and goes ... cups head off the chicken right\nAnd then the damn rooster comes running after me [laughter] you know your little kid writing things coming up you where do we do with its\nHead chopped off any bad enough Jose thought it was funny he went he grabbed the chicken ... the chickens foot and he found the nerve on the end of the chickens to pull on it and the chickens that you can handle it would do a class you know it cost ...\nTerrifying as a kid right terrified\nBy one had experience with ... we went to a place called we were farm where to go visit my folks at Christmas Time I told him that was the Thanksgiving when you go totally him and said hey we can get a ... a a a nice uh uh you know pumpkin pie good wheeler farm hang out go see the animals there were horses or anything and so they weren't chickens\nAnd certainly I'm just like what four or five years old six years old at the time and he thinks the rooster chase after it but he's scared of the ... and I said you know what\nYou like me you're just like me man\nWe have problems with chicken so we're we're going to do is we're going to go to KFC and get some chicken even told me he has his great idea for a horror film with chickens so he and I both bad we we've had our experience with chickens\nBut seeing this horrible pink breasted compensated chicken\nSwimming with what I mean the whole afternoon just looking for information on this creature because how terrified I Am of chicken and I was thinking of this creature was from my nightmares materialize in the real world\nAnd after a whole afternoon of obsession I found out the creature how to name it was a real thing it wasn't some you know October legion CGI it's called\nAnd opinion justice and see mia and it ... me that's Spanish ... and ... states and it ... ...\nIt does not change the fact that these things they are ruthless\nThey package you\nThey go they make that that clicking sound this just hideous you can you imagine you imagine being held in a chicken coop\nFor a long period of time hearing the sounds of clocking everyday and scratching and pecking\nThat would drive me nuts that's how would knowing chickens are\nThat's why we put them in buckets they will use eleven herbs and spices on them because they're scary\nWhen you do all these people out of the old airport defence there's chickens no one attack me when I was a little kid there not defenseless\nThey're not defenseless\nScary poultry but they are frightening foul is what they are and they do fly you know that they do okay don't let anybody tell you different chickens fly they just don't like to fly obviously\nThey're lazy good for nothing chickens and they only fly when they need to they only fly when they want to pick you up the only fly where they want to scare the hell out of you\nHow one coming down swooping down on you and flying as they jump off the coup on to you that is when they decide to fly chickens\nFly and they attacked children they're worse than the worst in those damn dogs those ... bulldogs are worse than pit bulls\nTo keep your chicken under lock and key\nFive oh three five three five ... back in the old days when I was younger okay and ground zero was you know it had been put in the and like I said I went to a party and this guy just you know he calls me and he starts talking about how it could be my fear of chickens and he said I had to kill it nah\nI went into this chicken rant and people were like going I recorded bath [laughter]\nBut he's sending me this this chicken ... chicken they should I call that those chicken ...\nSo uh anyway so that's why I write about chickens once again they found this they found the sea cucumber because the cucumber of all things actually swimming off of Antarctica or Australian group founded put on video it looks like a\nFlying I like swimming headless chicken and I was watching it today gave me the creeps I thought my God you know there are plenty of creatures that we don't know about and the scary and they're out there and they're freaky All right so a especially a chicken with its head chopped up man nothing worse than that\nAnyone a bus ended up a chicken ran a very rare I pull up the chicken rent but I pulled it out there so you could see that yes in my younger days there's a reason why I was in the national talk show host\n[laughter]\nAAA thinks every three thirty

like the chili that granted we miss the mom ... that Steven it took me a long time to get here\nOh I guess that makes the first is not that ... role\nOr anything that looks like a real chicken with feathers and it'd be scares me um but it says here on average ... mia that's what they call it measures to an eight inches in length adults colors can range from\nDark reddish brown the crimson bow juveniles are typically a pale pink according to a study published in Nineteen Ninety the journal Smithsonian contributions to marine sciences so they're really fascinated by the sea cucumber gave me the creeps we're always we're really weird is that uh it got me thinking about second genesis\nAnd what's second genesis is is well scientists have said some have suggested that there is there was a a there is that where there was a second genesis that took place in the beginning in the beginning or God created having the earth got also created\nAnd having an heaven and heaven and heaven and earth and earth and earth and earth meaning\nThere were several genesis uh beginnings several different ones ah where\nThere's a fifty percent chance of other life forms which opposes the norm and they do exist and sometimes they show up and when they show up we don't know what you call the window would do with him and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster I'm not going to any of those things I'm Talking about things that you know you look at them and you get a second look\nLike this chicken that swim so that such chicken or the the the ... chicken monster type creature that I have in\nMy uh uh I have in my article tonight\nUh but when you're looking at the multiplicity of creation and you're looking at\nHow the diversity of the multi versus unseen and the multiplicity\nThe insurance would call that the underworld creatures from the underworld they'll come up from nowhere with Demi Moore guns from you know stranger things or\nYou know I don't know anything that extreme but still I mean stranger things called the upside down we called the best uh the timeline of creation and the creation as we adhere to are the ones that have been handed down through millennia and each one is unique and its interpretation our the concepts pretty much\nAre the same wherever you look so scientists are speculating\nSciences are speculating that strange organisms\nThat might be alien in nature exist on the planet and\nThere isn't\nA very far jumped to suggest that stranger life exist on the planet that well you've never seen before and that if you were to blow up in the shadow biosphere lurks every monster and vital thing that no one even wants to see or or take on or have contact with\nThere was another creature that I saw it and somebody was kind enough\nTo actually send me a picture of this thing it's called the tangled in\nI don't know if you've ever seen a hangover and but I saw a paying all end today for the first time I've never heard of the pain Glenn in my life it looks like a mini Godzilla with armor let's say something from a Japanese horror film tiny thing it looks like a cross between an animator and armadillo\nAnd uh so he says will bring up the plight of course will apply to push the ... isn't terrify but I I think the penguin it's cute but it's also scary looking because it has its armor all over his body\nAnd it kinda like conscious over like Godzilla it looks like it could take out a a you know it if it was big enough you can take out Tokyo and that's how we're to see that these ... we're creatures that
