I mean let's let's be fair to what I actually said I didn't ... I spoke specifically about the gas tax which and this is well documented was an empire built on slavery and\nA cannibalism and human sacrifice\nAnd there was an incredible amount\nOf violence that built the Aztec Empire which was the single largest\nNative a native civilization or native political entity that existed at the time of the uh exploration and and colonial period\nI didn't name I didn't say that the Navajo I didn't say the euro coordination we're doing anything like that at all so I'm going to need I'm going to need more specific You're welcome to criticize me welcome to write in\nA but I Would never accused of\nAll groups of being savages in the new world than ever said that I'm so I'm a I'm going to need a little more a little more on the details there\nDJ Wright's book I've noticed on rising that crystal brings up gerrymandering a lot is it just me or does it seemed like she's reading her argument in case the house when the dams in November\nDJ crystal was my co host so all I have to say about Chris was she's great that's all I'm going to say for that that is good for the James thank you for being here with me\nYou know what's not smart hoping that you're going to get the right candidate because you just cross your fingers and decide that the post that you put on some side no one's ever heard going to get it done you know what is more using the best hiring and recruiting tool on the Web\n\nBut I'm beginning to realize something and that is I I should have done this a long time ago on my show but I think the reason why I did is because I didn't think it would be a popular thing to do but now I don't care if it's popular or not\nBecause I had made a commitment\nTo all of you to be truthful to tell the truth can be as honest as I can be\nWith my radio program and that he is [laughter]\nI Know there's a drinking game out there so please get your drinks ready when I was in South America that I Lived there and I lived there in the middle of\nWell it was ever event in the middle of his towards the end of their civil war there was there the dirty war but it was more of a civil war\nI saw civil war in a whole new light it was different than the two sided civil war we had in the Eighteen hundreds it was or something out it was civil war in\nContemporary time it was it was civil war in a in a in a major city\nAnd when I say when Assad is I'm sure many of you think that it's just some backward city in South America no it's it's actually a south America's Spain or France or or or it it had the feel of Italy or France or or Spain or any of the European cities it's it's an amazing city\nVery or urban very uh advance but an advanced technologies there because they try them out down there and see if they'll work down there they do they move up here sometimes it's the other way around\nAnd so\nThe biggest concern for a lot of Americans is what's going to happen in this country what\nWhat is going on and when you speak of bike civil upheaval in civil war and you say to yourself well it's not there yet I always hear people say why it's not there yet but I'm Wondering you know do they know did they ever lived through one do they know what it's like to live in one\nAnd\nI said to myself that maybe I've waited too long to talk about the reality and and and how we're smack dab in the middle of the reality that uh is out of control\n\nI mean we have new laws have executive orders that pretty much been able to president\nThe act of emergency powers act I mean he can make plans any time to just arrest people you know and I've heard the rumors that that probably in the works from sort of a\nArrest structure somehow they're going to go after they're just making the plans to see if they can legally go after people who have been creating problems in this country that would be a more or less involved with what I call this this this island or or this or you know very soft coup\nOr there's the soft espionage or you know it's all it's all get soft espionage soft coup\nOther behaviors with or you know certain people and how uh you know they they try to say that it's a constitutional behavior when it's not I mean look I Know that if you say that if you say well maybe the president's planning on doing this he's planning on\nExposing all the way back to twenty sixteen some of the problems we have even during the Obama administration before that the Bush administration or a response to that would be well here we have political sour grapes\n\nAnd with political sour grapes or get political splinter groups political splinter group should get the ah marginalizing fragmentation of our republic\n\nAnd believe it or not it's a fragmentation of our republic they're destroying us it will destroy us for sure\n\nAnd there will not be and there is not\nI repeat there is not a unanimous front against an abusive government does unanimous front against ourselves and we're easily exploited easily exploited by political Jagger not said have\nBeen hijacked by Neal cons anarchists socialists anti five black lives down the list okay\nAnd the media basically all of the American people like sheep and it being join ers and what they're doing is they're basically encouraging what I call divisive coats and these groups do nothing to further the cause of change\nAnd solve the entire process as it appears to be mired in nothing but fanaticism\n\nWere stuck in this Myra fanaticism is beyond protest signs and pepper spraying people camping in parks or a pepper spraying the homeless or what the overall feeling here in America\nIs it it's wise to have a gun\n\nOh everybody's saying the gun violence should be curbed that you should you know where he visited the second amendment there are many people who say that that are still wanting armed security and they think it's wise to be armed to have a gun concealed carry\nAnd you're feeling in the United states is if you don't have at least a gun then you should have at\nLeast some stored food batteries radios and you'll be comes swallowed up into the onslaught of attacks in the homeland from an unseen enemy but be unseen enemy has been seen we're identifying the enemy all the time the enemies within and the enemy is among all of us\nBack or what was it um he has a few years ago\nActually show this program I says I think it's wise to know and and find out just to your neighbors are\n\nAnd I said you know maybe we shouldn't organizer neighborhoods on her own or that or if someone will come in and do it for us\nBecause the cloud that hangs over the United states now\nIs it no group is safe unless it's legally armed organized overly advocating a return of a more localized government state constitution rules against the federal government run amok\nUm\nI remember it was a civil war of the Eighteen hundreds that brought us the bloodiest conflict\nOn American soil and that was our first war veterans right there\n\nActually they were having Lincoln and Eighteen sixteen was the final straw for many southerners in an all of the states uh\nEleven states ... succeeded from the union for these Virginia Arkansas and North Carolina and Tennessee did not succeed until after the battle for Sumpter that occurred on April twelve fifty sixty one five additional states were border slave states may didn't succeed for the union Missouri Kentucky West Virginia Maryland in Delaware\nNow\nWe're not talking about secession than I Am not even though there are a number of states foods that basically says they want it to you know form their own governments maybe like California's been what they want to separate the three states and and Texas has always been wanting to get out of the union and than they ever you know the constitution says they\nCan but Americans have been angry with government from from way back I mean\nWhen Obama was president they wanted us to see now with Trump president they want us to see they want to but they say they want to move to Canada and all this other stuff but if he dealt with this trivial path that they like the spread out there to make themselves look important\nBut\nA lot of this has to do with the end of the the the thought that was a part in the declaration of independence\nI Want to jump to a historically an actor but I think it's um there's a I'm a part of the declaration of events that says something that the governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends\nThe government\nWhich has been in the plans in place since two thousand three so President Trump\nDecides to act upon this if he wants to become presidential besides he wants to do that he can\n\nHe can do this because this was put into play in two thousand three after the nine eleven attack\n\nThey would have to keep incarceration an inmate inventory because most of the people would be civilian inmate population and they would be charged for extradition\nThere have been other proposals hidden within the endgame to include the creation of smart cities virtual cities smart cities in virtual\nCities will be where he'll be do mass incarceration there'll be able to release those were mass who are incarcerated in math\nAnd they were turned them into inmate labor cities\nWhere under constant observation with five gee networks and triple\n... and a closed circuit TV cameras there would be able to create pretty much Japan optic on gulag of cities but ... nothing more than those who violated\nAny and all of these provisions\nIn engaging and endgame statistics from homeland security can make one feel a little paranoid because the focus according to the new intelligence stated that anyone and they even pointed out right wing extremists libertarians there more than likely to be your next terrorists are more than likely it'd be the ones this but they did not put into into play\nThe emotional anger and frustration it's being brought about by meal con\nOr actually neo liberal facets an organization so now the government is expanding their watch list [noise]\nFacebook has

be prudent to tell people that perhaps it's time to heal and choose our battles no one militia in because there are been debt is to be settled in revenge is a dish but his best serve cold in America\n\nSo whenever I speak of civil war ... civil or people in America I often get told that it will never get that bad Clyde and then I fear mongering for the sake of clicks or ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back to people\n\nBut it's certainly cynics better there in order to keep telling yourself into America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed and they're living through a civil war and South America can teach you what to expect\nAnd it is a real experience and I talked about that in the first hour I mean I Want to make it clear that during the civil war in a modern day in a modern city modernist city like when I ...\nI mean life was normal except for little things so it makes you wonder if you would make it through the day or if you will be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine\nThat the United states the civil war will be similar except that we have the Internet that's the difference say I mean the outbreak of a civil war in the United states wouldn't look all that different to the normal news cycle regularly you know and that's the thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different than the normal news cycle\nAnd what they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean it begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\n\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city or directed at Congress or to the president\n\nAnd I know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but it's certainly send the ball rolling because there was a political attack using rice and a poison that was\nAimed at certain people including the president the United states if they would have sent all that the members of Congress we would have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attacks happened in two thousand one after the nine eleven attacks\n\nSeattle we have the rights that attack that happened just before the cabinet vote\n\nWe talked about the Russian each cult an al ... tried to use biological warfare as a way to get people not to vote or to\nSomehow change the direction political you have an area here in in Oregon I mean these are simple politically motivated attacks and these attacks are usually supposed to not only change directions politically\nBut they're also there to generate copycat attacks\n\nAnd these can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash they're simply done in order to provoke a response if the responses overwhelming and police departments cannot keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\n\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent and the domino effect is in play military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable his will be your martial law scenario\nExcept it will either be the military working within already militarized police or the police working against the military there also be restrained to start with\nHow or if there is an insurgency there will be some re straight at first but then the insurgency military weapons martial law all these things can be applied to a situation I don't know if there will go that far but it can be applied I mean there's a misconception but in a modern civil war there'll be two sides\nAnd the reason why we think this\nIs because we live back in history and we all know that it was the union believes me into less slavery and the confederation really being more slavery but most people are thinking right now but if there was a civil war in the United states it would be two sided and that's it\nLike Republican against Democrat concern against federal no on how it's going to be\n... when the civil war will be in the United states if this happens you know it's not modern civil war would have many so called sight seeing the dirty war South America there are several sides that we're fighting\nThere were the parent is kind of nice there's the radicals are out of college the communist called me and he says the Nazis the Catholic Church the Jews who until the police the moderate applies I\nI can go down all the list of who are fighting against to\n\nThe age group would have their own band if terrorists carrying out executions abductions and torture of course the government had access to the police had access to corrupt cops had access to military and so of course the government utilize them whenever they could the church would utilize them as well your poll by the way was part of that group\n\nFeeding America we didn't have a left wing group inside violence or insurgency that what sparked a response from black lives matter or me too but all eyes would be an anti ... because they're usually the ones that carry out all the stuff\nOn this stuff hits the fan\n\nOver the weekend there was a vigil in Portland, Oregon for Patrick Kevin's there was a black man who was shot by police afterwards members of anti ... blocks streets directing traffic getting harassed drivers and other people the police looked on and allowed the harassment to happen it was horrible\n\nAn elderly man who made the mistake of not following orders of anti what's called a racist at a Nazi among other things and there was chased down by an angry mob where they proceeded to use but times and other weapons the damages vehicle\nThe police looked on\nThe driver says he was following two other cars that made the right hand turn instead of a left when one protester stepped in front of his car and the other surrounding the demand was out numbered probably scared and did not know what he did wrong the truth is he did nothing wrong\nAnd it could have wound up with him being beaten shot once again the police looked on didn't do anything didn't intervene\n\nGuy had about three thousand dollars worth of damage done to his car\n\nOnce again in the civil war breaks out there that are here or in the United states would not be two sides fighting we can see hundreds of sides with hundreds of agendas yearning and fighting for independence\n\nTheir separatist groups in America the militia groups keeper storm front patriot prayer Proud Boys Christian sects Muslim groups all these guys can come together and feel the flames for civil war other insurgency Kelly is can be criminal gangs like MS Thirteen black nationalist groups white nationalist sovereign citizens\nGenerally any armed organized group with some kind of history to it now with the Internet\n\nWe would see more organized insurgency through social networking\n\nIs anybody remembers the purge threat August fifteenth twenty four team\nThe mainstream news was reporting on the events are happening in Ferguson, Missouri for the first time and since the LA Riots in Nineteen Ninety One\nThe United states was watching what appeared to be a scene from the movie the siege were peaceful protesters appear to be enemies of the state as militarized police force gathering demonstrated what can only be described as intimidating overreach meanwhile there was something else that what's happening the United states are actually got a a little press a press of the United states about something called\nA purge and there was about to take place in Louisville, Kentucky\nWhen news of the Louisville purged for struck police officials indicated they were preparing for any potential disturbing [noise] there's a heightened police presence

and just because it hasn't been declared we can say that isn't happening here it is happening here\nThe civil war we are in now\nIs not two sides fighting against each other even though there are two sides but liberal and conservative that are fighting against one another\n\nAnd that is that that is the main fight\nBut what we're saying if somebody is asymmetrical we're seeing something that's a

to\n\nTake a look at all of the things that we can say we're a little skirmishes and and little ideological or fights we had Charlottesville Berkeley Las Vegas and what's going on here and my my city here it is just it's terrifying\nAll of the friends aren't territory and we're not fighting for territory we're fighting for ideological or ideological superiority\n\nJust as we risk missing the signs
