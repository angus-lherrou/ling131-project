think that it's accurate so that's a thing that\nI Want everyone to remember I I Do think he's more of a Roberts type justice where he's going to try judicial ... uh from the bench now we're generally as conservatives because we are trying to conserve right where we're OK with judicial minimal ism but just understand that that means\nThat he probably won't be in a position to give a and do things

for seeing it and if I don't see it it wouldn't surprise me I'm honestly it's bittersweet reason is because I already have preconceived notions that I'm going to heated\nAnd if I go I Hope I Am pleasantly surprised but as for now all I can think of is how this is nothing more than a fan fiction fantasy new Marshall promote NASA\nAnd I don't know I have high hopes for NASA\nAnd I think the reason why I hate them so much is because they always always always disappoint me just what I think I can go back to like human again they do some good wholesome Boehner that I just don't I I just don't like them anymore okay and he was really funny is one of my favorite T shirts\nIf the teacher the Janine got me before I went to California and it was a national\nShirt I I just like it's very comfortable\nAnd uh I just thought it was awesome she got me this massive shirt because it just makes me feel on NASA like you know it's cool but\nUh yeah a NASA gives be such Natasha ... they should call it a notch you are because they every everything they do anymore just makes me kind of\nRhetoric and feel will stick to my stomach I Know the earliest days with us space exploration situation one of the most fascinating chapters of human history\nThat's why I like NASA cause I like reading about Gus Grissom I like reading about uh you know Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin ... and I I like reading about all these guys you know I write a report about the team um I got in in my op it maybe if I get wrong to\nGet it out of the opposite can take a picture and put on a on Facebook I've got\nUm\nI've got the uh uh a picture of something is supposed to be the Apollo Thirteen no not ... fourteen astronaut and it's a little piece of the gold lamb\nFramed I it's kind of a cool thing I don't have any moon rocks but I have that and I have that in my office and I I really liked that thing and one of my earliest producers on this program Daniel he work for NASA\nAnd\n... when I had him on working with me it was amazing because I got to get all this inside information and he was the one that was telling me you should do shows about this shows but that asked by this isn't happening announcing that any big conspiracy theories about NASA\nWorked for us to actually so yeah you're going to see first ban is going to be cool because it's going to be like going to see Apollo Thirteen or any other space movie\n\nRunning with the historical narrative we know that scientists had a determined effort\nTo go to the moon and they have limited time table\nAnd their efforts gave us the Gemini program and the Apollo moon landing\nWith Neil Armstrong acting is the first human bouncer to an extraterrestrial world\nAnd there's so many things we can talk about with him you know leaving the planet along with bugs and and go in and doing it and you know touching putting a split on lunar soil and all that whether or not there aliens air whether or not they saw structures they're I mean there's all kinds of things that you can speculate about\nBut\nAlmost from the point of the first Apollo mission\nThere were many Americans they expressed skepticism that the whole event taking place at all\nIt had they argued been faked in Hollywood by the federal government for purposes ranging from embezzlement of the public treasury\nComplex conspiracy theories involving international intrigued murderous criminality also using money to foot the war effort in Vietnam this was all thrown together as a propaganda basically a propaganda scam\nTo make the Russians feel inferior and and to be honest it worked\n\nWas whatever it was really the Russians were ahead of us in the space race then one day they find out that we've got a man on the moon immediately as hell we don't want to do that and see and that's what has always bothered me about the moon landing as we landed on the moon\nAnd it's kind of like climbing Everest one man climbs up ... makes it to the top there are several other people who want to climate ... efforts to do the same they don't succeed okay some do but some don't\nSo let's look at the moon is like ... we go about every sweet land on Mt Everest and the Russians that worked so hard to go about at risk decide that but we're not going\n\nNow why didn't they go why were they in the second on the moon why when when the when the whole fever pitch was going on we're we're the only ones who are going to and from the moon no one else was going up there Russia wasn't going up there China wasn't going up there\n\nNobody cared to go up there in fact after the first three moon missions they were kind of getting bored with the moon mission they would rather watch Lucille Ball I mean what are\n\nYour rather watching Lucille Ball wondering of their busy or near this kid or whoever it was good to have a baby or I it was like\nYou know\nComedies were more interesting than the moon landing the first one\nCool second one okay third one huh okay about about how their lives ruined thing\nIf you're a lot of people that had skepticism about whether it on the moon happened at all when we landed\n\nAmong Americans between the ages of Eighteen and twenty four years old this is figures from the Nineteen sixties uh twenty seven percent expressed doubts but NASA went to the moon and over the years there have been many more dollars and anymore if you express doubts you were called a science dinner you're up there with ladders right\nAh that's about the first moon landing had been on the rise for some time here and there are a lot of people who don't believe\nThat was it turns out throughout the latter third of the twenty twenty century onto the twenty first confidence in the United states government by the American public had been in decline and those who remember the Kennedy assassination Vietnam Watergate nine eleven attacks all these other scandals malfeasance\nThey find it easier to say well you know the governs lied to us about a lot of things why wouldn't they lied it was about the moon landing and what's really weird is is\nThat you know out of all the things you can question questioning the moon landing is probably one of the worst things you can do okay it's it's one of the worst things that you can do\nThat you know using ... you can question nine eleven and that's that's kinda bad because people say how dare you there was this horrible event and history and you're questioning of people died\nThat that you get that all the time you're talking about Watergate you you do some ... they don't care about why they don't care about Monica Lewinsky stress but yet we spent less money on nine eleven I mean ... and that's the thing is you know you look at the embarrassment of that you look at all the money they put it into the moon landing and we haven't gone back in fifty some odd years\nAnd the rockets or what happened to them and you know all these questions that people have it and when you start speculating they won't even allow you to speculate that it never happened\n\nThey'll tell you you're crazy they'll tell you you you need to go back to physics class\nWell\nYou look back at a pow Lebanon and you say to yourself well this is kind of interesting and you know with all the the deaths and the accidents before Apollo eleven we sent three guys out in the space and\nNothing really happened to them\nWe didn't lose any astronauts we didn't destroy any equipment in the process maybe on earth we did when the when the alarm on and you'll Armstrong almost killed himself in the lab and his wife said you're not going to the moon no way\nI Am honey I'm going to the moon no not after you crossed the lunar lander honor as well you know we're not we crashed it on earth but we're not gonna crash it on the moon ... trust me we're not going to do that\nI think the space shuttle blows up or astronauts are killed shot in the program for a year to figure out what the hell happened back then I I we got a timetable to meet you know Neal if you cross the lunar lander tough luck Charlie you're going up into space you're doing that one small step for man speech\nThat is what happened\nAnd you're going to do it with technology but for the equivalent of the computer technology in your toaster oven that's how we're going to do with guys and you're going to be sitting in something the size of a phone booth with those huge backpacks on your back here to take pictures of the moon was something called the oven Mitt and how are you going to do it well we got all figured out\nNow there's ... how is this going to be done without people questioning what we've got that I'll figure it out to no one will question it it'll be the most brilliant thing ever you're going to the moon and you know you're going to the moon and the American people know you're going to the moon except except\nThat [noise] there are a lot of things were going to tell them about how we're doing this magic [noise]\nAnd a lot of things were going to forget about once you've gone [noise]\nAnd we forget about it it'll it'll delay our moon program for maybe a hundred years [noise]\n\nI'm not kidding [noise]\nEven with the lawn mosque [noise]\nAnd all the other guy's trying your base are trying to get to the moon\nIs one thing in the media is Don telling you [noise]\nNone of this is

Louis [noise] you are listening to ground zero [noise] numbers\nTo call tonight [noise] AAA six Seventy three thirty seven hundred that's AAA six seven three thirty seven hundred [noise]\nYou know one of the first topics on ground zero that I did\nWas the debate over whether or not we went to the moon I was able to interview build casing one of the old timers you wrote the book about it [noise]\nIt was also referred to a bar several several was later on today and I beard was fraying a of Penn and teller Showtime special show where they actually make fun of conspiracy theorists I was they didn't really make\nFun of me all that much but they put me with a bunch of other guys were kind of bizarre\nAnd uh it really was kind of unnerving to watch but still I mean I I was one of the first talk show host I mean I only be art bell would have done this because our building I they were working together one time when I was on\nDoing a ground zero we're broadcasting on the Internet first shows broadcast on the Internet it was ground zero than our ... our bills show we had dreamland art bell\nAnd ah I don't believe there are bell was very supportive of me doing just doing the topic and Richard Hogan knew I was doing the topic and he laughed he thought it was funny but because he was telling me he says well yeah you know right off the bat you know people are already thinking just a minute we went on the moon but nobody that we didn't when we didn't go\nThere was a communist propaganda you know the you know whatever so\nI did the show and then uh I think it was February of two thousand one I was very surprised when Fox or did a special called conspiracy theory did we landed on the moon\nAnd uh\nThat changed the entire nature of the debate because this way main street and this is just a ... it's just a situation where a major network presented a conspiracy scenario without any serious re bottle it was reported this fact that and that made me feel uncomfortable because at least on my show\nAt least on my show I gave a balance I said okay you know I have my doubts but here's some people to try and convince you otherwise and uh\nI think it was still plate actually who you know got wind of all this and and ah he didn't like me [laughter] I don't think ah but if you if you see the old Penn and teller\nBS Showtime TV show\nWhere I'm On it talking about the moon landing right talking about the moon landing hoax or what have you a bill plates right there and I recommended him he was he's in the show or you don't have recommended because I really respected it but I thought it was awesome that he responded to my show\nAnd that he responded to my uh I wrote an article called good luck Mr Gore ski another other uh\nOther lives about the moon and uh it was just me you know what if it was just saying what if it's not that I Believe that totally I just had doubts\nSo having doubts I decided well I have a doubt they can say okay I Want to present this to people's oh man that was the ugliest thing I'd Jim oh bird from NASA right be a dirty letter I had I I just thought what the hell of a gun you know what ... what do I do\nSee at the time I was young I didn't care I thought well whatever you know now I'm older I care a lot about you know it was his views and [laughter] I just because I Love talking to people back then it was a man I'm just a young

Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon and twenty Fifteen and he said the NASA will test the new spacecraft was called the crew expiration vehicle by two thousand eight and conduct the first manned mission no later than twenty fourteen\n\nWell here we are four years after the fact nothing we don't we don't have men men started back on the moon again we're we're just really talking about saving for space to receive the same even land on the moon is this going to go around them\nBut the President Bush had a goal set of having a man on the moon living and working there by twenty twenty having a base there and it's not out of the question I mean if you're looking for Bigelow Aerospace is up to with\nMaking these inflatable moon basically I could have been done even um our space could've been done\nWell in two thousand nine we were told the NASA was carrying out this LCROSS experiment and they were lying to us about it about what they were using it for is that they were looking for ice on the move there are plenty of missions prior to the moon landing and plenty of missions like the Clementine mission where they were scouting out in the moon finding ice\nPockets and so they didn't need the LCROSS mission\nBut ah of course NASA had five hundred million to spend on a rocket who's gonna slam into the moon blow up and then a cause of created it's about six miles wide and uh you know people say oh my God they're going to new moon and they were going to do this two days or two days shy of the forty F anniversary of first landing on the moon\nAnd there was a lot of stuff about that mission that didn't add up didn't make any sense\nAnd\nIn twenty love and after the LCROSS mission failed rock Obama cut funding for the proposed constellation program and the space vehicles he he basically cancelled the five year nine billion dollar effort to build new Orion spacecraft an aries rockets\nNew space vehicles were slated to replace the masses three aging space shuttles and launch astronauts into orbit and onto the moon that was the thing but no Obama pulled the nine billion and they put the money towards better than I thought that climate change climate science\nSo Obama kill the space program in order to turn out in the climate change police and that's that's really sad I mean there was ever a time that we went to the moon at all that was the time because it you know they just shut down you know here we have this dream we're gonna probably money forward then Obama says not\nNot we're not going to go so here we are and twenty Eighteen again been told that the moon is the goal and later Mars\nTo news stories today that I Want to tell you about that really helped me excited but uh some bad news first of all a Russia seems to be out of their minds\nAh apparently they have detected what appear to be to colliding start\nAnd I think somewhere I have the sounds of the stars I'll Try and dig it up but uh yeah they detected these stars are putting off of sound gate of weird sound and are there going wait a minute or these really colliding stars are we looking at a space armada coming our way\nAnd if they're moving is asked we think they're going to be here by twenty twenty two\nWhich I'm not kidding Russia found these colliding stars\nSoccer stars and they before them out there saying well these are these look like cutting stars but the sounds are giving us she may have intelligence in them so they may not be colliding stars at all\nWhat are they are there are ... there are no mater of of huge space craft coming our way\nUm\nNASA also reporting today at Seventeen scientists often report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national mission\n\nThe briefing was offered by the national academies of Science Engineering and medicine it emphasizes the importance including astrobiology the study about life originated on earth and how it might evolve elsewhere in the University of every phase of all NASA missions destined for space from inception conceptualization to planning to development and operation\nSo once again we're Seventeen signed the saying guess what guys every mission that we do from now on is going to have the purpose of finding life out in space\n\nOnce again every mission is going to be about finding a life in space to have to have a a quest of finding a life in space Russia says they picked up on to quote colliding stars but maybe a space armada heading our way\n\nSo I Believe that the reason why this is happening why they're saying hey every mission has to have a fact finding life giving whatever is because they have confidence that there's intelligent life out there and the recent reports of techno signatures in fast ... actually it's fast radio burst or the motivation behind the quest\n\nI don't know that it has anything to do with these colliding stars are possible are modest coming our way but it certainly has a lot to do with the techno signatures and get this\nAstrophysicist are now\n... with all the thousands of exoplanets out there and and how they're uncovering new insights into complex the diversity of life on earth\nThe authors also sit in the briefing that not only are you going to be looking for techno signatures guys we want you to look for bio signatures [laughter]\nSo this is pretty amazing don't you think I mean I think it's cool I mean this bolsters the chance at life could exist out there\nAstronauts to the moon and Mars and back however\nIt costs twelve point two billion dollars to develop and launch this rocket first mission and they're saying it's running years behind schedule it faces major cost overruns on Wednesday government auditors published report highlighting problems with the work of NASA in Boeing they're the biggest contractors for the SOLs\nReport flags sixty four million dollars in extra fees worn by NASA slam bowling for poor performance and question the long term sustainability the super rocket program\nThe report even cause of the question is sustainability of the entire project meaning that even with all the right ideas and design the rocket won't even make it off the launch pad to the moon making making this newly manned moon project a pipe dream\nMean auditors put so much blame for the high costs the liaison bowling\nOne of the contractors the company is responsible for about fifty six percent of the new rockets cost but it's years behind schedule and delivering the biggest section of the rocket [noise] and [noise] I mean there's just puts you off I mean does it does give you more doubts as to whether or not we went to the moon in the first place\nCome on if we're supposed to be on the moon and twenty Fifteen according to George Bush brought
