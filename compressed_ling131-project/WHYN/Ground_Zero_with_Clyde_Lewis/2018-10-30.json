really liked the cartoon growing up and then also even the first major turtles movie I saw that so many times I really I really enjoyed it\nOf people thought it was kind of intense and violent at the time if you go back and and check it out you'll you'll see what I mean but it was a good movie I really enjoyed it\nAnd it's a really creative concept who would think that turtles in a nuclear

up shields Hi Gary\nGary she'll try to you know I'm so glad you liked the blinders on I really I really do enjoy it I I think it's a very entertaining very well done very entertaining show a little bleak for sure but\nIt's ah it's well executed the writing is good and and there's some very interesting twists and turns in it I I started watching the third season\nOf daredevil all over the weekend which I Would have to say you know the thing about daredevil is that it it's also a little bit dark a little bleak I think it's well executed for what it is\nI just can't understand how they made daredevil such a compelling show at Netflix and they made iron fist which was just on washable garbage in iron fish was crash it's also a superhero story also set of New York same\nYou know platform with Netflix you'd think they'd have some idea how to do it the iron fist got cancelled and thank heavens because it was such\nA piece of of waste\nAnd ah anyway but yeah I have to say I think that daredevil three so far as the little slow and getting going but so far it's it's pretty well done\nI find the acting all very good I I enjoy the performance is even if you're not that into super hero stuff I think you might like daredevil I I think you might find daredevil to be a pretty good show a\nCarla ... the other day with a B loved her comment about someone writing his comments about the
