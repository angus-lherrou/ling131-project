we could do with these invaders before they get to our border is pre position all the materials necessary to build a tent city I mean living quarters shower facilities messed facilities port a potties\nFood water betting clothing everything have the grounds all staked out and ready for construction and bring in Sheriff Joe to supervise the whole thing along with all this we should bring in ten or twenty functional FEMA trailers\nThat can use the temporary courtrooms that have all the judges\nAlready there to adjudicate any claims and all of for sanctuary status right there none of this come back we're three and three or four years for hearing bull crap I early on you know you're you're actually much more solution oriented than a lot of other people who think they are on this issue because the problem is not that\nWe don't have enough people to catch people at the border from this caravan the problem is that they will turn themselves in and claim false asylum that's what they will do right so it's not decision oh we need more people to catch them I don't think I don't think everybody really really get that part of this\nYes they may be initially prosecuted for illegal entry if they don't show at a port of entry if they just try to cross the border but think about the the value proposition from their side\nIf you get close to the U.S Mexico border and you're a Honduran as part of this caravan\nYou can either just try to sneak in the United states free and clear or if you get caught then you say oh well I'm claiming asylum defensive asylum is what they call it I'm I'm I needed a song and you will still get process for the illegal entry but that's a misdemeanor and they're not going to deport you for that and so you've had your asylum hearing\nSo you really get two shots to stay in the U.S under the system as it is now and we do need much speedier process uh but keep in mind how do you even here these\n... properly they're not providing any ... any specific documentation of a threat against him they just tell a story and the question is is their story compelling so butter or in your ear at least thinking about this and the right way which is that if we had a a a set up at\nThe border where it was essentially you know when they have the a producer Mike knows about this they got the uh courthouse under the the eagles the eagles play you know the football stadium they have a courthouse in the stadium for all the drunken brawl so their take you write down there and\nYou know you get justice dispense right away you get your fine or you go to jail or whatever\nSo it it sort of like that at the border would be what are what you can do so or when you're\nYou're on the right track my friend\nBryan writes bucks still laughing out loud about trying to mediate discussion on the heated topic between crystal in Kansas we're actually well beyond time can just did an incredible job\nHolding her ground oh to be a fly on the wall pre and post that segment canisters spheres no there's no two ways about it I mean she\nYou know you can come at her with with everything you've got and I'll tell you look crystal from the left is also very tenacious\nSo it was quiet and I could tell a lot of you that does all this but it was quite a thing it was quite a thing that uh that happened by the way there's a rumor that junk weaker from the young church maybe there tomorrow\nAnd while I'm not planning to be in any way hum disrespect floor aggressive ah I have a feeling we will disagree profusely on some issues I have a feeling that could very well happen so we will see a\nJosh but I Want to thank you for writing my day after long stressful day it's nice to listen in on the drive home you're accurate\nDepiction of Hillary Clinton's

and I didn't expect a call but I don't even remember what he was calling for like they I guess they put up something unknown going on or whatever\nAnd it was the first time I ever had a call reporting some sort of a vampire attack even take some of the attack that I got a lot of people wrote me said this is this is the guard um\nAnd some people even terrified to go this is not the zombie apocalypse

delivery him\nWith something that uh that some people just go mad and they freak out I mean it's the season I guess but it's also you know it's one of the many stories that my opinion raised concern over what evil influence seems to be pervasive this year I mean this year is being the weirdest here for a lot of things\nHalloween of course is a fun time of the year it's fun for me at this year reality to seems to be turning out just some of the most terrifying some of those chilling story that sound like they they they belong in a horror movie\nUm it was reported last week that thirty eight unintended corpses were left to rot in Detroit funeral home loving dead babies including ten feet this is ...\nWe're hitting in the ceiling last week there the remains were discovered over the course of a week\nAs workers were clearing out the basement the remains of the babies were found in the drop ceiling of the funeral home on friday\n\nThe state of Michigan close the mortuary six months ago

strange shadowy through your in the night but the stories of running courses and blood feeding children proceeding men\nAs let the little ... fell away and I tell you I was listening today to a talk show um colleague of mine they were discussing briefly the origins of Halloween and whether or not to say panic holiday or the holiday for fun and festivities\nSomeone brought up but the Halloween seizes a mixed bag of both Christian in pagan traditions that evolved over time it actually it actually was a time uh that was ... it was a it was actually observed ... yourself and evil spirits that's what it was for it was observed as they fall festival silent\nUm some people say Sam Hain but it's really salads brown sounding\nSummers in [noise] so you have this festival the Celts actually celebrated his first [noise] and then later Christian missionaries used it as an opportunity to learn more or actually to teach people about Christian heroes and murders and so it turned into a festival of not only morning off spirits but remembering the dead [noise]\nIn one by one they plan to drink their blood in one by one they planned to eat their flesh these are two\nMiddle school gr\nAnd they said they worship the devil and how is the how was it they were turned on to this\n\nWhat was the influence where do they influence come from and why is it now which is I mean\nIt was it was just you know we we were talking about this parasitic\nEvil is parasitic evil that\nYou know they they can be a part of everyone's life to the once you allow yourself to be infected\n\nYou know if you allow yourself to be infected you allow whatever it is to get in\nAnd you know when I had a ... when we were on the other night talking about the the parasitic evil okay we're talking about that the other night I didn't even get to half of what I wanted to talk about and the reason why was because of the fact that it was just there were just so many things\nAh you know in ... was on the show so many things that we didn't cover so many things that he wanted to talk about so many things you know we're talking about mental disorders and possessions\nYou know that there's a fine line it's not always obvious in in many cases I mean medicine claims they okay it's ... it's psychosis and of course spiritual realms tell you that you could be possess\n\nBut in the in the ancient writing so I get them out of the smaller car which is the switches hammer ... the Catholics added and all these other you know books they said that vampires and we're ... we're in effect part of\nSome blood disorders some blood disease then they had no idea what it was and this is where we got the vampire legend is from\n\nAn empire legends are are basically we all beliefs that blood\nBlood was polite blood ... any blood was tainted blood tainted blood would eventually create a profane rubbed in preacher\nOf empire\nNot only that it was just like there was just like a ... the chemical were using a blood and of course seaman or or it's a fluid of life was going hand in hand\nSo whenever they said do not lose your virtue what they were talking about do you not lose your blood do not give your blood to anyone hold your blood to you\nDo not defy all someone else with your seaman or your seed that is because that is part of the life's blood within you your fluids are important that was what they are ... and the thing is is that\nYou know we all believe the spirit Stevens in devil's possessing an impregnated even killing their victims you can say well you can compare it to\nA lot of what we hear about microbes and viruses in worms and everything and that that's killing people but it's also getting in there and he's doing all kinds of I think strange mind games to people and and I think that it's turning them into monsters cannibals maybe vampires I don't know [noise]\nYou're the call from the guy the other night said he was bitten by why would the guy by to me to get beat into my head

weren't thinking there was going to be a school shooting\nSomething bad is going to happen so the police were aware that something was going to happen and uh\nSo and somebody had warned that would be a a something bad is going to go down in building five hundred in the middle school or they're in a bar to bar to middle school or the staff immediately began to search the campus they found two girls in the bathroom\nThe girls were holding a goblet which should've been a string of suspect who's going to be used to drink alcohol but uh once they're in the principal's office the girls empty their pockets and in their pockets where a knife knife sharpening her a pizza cutter\nUm they also found a butter knife or in the girls said they had a bag they carry two admitted the two girls had been planning to kill students\nAs they entered the bathroom and when asked about motivation the girls said well we worship the devil according to police the girls plan to drink their victims blood out of the goblet they were found with they also discussed eating their victims flesh and living body parts of the schools entrance before killing himself\nAnd now you know there's always good for a scary

Sam ... says Sam hey not some people call Sam hey I used to say I mean for the longest time it's our in\nA meeting summers in but then the Christian missionaries came along and they use as an opportunity to learn about the Christian heroes and martyrs so that day was set aside to remember the Christian heroes and martyrs in fact the day after Halloween was observed as a moment to
