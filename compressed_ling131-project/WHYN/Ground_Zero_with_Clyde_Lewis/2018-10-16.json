I was gonna say a flock of ... but now I'm mixing things up a like a school of angry raging ...\nOn us or that they they would have torn apart if he had\nAgreed to what they said he should agreed to about one statement you made or another better just stand and fight and constantly push back on these issues these things that I'm learning from Trump isn't just like all of you\nI have to adapt my approach and my thinking for the the current moment I have to actually think about what's working what's not working and I I reevaluate I'll say one of the most important lessons I've seen one of the biggest\nUh differentiate or is when it comes to whether someone is successful or not is do they have the capacity for self correction\nOr do they have the ability to look at whatever they're doing in life how they're treating themselves how they're treating other people or how they are doing their work or whatever how how they're taking care of their health\nAn objectively assess what is going right what is not what is going wrong are not going well and make changes\nAnd I'm constantly making changes I mean I have a core principles and a and an approach and an east coast but I'm counting making changes to what I think is going to to work best in this this ideological fight I mean that's really what I Do hear everyday yes I like to present information and there's an aspect of this that's\nA really just about dare I say ... community right we're all a community here on the show um but there's also how can I equip\nThose listen to the show with the best arguments possible and equip them also with the knowledge that they are in fact correct in their beliefs either ... explain not just what we should all think about different issues but why we should think that way\nSo I think that's all very very important um and and yeah I I Am also in a process of of learning all the time I don't want to ever make it seem like I'm just the one guy who thinks that he's doing it the right way and and it's never adjusting I'm adjusting all the time\nBrad writes dear book I just read that Hillary Clinton security clearance revoked at her request\nI was wondering what are your thoughts on this are and why in the world would she make such a request especially if she's planning on running again in twenty twenty\nI'm a loyal podcast listeners and wanted to thank you for releasing ... earlier so us folks up here in Alaska and listen to it on the way home ... thanks for keeping us in the know Brad a well Brett first of all I'm so glad you liked the pockets as out sooner\nAnd I'm hoping that everybody in the west coast knows that we're pretty much now our podcast is going up for this show for the buck sex and show in drive time on the west coast\nSo ... there's no problem with you decide and that you're going to just get a little bit ahead of the game and a and listening to it a little early ... you don't have to wait wait for it to be rebroadcast her to be broadcast on whatever stations near you you can listen to it on the\nOn the podcast however you consume puck is\nUh and so that's great news and you're listening up in Alaska that way and as for keeping everybody in the no I certainly try Hillary and her security clearance\nLook let's just let's just call it where it is Hillary should never have been able to keep a security clearance after the debacle that occurred with her private email server private email account all that stuff and that was just\nCompletely ... it should've been terrifically embarrassing or for anybody not just associated with Hillary Clinton but who was willing to defend that nonsense\nThat she held to a new clearance until this point just goes to show you how broken the system is\nOr mind you all that just this Friday I Will be doing an event with my friends at Stanford research will be about what's coming next in the markets and\nBig big things to tell you about I'll be joining them for a full\nLive event this Friday just go to book event dot com free to register folks totally free you can watch the whole thing register for free all free\nBook events dot com and getting ...

can't you just talk about things openly without having people have to assume you're one side of the other side of the label which were canned beans as far as I'm sure can't peas\nIt's not you know it about a week ago\nI'm a\nShow was about ready to drop the records and uh I I was talking about the deep state\nAnd one of the things that bothers me about the state is that it's it's the most overused term since false flag a because\nWell because of shows like Alex Jones but because of uh what people say and what they think that they'd be like a a big big like a false flag is like\nA didn't really happen so it's a false flag that's not a false flag okay and I've always felt told people tell people that is not a false flag but of course you know a lot of ignorance is bred when people tend to think that one thing means another thing and and they ... the people the defining their own terms\nYou know they're they're defining what is a conservative they're finding what is the liberal people don't even know anymore I mean really do\nIt and and they don't know what are you a critical analysis that are objectivity anymore because if somebody says one day\nThat he can't stand you know Donald Trump being a noxious because he is he's obnoxious there's no doubt in my ... he's he's he's obnoxious he's obviously is obnoxious okay so he's not noxious president you say so it was going out or do I was ... liberal will come on\nEven if you're conservative you have to admit she's help noxious if you can't you're you're not being genuine you're not being being disingenuous\nAnd you know ... if you're like saying you can't say that Hillary Clinton is obnoxious ... your your disingenuous\nShe is obnoxious she's up boxes Donald Trump's obnoxious but the only difference between Hillary Clinton Donald Trump is that Donald Trump is president United States and he was voted in by the people that's the difference okay and as your obnoxious president\nWe're supposed to ah criticized him for things that he does wrong and we do a same with ... and I said the same about Barack Obama and people say I like where I go by the time and say look you know bronco bombers our president and um\nWe should try to give them some time given the honeymoon and he deserves but you know we didn't give Donald Trump the honeymoon for sure [laughter] no [laughter] hey nobody gave him a honeymoon and a\nAnd one of the things that's interesting is that you know between the false flag a nomenclature being bastard dies the other was the other ones the deep state because they think it's an invention of Donald Trump and it's not\nIn fact the deep state was a shadow government one time there is also the dark state there's also a what is it that dark command\nThere are several names so that each state is just a deep state stuck with Donald Trump what's most troubling about this accusation is that certainly the tactic being used as somehow discredit conspiracy theorists and others in the media feels are right wing extremist pushing the ever present persecution complex of the president listen uh\nLet me just tell you that back when the Democrats were in power there's a vast right wing conspiracy now uh now that the debt that the Republicans are in power there's a vast left wing conspiracy so is it or or no it's just there's a conspiracy\nAnd what it is is that it's it's meddling from the deep state operatives all over the world not just here in the United states not just Russia\nIt's all over the world there's these deep state players\nYou wanted to come in and undermine this country and they undermine that by by programming a weirdos to actually go on to Facebook pages and start declaring a certain person has a certain type of a leading toward a certain type of ideology in in politics which isn't the case because when you are doing a conspiracy\nAnalysis of geopolitical players\nYou couldn't talk about anybody and say what they do is good or bad and there's always somebody there they will tell you well obviously this is how you think all the time no it's not and so when you're looking at the deep state\nIt's it's not an American delusion ... if it's not you know ... is it is a worldwide phenomenon okay the deep state on a global level right now\nIs needed in order for the elites to salvage what they called the liberal international order which pure and simple as new speak for newer over liberal conservative whatever it might be it is a new world order and it's being established down conspiracies done really trying to overthrow\n... and they tried to overthrow many presidents including bronco bomb and so they're overthrowing bronco bothering him you know overthrowing George Bush\nOr in fact they successfully a I think uh they they successfully were able to a command and also a puppet George W. Bush when he was in power it's obviously did that and a bronco bottom of the same they were able to ... him as well they puff it at a mall\nOr the only difference between them and Donald Trump is Donald Trump's stubborn\nDonald Trump stubborn and he doesn't know how to play the game of ah you know the deep state politics which is a dangerous thing for him and he doesn't care\nBut what I worry about it as if he doesn't care how does that fair with the American people in the deep state do to try and change all this while we see what they do they they mail rice and out to a out to people to scare them\nThey uh they they go in and they they do these are classic kids you know of a of a noted officials being killed people involved with a certain insight into ideology they that's how it works sixteen states in control so whatever you say about politics however I lean left writer or upside down I don't care\nI Know that there is something above it all there is a sin are above it all but certainly as controlling this country and is trying to control the world so all we're arguing various ah you know or arguing a over various ideologies that we don't like or that we're thinking we're leaning towards\nYou know the conspiracy is there\nTo metal in the affairs of nations all over the world that are struggling to keep their sovereignty and this is why there are few oligarchy\nOr willing to buy up in support chaos in the world and this is why we're now seeing in our major cities\nGang violence mob takeover and radicalized factions within separate strongholds\nAnd we're also seeing is on the Internet as well where people can't help themselves but to try and be mean to one another because somebody has a different ideologies and they do\nInstead of being a little bit more open a little bit more willing to talk things out see the warning of a major collapse the United states is not being heated and it's going on right now because there are many of the radicalized factions and they're quick to blame each other for the problems in the country and not the bad actors on the world stage they wish to see American cities burn\nAnd that's where they want to do they want to see American cities burn the truth is there are many Americans\nThat have been touched by the secret hyper power who wants to further the clutching covered his seizing of world controls against the wishes of the majority\n\nThe psychological damage has been done to this country\nWill take a generation or more to change and that if you're a people will stop and realize they've all been victims of massive know cis brainwashing chips it's dividing marriages it's dividing man and woman is that it's dividing political allies it's dividing it all\nThe deep state has always been\nA refuge for rogue intelligence operators\nThat worked for many of the countries that we have said that we said that are they they are our allies we said these are these we allied with these people but yet they're rogue intelligence ops that work within our allies the groups that say that they were friends but they've succeeded in developing ways the heightened suggested abilities subservient in the world\nAnd with the failure of the fourth estate\nAnd it controls that are now in place has been crucial in creating a warm climate politically motivated violence politically correct speech political dismissive talking points political fanaticism manufactured racial tension for political gain pseudo science or feared lack of goal resources and a whole hell of a lot of fear mix up we have a whole held a lot of fighting going on [noise]\nThat I got to admit to you I'm damned tired tonight you know why because I spent my weekend reporting about riots in my hometown of Portland, Oregon [noise]\nI

the flashpoint a will to power that ended in destruction and violence and it ended up in a huge war\nWhere young people were sacrifice in order to empower the leaders with a blood bond where the blood bond or a blood cement they would hold their grip on a frightened world the American people\nHave actually managed to solidly adapt\nTo intolerant ideologies to dissent all these forms a\nOf of a you know groups that are supposed to represent neo Nazis and fascists in and then we have the anti fascist and the left wing umbrella of its shades communism and and all these factions fighting together thinking there's one side of the other side wouldn't reality that there is no one side of the other side there are several factions within both sides\nAnd everybody's trying to identify them is one thing but you can't anymore\nI mean what are your conscious of it or not\nYou can say that doing this dividing and fighting his anti liberty it really turns out to be very difficult for the media under center except that's why they say well we have these guys over here that are out right and we have these counterprotesters the hour they never say who they are\nI've never I mean maybe I can find someplace by every time I have never heard anti far being spoken up by the media\nAnd you know the only ones I hear about are Proud Boys in anti ... but there's also others and you know we have to learn and we have to remember that there are two main\nDangers to liberty right now one that comes from the left and when that comes from the right and that is this bond receive from the Warren groups of the city's literally\nAdapting there's blood cement back in time in Germany and Hitler was blue kites they called the blue the kite boot kites meaning blood Senate meaning that the leaders would commit acts of accidents murder and violence and the others would follow suit\nAnd that's what's happening now we have a little blue type going on in in the deep state certainly is breathing this boots kites and we are\nHaving a little something called fascism and and ah and fighting a this is this is how we do terrorism American style this is our new civil instability or instability was reduced incivility uh American so\nI mean\nYou know the jak boots of course are coming from our own people now be enforced is their own people police show up I mean this kind of stand there and wait kind of a referee between the factions fighting\nBut here we are following the footsteps of or well we're following the footsteps of does the U.S ski we're following in the footsteps of all these guys who forewarned us\nAs well I mean given all we know about what's going on and given all we know about the new world order and what it's going to do and what the new I mean this is this is the example of new world order it trade citizens like faceless statistics\nAnd economic units to be bought sold barter traded in track\n\nAnd it lies the system why is it cheats it steals it spies it kills breaks laws over reaches authority abuses its power almost every turn and they love to violent\nTheir empire so what they do is they create wars they they ah\nThey take over everything they they're they're swallowing up everything little by little and so we have this deep state that is a\nMyth super powered worldwide deep state of global industrial deep state\nAnd so it might get like you know network where uh the\nMid ... says there are no Russians are Arnold countries there are no ... there is no west there's only one organized system systems and that's money and that's takeover and that's dominance\n\nAnd that's that that that's become becoming true you know conspiracy theory but it's becoming a a a true thing\nFor everybody\nAnd that's what's the most terrifying as it is it's very true ideology we we were first afraid of terrorists now we're afraid of each other we're afraid of the rising up\n\nRising up the middle eastern terrorists now it's us but\nNeeds to be careful because you know we have a fourth estate it's failed us\n\nAnd and what they have they have these controls in place now would you be crucial in creating a warm climate of politically motivated violence\nMay want you to speak politically correct speech politically been dismissive talking points political fanaticism I mean we manufacture racial tension we for fifty one people that we don't like we\nBurn the books in the same places we burn people\nAnd it's because of the global establishment has risen up against the people and the people responded by radicalizing political ideology that by all intents and purposes is eating us from the inside out\n\nAnd we have a large number of people always cannot be Gabby happy with themselves and let's say pressure other ... other people into believing

Amazon gift show gets ... junkie show ...\n... you know you had a the Turks came out ... showed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise] well if they knew\nThat these guys were there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stop them so I think you have a the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen\nBut what does it ring true to me is have you ever heard of a of any nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill\nMore people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true but Trump is a between a rock and a hard spot now because you're coming up on the mid term elections\nAnd they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back or you can see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly\nAnd the price of gasoline would skyrocket would have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to\nLessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot this hasn't the stock market been dropping\nWhat was it like I said this is an example of worldwide be stay manipulation heat is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump it's about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence\nWith this ... this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go bust\nWell\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy\nShouldn't we look at another indicators the price of gold\nGold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to Laurel\nCan be a very bad day in the stock market if if this thing somehow starts to escalate now how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ... is the Saudi citizens and he was actually in a Saudi embassy which\nMakes him on Saudi territory we have no authority over that\nWe shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states is of no consequence the president states has really no authority\nTo retaliate against Saudi Arabia but you don't watch him get pressured to do something and you know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to leak the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey has said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and they flew his remains I Can't remember the ... too but uh they move them out of the country\nApplied if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it will\nProbably do the same reason or you say that you would have been a he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can't get in there and empathy and do anything about it\nWell but you're making the argument that that may be the CIA let this happen that\nThey are making the argument the CIA was facilitating operation deep late ... argument that he said operatives the IRA were facilitators to the murder of this uh uh of of cars Yogi\nAnd of course Saudi Arabian as a ... said operators were involved here as well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed to what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple or our country even more because the Trump is pressure to do anything\nIt's going to bring up gas prices and it's going to bring up a inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that could happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you would want an instant this incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia is\nThe thing that I have a feeling we do need to do that well I have a feeling though that's what they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you got Bolton who certainly was a signatory on the project for the new American Century and if they moved him into another George W.
