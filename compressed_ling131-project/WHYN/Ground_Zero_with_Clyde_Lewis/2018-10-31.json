these days people are coming up with all kinds of creative creative possible solutions to the situation at the southern border uh I think that one would probably go too far even for Trump though that's my sense of a thank you so much reading and my friend made dean rides\nAnd but I Know I Know he was kidding I Know he was getting I just I didn't want to step on the man's thought process ... so I\nMoved to the next roll call Maria right does it make you wonder where all the anti gun folks are after the synagogue shooting they usually don't miss an opportunity to spin that narrative ... they are already out spending a narrative perhaps not quite\nAs clearly as they have or as a in full throated a fashion that they have in the past I think that's mostly because the anti gun anti Second Amendment left knows enough\nTo know that right now there are Democrats who are in some tight races in states where a gun rights are very much\nA supported by folks who vote and so they don't want to create more problems the Democratic party right now that's the only reason I think\nYour honestly not seeing more shrew a anti gun commentary in the media while you're not seeing more people running around protesting and all that kind of stuff\n... right I'm a proud member of team buck Israel thanks for unwavering support for Jewish people everywhere feeling the love ... love his real so I'm Glad you're feeling it thank you very much for writing in from teen book Israel and please spread the word to your Israeli brothers and sisters that we would love\nTo have more and more of them listening in on the podcast joining in on the freedom hutch a\nAries my buddy ... bought this weekend the leftist media including fake tapper have proven their either agenda driven subversive spend on tearing the country apart for their own purposes or completely stupid and insane\nThere is no simple misunderstanding or a difference of opinion on this point by calling Trump's nationalistic rhetoric anti Semitic they're\nLiterally feeding into and agreeing with the talking points of anti Semitic groups\nLike the Nazis the nation of Islam and ... who say Jews cannot be loyal to their country et cetera et cetera uh yeah the media has been a horrific on this aries and a chapter has\nEmbarrassed himself insofar as he spent so much time reading this oh I'm such a serious newsman brand I have no bias or a legion he's a nasty snide little fellow and does a lot of stuff in public that is meant for public consumption but I can tell you that a behind the scenes not a nice guy not a good guy\nAnd that's all you really need to know\nUh and it's made a joke of his old show I mean he had somebody on saying that ISIS has not radicalize as many people as Trump and let it go didn't immediately say well well you can't say that on here so that's all you really need to know about some\nOf these books John book I've been following all the quote justified violence from the left I Know how to beat it\nAh the anti ... and be all end folks are just paid thugs they don't really want to fight they just won't Republicans to fight back to defend themselves so the left can point the finger at the right and say see their their violence fascist they're willing to be bloody than be not for it\nThe real way to beat this has to follow the money why can't people with the right skill sets infiltrate these groups at a high level and expose the leaders and expose the money\nAh John following the money is very important that is why we had our friends rocking cut some on yesterday to talk about who is trying to fund these are the\nFund the caravan organized the care of and there are definitely people work and I think they are definitely people that are putting money into this just a question of finding out who they are so I got to find the money and we're certainly looking into it\nWill be right seems like everybody forgot how the media were searching for a Tea Party member called James Holmes after the Colorado shooting yes Willie I remember that there have been efforts to try and tie the Tea Party to violence and they were unsuccessful because the Tea Party was a remarkably not

civic or how much civic responsibility there was in the Tea Party movement\nUm shoes ... right you're so right on the DSD I've got the real thing and I'll trade might be TST in for election loss

are dirty and unclean and all this\nThat's not what anyone should say or or is saying who's reasonable on this issue but there are concerns about vaccination a lack of vaccination of some of these Margaret populations\nAnd there have been diseases that have been propping up popping up across the country that were thought to have been eradicated not in large numbers but it's something to think about\nAnd they don't want to have this discussion and the people that want to get the CDC more involved want the facts out there and there are a lot of\nImmigration activists on the left who don't care\nAnd think that this was either ally which it is not there are people who are going to be having different levels of vaccination that that come into the country as part of these caravans of and
