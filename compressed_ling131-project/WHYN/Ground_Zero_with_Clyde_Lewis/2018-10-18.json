I mean I don't know if anybody remembers me let's see if I remembered it okay somebody else or there would be saying this now I went back I went back to somebody shows to try and find it I couldn't find it where I said it\n\nPlayed I I did say I I Swear I said and then um I asked my friend Sarah said that I say this is she listened to the show and I think she called me and she said uh how how does this what what what about the space armada thing\nAnd I and so I remember her calling me she remembers calling me because I asked her about it\nAnd so I tend to take some of these strange stories I just I bookmark them and I put them in my in a file right\nAnd so I came in this morning after I had lunch or actually he was afternoon after I had lunch with my friend John and I went to look for that story because I Want it to you know I wanted to\nFind the the the guy who emailed me tweeted me are sent me a message saying I'd found the story of this is all I got\nBut I looked all over the Web today I ... I just search tying little all over the Web\nTyping in key words armada space armada stark clusters Russian scientists the stark clusters the big bear alien armada think their daily information or something UFO formation\nCould not find story at all sure he was gone\nI welcome you to try and find the story on Google if you're near a computer and send it to me on Twitter is set up to me and my in my Facebook feed I I'm more than happy\nTo uh you know\nBig Mitt that maybe it is there but I cannot find that story\nCan't find that story\nSo it was like one of those off the cuff comment so I didn't do any research on I'm thinking well I Want to do research on this I Want to find out more can't find a damn thing\nSo last night\nI don't know if I'm any of you know this but there was a full worldwide shutdown of YouTube last night\n\nAnd I got an email from a guy named Scott ... emails me all the time and he kept mentioning the story about or have you seen this video this video is going around the Internet this video of a guy he's in a uniform even military and you say that something is about to hit the moon\nSome large object is about to hit the moon well apparently\nThis is the this is a conspiracy theory this is a conspiracy theory cause I cannot confirm it so it's a conspiracy theory meaning that since I Can't confirm it but it's weird that I think I'm having some sort of a mental breakdown or something I don't know what's going on here but\nUm there are rumors flying around as to why the this this this this outage occurred last night\nAnd the cheap rumor is that viral video\n\nThe viral video of a guy something on YouTube release the report of the show a man in uniform announcing that something large he didn't asteroid a rock a UFO I dunno something large was about to crash into the moon\n\nAs I said I was notified by email and Scott if you're listening please sit in that email again and I want I Want to know if you send an email too because I read your email sometimes they don't reply to them but I read your emails and Scott you know you are I'm Talking right to you\n\nI Want to know where that video is about man or that that footage of something hitting the moon\n\nBecause from what I understand is that they shut down you two\nLast night\nThey shut down YouTube last night because of that video\nThey didn't want that video to go viral so they had to shut down the system do they won't tell anybody why the system shut down it just shut down because they wanted to weed out any and all of these videos going around that would show something hitting the moon\n\nNow if I Can't find proof of this and I can't find a video or I Can't find the story about the armada stark clusters and the Russians and the R. T. story\nIt all sounds like some science fiction misinformation\n\nMaybe got leaked out it wasn't supposed to be heard of touched or ... or or thought about right so\nThe science fiction is information maybe maybe some history to play a joke on people\nBut\nI mean\nIs it really was it really science fiction misinformation really because of the circumstances it just seems a little odd Russians say they see be stark let's just say but they don't want to start clusters they look like you remember me saying this didn't remember me saying this on the air\nSo I was talking about the neutrinos coming out of Antarctica right and I said oh and now they're saying that Russia ... look like our motto UFOs blah blah blah blah blah you remember I said something about that haven't been able to find that\nQuote but I have a friend who said you did say it okay I did say it\n\nI said it and then the shutdown of YouTube and a mysterious email not really mysterious as a guy who sends me emails all the time saying that he saw video in fact donors check my email and see if he's on this year to see if he wrote me back I Want to find out to be listening to me if he's writing me back I mean\nI'm you know he has been written has not\nWait a minute [noise]\nSomebody sent me some better rushing star cluster [noise]\nNo that's not in jail thank you but this is the story [noise] this is your story [noise] I'm thinking of somebody sent me a [noise]\nA something about a Russian star cluster that joke curry who I met in Virginia [noise]\nAmazing woman you know she that's not a I'm Sorry sorry [noise]\nNo nothing Scott if you're listening man you got to tell me did you see that video something hitting the moon hitting the moon last night [noise]\nBecause I hear that that was the reason why they shut down you too [noise]\nAnd I'm feeling I'm honestly and this has been for a fact I Am feeling really nervous than I I'm I feel it in my neck I feel tension in my neck something definitely is weird about this whole thing\nI mean as I say\nIt'd be science fiction disinformation it could be something else\nI'm Still looking for the proof will be backed them\nGo coast to coast am with George Mallory mornings at one at a news radio five sixty W.

it's kind of follow the right now\nOkay so so okay so the whole\nRussia thing from Russia Today I went to look for the notes and\nNothing done nothing\nSo something weird happened last night too\nAnd this is this is the this is from a read a page or write\nA reading his reporting that there was a fall worldwide shutdown of YouTube last night there was because we were having a hard time preparing our show because a lot of that stuff we use for a montage has been for a music in liners and stuff we get from you too\nAnd we get the audio from you too we couldn't get audio last night for a lot of things because you too but ... had been shut down full worldwide shutdown of YouTube\nAnd there are rumors flying around as to why this outage happened and one of the cheap rumors is and I'll read it directly from a ... this this is from\nRead it okay\nIf anyone has the footage of the man in uniform warning of an impact on the moon last night before you to shut down and took it off please share\nSo the rumor is that YouTube\nHad to shut down a viral video of a man in uniform there was pointing out that the moon was about to be struck by something\nOr he didn't say what it was he didn't have ... ... people say they thought it was like it had a hundreds of thousands of hits and then it was taken down and then all of a sudden you to shut\nDown okay\nSo that's a mystery that's tacked onto this you know I was notified by an email a guy named Scott who told me I got to go back and see ... ... email us Scott told me he says have you seen this video he was mentioning the video he said it to me like five six team\nOkay okay All right\nSo we have you seen this video and and I and I didn't know what he was talking about\nAll right so\nYou to shut down to the moon get hit by an asteroid or was it as a cyber attack here's another Youtube video saying was shut down because of this whole moon\nThing okay\nSo I mean I'm getting now I'm getting bombarded with emails and all kinds of other pointers and and and references to what happened last night with you to shut down\nUh [noise]\nSo that's something that's mysterious something had crashed on the moon and they didn't want anybody you see it hit the moon so they shut down you to keep you from watching it because it was going viral\nNow\nIt's like I said that sounded like a lot of science fiction misinformation right and and the fact that you can go back and reference things but I Do know what I talked about two nights ago I Do know I played those homes I Do know that I played a frequent feed it was being sent by the so called armada\nAnd\nThis armada apparently that sounds coming from is shut down the radio stations a couple across the country now YouTube shuts down okay it's back up again today\nBut all this reminded me of an old science fiction film called earth versus the flying saucers and what happens in that film is that rockets and missiles and satellites all get shut down because the aliens are planning to arrive there plenty of land\nAnd so I got to thinking about what's been happening\nIn the past few days first of all the Russian rockets so use them as can\nFeel the launch on its way to the IOC says according to a statement that was released by NASA but so use that as Ken spacecraft watch from about ... nor Cosby drumming Kazakhstan to the international space station for forty ... am eastern daylight time Thursday October eleven\nOr carrying American ass right near Kagan Russian cause not Alex C\nO and should shortly\nAfter launch it was an anomaly with the booster and the launch ascent was aborted resulting in a ballistic lending up a spacecraft\nLaunched\nTo be going smoothly but about Ninety seconds later NASA on his life's dream reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation\nThe space agency tweeted the ballistic descended above the sharper angle of landing compared to normal the cats will continue the abstract successfully separated from the rocket booster and parachute into the ground with the rescue teams were there to pick them up it's also interesting to know the two of NASA's important space telescopes when did the safe mode\nShutting down about sending information back\nBut the shawndra X ray observatory when did the same boat and hope that all the science operation is a few days after Hubble the Hubble Space telescope\nShutdown Detroit gyroscope failure\nAccording to the agency ... a transition at the same boat was possibly triggered by an issue that also had something to do with a gyroscope component in charge of pointing and stabilizing telescope however there are some investigators and those were into deep space conspiracy theory\nThey're saying that something is happening in space that NASA does not want us to see\nAnd ... and and just out of coincidence NASA's curiosity Mars rover it's temporarily halted science operations to there's been a glitch with that so that we can't see anything from Mars\n\nCan't see anything from Mars here's an overnight bulletin\nHasn't made national headlines yet but here we go NASA's planetary defense coordination arms are often says two year old a two year old a a organization that NASA's it's NASA's planetary defense coordination office two years old it started with a budget\nIt started with a small budget and now it's gone to overnight and they they spiked it to a hundred and fifty million dollar budget for this a planetary defense coordination up\n\nFirst of all there was Ninety million dollars with no sixty million dollars he went from sixty million dollars to one hundred and fifty million dollars overnight and says you're amid growing concerns humanity is I don't really unprepared for the unlikely but still an ...\nAn asteroid strike of climate it's proportion White House has also recently issued a new national near earth object prepared to strategy an action plan intended to energize a host of agencies who could contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster\nSo Ninety million more dollars I mean we have not been concerned about why is it the shot up to a hundred and fifty dollars a hundred and fifty million dollars\n... white issue a brand new plan that it's intended to energize a host of agencies who can contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster if there is no debt disaster looming for the foreseeable future something isn't right about all this something is definitely wrong here\nI mean it feels like a really scary B horror science fiction film it sounds like a war of the world scenario it sounds\nToo weird to be real but it is real it's happening\n\nI mean these these shutdowns I mean remember the sunspot observatory was shut down on September Six twenty eighth team and then all this stuff is good chicken shut it got to remember all the other space observatory to shut down after the September ... shut down in New Mexico\n\nI mean these shutdowns remind me of what happens before an alien invasion well he's from a science fiction perspective I mean and I don't I don't want I don't want it to be about this but I
