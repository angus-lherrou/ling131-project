abuser Bill Clinton runs around here campaigning\nI think it was amazing and uh you you had a situation where he actually raped a woman\nWho told us that Juanita Broderick when Clinton raped her with a bloody lamp told her a roommate what happened\nThe roommate solved the blood on her lap saw her pantyhose was torn she actually had four or five corroborating witnesses as the event took place and then they also had the so called uh Arkansas state troopers confirming the fact\nThat the one eight abroad ... was actually raped and then you have while he's in the White House says president sexually groping in molesting Kathleen Willie in the White House\nAnd that was well known and corroborated but the media completely ignored both of those events because it didn't fit did it but it did good to go to Brett Kavanaugh\nAbsolutely and so that that's the double standard and then the bigger double standard it has to do more with men\nIt's me too movement and trying to to I Love how the left tries to migrate thing how they try to get us to take ownership so the ownership of me to get a bunch of left this lecture it's Hollywood lefty okay it's the Harvey Weinstein is of the world with all these young on your news and he's\nOld school actresses and all these ... political feminist taking pictures with Harvey going to his party's extending its virtues that awards dinners and so on while enabling him to do exactly what he's been doing for women for a decade\nDating back decades and and all the the the trail of women who did exactly what Harvey ask them to do getting their butts ...\nOut and then suddenly when their careers are waning they decide they want to turn states' evidence but then what's interesting me two ends up being ... bill\nEnds up being part of a couple of being used against Kavanaugh being used against a high powered CEOs of companies this movement is born of the lectures activities of left us in Hollywood that in in in the entertainment industry where they marginalized objectify women like crazy\nAnd suddenly a guy like Kavanaugh they want to make him the poster child um I mean it just it bores me\nAnd when it came time for Obama to put his daughters on summer in terms positions with somebody ah Brock Hussein Obama and Michelle Obama is elected Harvey Weinstein\nTo to take their daughters end of the Hollywood scene when they knew or should have known exactly what was going on from all of their connections but they couldn't care less Harvey Weinstein was in star Harvey Weinstein and access Harvey Weinstein was are making millions of dollars and giving millions the Democratic party including the Obamas\nSo they sent their own daughters end of the care custody in control of Harvey Weinstein and the media didn't cover that either did they\nThey didn't but here's what's interesting about that so they know Harvey their daughters are untouchable but you know whose daughter's aren't bill the daughters of ordinary people there the daughter that you don't that you got to be concerned about because Harvey will take advantage of them but the ... the what the what rock Obama telling you is\nI have so much power I Know that this guy that led to his left this who will take advantage of women and every time but I can put my daughters with them but don't you dare put yours\nThat's exactly how the left stacks up I can do it you can't

fall from grace from the one time global cycling icon to inspire millions of people have to survive\nRadio why don't we [noise]\nKnow the other night on Fox I'm watching and uh the speaker made a comment the expert on the administrative agency slashing the Congress that made the comment that every year in matter who's the president something like three thousand new rules are put into effect\nBy the alphabet soup federal government agencies and uh they're simply a room making that becomes law making which is completely different than what the founding fathers intended what the constitution did not invent the consequences had been not necessary rules and regulations\nThat cost the American economy billions of dollars every year the constitutional separation of powers been compromised in other words the ... the agencies and the federal government\nOr the state government agencies mainly the federal government agencies are accountable to no one other time lawsuits are filed might be years before their compromise and you can't even begin to stop three thousand new rules going into effect and then as a consequence we Americans are going to question the legitimacy of their own government\nWhen it's completely on accountable a good man Peter Jay wall isn't written a book\nJudicial fortitude or subtitled the last chance to rein in the administrators state and Peter Wallison welcome for the first time the bill Cunningham show Peter how are you\nI'm fine thanks bill good to have you here a couple of weeks ago of course we got a the fifth conservative vote\nOn the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh which is a good thing and in his writings and the second circuit court of appeals where he was for twelve years Brett Kavanaugh often knocked down the administrative state ruled by rule which is a great thing now described as the American people what is the administrator state and how does an impact our lives\nAre the ... minutes to the aid is all of the federal agencies including everything from the Treasury Department\nAll the way down to the FCC and there are hundreds of them and a way that they impact our lives\nIs that they make a lot of rules and regulations on staff who in many cases a generations old [noise] and those rules and regulations are not only plentiful\nThat is there are many of them but they have a major effect on our lives and the purpose of the book that I have written is to explain that that we have to rain banned in in some way\nAnd it was ... when the when you when you say we have to rain the men who is we\nAh well the American people have to rain than in and the way to do it is so unfortunately the only way we do it is through uh the court system and that's why your point about a ... Brett Kavanaugh having been a confirmed for the Supreme Court is very important because I think he is the fifth\nRoad of the five of the five member majority would be interested in raining in the administrative state\nBy cutting back on the activities and the rules that they are able to make\nCan you give me a concrete example and I think government agencies I think of the FCC I think the Irish\nBut you're telling me there's hundreds of government agencies bureaucrats\nAbout about one point two million strong new everyday made in offices mainly in Washington about our little all over the country and then they got to do something they just can't sit there and drink coffee all day\nSo they sort of not enacting rules because they want because they have some generic piece of legislation giving them real making powers and then they issue these three thousand new rules that day that must be complied with how much farmers are causing us\nTo where I think it's causing a lot of harm in the center\nFor business is of course it creates a lot of regulations that they have to comply with compliance activities are very expensive for business is one of the estimates that I have in the book is that each year it car who really in dollars to comply with government regulations\nThough that two trillion dollars actually gets passed on through all other Americans who are consumers of the of the products that businesses could do\nThat an important factor and in fact a trillion dollars is more than the government actually ... ah either from businesses or from the individual each year\nThey very significant thing but it can be turned back\nTown and they can be reduced give me\nThe idea here and described in the book is that the court can step in and begin to review carefully\nThe legislation under which all of these rules are made and very frequently um the rules are based on laws that were ... years ago sometimes generations ago and they are and perpetrated by the administrative agency to give them the authorities if you will be new rules\nAnd the court can look at that legislation again and say wait a minute you're gone too far the Congress did not give you the authority that make the rules and there are a number\nOf examples in the book where you can see that the that the agency has gotten well beyond what Congress actually authorize so if the court is willing to step in and take those steps and that's what fortitude is necessary that's why the book is called the national guard it do they have to have the strength\nOf character that go in and make these decisions that will turn down regulations of um of administrative agency then we can actually begin to reduce the amount of regulation and the rules have come out of Washington", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Ground Zero with Clyde Lewis", "city": "Springfield", "day": "22"}
