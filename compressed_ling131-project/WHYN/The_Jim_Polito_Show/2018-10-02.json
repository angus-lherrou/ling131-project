now in being brought down a headquarters the light over him in the dark room and\nWhat would you do when Kavanaugh where where you you know it's basically police showed up after a fight and somebody said Kavanaugh through I said somebody okay he must be wild drunk he must be a team of really he must be\nOut of control I I Want to see what climate moron Clyde McFarlane from the telegram writes

than just law enforcement\nAlright so Kate Snow\nInterviews this woman the interview was a disaster\nBecause of all of her inconsistencies yet MSNBC still airs\nIt and here's a here's your explaining why they still aired it\nWhere overall out all that she had her story our reporting we want to be very tragic parrot because they are very valuable Kavanaugh has called Julie ... wrote the story line as far as the president Perot question her credibility and everyone for\nFor the record has well over ... ... or verified her class there are ... told us on camera that differ from her rent or phone while\nWe're trying to reach out to members of Kendall hired\nSomebody came forward gilly sweat Mick you're interviewing her there's inconsistencies you still\nAir it you know why two reasons one you want eyeballs\nOkay you got to be get\nRight Steve Danny if if I found out that Julie sweat naked contacted wanna view and you guys said to me we could have her on the show what do you think my answer would be absolutely yes yeah\nOf course can you imagine all the people would tune in grocery completely destroyed her but you know\nThat one I wouldn't ... that woman I wouldn't feel bad about I'd say gee I I I Am sorry that that uh you're\nAlleging that you were a victim of a of a of a rape but I'm the rest of your story stinks\n... first question would be well you went to tend parties and they were gang rapes but it's like well you know I used to swim in that river and every time I went for ten times somebody got pulled under by a crocodile\nLast time it was me you went back yeah every time so NBC put this woman on why\nBecause they were going to get eyeballs but we also know the other reason why they put her on the other reason they put her on is because it fits their narrative now\nIt

he was speaking this was an outdoor venue and\nHeld up signs like I Believe Dr Ford I Believe Christine Ford and just stood there silently and held the signs while he was being interviewed as part of this thing now that it's okay you want to do that fine as long as you're not in front of me and I'm trying to see\nThen you stand up that's fine\nMaybe maybe the left to get it and just be quiet but you see they don't do it\nAnd they're not quiet what they do is typically you to to Jeff Flake\nIs they they follow him into an elevator and start yelling at him and saying I'm a victim of sexual assault and you hate me because you don't believe Dr Ford remember that\nRemember those two women do you know what we've learned about those two women\nWho chased them into the elevator\nFirst of all let's just tell you what they said I won't play that clip\nAnd and I don't know how this was coordinated I I didn't know this but remember Jeff Flake last week he said he was going to vote yes he said he was going to vote yes on the committee after\nChristine Ford and after Brett Kavanaugh spoke and then he was getting into an elevator or trying to get out of an elevator and these two women\nApproaching them and started shouting out and why you realize the CNN had it live how did that happen right a little coordination maybe\nBut the two women one of them said I was sexually assaulted and nobody believed me I didn't tell anyone in your telling all women that they don't matter\nThat's what you're telling all of these women that's what you're telling me right now look at me when I'm Talking to you you are telling me that my assault doesn't matter don't look away from me look at me and then it was after that he went into that ante room\nCame out and said okay we should have an FBI investigation\nAt least for a week\nNow yeah CNN carrying it alive which I didn't know they had to live I only saw the tape after how they coordinated that and the back all of a Senate building near the hearing room got at him he said later that didn't change my mind\nYou know I just thought it was a good idea to have an investigation will before that you said you were ready to vote on the committee and then on the floor\nWell here's the interesting thing\nFirst of all we played you the audio yesterday of the president's chief counsel Kellyanne Conway and Kellyanne Conway said while being interviewed on Jake Tapper Sunday show on CNN\nThat she was a victim of sexual assault and yet she didn't hold\nAnyone else like Brett Kavanaugh responsible for it to a lot of attention and a lot of anger is being directed Brett Kavanaugh by some survivors of sexual assault that's because the ... the Democrats\nAre getting them all fired up about this\n... it's not it's not their fault it's not Jeff Flake fault that he heard\nCabin on any word for it and said I'm going to vote with a cabinet well wait it gets deeper here these two women\nAnd Maria are Sheila and Maria gallon\nPart Sheila is an executive director of the center for popular democracy\nShe spent the previous week in Washington engaged in protest against Kavanaugh\nGallagher is uh twenty three year old activist with the same group the center is a left wing group heavily funded by George Soros is open society foundations\n\nHis group is one of the three largest donors\nTo the organization so when Brett Kavanaugh was criticized\nFor saying something\nAbout George Soros and the Clintons and everyone else when he was criticized for that they said he's getting political or wait a minute these two women who got Jeff Flake and just happened to have a CNN camera they're alive\nAnd I don't know if you know anything about ... broadcast now those cameras run off why now in the old days used to have
