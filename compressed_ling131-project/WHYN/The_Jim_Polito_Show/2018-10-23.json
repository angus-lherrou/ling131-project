crushing and dull and with your legal exchange quick tip of the day\nWe're talking about drafting Medicaid income trust\nYou know ... ... the average person and frankly the average financial advisor is not going to know whether the documents are right or wrong they need to rely on their attorney which should they be looking for when they're looking for in selecting\nAn elder law attorney or somebody who's going to wrap these trust documents are so critically important yeah I think\nThat's a great question because as you say they are challenging him and so they need to be drafted right you know\nUh and and you're going to find that you know it's it's the attorney that's going to be the one drafting it so\nWhen you're when you're picking that lawyer I Would say first and foremost and you can see this right on their car that they give you the letters El Al am what does that mean after the attorney's name it means that they've got a masters in taxation yeah so they are so they undergraduate degree law school and a master's degree of some sort in taxation which is from\nInequality you poor kids fifty thousand dollars\nHe's introduced a bill\nTo do this boy that's a guy who wants to win the Democratic nomination for president cars that will appeal to the Rio extreme leftists\nHe said America has a massive growing racial wealth gap\nBut so is there a certain age at which they can to is it like a like a ... like a bond or something like that where they came out\nThey can only use it for he said certain things like a down payment on a house college tuition to start a business they're going to be called opportunity accounts and they're going to\nLevel the playing field between kids who are raised in wealthier homes and kids who are raised in low income homes\nDo we just we just explain this this is definitely a this this knocks Bernie\nSanders off the front burner to the back burner for Democrats you know with Medicare for all this speeds Medicare for all this is money for all\nHe wants to give all these kids fifty thousand dollars Ghazi not understand that by giving out fifty thousand dollars you begin to make fifty thousand dollars worthless [noise]\nBe able to say what I've actually spoke with people who I consider to be quite intelligent\nWho said why can't the government just make\nEverybody a millionaire\nGive everybody a million dollars\nWhat's the million dollars worth\nIf everybody's got is\nI mean think about this you know there are people who buy things right\nAnd to collect\nAnd do more things about you I'm a big fan of American Pickers so you watch American Pickers and he began to realize well things have different\nValues right and then based upon who's collecting them\nThat determines what the price will be\nBanned\nIf everybody's got the same amount of money\nFor everybody's got the minimum amount of money that minimum now becomes the floor\nAnd then we build upon that so everybody's got fifty thousand dollars to go buy a house\nWell not everybody's going to get the same house\nAnd in the house so you go to buy\nHis probably gonna be in a in a market where everybody didn't get fifty thousand dollars [noise]\nUm it would be worth fifty thousand last\nBut now that everybody got fifty thousand dollars\nHouses now worth fifty thousand dollars more\nSimple economics\nIs simple supply and demand\nCurrency theory\nDoesn't make any sense but that's the good thing about Democrats\nBecause you look at their stuff and you say wow that's really kinda nice\nWell increased taxes on the rich give Fifteen thousand dollars to everybody the\nAnd then um everybody will have a lot of money\nNobody will be poor no\nAbsolutely not\nThat's not gonna happen\nBy the way the American opportunity a county every child\nBomb being born would give be given a thousand dollars that would sit in a low risk account\nManaged by the treasury\nAnd the three percent would be the return on that\nSo everybody's got that account so that when I'm selling things and I go to price some\nHigh price it based on what the market can Bayer\nWhen people when you sell your house you sell your house based upon what the market will bear\nStraightforward but Cory Booker wants to win the Democratic nomination me I'm telling you you you they're going to be people who are going to think this is the greatest idea you know he's going to be one of them congressman Jim McGovern he's gonna think this is a great idea we need to do this\nSpeaking of money\nMega millions is tonight a recommendation to everybody\nHave you got an

construction worker back in two thousand nine he had five colleagues\nWho took 'em to court over a twenty four million mega millions when\nHe says I bought my own ticket and then I bought tickets for all of us and he ultimately had to settle up with them\nA certain amount of money oh yeah it's a cough up twenty million\nIf you buy your own tickets and you participate in a ... and you coordinate the office ticket take photos copies of the numbers for the office ticket and pass them around to everybody I Know\nI Know these are my your friends your co workers your gray you get along and then all of a sudden there's twenty four million dollars on the table or in this case one point six billion and counting changes people a little bit I was speaking of the one point six billion female it if you win\nMega millions up in\nWhy it's a multi state lottery why would I get more money in New Hampshire 'cause there's no state tax now some states\nThat have state tax\nChoose to not tax you\nChoose to not\nTax you um but Massachusetts isn't one of them\nSo keep that in mind hey speaking of guys who no money\nRichard Bella tear my good friend is on the phone and he wants to talk about Cory

I Want to tell people what they're going to hear on you know CBS or not but what is it really though\nIt is Asia the their economy is slowing down there being obstinate about this trade it was really the issue Jim ... with people you know people always call it a trade war it's not a trade war so much is it an intellectual property theft\nWar right now are are the ceiling are right right stop\nStealing our you know they're doing rebroadcast so the gym please don't show over there and I'm not getting any royalties\nOh you're not I I'm getting [laughter]\nYeah it's totally let me even if you're caught\nBarry pennies on the dollar you're getting from from my royalties so right it's finally the United states saying stop stealing our stuff yeah\nYeah yeah ... stealing it\nIt just comes at an inopportune time because of the terms you know like I Wish this was if it was three weeks later I say I just to help the correct right right now the timing that\nOkay okay so that that's what it is now the the Chinese can help hold out forever berry they really can't right\nWow they can no that's the problem they're communist\nModel but what they don't have it terms but they still have to rely on other people investing in their country like a an investor who invest internationally and says yeah I'll put up some money toward that factory you want to build\nRight right well here's the challenge is you know they they so far Jim\nThey said screw you know they're they're not negotiating they're not having conversations yeah\nThey're being obstinate and and again you know it's hard to argue with the president's position because these people are deep I if if like somebody if your next door neighbor kept coming into your house and taken all the fridge out food out of your fridge Shiite ... eventually get ticked off about it\nAnd that's what they're doing right they're they're walking into their neighbor's house and they're stealing\nAnd they expect that it's okay and they were just going to turn the other cheek well they got a president who is not going to turn the other cheek\nYeah I got a childcare costs what's going on their\nHoly smokes up seven and a half percent over the last year and it's a wonder people are having kids you know birth rate at record low levels strip\nIt never came back after the recession of two thousand and eight and I think a large part of it and I'd be I guess Danny can give us his perspective but I think a large part of the reason is you want to take your kid to daycare especially in Massachusetts You're talking Fifteen twenty grand a year per child\nYeah I like bike and smart I get my parents to do get built in he's got a built in daycare kind of like your um Wednesday afternoon you know with master of all millennials my

friday November second it's early voting why we have early voting I don't know when you can do an absentee ballot see they don't have to give you\nI'm\nSame location to go vote at an early voting in Massachusetts most communities would just say okay go to the town hall I mean to you\nYou can get yourself to the town hall why key you um\nWhy can't you just get to a polling place I mean like\nI usually do an absentee ballot will now it's considered in early voting bad but I usually do an absentee ballot because on election day I'm generally busy and I don't want to take a chance of missing the boat and that is that that happened to me a few times\nEarly in my career as a reporter and I just got to try it out but I never get to the polls in time\nI I don't want that to I don't want that to happen\nI don't want that to happen um\nLittle a little bit of news here for Elizabeth Warren Donald Trump\nUm last night he was doing a rally in Texas He uh he said I'm taking back the main Pocahontas from Elizabeth Warren um this is after she revealed the results of a DNA test\nYou said uh she's she doesn't have any Indian at all so she can't be called focus on just\nA sad thing happened last week because Elizabeth Warren was exposed as being a total fraud I can no longer color Pocahontas because she has no Indian blood that can't go ... says she doesn't qualify\nNow that's the kind of job game that's it's okay when he does that\nYou know that's all right I mean when you when you call the porn star horse race well\nHey joining me now is a great guy you uh see him on Fox News and you will recognize the voice\nAnd easier to talk to us about a problem with law and order what's going on with antifa and maybe we can squeeze a few other comments and questions in their\nSheriff David Clarke good morning Sarah thanks for coming back again\nMorning group you know when you listen to\nThank you die ... let's talk about antifa um I think anybody reasonable\nHas to say the violence the incitement to violence in the actual violence doesn't come from the right in this country it comes from the left\nWho is no doubt about that look and see for has\nTurned into a fighting force for the Democratic party and that's why you here and go Democrat leader anywhere in this country stand up\nAnd ... them no uncertain terms confound the action is at least check post\nI said that the Harry Potter military ... book the show up old dress same in a similar fashion than all black faces or or could feel with math they show up at the advance with two by fours with clubs with the with knives with rocks\nLooking to initiate confrontation with um a group that shows up to exercise their person I rely\nOn that point it above the law enforcement is not identify them I don't think it's such an not taking appropriate action to protect people at the incidence every town and it shows up\nThere's trouble if they can't find a group to pack their turn on the police and they attract believe and until law enforcement takes more sort of all I mean you look at Portland for instance\nWhere the cops were told that giving orders stand down yeah while I'm the goons if your will\nAttack people intimidate people try to incite fear\n[noise] yeah it is for those who don't know a sheriff David Clarke folk served a share of Milwaukee County from a two thousand two to twenty Seventeen for Fifteen Years he knows what he's talking about\nPortland is a is a really a strange example Portland, Oregon\nThe mayor there has basically told the police to stand down and if you drive through\nAnd in chief uh uh I I don't want to call it a rally because the connotation there is that it's you know uh it's got a positive a positive connotation um\nI ... you you will be a cost it in your car no matter who you are\nWell look it's a totally the case of her responsibility when she gave orders for the cops\nAnd on and she plotted them I'm not being critical of the frontline officers they're under orders right being critical of their their leaders their commanders or putting them in a dangerous dangerous situation without the resources no way to be able to walk and themselves\nSecond defend public ... third and and most importantly to keep the peace so would you have to have these low buddy for the sense that have to act on their own you know I I don't advocate violence but do it strongly for persons right of self defense yeah God given right it's the first law of nature self ...\nSo what I Do tell people is that when government refused\nTo perform their responsibility to keep the peace to keep people say\nThat responsibility is left the ritual or they do have the right to defend themselves that did happen in Portland yeah it happened in uh New York city recently and you're seeing more and more people realize hey I'm On my own my personal safety is my responsibility I'm going to do something about\nSheriff's um we you know I'm a talk radio guy you're on Fox News and and other media outlets in here um\nWe're often said 'cause we're we're right leaning\nThey often say oh you guys are you guys are inciting violence and yet we've got Eric Holder saying when they go low we kick them we've got Hillary Clinton who's a candidate for president a first lady and secretary of state in a U.S senator\nSaying now is the time to adopt the civil\nI mean that's actually inciting people that's saying to him to eat so it's okay you don't have to be civil\nBecause uh we will be civil when we're back in power\n\nYou know and they try to turn the tables on is that the Democrats trick ... district for a long time ago where they ... they think about the name and they think they're an\nAnti fascist the body fish that so that's what I mean when I said they tried to turn the tables on us and then try to make us feel guilty about what's going on and you look at Maxine Waters who says get up in their faith yeah let them know they're not want to make them feel uncomfortable that is\nVery dangerous for people who can't process thing yeah you and I like to hear somebody say uh you know when when it's a thing go\nI'm In Ohio we recommend you and I might be able to process differently and say well you know metaphorically that's what he's talking about with there are a lot of people out here on the left who cannot process like that will not process like that they take it as marching orders ... it's going to continue to increase\nIn a frequency especially\nAfter the uh the mid term should the GOP maintain the house and Senate\nUm the the
