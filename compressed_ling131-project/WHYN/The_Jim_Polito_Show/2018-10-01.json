generator inside your house either like cars portable generators give off carbon monoxide a poisonous odorless colors deadly gas\nUh the folks who are you know the the poll takers you know they've been wrong before but very wrong but\nSome polling shows now that the favorability now this is from Gallup right and Gallup has been wrong before\nThe percentage of Americans say that who say they have a favorable view of Republicans now stands\nAt forty five percent up from thirty six percent favorability for Democrats stands at forty four percent exactly where it was last September\nSo what does that mean either many Republicans came home or independents are leaning Republican what does that mean well we're going into the midterms that's not a great number\nThat makes in the words of the Boston Herald the blue wave look more like a ripple\n\nI've told you I didn't see the blue a back in March I don't see it now people vote based on the economy is this cabinet are thing going to make a difference I don't think so I think those on both sides are dug in\nAnd there's a lot of people in the middle who may not care about this now they may not care about it\nSo let's get to let's get to the let's get to cabinet oh it was very funny this weekend when I'm Matt Damon made fun of cabinet or you know Matt Damon the same guy that when the wind\n... stories broke about him being a rapist and serial abuser she was a conspicuous by his silence [noise]\n\nVery conspicuous and then he started to say things like will come on now there's a difference between slapping someone on the backside and I'm sexually assaulting somewhat or that didn't go over he had to apologize for that anyway we'll get into his Saturday Night live\nAppearance but I Want to get into\nAll of the new surrounding Kavanaugh yes after we left the show Jeff flight was confronted in an elevator by a victim of sexual assault and\nSaid why do you hate me why do you mean flake said okay I Want an FBI investigation\nSo we got a one week FBI investigation a one way and James Cole me calls the one week deadline for cabinet laws probate idiotic\nAnd says I'm agents know that little lies points to bigger allies\nThat's kinda funny coming from the disgraced former head of the FBI because you know I mean if they can investigate Hillary's emails and a few days\nBut we should be no problem they looked at six hundred and fifty thousand of Hillary Clinton's emails remember when they showed up on\nOn a Anthony wiener Carlos dangers computer remember they showed up on his computer what was it two three are not even that wouldn't like it was like a day and a half they looked at all of them by and clean it all up no nothing to see here\nSo you're telling me it can't be done in a week of course Democrats are saying well we can't trust the FBI to do an impartial investigation you didn't say that when they were investigating or continue to investigate\nRussia you can have it both ways\nBernie Sanders um wrote a blistering letter to the judicial committee or any\nSaid a lying to Congress as a federal crime the FBI must examine the veracity of cabinet statements under oath in addition to the sexual assault allegations against him Kavanaugh's truthfulness with the Senate goes to the very heart of whether he should be confirmed\nTo the court really Grassley um wrote back to Bernie\n[laughter]\nThen said this supplemental FBI background and Grassley so Chuck Grassley Republican from Iowa chair the committee\nThis supplemental FBI background investigation was requested by undecided members of both parties that might take from your letter that you are now undecided unwilling to seriously engage with the Senate's\nAdvise and consent constitutional duties related to the nomination of judge Kavanaugh to serve as associate justice of the Supreme Court or the United states if so we should have a conversation about what information you need to assist you in making a decision and I look forward to that conversation\nThe reason Grassley saying that\nIs that Bernie Sanders is one of the people who came out twenty five minutes after cabinet was announced\nAnd said I'm not going to vote for him well Bernie then then ... what ... what are we what are you doing asking for additional information your minds already made up speaking of investigations Lindsey Graham\nWants an investigation\nOf Dianne Feinstein handling\nOf Christine Blasey Ford's letter and allegations\nUm there's still no evidence of sexual assault and now Democrats want cabinet invested ... investigative for perjury do you understand\nThat this is going to keep going and going and going and going\nThey won't stop going to stop\nI guarantee you by the end of the week we're going to hear from some Democrats somewhere\nThe following\nWhy hasn't the FBI given Brett Kavanaugh a polygraph test\nYou think I'm joking right\nIt's ah what time Danny six seven team on Monday morning October the first how long how long until the Democrats says why as ... ... you know what I Know there's a some liberals in the audience right now saying yeah why not\n[noise]\nHow long until that happens finally the ACLU which has a policy on judicial endorsements they never never say anything about them I guess what the ACLU opposes Brett\nKavanaugh on what grounds\nOn what grounds he drinks too much\nReally and by the way they just say this um why is it that why is it that we're not hearing anything about the character of Christine Blasey Ford Dr Ford now don't\nDon't give me the old will Jim you can't investigate the accuser\nYou most certainly can\nIt's called the cross examination you come forward what you mean we're just investigating Kavanaugh\nWe can't question or\nWitness who gave a lot of different stories and doesn't have anyone who couldn't corroborate anything\n\nI mean if this is the oh let me give an example\nYou know the Rachel Michel ... the the the prosecutor\nWho interviewed Dr Ford do you know what she said over the weekend she said if it if this was the case you would not bring criminal charges against Kavanaugh she said the case is an example of it he said she said\nAnd said that forged cases even weaker than that she has admitted that she is a Republican this woman but she said\nI'm a that didn't play into her decision\nShe said that Ford appeared to jump around on the timing of the alleged sexual assault ranging from the Nineteen eighties early Nineteen eighties and then the summer of Nineteen eighty to quote wild is common for victims to be uncertain about the age\nDr Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season in particular year she also pointed out that Ford has a history of struggling to name cabinet\nAs her attacker Mitchell noted that the name was not a note from twenty twelve marriage therapy or her individual therapy in twenty Thirteen\n\nShe said that

they say she didn't do well because she like to go out and party and I have a great time\n\nI don't know if that's true anymore then you can say that a Yale students said Brett Kavanaugh was drunk all the time I mean this is what we're hanging on here the destruction of an individual\n\nOf course she deserves to be hurt by the way the woman the sex crimes prosecutor who interviewed Dr Ford Rachel

had not been corroborated by anyone who she identified as attending the party including a lifelong friend\n\nNow the lifelong friend has since come out and said well I Can't corroborated but I Believe her well that holds just as much weight as me saying I Believe Brett Kavanaugh\n\nI Believe her okay good people do and people\nBelieve Kavanaugh but absent anything else I'm not I'm not going to stand in the way of a person being appointed to the Supreme Court because of something that comes through the last minute\nFrom a person who has inconsistencies and their story can't really give the whole story is\nBeing manipulated by a lawyer recommended by Dianne Feinstein since when the senators recommend lawyers for people owned by the way she recommended a lawyer attorney cats a woman who's
