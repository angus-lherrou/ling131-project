she's a great job and then I think in the debate last night\nHe showed up sat on the road to try to block her car all this insanity and it's I I have a problem with it because I don't want people who are opposed to the radical agenda the left to begin a dark\nThing their behavior don't start acting like them I mean I steal\nSome of their play book by like you know the rules for radicals by saw Lewinsky you know ridicule your enemy\nI use that I knew that because they do that\nBut I don't adopt any the other stuff and I think it's foolish if you do you want to go out in the street\nAnd um and protest that kinda stuff\nNancy Pelosi was accosted by some Trump supporters and I don't I don't agree with that they use foul language\nI don't agree with that Mitch McConnell Republican majority leader in the house\nHe was out to dinner with his wife who happens to be secretary of transportation they were back in a\nUm Kentucky and they were trying to have dinner some idiot came and started yelling at him and you're trying to steal Social Security from us and\nIt was great because people in the restaurants they get\nLost get outta here get lost ...\nSee now that won't happen in Washington DC because everybody in the Washington who restaurants probably liberal\nI Would speak up I Would say get the heck out of here\nWhere I Am [laughter] we're going to talk with bills him for about ten minutes or national correspondent\nThis caravan continues to go forward in Mexico toward the United states border and bill will have the latest on you're seeing\nSeeing people in that that are addressed and they're trying to get away from you know an oppressive country and it's mostly men by the way um\nThe men are concerned where where are their families\nAnd not only that well we'll get into it with Bill if your country like Guatemala is so bad and you make it into Mexico why don't you stop there really because Mexico isn't isn't in turmoil like them\nInteresting that's kind of help I think Donald Trump and\nSo that leads me to what I Want to talk about until we get to the break and we get to bill's him for which is the so called blue wave I did some reading over the weekend sort of research over the weekend but I remember I was the guy back in March who said I don't see this blue wave\nAnd I'm going to continue to say I don't see a blue wave first of all in the Senate side I see Republicans picking up seats in the house\nThere's still a chance\nThat Democrats could win enough seats to gain control now how many seats were they will gain control by what were their majority be it would be in single digits\nThe way I look at it it will be in single digits not remember back in March I said\nThe Democrats are definitely going to pick up house seats in Pennsylvania and the reason for that is redistricting and it hurt the Republicans and Trump remember was strong\nIn western Pennsylvania it's one of the things on election night in twenty sixteen when I started to see\nResults coming in from western Pennsylvania I said wow they're going Trump that it was one of those things that made me think he's got a whim early in the evening [noise] but anyway\nMean it doesn't matter if they win by one seat or by twenties seeds one say when they have control of the house they have control of all the committees\nAnd who knows what they'll do now if they don't have a big margin if they don't have a big margin in the house\nI'm it would be tough for them to ram through a lot of stuff because\nUnlike in the Senate you know where you get a hundred people were talking four hundred and thirty five you get a lot of minds that can be\nYou know different and even though it's become so partisan they usually votes or along party lines it could be difficult but once they when they have control and who knows maybe Nancy Pelosi's in charge\nBut if they do win and I'm just saying\nThey really only about sixty percent chance I think of taking back the house if they do win again it will be by a single digit majority they do take back the house\nBut be prepared for the left to call that a mandate\n\nBe prepared for them to call that the blue wave be prepared for them to call that a rejection of Donald Trump the media will do that when I say the left I mean the media and the Democratic party\nThey'll do that when in fact they should win win big\nThis year because it's an off year\nAnd the humanitarian\nA Donald Trump has said this is an invasion and I listen on certain level I\nI agree with that I agree with that assessment but what happens when they get to the to the border of the United states\nYeah uh that's that's a big question I mean are we now have a an arrangement with Mexico where we can just simply turn them around and send them\nBack and that's different than the last time\nAbsolutely but I mean what what do we do I mean if even if we say sorry a turn around and go with that I said then then do we get migrant camp set up along the ports of entry there would be just right across the illegally uh ... what happens when they cross illegally do we arrest them well they would like nothing better than that to be arrested\nUnited States and your boss is a\nShow that that that is a that is the the magic question there Jim what happens if and when they get to the U.S and they're still over a thousand miles away\nAnd the storm is coming a
