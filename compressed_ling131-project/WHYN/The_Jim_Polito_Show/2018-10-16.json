got to come back and you're right day and he was like you can feel is with a more sitting there and saying so what did the research say has been for the dun dun dun yeah and then you show show a couple of reaction shots of people in the music Rogers and then all of a sudden it's a commercial\nFor guy go I don't know anyway she did this whole thing but what made it so cheesy\nAs it she put her three older brothers in it and I don't know if you guys saw this but\nAll the scenes where she was visiting with people back in Oklahoma which I'm sure she hates to go back to Oklahoma\nI'm sure she hates it she's living in Cambridge now she's going to achieve shops\nShe hates going back to Oklahoma anyway there she is in Oklahoma and they're all drinking beer even Elizabeth Warren is drinking a

a box of chips I mean a bag of chips ... tape over the name so\nNow they are fronting the product you see someone sipping a drink and it's the actual product and companies pay for that\nIn movies they pay for it and the can is held just right think of the James Bond movies with Daniel Craig\nBond used to wear a Rolex based sub Mariner now he's wearing an old media\nWhich is a fine watch but on me

she was like one in five hundred and twelve\nA won five hundred and twelve Native American Indian I Want you to get into why that chest isn't foolproof oh let's see that it is for the sake of argument [noise]\n\nThen let's even go to she's one thirty second that would be the best case scenario told by the way the global had to correct their story\nBecause based on the math is actually the high end she's the one uh twelve hundred\nAmerican indian then again a test is foolproof so can you she decided to put herself in a law book\nAnna directory of lawyers and professors who consider themselves Native American\nShe wrote that put a recipes and that cookbook\nPowwow chow\nAnd let me ask you a question if you if you were one thirty second\nOf some race would that be an identifier the you would put forth so let's say you find out that your\nOne thirty second Jewish sorry you're one thirty second Jewish would you put out\nOr put yourself into a directory that said I Am one thirty second Jewish\nI mean the rest of you could be Irish Scottish German French whatever\n\nLet's say the rest of you was English and you came up one thirty second Jewish would you suddenly put yourself in a directory identifying Jewish people doing your particular job\nNo\nOf course you wouldn't but somebody did to take advantage of it\nAnd remember when I told you about this man he's an insurance agent Ralph Taylor\nHe had a DNA test that show these four percent African\nAnd so he wanted to be identified by the government as I'm as a minority business see if you're a minority business you are given preferential treatment and government contracts [noise]\nHe has since been told no you can't do that\nHe's Ninety percent European six percent indigenous at um American than four percent sub Saharan African\nHe's more [noise] indigenous than Elizabeth Warren remember I told you about this guy and he's fight it he's fighting\nTo get minority status approval based part of the disadvantaged uh businesses program that the government has then he wants government contracts\nCan't get it Elizabeth Warren check the box and filled out the um form\nTo be put him a listing of minority professors why would a press release go out saying Harvard law school has hired its first woman of color\n[noise] why what color\nAnd by the way the New York times came out with this story after we went off the air yesterday saying that based upon the findings Elizabeth Warren is actually has less indigenous blood in her\nThan the average of European person of European descent living in the United states they have anywhere from twice as much\nTo three times as much\nFor the folks from the Cherokee Nation put out a press release last night and I agree with them\nThey said this has nothing to do with being a Cherokee\nThis has nothing to do with it a DNA test does not make you a Cherokee and by the way it's still very very difficult\nTo do it tests like that\nAnd show ethnicity\nYou know we see the commercials that guy saying um we were told that we were German and ah I grew up but I was told I was German or or something like that and that I trade in my\nKilled by trade and in my late arose in for a killed because I found out I was Scottish\n\nThat could be wrong that commercial and by the way I support ancestry [noise] then the work that they do but that could be wrong and here's why that ma'am\nIf you look at the history of Germany [noise] do you know that you know through the through the centuries the warring in Germany and in Europe said people migrated from one section to another and when they did they adopted the culture of that section even though the their DNA came from somewhere else\n\nSo he may go where Irish or where German or whatever it is\nOnly eat very well may be German that hundreds of years ago his people went from Ireland to Germany and stayed in Germany\nThese tests just aren't accurate at determining ethnicity\nThey're\nActually more accurate at determining a lot of other things ethnicity is very difficult it's not a pure scientific test\nAnd that's why what Elizabeth Warren did\nDoesn't prove anything while they proves one thing she's running for president because right after the story was broken by the globe her friends\nA video was released on her website that was almost like a reality show with her getting the test results you know it was like being on an episode of Maury\nWould the headlines from the news radio five sixty Tony ... newsroom here's John ... back\nA disturbing story out of Westfield this morning where someone

that's going to be the one drafting so when you're when you're picking that lawyer\nWhat say first and foremost and you can see this right on their car that they give you the letters El Al am what does that mean after the attorney's name it means that they've got a masters in taxation yeah so they are so they undergraduate degree law school and a master's degree of some sort of in taxation which is from law school it's a specialty logically they specialize in it so\nVery important because it's going to be covering all aspects of tax years they tax or income tax or gift tax\nAre all impacted when you do these irrevocably trust so you need to know that flat fee or hourly you know another thing ... see they should say you know how often do the flat sea mhm right and lastly asked a

Sunday night game Barry if you add certain guarantees to bring certain numbers to advertisers\nBoy I I didn't look at the numbers from that fourth quarter but people hung in there I bet I bet it was a good fourth quarter and I bet the NFL made up some ground with advertisers\nWell they did and it was the best Sunday night game that had in your case though you know it it you know you've got some good young players in the league now and the president not her but you know he he\nIs he really hasn't said anything like Bob ... probably getting a call now like what the hell up money cut me a

C. um let me ask you this though don't you think there were a portion of people\nWho saw the behavior of the mob the Democrats saw that it was astro turf that a lot of this was paid for\nDon't you think that those people maybe were turned off I Know the person who doesn't pay attention to the news like usually a listener to this show would may be fooled but aren't there are a good number of people who maybe were turned off by it\nAll the polls show that not only Republican turned off by it but a good pair of independent than even some Democrats are saying well this is way too far and we've gone way too far and and I think that\nThe Democrats really overplay their hand\nA lot of people who for example you know recall worked all the horrible but people who came out to vote for President Trump or maybe even when they're first time voting for a long long time you know they may not have come out during the mid term elections because\nWell President Trump isn't actually on the ballot and they rarely all may have voted for it accorded the outsider candidate Donald Trump they might have stayed home but act the way they're starting to respond appalled first thing they understand that the Kavanaugh thing as an example of how walking or more run\nAfter the midterm if the Democrats take over and they realize it whoa whoa\nOr completely car but president the gender and probably in many ways were hurt the economy the wrong right now we're into the job of rape or what what they've ever been in and and read the time\nAnd they understand that if they don't get out and vote even though the president himself as a as a clear on the ballot\nThe president's agenda will be will be will be all completely\nThrow a lot of the ... were ... behavior or understood that it was at her and then it would be have or that was beyond the pale they're getting out the vote but they're very of your weapon or our Confederate staying home on election day a huge mistake\nYeah we we we make that message to everyone all of the time\nI'm Mike if they if the Democrats regain Congress even if it's by one vote are you willing to say even if it's by one vote they will definitely try to bring up articles of impeachment\nI'll I'll tell you where are you know anything that happens on the on the war of the house of representatives the United States Senate is always accompanied with some\nKind of head count your big dumb leaders of the Democratic party now trying to do it the more radical members and the more radical candidates and trying to stop talking about impeachment but in reality my understanding is that the ... going on in the back room than in the caucuses\nOther Democratic Party the fact that the party is still radicalized now by whom Trump pay you know they really don't have an agenda and higher agenda on the campaign trail with golfing Trump hating Trump hating on Trump to point either\nBut they're still can go by that\nBut they will at least try to do it\nAnd if they fail it in ... when they certainly will do whatever they can stop the president ever return so if you if they failed or being trapped there certainly are going to turn the economy around and do things that are all around\nUs in just so people know the house brings up the articles of impeachment the trial is held in the Senate if the Senate or to vote along party lines um I think even after these midterms Republicans maintain control the Senate\nUm the the impeachment wouldn't go through but Michael what you're saying is it's just the disruption the distraction it may not be successful but it'll be a distraction\nThat and if you look at the present\nA program you know the foreign policy and get a you know interacting with North Korea South Korea trying to bring them together at the new we ride or you know his ah work to try to a corner Iran and drop that global sponsor terrorism\nThe president will be completely ... that are more international thing yeah well not ... but people have to go check what\nWere the people aren't with him but I got the foreign policy alone he'd be stop\nThe would be stopped up finally what do you think the chances are right now before I let you go of Democrats read gaining control of Congress I'm In the mid term\nElection were held today the Democrats would take the how represented but friends are going in the Republican favor you know the enthusiasm gap but you're being fair where the Democrats are much more and parents about their their interest in voting that evaporated Republican there now\nEqually in Tampa and Democrat and voting and you know if you walk in the er the target of district that are troublesome for Republican\nBut gap in in a in a quota thing there on a favorable versus on paper what were they going to vote Republican or Democrat we're going in the right direction but we're not there yet if you elect were held today we'd have a Democratic House\nSorry Michel ...
