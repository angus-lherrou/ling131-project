the surrounding area and it's really thriving yet here in West are are poverty rate has increased um how we're making national attention for an extreme poverty level\nAnd those are happening under his watch 'em and instead of showing concern for western you know he got very defensive and and blame me for trashing his city\nUm and of course they don't have them back with no huge trashed your city um but you know at that and it did make a great soundbite\nBut honestly what about the concern for the problems in western here I Would absolutely no concern\nWell he's more concerned about third world countries and as I said he's in he's in Boston today meeting with the Cuban ambassador for\nFor what last I look ah we don't have any a Cuban cigars stores and in downtown Worcester and we're not making parts for fifty seven chevies which is what everybody in Cuba is driving right now\nOn you know even throughout the whole debate you know sitting next to him it was everything you see on TV you

about the companies that have left western high tax\nRates and what can we do to incentivize more business development yeah um luckily some of the businesses that have left western state in the district at a couple of them anyway which is good for the district but when it comes to a rising poverty rate here in the city\nThat has nothing to help and and I know that congressman doesn't have direct control over that but indirectly he can really try to help and influence that environment here in West or\nWe're talking with Tracy live on she's running against congressman Jim McGovern and
