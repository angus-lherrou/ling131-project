where he was robbed\nIn a decision in a boxing match\nWhen he was robbed well he used that word which is not an appropriate word to use that a post game press conference when you're a football coach it's not\nJust not been in academia\nThere seems to be a double standard I Know I Know you're surprised right that's that's all part of the breaking news here\nWe have a Georgetown professor Dr Carroll Christine fair who's fifty years old she's an associate professor and the security studies program within the Edmund a Walsh school of foreign service\nAt the prestigious Washington DC school do you want to hear what she wrote in her tweak\nDanny heavy you um have you heard about what she wrote in her tweet that rape is a pretty bad thing right\nEveryone believes that you and it's not something or\nI don't know if Steve is up off the floor yet um it's not something that you should actually make jokes about I mean maybe in one of those night clubs where\nYou know they do make a kind of like really ... the way out their humor baby\nBut it's it's not something you want to talk about you know I mean it it's just it's not good so anyway um she put out a tweet and uh they said this\nLook at this chorus of titled white men justifying a serial rapists\nBag a aggregated entitlement she rode all of them deserve a miserable death while feminists laugh as they take their last gas bonus we cast straight their corpses\nAnd feed them to swine yes everybody here that [noise]\nSo uh Georgetown professor\nSaid that entitled white white men justify a I I mean justifying the serial

in ... marry a a A R on\nStrike they went on strike this morning [laughter] yeah and I'll tell you what they timed it pretty well you got the Columbus Day weekend coming up yeah not good you know all the people the bartenders the valet housekeepers they're gone yeah you're out of there\nI've seen the ah I've been watching some of the Boston news stations I've seen the video yeah ooh John especially by the way when you got an economy that's the way it is right now\nWell and they felt like you can go out and find a replacement workers right\nYou know it will be here I'll be curious to see how Mary I handle this because you had that Amazon announced yesterday that workers I I've been waiting for this moment you know worse or how you and I've been talking about wages for three years yes\nFinally workers are recognizing that they have leverage on these companies Dario if you're the company\nBelieve me you want to depressed wages as much as you possibly can yeah\nAnd I worked for a lot of depressing wages\nWell you know think about it here the if you're the c._e._o. and the CFO that company you don't make a bonus because you gave ... or re [laughter] you know there's still having me that the company they the way these guys said right yeah that's true\nIf they're paid based on managing expensive they'll call it but they you know when when you look at a business like very odd I'm guessing thirty thirty five percent of their overhead is wage yeah labor expense yeah so the more you can depressed that the bigger bigger your CEO bonuses got to be workers\nFinally figuring this out and there I I think they're going to get paid I I think Mary up there and how you\nKnow they're very profitable company um if you're the CFO you're calling the the guy doing the negotiation and saying okay well you know you give them another dollar an hour and the vet\nAnd see if that works yeah yeah I Know um retail stocks um is retail\nReborn or or is struggling\nYou know why do you like if you look at the retailers right now the you're the manager for a Wal Mart okay or a BJ's right between the local company yeah bee Jay's pays nine dollars an hour so you've got a kid coming into work or you got a full time worker\nBee Jay's is making ten bucks an hour he's going to be knocking on your door is the manager and say hey I just heard Amazon a payment Fifteen bucks an hour right what are you going to do right and so what we saw yesterday is retail stocks go down in value all because\nPeople are saying hey if Amazon paying Fifteen target is going to pay Fifteen Walmart home the Home Depot only pays ten bucks an hour so that and I'm\nGoing from their minimum hourly wages but Macy's pays minimum hourly wage of nine dollars an hour Dollar General pays eight dollars an hour or so\nThese companies Jim ... they're competing for workers it's a great story when when companies have to compete for workers wages go up they go up the low end right the guy that it was\nNine is now making Fifteen Fifteen he's going to spend now he is right\nRight ... ... it's all part of the shall I say the circle of life in the economy state Bernie Sanders came out yesterday all excited\nAbout Amazon the trumpeter he and Trump or on the same page\nAnd see the thing is Bernie do you understand there's an example of something that works not what you propose a main he did it on their own understand anything you know smile evoked a little too much guys which\nI find that to be a very unfold thing I Will not be listening to the financial exchanged today [laughter] Armstrong everybody you get it all ten to twelve\nDo not miss the show I you know we're listening today Barry thanks very much thanks very sorry when we return I Do need to I\nI Do want to go through the synopsis of charges against a Brett Kavanaugh\nI Want to go through what Cory Booker has said most recently you know cheering Cory Booker looks\nOff into the distance and talks like this\nCory Booker

and if you're offering new study toilets or methods instead of saying\nLike you should do this they want to try doing it this way I read online that hundreds of kids do it this way and they find the ... year\nAnd then you've got all these other people right\nAround him I'm sure that we could find it to people who think that Mother Teresa was a jerk\nI'm sure there's two people out there who would be willing to say it was a jerk but you know so Cory Booker would say All right mother Theresa's a jerk [noise]\nWhen it's temperament had been revealed in an emotional moment [noise]\nWhere do you use language that that frankly shocked a lot of\nThe language shock to you purchase from Newark\nSeriously Corey you you you're from Newark you the man who wrote in a book about how you realized that you had to coerce girls to have sex with him\nThat you um fond older woman without her\nConsent that she really didn't want you to do that oh okay\nAnd then ultimately [noise]\nNot whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial for all federally\nHas enough questions the rain that we should not move on to wait another candidate\nYou really enough questions having been raised we've raised questions about\nFlying for flatulence as my race you know National Review did a pretty good piece\nAnd you know I'm just going to use it as kind of an outline for what we're going to go through here because I think it's important to realize that every time the goalposts gets move we got to remember where the goalposts was before he's talking about whether or not this person is qualified to serve on the court\nI'm sure Cory Booker if given the three hundred decisions\nThat judge Kavanaugh rendered would have trouble understanding them\nOr help me with this word here no seriously okay\n[noise] um if you noticed\nOver last weekend to follow social media Twitter\nThe debate over Brett Kavanaugh moved from ah whether\nOr not he was involved with assaulting a young woman thirty five thirty six years ago\nIt move from that to the discussion and debate over slang college drinking inside jokes or whether he was just too angry to be a Supreme Court judge here Cory Booker says there\nUm\nIt it became a remember the expression boost and this is silly think he he used the term both as a term for flatulence for the New York times\nI don't know how but did research and found that\nBooth\nOr I have to say this I'm turned the I I turn the turn the echo or the radio or whatever down for for a second if you've got young years New York times did an article that said oh no in the eighties\nBoost meant anal sex\n[noise] I'm not kidding so he obviously committed perjury oh no there's people out there saying because he said that and it really means what I just described it to the sex act um he he committed perjury\n[laughter]\nNow let's hear let's deal with the women making accusations and let's go to the one who is the the ... the least believable\nRemember Michael Abernathy the creepy creepy porn lawyer [noise] he released the declaration that he said he had a woman named Julie sweating it\nWho claimed that she saw cabinet awaiting his term for gang rapes after facilitating them by spiking or drug in\nThe punch at high school party she claimed that she went to multiple such parties and was gang raped at one of them\nThough she would only asserts the cabinet was present on that occasion about this was completely absurd first of all you want me to believe that a woman would repeatedly go to parties where there were gang rapes and\nWhich would presumably generate many witnesses victims bystanders and people didn't say a word for decades about this\nBut\nI'm left wing Twitter\nTweets over the weekend you know what people were saying\nUm than the Catholic Church scandals prove the crimes could be concealed\nNo it didn't\nThat I can see of\nSomebody also ... in a an article in vox V. O. X. yeah you may not be familiar with Danny you're familiar with ...\nThe movie sixteen candles mhm remember the movie sixteen candles a popular eighties movie didn't have a subplot about a drunk male geek sleeping with\nA drunk popular girl but they were both Trump\nThe article in Vioxx use that thought in a subplot in the movie\nTo prove that this could have happened\nUm Wall Street journal\nContacted dozens of former classmates and colleagues only to find they couldn't reach anyone with any knowledge of sweat next allegations no friends of hers have come forward to support her claims\nAgain she said that there were repeated gang rapes now let's look at her credibility turns out\nHer former employer company called the Web trends one sued her for\nDefamation and fraud among other things they contended the sweat and they can gauge in sexually inappropriate conduct and then quote in a transparent effort to divert attention from her own inappropriate behavior made uncorroborated sexual harassment complaints against the two men who accused her of such behavior\n[noise] meanwhile we go Deborah Ramirez the Yale classmate of judge Kavanaugh\nShe said he exposed himself or the party\nUm she was drinking heavily at the time she confesses that our memory\nContains gaps she even told the classmates that she wasn't certain\nAbout anything\nAnd wasn't even certain that it was cabin on\nBoth of those stories should never have run\nThey really shouldn't I mean the New York times didn't even pick up\nA ... story about the view so whenever you hear us some Democrats saying oh no this is what happened this is what happened this is what happened\nThen there were three people know there's really just one\nI'm\nRachel Mitchell remember I told you the woman who interviewed her the um expert in prosecuting sexual assaults and abuse\nRead her memo\nShe said um\nThere are ... there's no way to prosecute this case forward as no corroborating witnesses\nAnd even the friend she says who is that the party and question has denied being there or knowing Kavanaugh\nAt all yet that woman you know Democrats will point to him say but she believes her okay ...
