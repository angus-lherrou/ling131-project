the show today we'll talk to you about all the great things that happened here all the great miracles that happening here is important to point out\nYou need to think of this as your hospital Sean mentioned something that everybody almost cringes down when they hear is that years ago this hospital was going to cause there was declining revenue for the ... you know that they operate hot all over the country\nThere was declining revenue and the issue was ah\nCan we really keep it well people stepped up the community\nAnd they they kept his office and\nEach with good reason\nBecause as as I said not only is it the hospital for many services many orthopedic services by the way for children [noise]\nBut it's also the hospital for people who come from all over the world I get treated here a little bit I think when I was working at a channel forty way back when and doing stories here kind of a coming in and doing a story because some head of state from\nFrom some country was here to the tank the writers for treating some of the citizens of um [noise] their country and\nA little bit I think that my niece would be here having a surgery here are Thirteen hours surgery to correct school yo since then I mean what I tell you is a Thirteen hour surgery or was it started with her on her back and I'm a surgeon\nAll of her organs out of the way while another surgeon was able to work on the spine\nFrom the front end putting her on her stomach and working all of\n'em\nThe spine from the other side\nAnd I thought about this with this girl little girl who's now a woman\nAnd uh how how they that she went through that and just the care that she received here it's incredible\nFor once every three one for six thousand for one three [noise]\nThree one for six\nUm love to the rescue\nIs what we call this love to the rescue and and really it is left to the [noise] it's helping people helping people can I say yeah I'll go through some of the things that are treated here you know ... is one of the things treated here [noise]\nAnd that is the curvature of the spine\nAnd my niece had a very\nVery profound curvature of her spine [noise] um some of the other things ... and ... which can be a heartbreak [noise]\nFor a child\nIt's a very a\nDifficult situation to treat ... treatment center\nHere multi disciplinary team\nIt's a team plastic surgery speech and language that fall gee ear nose and throat doctor services that are provided to families to children whether or not they have the ability to [noise]\nWhether or not they have the ability to but it's also available to you have some money and we are friends as a child with a cleft lip or cleft pallet I I Would suggest that the sitter you consider this [noise] this great institution\nRheumatologist even children as young as one year old can develop arthritis even children as young as one year old develop them [noise]\nThis place that has a national and in fact an international reputation for I'm getting rid of pain both emotionally and physically we see the physical pain [noise] um that the kids go through but you don't often times know the the physical ... the pain that the parents are going to go through\nI didn't realize it and we're going to talk with my niece just for me this was kind of a personal journey who's treated here about nine years ago ... and I didn't realize until she got older she said [noise]\nUh I didn't like I didn't feel comfortable in my body and she has a lot of other physical challenges but she didn't feel comfortable in my body and [noise]\nAfter I had the surgery at once I always be able to walk straight and stand up straight I feel better about myself\nAnd we you don't think of that part of it you think of the miracle of the\nThe physicians and the providers here can do these wonderful things but you don't think about you know well okay the pains relieved mobility is restored and independent life is is uh is is a viable part of the future [noise]\nBut you know think about all I feel better about me\nAnd it's in Springfield too you wouldn't expect something like that here because you know you listen to all the Boston people all the big hospitals around Boston and you know Boston is it you know we wouldn't want to put this you know\nOut here no no I ... and people say you know there is another ... Boston but it's a it's a it's a bird I burn center but for these types of services [noise] people especially in central last you know oh we go east for that we go for that kind of treatment\nAnd again our families personal experience was well they they went everywhere\nAnd they decided this would be the best place and again it's the best place whether you have the ability to say or not whether you have health insurance or not it does not matter and ... and one final thing [noise] um we were fortunate enough to have as a friend of the family someone is an orthopedic surgeon practices and the other part of the country [noise]\nShe reminded us that\nHe learned from the ... ... he's a private practice he learned\nFrom the ... and he said that that's where you learn all the latest and that's where you live in the best is from the the physicians surgeons and the and the providers at ... hospitals so it is left to the rescue folks so we have a phone number just redo Fort won three free one for six thousand\nFor one three three one for six thousand I'm also a four four three five zero Ninety six Ninety eight please please make a pledge make a pledge and raise your own awareness eighties loved to the rescue or the gym police do show\nThis is the seventh and you will love to the rescue radio Don ... hospital for children Springfield\nWould the headlines from the news radio five sixty Tony ... newsroom here's John ... back\nChicken be police need your help finding a missing girl fourteen year old Jasmine ... was reported missing earlier in the week we have a picture of her up on the website right now at W.

a condescending thing yeah that they ... they know they're smart and they know how to relate the information\nAnd you know but when we do an event like this John it puts things in perspective because we talk about the news of the day every day we provided analysis um we go through everything that we take calls and yet\nIt all seems to be\nNot as important when we're here every year doing this event\nBecause it certainly it boils everything down to what's the most important thing and it's not party affiliation and stop politics is not anything else is making sure that families and especially children get the treatment they need and really deserve you know\nWe can talk about politics at any time in at ... pm and and everybody knows it however what we don't know is the great stories that happened in this building every day yeah\nAnd they are and we just we just gave you an example of one Juba and there's a book called them when we don't need the book yeah I mean you know you could pick anybody I'm In this building and they have a life saving story to\nTell just truly lights and and again in the next hour um for those who've heard the radio on and the past and my niece was treated ear or nine years ago it seems like yesterday and um\nShe was a young teenager at the time and now she's a young woman and what a difference it made in your life that I and again I didn't realize until\nAnd um you'll hear this when I when I talk with her that it wasn't just the physical aspects\nOf correcting what was a profound cases ... but it was the emotional\nThe emotional was uncle Jim I I felt better about myself I'm sure I had better mobility but I felt better about myself because I was embarrassed about the way I look about how I was kind of you know\nHunched over yeah hunched over and it was impacting your ribs impacting her walk her gate when she walked\nAnd she's I felt you know when you don't think I even think about that but you know a a a a girl that age wanting to look a certain way the pressures of life and I just didn't realize that that that there was more than a surgery here for one three three one for six thousand eight four four\nThree five

here\nAre here for a while they are here for a long while and um I Know my niece was I Know that the floors above us right now here in Springfield there are kids who are receiving the best care but no
