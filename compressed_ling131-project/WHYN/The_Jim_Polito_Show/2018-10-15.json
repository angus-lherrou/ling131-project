that it's more likely she is one five hundred and twelve Native American [noise] [laughter]\nI'm now getting through the Boston Globe article\nIt says the largest piece of Native American CNA was found on her tents chromosome\nEach human as twenty three pairs and I guess a little it's pretty hard to actually find Native American DNA because there isn't any use samples from Mexico Peru in Colombia to stay in for Native Americans\nAnd I guess she's twelve times just she has twelve times more Native American blood then he white person from Great Britain in ten times more than a white person from Utah\nOh absolutely not absolutely nothing\nI just want to read you the lead to the story this is how the globe would do it and what a surprise that the information was provided to the Boston Globe first here's the lead to the story or as a John would tell us you know in in in news parlance when you write up a newspaper article\nThe first part of the story is called the nut graph issued encapsulate you know what is most important in the story here's the knock graph\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has released a DNA test that provides quote\nStrong evidence she added Native American

twelve Native American won five hundred and twelve Native American by the way folks do you know what this chest proves\nWithout a shadow of a doubt are you ready Steve are you ready they need to know what this proves what does it prove without a shadow of a doubt\nThat she's running for president that any twenty\n... you'd be Steve to it Steve yuppie to it\nYou did I I imagine you were going to

TV just casually browse that your news feed on your mobile device you saw for the accuser comes forward if you just see the headline is\nElizabeth Warren is Native American knows with your won five hundred and twelve Native American so that allows you to check the box\nThat that'll Ali or the headline from NBC ten Boston on Twitter and it's surprising move the senator released information on a DNA test that supports her claims of having Native American ancestry does that\nSays that support the claims idea\nI guess if you're one five hundred and twelve hey let me tell you something I haven't learned though right her claim was one or whatever that was born in one thirty seconds yeah OK one's already Sacco doesn't support our claim so that headline here\nIt ... it doesn't matter this is what this is what she wanted and uh let's see what else um yeah is Danny said or to make up for the jurors of Native American DNA\nScientist use samples from Mexico Peru in Colombia to stand in for Native American now that is because in Mexico Peru in Columbia them native America or not NATO you know what I've got to stop saying Native American and they've got to stop saying Native American it's an insult\nTo American Indians to say Native American but any way that you know for for a group of people who were all hung up on words and labels\nYou shouldn't say Native American go ahead buddy or somebody called and asked basically what how much you would have to be how much but you would have to have to be considered a native and for me\nTo do it all for an indigenous person it's much more

exactly\nOne sixteens and to be that one sixteens\nUs to have someone who is basically full blood indigenous to be able to really make that mix unless of course you have quite a few people in your um ancestry who are a mixed\nAmerican indian race than than the like that then bring up the question of how she allowed to mark American indian on her she shouldn't be able to\nBecause frankly um my uh

into the Boston Globe so that they would put a positive spin on it I mean who else would say that she has strong evidence\nThat she's got native blood but the Boston Globe they broke the story so she gave it to them right so they would write to lead that everybody else would copy\nBut when you read the article you find out the chances are she's not one thirty second native she's won five hundred and twelve native that's won five hundred and twelve\nNative is\nDanny is point\nTwo percent yeah isn't it do the math I don't think it demeans them at all but no that's point two percent that it would be funny to bet is point two percent so everyone has a three\nPoint two percent so if you take a test a DNA test and it shows that you are one percent\nNative\nYou are more native that Elizabeth Warren and I I Would check the box is she in check the box\nWith point two percent native\nUp I think one is your five times more native than her\nAnyway\nSomething came up that confirms what I've said about Elizabeth Warren for a long time\nI had said that she was an odd person an odd\nAnd really not personable she isn't and that will destroy her in running for president no matter how much the media tries to prop per up when she runs against Trump in twenty twenty if she gets the nomination no matter how much they try to proper up\nShe just doesn't she is more plastic than Hillary actually Elizabeth Warren is plastic it's more like um [noise] I don't want to say stone because that that gives you like somewhat of strength um\nShe's like artificial sweetener\nKind of what she's met anyway John Kelly the president's chief of staff\nSomehow people get their hands on a a memo she wrote about a conversation with her\nAnd she Roche\nIt was about the whole dividing people at the border splitting up families and Elizabeth and she wrote in the memo which was not for public consumption\nThat she's an impolite\nArrogant woman and this was an insulting conversation and that she was

Trump these oh he's he's a bull or use it\nThat's Elizabeth Warren I've told you she's an odd person\nOut I guess I could look the other way she could actually get something done she doesn't pay one way richer and Hillary Clinton has no problem with her husband having sex with an intern because it was consensual\nI'll explain when we return you're listening to the gym please do show you're safe

a Native American in her family tree\nThat's all you'll see you have to read the article to find out that this person goes six to ten generations back\nAnd couldn't make Kerr\nWon five hundred and twelve Native American which would be point two percent Native American\nPoint two percent Native American which which she used to check the box\nPoint two percent point two percent just keep saying that to yourself and when your stuff comes back from ancestry dot com even says one percent American indian or indigenous\nThen you should check the box by not giving you advice legal advice or advice for human resources or whatever but she checked the box for point two percent\nNative blood\nBut there's your headlines for the day telling me I'm I'll tell you what I Want you to call tomorrow and I want you to tell me how many times how many times during the day you hear\nA those are the Warren vindicated Elizabeth Warren ... point two percent grace grace grace grand mother born in the late Seventeen hundreds\nThis isn't proven I mean that's what\nThis scientist in Georgia came up with no she didn't go to ancestry dot com she didn't go to twenty three and me she went there\nAnd she got an expert to do it and who did she gave it to see because if you gave it to any other news organization the headline would not be there's strong evidence that line would be\nElizabeth Warren point two percent American indian but she gave it to the globe now let the spin\nBegan and speaking of spin we've just so much news speaking of women running for president because the only hard evidence that comes out of this DNA test\nIs that she's definitely running for president remember when the Berkshires eagle one of the most liberal newspapers in the state didn't editorial and said look\nSenator Warren take the test if you're not native you'll have time to deal with it if you are then you'll be able to shut up Trump's he'll shut up Trump\nWas point two percent by the way just for the record I was one of the first\nYou know people to say I will pay for the test\nAnd kind of glad she went off on a room\nBecause what if she'd come to me and said\nYeah you pay for the tests that the you know for your county nine bucks right nothing ah I'm sure this guy was a little bit more expensive\nSpeaking of women running for president Hillary Clinton yeah I Know how can we miss you if you will go away but I don't want you to go way\nHillary Clinton on a CBS Sunday Morning yesterday asked about Bill Clinton and the meat to move freshmen and this solves\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill a sexual misconduct ... well\nThat's a lie right there that's a lie so many people from the inner circle have written about the bimbo ruptured ... unit in the Clinton campaign and she added it up and her job was to destroy women who came forward\nAnd disgust relationships either consensual\nOr non consensual that they had with Bill Clinton next point remember James Carville they're good friend that's what you get when you're dragging a dollar bill through a chain of popped\nRight you're going to tell me you Hillary nothing we\nAll know she's a liar I take responsibility for my life and my actions\nShe also know Hillary seat listen you can say that had you divorced bill let me let's let's be honest about Hillary here\nUse the majority of this uh the audience here doesn't like Hillary right I mean come on it's got an email with there being a woman you know what\nI said this to a friend over the weekend when this came out I Would have respect for Hillary Clinton if she had long ago booted his ass out\nIf she had said I Am done with this\nI Wonder about respect for her\nWouldn't have changed how I felt about her politically and her ideology\nAnd her her insatiable hunger for power and money\nBut I Want him said hey\nLee she's got her house in order hey remember that's what Michelle Obama\nIn two thousand eight when her husband was running against Hillary for the Democratic primary in nod to be the presidential candidate on the Democrats' side she said if you can't keep your house in order\nHow you're going to keep the country in order that was basically saying you got a husband who's a dog and you can't keep them in check how are you going to deal with everything else she was right but I Would have respect for Hillary\nIf tomorrow I mean it's kinda late now but if tomorrow she said I'm done with him I guess I wouldn't believe it 'cause I'd say yeah you just doing it gives you want to run for president twenty twenty and you figure this will work\nSide by side as he was impeached after lying about his affair with a White House intern some today have said he should have stepped down\nIn retrospect do you think\nBill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now more there are people who look at the incidents in the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an internal power imbalance as to why an adult\nBut let me ask you this is\nWhere the investigation of the current income\nSeat right away the Monica Lewinsky situation is not me to let me deflect and let me push it off\nLet me push it off on to the president occupants of the White House your husband had sex with an intern with an intern in the oval office so the most powerful person in the country\nAnd then and in turn and\nThat was consensual and that was in power\nReally okay so if the president say of IBM had sex with a twenty two year old in turn\nOn the job and a relationship and he was married you wouldn't call that to me to be really you wouldn't call that an abuse of power\nThank you for all your help we appreciate it because you're helping the Republicans to hold onto the house and grow in the Senate Johnny from Oxford wants to get a quick word in before we break about Elizabeth Warren good morning Johnny\nGood morning Jim how are\nYou today thank you sir very good\nAh so I I didn't want to interrupt you there and that's really quite quite true making about

thing\nWe're all living a lot longer yeah how long realistically should people plan to be alive and retirement\nAnd it's kind of awful question asked if you're turning sixty five on average people are

people these days that actually have a pension and retirement so\nA very small minority of us still get pensions most of us the only fixed income coming it's going to be Social Security [noise]\nYou know there's no perfect ruined it really comes down to budgeting and figuring out what your true needs are but it's your turn sixty five and the amount that you're going to need from your portfolio your total invested assets is less than four percent\nYou're on the right track if you're looking at your money and saying hey you know I've got a\nHalf a million dollar portfolio and I knew in
