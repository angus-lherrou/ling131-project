did\nMollie Hemingway she um she's a senior senior editor for the federalist yes a a right leaning publication she\nWas on a great show yesterday um but I like\nUm [noise] with a Fox and\nLet me let me just give you an indication of what she said where\nThe where the press really really fail parents\nTaught Christine Fordham fashions especially given that many sexual assault victims don't remember all the details of what happened ...\nPeople kept saying on in the media that's going to ... or ... or ... credit for it when he was doing was pointing out what anybody could see when they watch Chuck ... which is that we're a major holes that were major flaws every major contradictions\nI actually thought that a lot of the media should have been pointing us out themselves and you didn't see that she didn't think people going through and looking at her story which changed over time multiple times they never were able to corroborate any aspect of it they spend all their time looking at ice throwing at parties in your book things and they should have been actually doing but he did that they should have been pointing out that she had flaws in her tests\nAnd well if you look at the transcript you could say yes he is he is saying that if we're going to scrutinize media than a political system's going to scrutinize to nominate let's look at the accuser but the tone\nFor it to me was unmistakable we thought it\nWas about the town and the problem with the talent and all the things you're saying ... hundred percent true about missing or the fair cover just problems in our test my was that you ... then he is speaking also the people who\nBelieve her and who also have had their own experiences so it looks as I was his locking them personally\nAnd that is one of the problems with President Trump and and his talent and when he addresses problems like this and that tail interpret it one way and and and it's harmful can be harmful previously said he found her credible which was much more than a lot of people thought when they saw some credit for that one he was ... lab or he was mocking in New York Times reporter\nAnd then he explained that again it just it just said well a lot of people and ...\nAnd when his ability as a judge Janine um I have\nNow that reporter with disabilities by the way I'm there's evidence of Trump\nMaking the same voice in the

about here\nOf course we have to treat Dr Ford with compassion\nBut doesn't mean we have to believe everything that she says you know\nI saw here and I doubt very much this is going to come out um
