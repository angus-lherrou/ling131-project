I guess\nOur own Senator Elizabeth Warren\nShould be held responsible anytime a police officer is killed or attacked by a minority because she said\nThe criminal justice system is racist front to

lawyer I Would say first and foremost and you can see this right on their car that they give you the letters El Al am what does that mean\nAfter the attorney's name it means that they've got a masters in taxation yeah so they are so they undergraduate degree law school and a master's degree or some sort of taxation which is from law school it's a specialty law degree they specialize in it so\nVery important because it's going to be covering all aspects of tax here a state tax or income tax or gift tax\nAre all impacted when you do these irrevocably trust so you need to know that flat fee or

could do it deniro impression if deniro are playing a character who is in a tuberculosis hospital\nYou know the ... did you even know who I Am [laughter] that's better than mine yeah yeah you send me a package you sent me a package when you think I don't you think I don't I had already have a package you think I don't he got on the bench yeah\nSo Robert Deniro I mean it fits the motif of everyone who's receive them Robert Deniro has been an unspoken\nOr I mean an outspoken\nCritic of the president and um if you were a whack job\nAnd you are trying to get it all\nThese liberals and yeah you would include the narrowing the list I can think of other people uh we were talking earlier this morning that there's a report out that they're expecting\nA package for Joe Biden former vice president I don't know how you're expecting you know like I'm expecting something from prime you know [noise]\nBut anyway I Want you to think about this in two different ways and I'm going to um [noise] I'm going to put some more meat on these bones after the news at the top of the hour we're Steve who is doing humans worked for John Day back I Want you to think about it in two different ways\nOne\nThis is the president's fault I mean that's what I'm being told it's the president's fault while I'm being told that by like Jeff Zucker who runs CNN\nThat words matter will affords really mattered Jeff you you would you would be doing fact checking on a lot of your stories because you guys have screwed up quite a bit in the past two years trying to get Trump event to do retractions and then you've refused to do retractions when you've obviously been wrong but okay\nSo words matter I get it Jeff I get it words matter so words matter\nAre we saying that no matter what you say it will cause people to act so\nEvery cop who's been shot by a minority since Elizabeth Warren said the criminal justice system is racist front to back are we saying that that\n... or she is responsible for all those cops because if you are saying Donald Trump's responsible you have to say\nThat she is responsible you have to and let's say get us up by the way it was taking a step further folks\nFrom there um could ... if if words that powerful so if we catch this person\nCan they use as a defense Donald Trump made me do it\nI mean you completely take away their responsibility from the individual who ... who acted\nThe ... you can't have it both ways and that's what the Dems are trying to do here\nI'm Eric Holder or\nDidn't he received one of these packages well didn't he say\nThat when they're down or when they're down we\nKick them so anybody who's um who's assaulted by protesting antifa\nThe\nThe ... the mob of can we say well it's obviously Eric Holder's fault and if that person is caught and arrested and charged with assault was shot fought\nCan we should we just exonerate him you see how crazy it is\nIt's all politics it's all politics now\nLet me get to the next step and I'm just going to give you a little bit of a tease with it\nDoes this just seem a little too perfect\nOf a crime\nIn what I mean by that is no not like uh the the person won't be caught I mean I I think ultimately the person who will be caught it took a long time to catch the Unabomber but since then\nWe've\nWe've developed ways to be able to really catch someone for doing this doesn't seem a little too perfect\nKind of like when when somebody spray paint a swastika on their house and then\nYou find out that their\nCans of spray paint in their trash that kinda stuff\nWill get into all that after the news you're listening to the gym police do show your safe space why\n... ... well on that level the Jim ... show I\nLine backer builders yard we then providing an equal local service since Nineteen forty eight we take pride in our servicemen products now it's about providing tap caught in combat competitive pricing for about contractors an idea why guys check us out on line at that time\nTwo things for you to think about this whole situation I'm an implied is that is\nAnd the sick and twisted and awful but that that's the implied obviously and um we don't want anything bad to happen to anyone no matter how we feel about them politically and that's ridiculous but\nSee if you heard a a little something 'cause I I gave a taste of what I'd like to talk about which is\nIt just seems to perfect and and I don't mean perfect like I like it or the perfect in is successful just like all of these people now Robert Deniro we find out this morning a suspicious package went to his place\nIt just George Soros it just seems to perfect but what did you hear\nThe well I gotta do this we don't really know anything until we have we have suspects ... thank goodness none of these have actually gone off by um I'd just when when you mentioned that it's just too perfect I mean I Am a maybe it's just 'cause I I'm a skeptic of everything and now in the world we live and I'm even more skeptical\nOf everything that happens um and I I don't necessarily disagree with your questioning of it I I think that we've\nYou know my first thought when you were talking about this was the article that came out in the New York times that was written by some uh you know mole and the Trump Administration and who is who is the mole we got to track down the mall we got to figure out this whole thing and then two days later it wasn't a story anymore we have no idea who that was we don't seem to air\nUm so that I don't know what suspicious to me at the time and we didn't get any resolution on it so I I don't I don't know every name that comes out and every bomb that is found on detonated\nA I guess as a news person and just as a skeptic to me uh that makes me just a little bit more cautious as to what was the motivation behind all this\nYeah I mean I'm certainly not\nHoping that something like this happens but don't you think it's unusual that none of the bombs have gone off\nI mean of course if the person went online and got instructions on line and did something wrong and it looks like they're all coming from the same person and they're all the bombs appear to be all the same I mean again where\nYou can't rely on all the information you're getting because some of its elite some of his it of it is from unnamed sources all this but\nIf they're all the same than they might have made the same mistake in all of them right or or did the person say I'm going to make something that looks exactly like a bomb just to scare you\nTo really really scary you but I'm not going to actually use the bomb like someone who goes into a bank with a toy gun that you're still charged as armed robbery but it's it can be different because you actually don't have a gun\nUm but the other side of this is what what's been going on in the country every whereas this fake stuff\nYou know a a home has swastikas painted on it and then we find out later chances are which is the person who live there you know college campuses\nYou know a white supremacy a literature was distributed you know I don't buy it because so many of you know a woman in a Muslim his job so she was beaten by a bunch of guys with Trump paths who are driving a pickup Enrique to be here and we find out she made it up\nAll of these things make me skeptical of this\nBut what I don't think is productive is blaming the president and not because I was saying I defend everything the president says I've made it quite clear on the show there are things he says I don't like I like substance a lot you know like some of the things he says\nBut if you're going to do that and like Jeff Zucker has come out swinging about this I mean Chris Cuomo on CNN hugs and kisses Don Lemon\nYou know talk about dramatics last night you know we're live real live\nLet me tell you something and I only told this story I think once on the air at Fox twenty five okay look we all know it's scary\nTo be in a circumstance where wow I was in a building or a bomb came into it you know OK guys\nBut you know what you were in the news business don't over dramatize if\nI'm I was standing\nOn the very spot\nWhere the first bomb went off at the\nMarathon bombing\nWas standing on the very spot where the first bomb went up about an hour before it went off\nOkay I was standing there on that spot an hour before I went to\nI never saw I never thought twice about it like oh my God I could have been killed\nHe's he'll be standing there an hour before a one off or ten years before it went off it doesn't matter you weren't there when it went off or what if I could have I hate that dramatic and frankly you know I'm bringing up the story just to make the point of these two knuckleheads\nHugging and kissing on the air over you know the thing\nIt's all it's all showbiz it's all crap or of\nCourse it's a terrible thing to have a bomb come into somebody's building you should be scared but don't give me this all the bomb came into our building and we're lucky to be in their attacking us because we're the media stay but just makes me sick\nWas ... and it's and it's ... you mentioned the dramatics of it and like one of my biggest problems with NBC among all of them is that they their little bottom of the screen thing that they put on is way more focused on being cute in finding something funny than actually being accurate which is dangerous\nAnd you know even last night I tried to watch the first twenty minutes of Lester Holt to get the story and you know they you know they they put the words a dangerous rhetoric or you know whatever the catchphrase is where the texture of Donald Trump or or doing something and I'm like well\nWhat wait a minute like slow down\nHere like it they the connection that they just make blatantly to again people that aren't as informed as you and I and our listening audience the average people going about their day coming home and turning on the six o'clock news\nI like it it's just so\nUm that to me is is fake news without being fake news that is\nYou know the the the the underlying problem here is that people only pick up the news in tiny little snippets and when it's something that is as baseless as that tiny little thing up in the upper corner and that's where that's where you get really dangerous to me\nIt it it's Trump's fault it's Trump salt\nI mean he really just like uh what if I came on the air and God Forbid and a police officer or a white police officer was killed by a minority and if I went on the air and said well this is because Elizabeth Warren said that the criminal justice system is racist from front to back\n... you're taking away all the responsibility from the person who actually did it\nYou taking away all the responsibility from the sick twisted individual who sent these bombs to everybody and and like I said\nThey could be all fake and I'm just to scare people because it doesn't matter it's just as bad when you open up a package and you see a bomb you don't know that it's fake but on the other side of this being CNN having Jeff Zucker come out the head of CNN and blamed the president for this\nAnd then to have Cuomo and Don Lemon you know to\nHyper liberal partisans hugging and kissing 'cause they made it through that's fake that's fake\nI Will say I will say it's it's tough to imagine that if somebody is sick and twisted as to send these things in the first place yeah they're going to go through all the time and effort and energy to do it knowing full well that ... they're going to get caught in the end\nAnd be ... if they're fake then nobody's actually really gonna get hurt and again you have to put yourself in the mind to that person so like yeah so I I\nAn envelope

hearing from Jeff Zucker head of CNN that this was all the president's fault that that's helpful right now if you believe that\nSomeone was motivated by the president's words to do this let's just think of it logically so you believe that there's somebody out there\nWho feels that the president's speaking to them and has told them go out and do this so you go out there and you attack the president for it are you actually encouraging that person to do more\nI'm just using your own logic against you Jeff Zucker but aren't you and if you believe that somebody did the really the president is responsible for getting this person to do this\nWell now if they're so devoted to the president that they would do this you're attacking the president there's going to be more\nRight 'cause you just motivated them they didn't get there they didn't get there I'm desired result yeah I Know it's insanity eight five five four zero three Ninety eight forty six let's go to join in good morning Joe
