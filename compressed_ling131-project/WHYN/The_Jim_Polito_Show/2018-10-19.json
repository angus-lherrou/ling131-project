what was the sixty seven the impossible dream team but they did the impossible and Danny was you know during the five o'clock hour when we were just on in central mess explaining\nIt and he said he his exceeded expectations and uh then that's it saved\nYour what are the ones saying that it and they're not going to make it to the world series\nUh pretty much yeah I Know problem rooting against this team I'm a I was just I'm Amazed at how well they're pitching was I mean I remember saying couple days ago they got a score five\nFive or more runs against everybody if they're going to win and a lot of times they had to do that but uh no it's really like all coming\nTogether I uh I hate when they say the teams of destiny but I mean when they need a big hit\nThey get a big hit when they need a big deaths in the outfield they got to be catching the outfield and they need a big strike out they get a big strike out and I know I Need fan interference interference right now um it's funny even though they said going into today's game\nOr I'm Sorry into last night's game they sort of\nThe red Sox had this approach of like well if we when we when we lose we lose right because we're up three to one in the series were still playing down in Houston if we lose this game whatever we go back to Fenway Park we got two more ...\nI'll be two in the series and so last night was I don't want to call it a throwaway game it never is in the play offs but they they would have accepted a loss and yet they went out there and got great pitching from a a guy who is just stunk his entire career in the playoffs\nFinally came out of a shell and pitch great they got the wind and I I think expectations changed now because they are much better than either of the teams in the national league and\nUh they should should be World Series or bus right now for the red Sox\nDown there we go they'll tell you what would it be fun Jim is if if the Dodgers win and then you get all these guys from LA coming out here where it's going to be you know a nine degrees in you know raw at stuff and\n... you know what Danny and I didn't even think about it because I was asking him earlier who do you want

doing now is trying to help you to understand wildlife care center of Wilbur him can do for you because there may come a time when you have to make a decision quickly\nAnd you need to have all the information up front\nSee life care center of Wilbur ham is what's known as a skilled nursing facility and they do short term rehab they take care of you when you're not sick enough to be in the hospital but you're not quite ready to go home yet\nAnd you know sometimes you've got yourself or a loved one in the hospital the doctor says well you're you don't need to be here anymore we're not quite ready to go home yet you need to rehab then they hand you a list of places and you have to decide right there or you have to pick for your loved one\nWrong about this obviously I think everyone's happy that the red Sox won it's a bit unexpected I think many people thought going into the series used it was a better team but\nThe red socks they'll played them for the five games so it's good for them and they're a rookie coach a pitching staff it's kind of thrown together in into the world series they go into the world\nSeries and go Steve for any who's back\nFrom from a couple of days of seeing fish and that's issued the ph do\nTest right baby she's I've ever had was fed to actually um ... these guys recognize you now when you go to see fit now you know I Know Ernie I'm shocked at how many people are there like this is my five order show I'm like you need a job ...\n... yeah ... like the folks who used to follow the dead Iraq right at the same thing um so\nActually it's funny Jim I timed it perfectly last thanks I went to bed about eight and the first ... they tend and that I woke up at eleven forty five turn on the TV for the last four pitches of the game was perfect then rolled over went back to bed\nI said hey I got a four and a half hour baseball games are just a boy this is going to be a grind especially if I'm you know if the weather's going to be as it is here in Boston and you get the ah LA Dodgers coming to town for a four and a half hour game at forty one degrees in and raw good luck I'm not\nJust the LA it's not just the LA Dodgers right Jamie it's the LA fans coming out here and saying\nWhere's the sushi stand how come you can't get sushi Fenway\nYes I think the I mean they've had been played this last series in Milwaukee has been exactly warm in Milwaukee this week\nOr so we've at least had the the people to do that so far yeah the fans however that come up to the world series I've just seen the thing standing room only tickets going for a hundred and eighty dollars a piece at Fenway Fenway Park than to go stand there and forty degree weather free eighty dollars and freeze\nThem freeze yeah but to be there for a game I'm a ... it's exciting and I I mean it's great the perspective here is the patriots are off to a great season now and we've got the red Sox so\nA real fair weather fans I mean I think are just gonna have to suck it up\nAnd watch for and a half hours of baseball just pass to and it's going to be you know what it's painful for us because we've got to watch it now and we got to get up and do the show that it's in the afternoon guys have it easy\nYeah a lot of the world series games they'll start to later either they're in the west coast games that you might not start to really\n[noise] I mean the the the ... what nine o'clock if it's in LA again company nine eight seven six row yeah started at nine o'clock will be getting up and watch the final pitch is right will be getting up to go to work then there'll be throwing the final pitch is on\nWay I mean I Know for next week so I'll be up extra early so I can actually that watch some of the game on prepping\nThat's gonna hurt although I Will say that to him to people like John that everybody else who just hates Boston sports\nI just I wanted to say uh\n[noise] yeah that's yeah [laughter] [noise]\nDanny what was that forty ONE Championship or parents is an Eighteen feels magic that from Boston [noise] [laughter]\n[noise] well\nYou were in Germany bees or the Yankees fan and he doesn't carry like happy about it but some people just not new a New York post first thing I turn to when I found out that the red Sox had one and the New York post what's a\nHold on a second let me just read let me just read the headline 'cause we've got so much other news to do it Yankees fans only can watch as their greatest rival dominates again\nI Love it my all of it All right let's\nGet to let's get to a recreational pot here\nA few issues on recreational pot in the commonwealth now we're being told that the recreational pot stores are going to be open by Halloween is that is that trick or treat Danny how can they get this all in line for by the end of the month it's\nSupposedly they found to testing facilities yesterday a now and they would have to be an open said facilities testy marijuana in the head sold in ... eleven days I don't yeah\nSteve a when you saw fish did you notice that there's a shortage of um marijuana out there\nYeah it seems to me like the uh the ... the black market and the underground or area has just been totally dried up\nAnd it's just a impossible for anybody to find themselves any sort of marijuana ever a at all whatsoever at least that was the nation I got yeah you're being sarcastic yes I Am it's everywhere and the longer that they wait the more the prices keep dropping in the black market and the less money the ... the towns are are ah the states actually go\nSo states actually going to get because because the recreational marijuana is that I still think is going to be cheaper\nMuch cheaper than the stuff you're going to buy legitimately think about it this way think about the fact that there are certain things that we can't manufacture in this country\nCheaper than the Chinese\nAnd the reason is well in this country we have um we have a higher standard of living\nWe have all these um environmental laws we have all these labor laws and everything else so the fact that you have to ship something here from China means nothing because you can make it over there so cheaply well compare that\nTo pot in the commonwealth of Massachusetts\nIs still going to be cheaper to buy illegal pot because it doesn't have to go to a testing facility it doesn't have to go to a retail establishment to be sold\nThink about the costs associated with the recreational marijuana and to sell it versus getting pot from your regular dealer\nGot you're also paying tax or when you buy an MD our head to the guy on the streets right riding an extra ten Fifteen bucks right there\nYeah exactly so speaking of smoking this is what I Want to know down in North Hampton you know I should say up in North Hampton they want to\nBan smoking in all of downtown [laughter]\nNo I'm Serious hey are you getting a laugh Steve but\nHave you ever gotten through there every other person is a chain smoker is annoying if that's\nRight exactly everybody's ripping box like crazy and right now they already have a ban on public buildings like city hall you can't be within a certain distance of city hall in order to to rip to rip up but [noise]\nBut now the the members of the council\nFor the city council are discussing it and they're saying we want to ban it out right in all of downtown\nWhich you know it's interesting because north Hampton doesn't want to do things like stop people from ... on the street and sleeping ah you know in front of a business is trying to be you know I've known business\nAnd the president claims a democratic money left wing money is behind supporting them but if it is wouldn't Democrats be shooting themselves in the foot wouldn't this give\nYeah Trump an excuse to point to the spectacle there and say this is why we need the border six\nYeah absolutely I I think it would be a it will be trouble for the Democrats to get involved in this especially now even though the timing is suspect because if these migrants are allowed to continue on they would get to the U.S border writer on election day yeah so\nUh and that is a curious but yeah I I Would think that it would be very foolish for the Democrats to get involved in this and to support something like this you know what the the president\nLaid out a pretty good match it where he is loud and clear saying hey we may end up sending troops to the border seal everything off or we're going to cut off aid to those countries who are allowed this to happen\nAnd I think the message got through to Mexico because it looks like they have a plan now uh they're bringing the un high commissioner for refugees to help with the situation along the southern Mexican border\nWhere we understand some of these caravan members are beginning to arrive [noise] ah so what they're going to do is set up shelters and processing centers along the southern border\nAnd those who show up with valid visas will be allowed through those who want to apply for asylum or obese\nI Will have to be processed that could take up to forty five days those who would who are deemed not eligible will be turned around and sent the country of origin\nAnd Mexico is also said Jim that if people have paid their system and end up getting to the U.S border Mexico is given permission for the United states is

perfect yeah yeah so so what's going on today Mike\nA well a lot of international news today show or the Chinese government reported their GDP Growth gross domestic product how the economy's doing and what I felt was a pretty good quota in fact you know the worst numbers that China has put out since the great recession since two thousand\nI'm so you know if you look at this day clearly parachute to be working\nYeah it down and we're trying to inflict on the Chinese economy is working their GDP has slowed down to the lowest level since uh nine their stock market's down ... percent\nI'm On that level seems to be working a that said you know are typically speaking when the second largest economy in the world was down to a lot of other economy so\nI can have a little bit of a ripple effect but I think the core that I'm taking away from this is that our policies at least seem to be having an economic impact right the question is whether they have any political sway over there\nYeah and the thing is the Chinese says as you and I both know you know when you're looking at economies and markets in other parts of the world for the most part you can make a pun go to the bank with what they're saying\nRight Chinese manipulate their currency Chinese don't tell the truth about a lot of things so I mean if they're telling you their economy slowed down\nProbably a lot worse it's probably a lot or exactly hey honey I um yeah well I I just I bumped somebody in the parking lot with the car yet that means that it's total\nI sent a few bucks on lottery tickets [laughter]\n\nHey listen suffer your daughter's college fund right\nYeah yeah well though right so what else is cooking\nThe European Union a breakfast negotiations continue but there's not a thorn in the side going on right now I'd

much independence members of the you can have and I didn't really come at worst time if there is a real big fight here\nWith the Italians in youth and leave the room open for the British to negotiate better deal as well so I couldn't come at a worse time it can come in a worse time for the European Union having this fight but we'll see we'll see where it goes\nUm [noise] the Italian economy not in great\nYou know it's not but Italians are very good tip per se you know that the Seattle when you think about it like that and you know they just want to extend a little bit of that to their economy
