R. M. C. did some polling in Massachusetts and said wow\nI mean Scott Brown is surging this this guy from rent them could actually win this Senate seat\nThey started pouring money into the race I don't think Jeff deal is getting a lot of money from the RMC they're spending it like in North Dakota where they think they can unseat the incumbent Democrat Senator Heidi Heitkamp\nPouring and it's working because the polling while it's chicken or egg she was slipping in the polls and that that that brings in national money\nI don't know if like Scott Brown there's polling that shows and and it would take a we'll take another few days to get some good polling what what was the impact of\nWarren's debacle with the DNA on this state wide race I mean it's really hurt her and the national\nRace to become president and twenty twenty but I'm a state wide race will it make a difference last polling I saw double digit lead cheetahs over Jeff to you is that going to shrink\nSo the real point is like what Scott Brown if we hear that are in the money is going to Jeff deal and we'll find out will know just like we did but Scott Brown you know that that won't be a major secret when we hear that will say well\nJeff deals chances just increased\nIt would be interesting and\nI think no matter what Jeff deal goes up in the polls right now he is the Republican facing Elizabeth Warren in the election we can get two debates coming up\nAnd I know that the western mass news consortium has one coming up I don't know if it's this weekend maybe it's a Sunday we'll get back to you on that\nBut there's one ah tomorrow night I think to they've got to debate it will be interesting to see how Geoff Diehl handles this remember\nScott Brown when he ran against Elizabeth Warren and she defeated him he would call her professor Warren he talked about the Indian\nThe question\n... interesting to see\nWhat Jeff deal does like what his people\nAre telling him\nRemember Holly robust shot she used to be on the show Holly robust shot\nIs running his campaign\nAnd she's she's tough knows type\nYou know throws elbows I Wonder what they're saying so what to watch folks wait and see\nIf money goes into Jeff deal from that and I'm not talking about just like you know a a a little bit attribute you know just to make it look good I'm Talking about mommy mommy [laughter] [noise]\nIt's going to be maybe the\nBiggest impact and us Saudi relations ever and we've been through some rough patches with whether it be a the Arab Israeli war or the OPEC oil embargo or to nine eleven one Fifteen of the Nineteen attackers were Saudi national we were able to overcome these but I I you know this one may have more of an impact than anything\nWe're talking with bills in for our national correspondent bill every president has had trouble with Saudi Arabia and every president has had to walk that fine line because they're an important ally for two\nReasons one oil keeping the global price of oil stable even though we're less dependent upon them now because of fracking we need to keep the the global price of oil stable\nAnd the second part is they are the one country over there\nThat kind of keeps her ran in check and we need a rain kept in check because if they're not kept in check so then you get into the situation right where you have to say\nYou know this is an awful thing we need these guys are real and and I think Trump unlike other presidents has come right out and said that other presidents that conversation goes on but they don't share it publicly rice he shared it publicly\nYeah I did a ... and you know it's interesting in Saudi Arabia is apparently all the evidence shows that they were involved in this and and it's hard to believe that they would be involved in it without the knowledge of the royal family\nUh but that they are doing the best they can to back pedal on this or try to move sideways on it because they're in the midst of an economic evolution there and this is the brainchild of the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman you know a ... is part of this what they call the Saudi twenty thirty initiative to reduce\nTheir dependence on oil based
