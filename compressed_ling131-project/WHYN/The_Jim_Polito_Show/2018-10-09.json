kind of a difference has cabinet\nIn the mid term elections now remember the mid term elections are less than a month away but that's still a long time\nIn terms of voter memory but what did he do did it really active eight Republicans\nThink about our own\nA race right with a Jim McGovern did activate\nThat race well let's see um independence or key indicators of elections because while those data five with either party generally vote according to their identification independence are seen as swing boats that can decide in election [noise]\nOnly forty one percent of Americans said they wanted to see Kavanaugh confirmed about fifty one percent oppose the confirmation opposed the past tense 'cause it's all over now now this is from Quinnipiac\nBut other polls show the Democrats hope for a blue wave are feeding\nThe Democratic vantage and the generic ballot has been sliced and a half from fourteen percentage points in September\nTo just seven percentage points\nAt the start of October\nBasically Republicans have all but a bullet are rated the enthusiasm gap\nThe Democrats\nWhile I'm and among independents to go back to them again thirty percent of independents approved of

it mean for a while it's Quinnipiac\nQuinnipiac up the presidential election wrong and twenty six team but we shall see however I think it's fair to say\nThat Kavanaugh um the strategy was Kavanaugh Democrats more than it helped them and even Democrats themselves admitted some of the talking heads and pundits too\nSo Brett Kavanaugh sits down today for the first time\nOn the Supreme Court Danny

I'll tell you what\nSteve came the closest to the correct answer here he you know direct answer no I'm I Know John here is the correct answer\nMedical marijuana\nIs regulated under the department of public health\nSo the department of public health regulates the labs that will test the medical marijuana\nRecreational marijuana comes from the cannabis control commission\nAnd there are labs will pass\nThe the pot to be used for commercial or recreational use not medical I'm not kidding that's the only difference they're going to test it for the same thing they're going to check it out in the same way\nSteve came the closest to the correct answer its bureaucracy when I was on\nConnecting point last friday night I should put a link to the\nTo the show 'cause the the show is archived now and you can watch it we talk about medical marijuana are we talking about recreational marijuana why we don't have a lesser and in North Hampton or a recreational pot shops open\nTennis because of this\nAnd supposedly\nThe commission is going to me very very soon and get this all straightened out but might play songs from the Republican en masse live you get to the bottom of the story\nWhich is\nHe didn't say it like we did but it's bureaucracy\nIt's ridiculous it's insane\nThey just look the cat's\nOut of the bag no matter how you feel about pot or whatever it is here okay yes I Know there's new studies out suggesting that if you use marijuana before your brain is fully developed you're going to be a yard so much higher risk\nFor psychiatric or ... is shoes later in life yes and get all of\nThat um but it's full steam ahead on this than I Am my opinion is once you're full steam ad on something like this just do it but the revenue that we all expected [noise]\nI mean really the revenue that we all expected from their stuff okay there's some from medical the revenue we all expected from from this stuff we said let's let's cast are a lot less have gambling let's have medical marijuana will make a lot of money off of it the only they only folks sending any money\nInto the state coffers is MGM in Springfield that's it that's it\nWe can't get out of our own way can you can you picture a business\nI'm your own company where you work now I Know we we all make complains about our employer and we say you know they should do this like this they just listen to us as\nYou do this like this okay I I agree and I and I do the same thing\nBut for the most part a business makes decisions when it comes to revenue but usually they're on there or not to make a bomb there on the money but you tell a business hey if you guys get moving\nAnd you get this a recreational pot store\nUp and running you're going to make a lot of money is going to be ready you know it's gonna be great do you think there'd be dragging their feet like the cannabis control commission see can we get a job on that commission here when the do nothing commission well I mean I I Know you have to be careful\nAnd and uh\nWatch what you do but do you though I mean they legalized the plants and people have a growing in their backyard they're not testing that stuff I mean look it's not like a it's not like we're talking about some white powdery substance where you could put God Knows what into it\nI'm ... ... it out or do you grow the things that comes off the plant gets like ...
