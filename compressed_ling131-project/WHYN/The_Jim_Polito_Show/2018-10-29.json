certified\nBut meanwhile\nThe secretary of state's office says to the local offices election offices\nIn local communities\nDon't go uh playing junior detective\nJust make sure there's a signature

back to the serious stuff here that we need to discuss\nAnd daddy is\nIs being attacked and we're being told that this this shooting is Donald Trump's fault and he needs to denounce white nationalist and\nLet me see now hold hold on just a second here's what here's what Alan Dershowitz had to say um Saturday uh no actually yesterday morning\nWhen talking about all the blame being placed on a President Trump I wasn't necessarily defending Trump but here's what he had to say about other folks who maybe\nShould be looking in the mirror when it comes to anti Semitism with\nHer on his part of the problem\nThe way the second in queuing up properly as usual anyone left to do it myself\nPresident Obama meets with Sarah ... shame on him President Clinton sits on the same platform with Farrakhan shame on him Keith Ellison\nJoins with Sarah ... ... is one of the greatest purveyor as of anti Semitic hate just because he's black doesn't give him the pass\nOn anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with her ... is part of the problem\nYeah remember\n... just I I play the free last week he called juice termites\nHe called juice during my Bill Clinton sat on the stage with him at a return Franklin oh of course we had a great excuse for that [noise] um he ate I'm Obama cozy up to him Keith Ellison you know the the domestic abuser the jeopardy chair of the Democratic National Committee\nHe's buddies with him in\nIs Trump's fall oh and then and then Trump is the ... you know the the mayor of Pittsburgh says Donald Trump saying they should have guns the synagogue is a is not the ...\nAnd the violence wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute we asked somebody walk into a synagogue and start shooting you're going to tell me having a police presence there isn't that started by the way I'm very surprised that this synagogue didn't have people their guards there\nUm Jersey which went on to say when he goes to synagogue yes to go through a metal detector they have armed guards and he goes through a metal detector you ever you ever got walked by a synagogue on Saturday in New York City\nYou up you have your basically a a couple of um the the\nArmed guards ... uniforms on because you have to\nTo protect to protect everybody in the temple I'm actually surprised this temple was visited by homeland security\nAs part of their training of of soft targets on ways to protect themselves an active shooter situations to synagogue in Pittsburgh unprotected no this isn't this isn't victims shaming at all\nThis is I'm just surprised most others synagogues but but Trump was told we shouldn't say that well wait a minute have you ever been newer synagogue\nDominic sorrow in Springfield and the and the police commissioner put out a message this weekend hey we're going to increase our patrols around synagogues\nAny near anything from your petty but I I I you know\nThat's exactly what you need to do let's go to Robert from chick ... who wants to talk about the shooting in Pittsburgh hello Robert\nMorning on a gym you know you know thinking about this not only about the shooting in Pittsburgh but it was the\nPresident if we can say this for an hour on every time\nSomebody says something bad about half of the Democrats come up with them wacky idea and they start falling out it\nApart and just go hungry people it doesn't mean much wedding go die because adding power to it but we don't have to always say that but if you just start doing that a regular basis instead of giving them the energy to keep that why going you know what I'm saying\nHere and I know but then you have guys like Adam Schiff out there I'm saying you know saying stuff like this honestly\nI think this president's whole modus operandi or is to divide us uh he gets up in the morning with a new and inventive ways to divide us and it's not enough that on the day of a tragedy he says the right words if every other day of the year he's saying things to bring us a into conflict with each other you\nThis takes the increase in hate crimes against Jews has\nGuy rocketed really highly rocketed in the past I'm In the past year and you know there's a lot of finger pointing and and uh you know Howard Dean himself let me just a a over the weekend had had this to say about\nThis this has now become a struggle about good versus evil and the president of the United states is evil\nI mean why don't you go again you can yeah you can't say if you want to say stuff like that fine but don't don't tell me that you're trying to bring us together\nRight that is not the way to do it that's making that divide even greater and that's part of the problem here and you're right those numbers are anti Semitic crime in particular thirty\nFive percent increase in twenty sixteen fifty seven percent increase uh last year and you know there are some who estimate they're nearly a thousand hate groups in the United states whether any anti immigrant anti gay anti Muslim\nA black nationalist white supremacist it runs the gamut but there are a estimated almost a thousand groups in the United states that professor hate and one of the things that leads to this\nIt's ... it's not responsible ultimately for actions like we saw over the weekend but uh something that can hurt me too so he'll media now there's no show the social media platform that this guy use this power as guy you I had never even heard of gab dot com\nYeah I haven't I hadn't either yeah\nYeah but these are things that number one people can anonymously get their view is out there\nNumber two they can find like minded individuals and then they can then collaborate with and encourage each other and that's an inflammatory situation the third part of it is\nA

H. Y. N. [noise]\nGiants and tragedy this past weekend\nI Want to talk to you about just how bad\nOur election system is in Massachusetts and we're going to focus on a race to probably wouldn't get state wide attention at all\nBut we we try to bring attention to some of the some of the races here especially in our courts because many of them are physicians you say what does that person do\nYou know what exactly do they do well we ... how ... how about the registry deeds the person who has the head that office\nThere's a race going on in Camden county for that office I'm the former\nHolder of that position he passed away he was a really really nice guy he was running for his seventh term when he passed away and that was John ... so you got Republicans the Democrats squaring off to run for the office and the Democratic side\nUh ... junior who was the son of Donald senior well deposition for thirty four years he was defeated by Cheryl Coakley Rivera a name that is very familiar and political circles in western Massachusetts actually say why do people just said she used to be a state rep\nI'm so she's running for the office and then you have a Republican running\nAnd the Republican doesn't have the name recognition long meadow attorney Mary ... leads um or I Would say injure leaders but that's you know\nThat's my pronunciation but anyway we are on the show\nHow you're supposed to come up you know you have\nTo get a nomination papers\nAnd get signatures to be able to be put on the ballot is to make sure you know like everybody can't get on the ballot so you need a thousand signatures to run countywide for that seat\nYou need a thousand signatures now for somebody like showed Coakley river that should be very very very easy\nYou've been to the supermarket or gone to the store and there's people out front trying to get you to sign nomination papers or to get something on the ballot we've all done it right in all what happens is depending upon what kind of a race it is it goes to the local authority\nTo be verified so James Toledo who happens to live in ... I used to live in a ... is this and you look at my job is he registered to vote\nAnd you know if you're looking for a democratic nomination you have to get a Democrat or be looking for a Republican you get your Republicans if you're looking for anything else you can get people who are running role like me so anyway Cheryl Coakley Rivera it was a ... discovered by her opponent\nSet these signatures\nThese people on these forms that never signed them and by the way their names are printed and it looks like many of them\nSome of the forums or were printed by the same person for two two different people the same hand writing from two different people on a lot of these farms\nNow Cheryl Coakley Rivera is coming right out with a this is just the last minute tactic here but that's not why I bring this all up I bring this all up for this reason\nWhat kind of a system do we have if you're a local um um election office can't verify signatures your local clerk can verify the signatures and whether the person's register\nBecause bill Galvin the Democrat has been secretary of state since Moses went to high school he says I don't expect local jurisdictions to be detectives and to try to figure out if this is actually the signature of the person who signed it for that [noise]\nHow about this in the article by the Republican Dr Andrew lamb lives in long meadow he said he never signed this document and he pointed to it and said look I that's not even a signature they printed\nMy mom used to say you lie down with the\nDogs that have put sleeves when we return we'll talk with a good friend Barry Armstrong the markets have been\nAll over the place all over the place what does this mean some people believe and I'm gonna ask berry about this the reason the market's a nose dived is they believe that the Democrats are going to win the house and\nAll the good stuff that's been going on in the economy is going to come to a screeching halt I'll Asbury about that you're listening to the gym please do show you're safe space to England fastest growing morning show you didn't build that somebody else made to\nThe gym ... show\n\nI simply don't get ready to give a great gift and give you your cells one it's my pillow and the gifts the is the best night sleep you've ever had\nYou fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer that's what happens with me and now it's buy one get one there's the two gifts you keep one for yourself you give one to someone else and you use mine named when you call this number eight hundred\nNine seven eight seven four zero nine tell them you want to buy one get one and give them the promo coed\nGym DAM that eight hundred nine seven eight seven four zero nine promote coed gym\nJ.

I mean while the Republican did a great job reporting on the controversy over signatures they have endorsed Elizabeth Warren\nI mean even saying that we know that she's going to leave but what she's

nothing endorsements mean anything anymore okay although I Would like this endorsement\nComes from the best dressed man and radio I'm Talking about Barry Armstrong\nHe is the host of the financial exchange every weekday here on WG a gene WHYY in from ten to noon areas from the Armstrong advisory group Mr Armstrong good morning sir\nGood morning Jim I you know owning red hat shares is like winning the stock market here they are required by IBM last\nNight you know ... well with everything else going on no I did not so what was the what was the price\nWill get this if you own the hairs on friday night they went to bed on friday night and you looked at your statement they're trained at a hundred and eleven dollars a share\nI being paid one Ninety\nFive is\nNow you know why I don't buy lottery tickets and I buy stock you know oh man that's a good one it is now I Will tell you this yeah\nReally curious watch IBM shares are down on the news why\nWell because much or I or\nThey did Jim I think they did I you know before I looked at the free market I was over at my son's place watching or game last night yeah and the like did you see that IBM bought red hats and uh he said no I had they paid one Ninety here and he just about fell off the chair hit and it's not worth that much\nAnd and so\nHe didn't really look it up right off the top of his head he said it's not worth that much\nYeah and and I said well we'll see in the morning we'll look at the free market and set up a gun and IBM shares are down not red hat chairs right now are trading at about a hundred and Seventy six dollars a share he got listeners driving to work and and and they're the people in the car with them or in the car next door saying can't understand why they're tearing Sovaldi\nYeah those are already had ever\nTalk about the red Sox what happened [laughter]\nHey I've got a question for you I heard in an interesting bit of analysis and you know politics crosses over to the stock market so I had a bit of analysis that Wall Street\nHas decided man you know what it means Wall Street has decided that the house is going to the Democrats that a portion of the party will be over meaning the economy and they're they're taking their losses now before it happens\n[noise] well you know there are some of that gym but a lot of what's going on right now is uncertainty mhm like you you're I'm not sure that the Republicans are going to lose the house\nI don't know I I'm not saying I'm saying Wall Street made that decision I haven't I'm Still giving I'm Still giving the Republicans are sixty percent chance of holding the house and it it would be difficult\nBut it's not impossible and I'm also looking back it's twenty sixteen race to and looking at my numbers from that race and thinking about the numbers from this because I Do believe this raises a referendum on Trump\nYeah but I think Trump can work with the Democrats to be a Democrat and I think he wants to do an infrastructure bill you know the Democrats want to do that\nDo do do you wait to do that\nYeah so like ... and and the the president is going to be here for the campaign for president in the begins on January first right you know us\nNext year man he's going to be doing everything we can get this economy cranking if the economy's doing as well it is as it is today yeah people are going to hold their nose and say yeah he's a jerk but I'm going to vote\nFor him 'cause a lot of money they'll get they'll take his substance over his style no I agree and that's how I that's how I look at him well it's interesting to hear you say it's not that\nThey're they're cutting they're taking their losses now it said they don't know which way it's going to go and we are Wall Street also hates 'em when things aren't black and white\nWell and I will tell you if you look at the stocks that are really coming down I mean they were a little bit nutty like Amazon right like just the pricing of Amazon\nAnd I just I mean how can you wait how they're coming up with the value it hit\nThe value a based upon what they've got and and everything else yeah and if you can't bury 'em you're not alone\n[noise] well ... and like I said that and and they come down substantially but if there's a lot of companies like that where I look at the price of it and I say you know and then ... and maybe it's my my ... I'm a value investor\nIt right you don't buy based on hey everybody's fine Amazon\nI was trained I I I Do a lot in that investing in our firms investing based on you know am I paying a good price for that company yeah relative to what I think it is worth and we we got it now and in pain that Jim I Will tell you I don't think the stock market was terribly overvalued that's why I think there's a very low\nTo the common and then it gets a little routing the police say okay to go home and go to bed and that's what a lot of us did and our waking up this morning world champions a Kevin is are doing some work for ... Kevin you have an interesting\nStatistic we are spoiled here in Boston and in New England we can compare to when I was a kid\nWhere you know it was the Bruins and it was then the Celtics keeping us happy goes through since two thousand\nHow many championships have been brought home here\nAre up uh I don't think it makes them everybody in two thousand and one we had the New England patriots yep oh three and four we had the pets you have an open for you know seven we have the Sox yup\nAnd ... we had the Celtics ... thousand eleven was the Bruins yep two thousand Thirteen was the red Sox yup fourteen and sixteen was to pass you know now Eighteen is a Red Sox with a very bright future for both the Boston Celtics the Boston Bruins and even the New England patriots\nI see just insane it's just insane it's great but as Danny said earlier today we've had a what did you say the red Sox have one more World Series championships than any other team the century\n[laughter] but I wasn't the patriots operate the last Super Bowl they won and there was an eleven year old kid who had a sign says I'm eleven years old and I've seen all my teams when\n... or not what I was eleven years old\nGuys got their whole lives and never get to see one of their own one no my poor uncle chick ah he he passed away before two thousand four is below Red Sox [laughter] anyway so we celebrate that today but it's been a weekend of triumph\nAnd tragedy triumphs and tragedies that are suddenly the shooting in Pittsburgh has become Donald Trump's fault\nAnd er here is remember Howard Dean the\nRunning for president Howard Dean former governor of Vermont\nHere's what he had to say over the weekend um he's doing a good job of bringing us all together good job or Howard [noise]\nI don't think it gets better I think it gets worse uh because at the end of the day the president said the town\nI'm Sorry that was shot have set the tone\nSorry that's Chuck Todd Chuck Todd on Chuck Todd on meet the press basically Joel people um go out and go out and vote and get rid of Trump\nI mean there's so many words he said it hold on\nWith evil lurks in the hearts of mad that [laughter] and it does and what Trump has tapped into is evil and eventually will overcome that because of the Republicans are always about the past and they're always there that fear of the future\nAnd the Democrats are made plenty of the things that they are about the future and idealism and making America a better place I think in the end hope wins over evil but it takes a long time and it looks at what\nIs it is a star wars trilogy hope when the dog side hope when's over evil when it gets better\nBoth of those working humankind and that's what this struggle about from that this has now become a struggle about good versus evil and the president of the United states is evil\nDid you hear that ... is still one more time to make sure you got to about\nGood versus evil and the president of the United states is evil\nThat will bring us together right because half of the people in this country voted for him\nAnd support him so that'll bring us together right\nTrump is tearing us apart or Adam Schiff democratic congressman said this over the weekend\nI honestly I think this president's whole modus operandi a is to divide us or he gets up in the morning when they went inventive ways to divide us and it's not enough that on the day of a tragedy he says the right words if every other day of the air is saying things to bring us a into conflict with each other\nThey'll wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute\nSo Donald Trump the man the president who finally make good on the promise to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel the man who daughter married a Jew then converted to Judaism and now he's got a Jewish grand kids\nI mean the guy who did business in New York City which has a larger Jewish population than Israel\nThat guy he he's anti Semitic he's\nThe one he's the one to blame well what's interesting is Alan Dershowitz\nWhen asked about um anti Semitism and politics had this to say yesterday morning\nPresident Obama meets with Sarah caught on him President Clinton sits on the same platform with Farrakhan shame on him Keith Ellison joins with Farrah Khan ... is one of the greatest purveyor as of anti Semitic have\nJust because he's black doesn't give them a pass\nOn anti Semitism and any liberal who has any positive association with her ... is part of the problem\nYeah you you know what the problem is Alan and he went on to talk about it it's on our college getting the real anti Semitism in America is is not in the Klan it's not what the white nationalist it's on college campuses to divest movement\nA boycott movement from from Israel\nThought he told a story about a student he knew who was going to do a semester abroad in Israel and needed a recommendation from a professor at a professor said no I'm part of the boycott movement I Can't write that recommendation for you to go to Israel\nYou don't think that if you don't think that the anti Semitism that that's not anti Semitism\nSiding with the Palestinians as an infant know gym it's politics has diplomacy no it's not to the Palestinians want the destruction of Israel, Why do they want the destruction of Israel because they want the destruction of the Jews how many times do I have to say this\nHow many times and now it's oh where do you hear this one this is a good one [noise] headlines out their Jewish leaders in Pittsburgh say Trump is not welcome to visit the synagogue were eleven people were shot and I said\nMy God really I mean they don't want to visit from the president well you got to read\nDeep into the story [noise] then you find out that it's the Pittsburgh chapter of a progressive\nAnd radical left wing Jewish group called the bend the arc bend the arc arc as an arc of the covenant is a very left or I mean they're left of Bernie radical left Jewish group\nWell they're Pittsburgh chapter and I I guess there's twelve people in their Pittsburgh chapter wrote a letter to the president saying we don't want you to hear oh well wait a minute you've got to denounce white nationalism so wait a minute are these actually\nThe people who represent the Jewish community in Pittsburgh or is this just a radical group in their local chapter\nAnd why would you say you don't want the president there then you get the mayor of Pittsburgh sing\nGuns are not the solution to solving this problem wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute
