me a lot of fun huh\nDid crime ... back in New England for the Sox but that's about it\nYeah that that can be yeah well no maybe next time you know it'll be a little more slow but anyway let's get to this because there is something I Want to ask you and um it's something I talked about\nUh uh with um your publicist than it was this that\nThere is a reason why Brett Kavanaugh I'm married up no matter how you may feel about him got approved got got the votes to be on the Supreme Court and that Donald Trump whether you agree with him or not\nGot elected there is a connection in the way the two men be have and it's something you talk about and encourage people to do what is that\n\nI'm not sure exactly what you're looking at other than um I don't I have not been drawn parallels between\nA modern us but you're talking about being black Rapids no no no being authentic me being real\nWell I think that the ... actually so I don't know that I I don't\nSee it that way all ever um I Do believe authenticity for sure uh you know when it when people step into their own authentic power and are there to sell their Roman bring them here on that and and really that the most powerful anyone can ever be I don't\nI don't know that I'm either of those individuals and right now are being their authentic though but um you know I can say for me I absolutely am and\nAnd the moment in time that I I decided to be transparent and the second so my laws and all which is really what my book is all about\nThat was really the most um the strongest I've ever become in my life\nSo you're saying just being a being yourself being real being up front that doesn't mean being a ... well you know and some people in business say being perfect being a you know ... not showing any weakness\nThat the complete opposite of authenticity though when there is no such thing as perfect right\nSo I don't know um what Donald Trump laws are you know but on the outside to me it would appear there's a level of insecurity anytime you're trying to demand in command things be a certain way because you are perfect that's not real\nAnd in fact I work for someone like that for a while and we spend a lot of time in a in organized crime over a decade for me\nWith a woman who wanted to pretend she was perfect really again because the the wives and you know it takes a while to see you have to get close enough to someone that you began with the wow that purposes crack and it really crack\nYou know to be able to step in the air flies and say I'm not perfect and let me tell you what what what about all that is so incredibly powerful and so people and the fake world that we live in today that so I really you know the thing is completely pull her up\nA no confidence creator his name of the book by their money and so the real confidence creator um use embracing rat in yourself not being there for our well\nYeah absolutely you know it's not easy we live in a society where people on either the health care people want to see that your life is looking at a certain way and you're happy everyday well that's not real\nYou know I didn't believe are laid off because I've got rioters outside her than\nI have to go to my book signing today on a mile but I'd rather own that yeah I'm exhausted and and traveling very difficult for them and there was people that are real side of what's happening\nBirth is selling off and just you know keeping that big smile on and and pretending that everything in my life is perfect so your city is that's not real\nOkay now others will may be perceived that his weakness aren't there are others out there who would take advantage of that\nWell when I was younger I can relate to what you're saying you know a decade ago I Believe I had to be here for the perfect in order to get ahead in business and I tried my hardest to create a facade\nIt takes a tremendous amount of energy and it's very difficult in her early and they have in that fashion however I did it I did it then and\nYou know I I never felt really strong or that about it and at the end of the day we're the ones that have to look at ourselves and then we're we're the ones that have to go home with ourselves if you're not yelling or a ... well it's a it's a tough life to live create that aside and put all that energy and appearing perfect so\nFor me not laptop and being
