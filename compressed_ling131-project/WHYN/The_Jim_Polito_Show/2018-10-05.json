protesting we don't have a democracy we have a representative democracy see we're too busy most of us working\nWith our lives so we empower representatives to do the work for us\nOf governing we can vote them out of office whenever we want but we have a representative democracy we have a real public we don't have a true democracy and if we didn't have a true democracy you wouldn't have a chance because liberals you haven't\nWon at the ballot box I'm going to explain you why\nThey are losing it right now why would we are going to look back on this period some day and say they were down the digging up stuff about a ... year puck\nReally\nThe liberal agenda\nDoes the liberal agenda\nSucceed does it succeed at the ballot box well\nYou could say in individual states like here in Massachusetts may be but where does it really succeed the liberal agenda it succeeds and the courts that's why the courts are so important to them\nThink about some of the major decisions that have been made with our ... our representatives voting on abortion\nGay marriage didn't anybody vote on gay marriage federally did anybody vote on gay marriage\nNow I'm not I'm not talking about either way supporting or not supporting gay marriage and I'm not making a I'm not trying to open up a debate here on gay marriage what I'm saying is\nGay marriage one in the court it was a liberal issue abortion one in the court it was a liberal issue\nThe reason that they're so concerned about Brett Kavanaugh being appointed for life is that he's not going to do that\nThat's why they're having a collective nutty and doing everything they can\nThis is the most important thing to the liberal agenda to the left is the courts if we can get activists on the bench we don't need to go to the dumb voters the racist homophobic Islamic phobic voters you know the ones Hillary was talking about\nWe basically have a dictatorship we get the court to do it [noise] it's time\nJust aren't [noise] think about Iraq Obama other than Obamacare\nWhat did he get through\nThe Congress in the Senate thing for a minute\nNothing his victories were in the courts and through executive order that was it that was in I mean\nHe may have been a popularly elected president but when it came to his agenda\nWhat did he get done in the last thing way\nNothing other than Obamacare\nAnd that was done on a procedural trick it was we all know it was\nWhat did he get done nothing\nThe liberal agenda the less agenda does not stand up to voters why\nBecause the average voter says\nOn some of the crazy stuff they come up with that doesn't make any sense to me that's not that people are hateful and racist it's just people say a lot of liberal stuff they say\nThat doesn't make any sense I'm not going to go with that\nSure there are enclaves throughout the country and we're one of them will get the tofu courting around north Hampton and cameras in that area and of course from one twenty eight\nEast to tofu curtain\nFrom the rest of the state and get people saying that doesn't make any sense to me I don't get that\nThat's the problem now next step then we're going to get to build them for our national correspondent who will lay out just where we're going to be over the next forty eight hours how it's kind of work\nBut Justice John Paul Stevens who's Ninety eight years old and I knew until I read this last night I didn't realize she was Ninety eight I knew you were retired I knew he was old but Ninety eight years old\nHe has supported Brett Kavanaugh previously\nHe'd actually I think he had mentioned Brett Kavanaugh on one of his books talking about a decision that came out of the D.C court of appeals the cabinet authored and said this guy would be great for the Supreme Court\nNow John Paul Stevens is saying she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of the Supreme Court really Okay John Paul Stevens let me ask you this question\nLet's take you during your confirmation hearing way back when and subject you to what Brett Kavanaugh had to put up with what subject due to what Brett Kavanaugh had to put up with\nAnd see how you react\nI don't think that has anything to do with your temperament he's got three hundred decisions and how could you say that his three hundred decisions\nWere sounding good and this guy should be on the Supreme Court then you see I'm Upset because his name was dragged through the mud\nHow could you say he doesn't have the temperament I Would say that if he didn't react that way\nNow granted he went a little overboard and himself in the wall Street Journal piece yesterday said I got a little too emotional\nOkay we've got a little too emotional\nNobody ever said that about any of his uh decisions did you see any one earlier through the process of his confirmation until they tried to sneak listen\nThis is this a sex assault allegation did anybody say a you're a little too emotional and your rulings did you remember hearing that during the during the hearings no you don't because it didn't happen but John Paul Stevens\nSaid listen I don't think he has a let's put you up against it and see how you react not not as a Ninety eight year old man but when you were younger let's see how you react to it\nWhich brings me to another point from the media\nNBC has has published\nAnonymous accusations against Brett Kavanaugh like like no no verification no core operation nothing and yet NBC was the same network that wouldn't\nPublish\nRonan Farrow Z story on Harvey Weinstein 'cause they didn't think it was corroborated enough

a buddy sits on your shoulders now might the whole thing was well again congratulations\nSo jobs report it's not out yet though but I Would I Would expect we will see um we'll see good numbers\nYeah we're we're going to the good numbers because the numbers are already so fantastic that ... for them to\nBe tough to like really the expectation because the numbers are already looks so good um but there's some areas that they might\nBe able to feed expectations on so\nI mean the the unemployment rate is already so low that we probably won't move too much the expectations airport that dropped down to three point eight percent ah which is you know almost unheard of in terms of the unemployment rate and what we are really looking at though I I could care less about that but he was already so low what I'm looking at their\nWage numbers what are we going to have moving on wages because that is what is going to\nI think you know one of the things that can actually carry this economy going forward or it could leave him are spending on the downside a lot of people are really worried about inflation at this point\nOkay um and you know that's the worry if you've got too many people working and as we've seen your dad was telling us yesterday about Teamsters a UPS threatening strike we don't like the contract that are\nThat are union management a union leadership came up with that kind of stuff then it goes the other way you know I mean it's it's nice for the individual but then it might not be nice for all my investments\nYeah yeah I mean that that's what people are worried about it and right now that you know actually the future they had they had been down a little bit this morning there about flat right now so I don't think anyone anticipating this wage numbers really\nBlow away but you know Bush vacations out of the water a but anything's possible you could see surprises a you know as it is we're expecting a to point eight percent you and your life increase in wages anyway which is pretty solid\nIf it comes out at three three and a half and uh you know keep an eye on equity markets that I'm\nSorry microchips what do I need to know\nWhy this goes to the you know China by trip story and ... you know the er at a Bloomberg\nBusiness with that uh\nBasically that you know Chinese government has been implanting micro spy Chad in to Amazon servers a bunch of apple products\nYeah does that sound like something out of a movie that enemy of a bull or something else it just it just does when I first read it that's what I thought\nAnd you know an apple actually came out this morning and said hey you know this report isn't true we're not under a gag order many judge you know we have not identified this as an issue but there are poured out of a Bloomberg Business is that this has been part of a top secret investigation by the U.S government going back to twenty um\nForget about the trade imbalance forget about everything else if you want to read in the flap sanctions on Chinese good here it is\nYeah if you if you can show this and say look at this and this is how their their their their way of stealing our intellectual property in spying on us boom\nYeah I mean this is the case then I have no history it's become that we would never do but you know huge sanctions on companies that decided to do business with a or hide to manufacture in China would not be out of the realm of possibility here\nThat it will say that I don't know where Bloomberg Business would come up with this report out of the blue\nYeah I Know because they're reputable it's not like

worker they unionized workers I'm One of them there and then you've got there very employers are still on the other\nAnd you know the whole purpose of the union who are like this to try to negotiate when the root of all this whole thing the root of a one size fits all solution is never get\nWork yeah here's here's ... let's just get at what you know we're going to get more into question one two and three but I'm I'm On the no side on question one which would mean I don't want to mandate ratios of nurses to patients now that doesn't mean\nThat I don't want patients to be well cared for and that doesn't mean that I don't support nurses and I don't have all the empathy or sympathy in the world for nurses and respect them\nHere's the problem okay you're right it's a labor dispute thing and they want to say you have to have X amount of nurses for\nUm this group of patients you have to have this ratio and that's wrong it mandates it it makes it does make one size fits all\nAnd here's what I say back to the nurses\nWe have the Massachusetts department of public health if you think patients are not receiving the care they should receive that here's what you do the Massachusetts department of public health regulates hospitals healthcare systems all they have to do is say you don't have enough nurses here\nNow what is not enough nurses at a hospital in Palmer is a lot different than what is not enough nurses at a hospital in Fall River\nTo different things and when you mandate it when you mandate it\nFirst of all we don't have enough nurses to cover it and what it's going to cost and what it will do to health care look I I agree there are some times decisions made in health care\nThat are not um advantageous to to the the best quality outcomes but guess what you want this okay what do you think socialized medicine is going to do you think you're going to have ratios like this and socialized medicine I don't think so\nWhy you want to have the math voter
