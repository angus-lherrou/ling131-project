kidding that was called the marital aid\nOver the rainbow marital aids in Buffalo why why why do I do and why it's become\nA thing that do no idea I I you know what I Love traditions and things and

that they're not armed guards and temples or not the answer I I just want to ask this question\nSo today I mean Saturday and friday night for Sabbath ... how can you guarantee that a temple is going to be safe\n\nI mean seriously how can you guarantee I didn't say arm everyone there are there are rabbis who carry guns I didn't say arm everybody in the in the\nTemple I'm just saying what what what are you going to do how are you going to protect people who want to express their religion or people who make up what is it less than one percent of the world's population\n\nAnd they're the target you want to talk about a true minority [noise]\nYep [noise] flip throughout history well let's let's go after the Jews but that's the burying a the first of the two victims today they were brothers I

a President Obama wasn't blamed for the twenty Fifteen Charleston church massacre\nHe talked about Bernie Sanders and the shooting of his friends Steve ... he wasn't blame for it and he was basically saying that's right they shouldn't have been blamed for why am I being blamed for this\nThe magnet bomber and the least shooting in the temple and it's because it's politics here's something that's interesting\n... a lawyer for a Trump supporter who was found guilty of planning to bomb a Kansas mosque and an apartment complex where Muslim refugees lived\nHe is now saying his client Patrick Stein was influenced by the president's rhetoric the hold on a second here I Want you to think it through\nWhen you say that something the president said is responsible for someone acting you are giving them a defense I said that I've set it in the past when people have complained about Trump\nYou're giving them a defense why can't be held responsible for this no that person Patrick Steiner was found guilty is responsible for what he did the man who shot up the synagogue is responsible for what he did\nSay is our say look who sent the bombs the Democrat leaders is responsible for what he did\nYou want it to be a mitigating factor\nWell the president's rhetoric caused him to act okay then you take away a portion of his responsibility and and you have a situation like this I knew what was going to happen\nAnd I I don't think this makes Trump look bad\nI think this makes the media\nAnd the left to look bad\nBecause this guy smart so is this lawyer\nHey I couldn't help himself he listened to Trump all the time he lives in the Trump speeches and they told him hey just like I'm just like a Charlie Manson listened to the Beatles white album and he heard messages in it right\nYou're going to blame the Beatles\nThat's that's where we're going\nThat's exactly where we're going\nAll the president are showing up at the synagogue is going to be divisive no you saying that it's going to be divisive\nIf he's welcome to the synagogue\nBecause he's the president of the United states\nAnd his daughter\nAnd son in law are Jewish and his grandkids are Jewish\nAnd he moved\nAnd recognized\nIs the capital of Israel um yeah he sounds enticing sounds like a really anti Semite to me\nSounds as bad as someone who is a someone who would called Jews termites right didn't\nFall that's minister

things like either Trump is bleeping his daughter although she she set it either Trump is believing his\nDaughter or he shirking nepotism laws which is worse um that's not the worst thing she's ever said about Trump but it's pretty disgusting don't you think\nJulie all off well she was on Jake Tapper\nShow on CNN take a listen to this I Want to get to the conspiracy theories and the second the first we have little house cleaning because for the Republican National committee is jumping on your comments you earlier on in the show said that Donald Trump is radicalized more people than ISIS has a David and Mona a disagreement he strongly as you wanted to clarify what\nI didn't want to clarify from stuff going on over for a very emotional and her for ... for a crime for I\nI I don't care you said Trump is radicalized more people than ISIS I don't care if you're upset over a shooting in a synagogue\nI don't care if you're upset over bombs being sent to Democrats and CNN I don't care\nJulie a blow off if you cannot control yourself on the air and you don't belong on the air\nAnd I'm sure Julie a lot of a police officer weren't able to control del themselves because it was an emotional time for them she wouldn't accept that explanation\nI Would I Want to clarify spoken about them on it for for a very emotional peripheral home for a crime for exaggerating around apologize for that but what I Would point out of time for federal probe\nOf fat going for\nA quote unquote overall the number of medical ... jump out or they would prefer or first of all of a balance how awful from afar Quinn put our will pass\nOver ... blown goals are homegrown right role for lower federal have pointed out overall social Humphrey particles ... role monitor or ... or so far from corona virus they do\nYou hear that whenever you apologize the word but should never be included in it it\nKind of a personal rule I have\nBut the other part here\nTalking about there's been a rise in anti Semitic attacks\nAnd it coincides with President of the ... over the past year and President Trump has been president that's like saying that the the cost of Twinkies is gone up because President Trump is president\nYou know is it is what are you were lenient you why don't you think about this what else has happened in the past year well let me see um Louis Farrakhan and stood on stage with\nAnd a five thousand is the maximum you can have as friends 'cause I I don't have like a fan page I have a front page\nAnd so you can still follow the page but people who aren't following me and our friends that it's difficult for them to get a message to me and it goes in Danny into this weird folder that I Can't find half the time I Want to I Want to see it anyway\nI got all these messages from nurses now a couple of them came from central\nAnd western Massachusetts so I looked at that and they said okay those are people who are listening and they start all started their message with I heard that you mentioned on your show that you haven't spoken with any nurses who support question one\nThey all kind of started with that same line\nOkay so the one from central mass the one from western mass okay that's fine but then the rest of them came from like Brighton\nAnd look we have listeners in eastern mass because of what I used to do on Fox and people listen to NPR radio app yadda yadda yadda but I mean this was like all of a sudden the bunch of these came in\nAlmost like they put out the word union headquarters email Jim bullied oh so what I'm saying right now is any of those nurses and I can't find\nYour emails and my messenger\nLike the emails that and I never got around to accepting though\nLike you have to accept I read them but then I didn't accept them which moves them into your regular mailbox you don't need to hear all this anyway any of the nurses\nWho want to call eight five five four zero three Ninety eight forty six who are supporting question one please call and make your case on the show don't send me a don't send me a message on Facebook I mean it's fine and I love communicating with people on Facebook but\nI'd rather you call and I'm\nI'm\nWell really uh enlighten the audience here\nFor our own at a vacation over the the the arguments behind supporting question one because the polling out there suggested in the past month that the majority of people in the commonwealth now do not support question one that's a shift\nThere were people that it was um based upon pulling from Suffolk\nAnd Suffolk University does some halfway decent polling I Would say out of what I look at locally I usually look at Suffolk\nThey do a pretty good job and political political polling I'm not talking about anything else but that and they had it as a majority of people well I shouldn't say a a um\nPlural arrows are already you know that more people have been more people saying yes then no [noise] but ah not over the fifty percent mark 'cause there was still some people who are undecided\nBut now it is no um it looks like if the vote were held today in the south pole\nIs correct that he would a question one would go down so a no vote on question one means you do not support government mandated ratios of nurses to patients\nIf you've Oh yes you do support that\nSo the nurses\nAnd all of the horror stories they told me said five five four zero three Ninety eight forty six\n[noise]\nIf you're a nurse and you don't support it there there's no reason to call them just want to put that out there now there's no reason to call this was purely messages I received that said I've got it all wrong\n[noise]\nQuestion one I got it all wrong\n[noise]\nJust kidding we're more important things to talk about here today yes that's an important issue so his question too so it's a question three but the president is going to Pittsburgh today\nA member of Congress from the local delegation there in Pennsylvania said the president really shouldn't come east going to be a distraction then it's going to be divisive see the fact that you said that\nIs a distraction and divisive if you add to shut your mouth and said the president's coming the rabbi from the tree of life synagogue said we would be happy to have the president here everything would have been fine it would have been quiet\nWe could have paid R respects today two of the victims are being buried and you know in the Jewish tradition you want to be buried you know the the the um tradition is to be buried within twenty four hours course because of the crime scene and autopsies and not to get gory here but that wasn't possible the two brothers\nWho I Believe um\nDevelopmentally disabled the two brothers who were they were cooking\nFor the a congregation and they were in the kitchen\n... gunmen entered the synagogue and they were killed and then they're going to be buried today so the president will be there today and I think it's a it's a good moment to reflect on this\nWe're hearing from Democrats that there's been a rise in anti Semitism since President Trump became president\nOkay so you're relating to President Trump is there anything else that's going on like on college campuses like boycotting Israel is there anything else that's going on\nThe actual anti Semitism that exists on college campuses why wouldn't you related to that and the rise in it especially following President Trump's decision\nTo make good on a promise many presidents have made but never fulfilled which was to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel\nWhy would you related to President Trump so all of a sudden President Trump is president and anti Semite or empowered\nI don't get it I'd love I'd love to understand the connection there but relating it to his presidency\nIs like relating to I said earlier the price of Twinkies going up the price of Twinkies have gone up since Trump became president All right well what's what's the correlation\nFrom scratch in price went up Trump's president more anti Semitism\nMimi intolerance on the left couldn't be to blame for this the recognition of of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel couldn't be to blame for this\nThat's not it are we sure about this are you one hundred percent sure\nThat's exactly what I mean let's hope it's a peaceful day let's hope it's a very very peaceful day\nIn Pittsburgh\nVisit by the president the people there are able to heal and the other thing is we have Massachusetts politicians out there saying and all that good official thing or guns or not the answer that the synagogue or let me tell you this they're they're the short term answer\nArmed guards at the synagogues before Sabbath\nDon't you think that's important to protect people\nIn case we have a copy cat idiot out there who wants to do something\nWe'll get into all this we've got to get to our national correspondent bills him for you're listening to the gym police do show you're safe space the gym for Leno

gets here and we'll have dwindled down it's already reportedly the main body\nYeah we had heard reporter was up to ten thousand at one point now they are reportedly down to about thirty five hundred a I think that many or deciding that it may not be worth the eight hundred miles they\nStill have to go to get to the United states that they're accepting asylum offers from Mexico who is also offering employment assistance for these people I think many of them I Will decide to stay there\nOr maybe even turn around I I have the feeling and the whole probably the Trump Administration is that these

them more responsibility\nAnd plus the price a price tag that comes with this\nNine hundred million dollars I mean I don't think\nYou can argue that it is it's nine hundred million dollars\nAnd look
