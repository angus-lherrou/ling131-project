Oklahoma given in what what what the Fed's like to call a little diesel therapy\nAnd diesel therapy is movie from prison the prison\nYou know you're in a vehicle\nSucking in diesel fuel\nDanny I Want your opinion\nOn this and I don't know if Steve's too busy to talk about this Curt Schilling wasn't invited to be part of the world series first pitch ceremony and I've read a lot of different\nStories about how this all came down to the red Sox are trying to portray it as it was just an oversight critically overlay\nWhat no way no they didn't want him their villages Lee [laughter] it's so here's the thing I Know\nCurt Schilling um expresses a lot of his political views so and uh ESPN didn't want him expressing and he was political views and make comments about trends genders and things like that\nUm he went bankrupt with this company and screw the state of Rhode Island probably part of the reason why ... got the paw socks 'cause Rhode Island was reluctant to give money to a private entity again\nBut he the guy had the bloody sock\nYou can't take any of that away from him yelling it's one thing to say well you can't have Pete Rose there he he ... he was placing bets on the sport okay\nCurt Schilling hasn't really hasn't done anything to hurt the integrity of baseball and he was an integral part of the two thousand four\nWorld Series championship after eighty six dry years for the red Sox say a Curt Schilling sympathizer I Am not me uh but uh\nI had to put it best when he said never once as one of his teammates come out and called him a racist or homophobic and he's never had an issue with his teammates yeah he may have these beliefs that he kind of kept to himself during his playing days yeah since then he's kind of come out in that kind of people know how he feels yeah\nHe definitely should have been yeah he gets screwed by John Henry and the politically correct Red Sox which now I'm the boss you know he owns the Boston Globe I mean this is all what virtue signaling huh or Steve what's your\nThought on well I mean I'll take sort of Curt Schilling out of it for the moment this is an organization who\nLiterally loves these pre game ceremonies loves then this is like there are they like the pregame ceremony more than the actual game I mean they have a thing as like\nOrganized down to a tea and then they come to this one they're like oh yeah well we were just winging it you know I we told anybody who wants to come from the fourteen they can come wait wait what it was your first world series in eighty six years you're celebrating that team and then you're just sort of like we see anybody can come if they want to\nUh yeah ... bowl I don't believe that at all whatsoever and I bought a bunch yeah and I don't generally yeah the Kurds Curt Schilling got the sort of screwed nest and dies or either for that guy at all but just like I said\nYeah I I'm I'm not either\nOh of course for me to be fired by ESPN is kind of a badge of courage\nUh as far as I'm concerned but you know the the folks from the red Sox talk about talk about backpedaling I mean man it's like they're going there they're going backwards for a pop up fly into into the center field wall that's uh that's how much they're back pedaling\nThe ... originally they said oh we just invited to players and then you know other people call and said hey they'd like can be part of it and you know I never got around to Curt Schilling come on\nYou know what you know what it really does it really bothers me because the red Sox around the cost of a of a World Series championship\nRight now and to just pull this crap you know changed the name of yucky way by the globe make it even more or less the radical ... and and this kind of stuff it just\nIt really it's like you know what you guys are you trying to make me not like you\nAre you really trying to make me not like you I understand\nProtecting your product and and the Boston Red Sox are a product just like the show is\nBut come on\n... what did they think we're going to happen people are gonna boo\nCurt Schilling is that is that what they were worried about say they were gonna boo courage yelling or we don't we didn't want to be associated with his\n... we have we don't want to we are right we we don't really agree with what he stands for and so that's why we're we're not which is again putting yourself a head of\nOf the fans the players everybody else that's involved and the thing it's it's all about the red Sox you know that they put their own personal politics and priorities ahead of everything else that's going on which is\nAnnoying to be quite honest with you there you know I\nI mean look at the place the guy deserves in the history of course you know as Johnny Damon would say what was in the middle for we were just a bunch of what was it it is yeah yeah we're just a bunch of idiots\nBut Curt Schilling went out there and yeah the bloody sock and even though what did he sell it after that or something you know I Can't remember but\nHe went out there and he had a bloody sock that was a real that was up a such a a representation if you want to know what that year was like for the Sox like\nA bloody sock any still pitch and what was it what did they done staple some tendon back together and his ankle\nYeah they had some suitors and staples down and then he goes to the game it didn't hold\nYeah and it ... and he's playing any still you know he still throwing rockets over the plate\nCome on [noise] you know it's interesting to look at it like you know everybody gives the NFL such a hard time for putting the politics and into it and I I\nI think this might be a little bit different in terms of this has nothing to do with the players like if you're thinking to yourself I don't want to watch the red Sox anymore 'cause their owner is you know X Y and Z that's fine but\nI Will say that I don't think this has anything to do with a ... and David Price and Chris Sale and all the other players on a known that have gotten them to this point you know so it is to me important to separate the two and you know you can still tell John Henry I feel about them but still be able to watch the game that I Will\nSay oh no no no no no right right I'm not I'm not turning away from the game this is not this is about actually the owners and hey don't get me wrong I I'm Upset\nWith the ... not saying hey guess what guys stand up you know ... and ... and then do a little too little too late over the summer\nThey put the new rule in but no this is what John Henry like this is a kind of anger that people had with um [noise] uh you know the Yankees organization under\nGeorge Steinbrenner [noise] no but no kidding aside no but I mean really like they love their Yankees but they would be mad at Steinbrenner for the things he would do right\nLike either ... cows on right in his office no how 'bout how come you traded ... view [laughter] gotta\nGet and I'm like oh you don't want that how you doing [laughter]\nThat's a Seinfeld folks but no but that kind of stuff for a member when George was being interviewed for the job of the Yankees any insulted Steinbrenner how he said you have taken our our beloved Yankees and made them into a laughing stock all you know glorification of your masters go\nHigher this ma'am [laughter] ah but that's what that's what it\nIs I've written stuff about John Henry before and you know I think he's full bowl but you know this is really this was this was this was putting politics and where it didn't need to be I Want to see that team\nUm he didn't bet\nOn the game of baseball it's not like Pete Rose this is different it was\nPolitics he did nothing bad any Red Sox you know from anything you could call heated controversial came post retirement\nPost Ruth ... yeah exactly but we don't want him there we don't like how it looks well you know what it looks pretty bad right thank you

now\n[noise] the whole family no good you know you got to nip that in the bud but I'm working on it I'm working on it\nI'm so first off let's just call out that Amazon has been one of the best performing stock in the world over the last several\nYears earnings report this quarter was not great a reward earnings were okay\nBut their projections for the fourth quarter which is pretty important quarter or you know our Christmas shopping of course up here and of course have protections are pretty important there\nAnd they just showed a little bit of a disappointment in comparison to what most people were expecting to stock right now before the market opens is down eight and a half percent free market\nUm you know this could be probably the biggest drop they've seen since twenty fourteen and their stock price that it would bring their shares back to where they're trading back in May of this year wow I'm so we'll see how investors react but you know I I I I was personally a little bit surprised about this or not expect to slow down\nA lot of there are still doing really well and they're still very very profitable at this point it's just that big the celebration in terms of what we anticipated for their growth her cue for as twenty nine paid\nThey're still making money hand over fist so\nEarning more money on advertising than they used to so they're kind of eating a little bit into Google and Facebook the here and they're doing a lot of stuff really well\nBut they seem to be slowing down a little bit in terms of their revenue projections which are clearly surprised a lot of investors\nYou can't tell Wall Street one thing and I have another thing happen if it's if it's bad and I'm not expect to get away from them even if you're still a monster behemoth\nYep so I then Google actually put out the results that weren't that great a after the market close yesterday too so right now the NASDAQ expected open a whole two percent down today so you know obviously Wednesday we had that terrible day yeah yeah we had in pretty good recovery and today it's looking like it's going to be pretty ugly out there again\nFor a um okay uh about our GDP\nGDP we're going to get a reading at eight thirty uh this morning so and about half an hour or it's expected to be very strong coming out of three point three percent of the annual lives rate\nThat's down from last quarter where we had a four point two percent gain but it's expected to be and I'm looking at this you know there's two ways that you're going to be looking at this one you know if it comes in very very strong\nThan the architecture might react poorly because they might say well gee now are definitely getting interest rate movies from the fed a and you know that could knock the stock market down even further on the other hand if it comes in really poorly that could be a pretty bad time for Republicans going into this midterm election\nHomicide shooting deaths at all\nBut this is what's the word swelled the county I'm so proud of the work that my prosecutors have done a and it was a practice we took himself it gets very disingenuous my opponent to say that if we weren't doing it because he knew we took that practice from Suffolk we implemented in Worcester for the first time ever All right\nChallenger also said there is an issue of ethics in the in the west or county da's office and he also made the accusation that there aren't enough minorities working it's not a real true reflection of the community here what are you what do you want to um\nOh that's absolutely false and he knows better on that as well look I've yes five applications are attorneys drugs from people of color since I get in it's hard to recruit minorities the pool listen to people we're trying to we need to get at a sure\nBut we were actively recruiting if the law schools I talk to the kids ... say men and women of color if you want to change the world become a lawyer I tell them about the program they have a UMass repeal except a public job you can get fifty percent tuition and\nYou know we've had minorities come to the office one of the problems is\nA it's a very small pool I'm I have lost a minority applicants to higher paying jobs and but what we have done in other parts of the ... is the first as a woman of color is a supervisor and this is the first ever headed this if this detective units why it is a man of color\nAnd I talked to some people in my office has to be made these accusations they were offended by that they said this is a great place to work it's a great climate in you know any and they need to say it would say because that was actually absolute nonsense and he knows better than that\nUm what about the question of the ethics ethics Jim here's the thing they are ethics of fine\nWe follow the rules are professional conduct with her in the alley people case what we do on a daily basis\nWhen you this a resident but ethics when you follow the rules professional conduct no award publicly condemning someone what actually protect someone right to have it so much Rachel at trial ... professionals in just three six and three eight you're in compliance with that you're not violating net suppressing it\nYou know with regards to the opioid crisis some people talk the talk I talk to talk to walk the walk\nThis is what we'd go in with regards to that as well\nYou know he's referring to the attorney general let the attorney general found in that case\nWas that no other fish within the state police no official within the da's office acted with the intent to keyed in here obstruct Tom DeLay rented it with the prosecution in that case no one has to reduce any charges were dismissed and he charges\nNo charges were reduced to dismiss also everything I mean everything Joe was preserved ... sense of the middle sex is off as\nThe prosecution of that case and like I said we falls out rules professional conduct that state I'm not just in a advocate I'm a minister of justice we don't publicly condemn someone with a statement at the end of the day all of that\nSo much this is about you'll you'll price races the fundamental beliefs that I have a we treat people with compassion\nDignity and respect we steer indirect meant to treat you know shame humiliate embarrass people we help people and people like former surgeon general Vivek Murthy said we have removed the stigma that involves compassion that involves treating people with respect dignity compassion for what we know is a disease\nIt's not a moral feeling it's not a character flaw in ... and we have pilot programs throughout the county and Fitch lemons when I was ...\nWe if someone will accept treatment and they get arrested possession of everyone everyone Smith
