group them into two groups\nOne of the of the people who loves one was treated by the trainers hospital for children and there were so many of them but then there were people\nWho it was new to them\nIn the sense that I I kind of always new trend is just there I never really knew\nAll that they do um this is from people who drive by on cruise street to people who live in the state where we live in Connecticut and to people who say and this was our family I didn't know\nI could or a loved one available so [noise] to\nEverything that's offers to try and hospital for children and that is exactly it I mean I went last night from talking to a young man who had a hockey injury was scared for here still still undergoing care here how patients\nTo\nA child who had four surgeries in the past week so\nThink about that spectrum of care and then think about what a gym this places and think about the shrine ers were you thinking about care\nThat's why they're here\nIt's not about the guys and the funny hats it's above the service that the hospital\nBrings everybody to doing this oh you're in this area\nBut throughout the world throughout the world somebody needs help\nHaiti China [noise]\nAnywhere in Asia\nThey're here and speaking of as John So eloquently put up the guys that is wonderful um oh you weren't\nA guy you want the guy this morning trying to find the plural says uh that's that's a tough one what is the ... what is the plural of says I I I worked out I went with pheasants oceans I Would go to the a P A style gotcha oh yeah no CNN is our guide\nI'm sure it's in there some way they've got everything else but we're we're going to speak with some wonderful trainers from Maine who have\nMade a very very big contribution to\nThe hospital here in Springfield and just just loved pouring out of these folks from up in Lewiston, Maine rate brings up a guy but\nKevin I'm us spent a lot of time going through the hospital as I have\nOne of the things we were talking about last year\nWas inpatient rehabilitation for children view and I get an injury there are many as they say inpatient beds for rehab or physical therapy we we can find one right [noise]\nChildren ... ... there's there's a ... every child needs inpatient rehab\nThere's nowhere to go well that was that way until the ...\nThe void correct and the facility is just ... you have to see it [noise]\nIf you can come here and take a tour yeah um and see the hospital and see what they do we\nThink he'll see ah the ah\nYeah I'm\nFrom uh it's it's ... it's a workshop working workshop and there are people in there a work in a way on an arm and a leg\nFor a child and and customize and get to that child's needs not only their needs are physically but also their needs um I Want my arm to have a Boston Bruins logo I Know\nI Know I like that I loved that I'm One of the things that you'll\nSee upstairs I I I Want you to I Want you to think of the scenario and John this is want to know you know one of those heartbreaking scenario I ... a pediatric ... a small child having a stroke\nAs devastating as that is [noise]\nA child having a stroke [noise]\nCan gain\nMore of their mobility and more a more neurological connection than we ever could [noise]\nThe the age of the brain the nerves everything else new connections can be made but the important thing is happening\nA facility that can help to make those connections and what they have here\nIn their inpatient rehab is zero gravity\nAnd basically if if I could explain it in this way it's a harness and prevent the person from\nFalling as they attempt to move and it goes from holding them up\nOne hundred percent of the time\nTo holding them up to zero it's a transition so same system that NASA you're right [noise] right and so as the muscles as the nerve connections are re work\nLess and less of the machine is used to hold the person up they have infants learning to crawl on that machine they can make it in a way than an infant can crawl an infant who's had a stroke that service [noise]\nGo on the Internet look for that type of service you're going to have a long search and you'll end up back here right in ... well not in this room we're in a lovely conference room but\nYou'll be in the floors above us and in the\nArea around us and it's just incredible as eloquent as you were explaining all that if you take the tour and this building you will find somebody who will be able to expound on on the most technical thing in the easiest way though that you and I can understand\nI can understand well

about this incredible\nSystem that they have here look when you get an X ray\nThere's a risk associated with the bottom line is you're being exposed to radiation\nWhen you are a child you're John I mean the average child going through an orthopedic surgery I mean [noise]\nMultiple X rays right oh yeah multiple multiple lecturing the problem is you don't want to expose\nA young person to that type of a radiation\nJulie uh two years ago one of the goals was to get a new type of system here\nTo provide imaging and Kevin is going to tell us a little bit about that and how pledges in the past went to that what a difference of dismay\nSo the imaging it's it's ... X ray technology and and what it does it takes the same X rayed at a normal X ray machine to do it again I I'm I Am not a doctor so I'm I'm voting this very basic terms\nI'm it would take the same age as normal X ray with a Ninety One percent less of the radiation and that Ninety One percent so it was so when these kids have an X ray to three times a week or however often\nOn that really starts to add on the net technology a Cathy who is head of a radiology here that that ... that machine\nIt's a million dollars right you just write write their million dollar machine and to put this into human terms we have a lovely drilling Megan who with her ... her mother they come here every year uh she's now Seventeen\nA very severe case of school Rios us very severe um she is beautiful and she actually ah competes in in pageants yes and wins um wants to be in media some day and and so she was so proud of her public speaking and all the um [noise]\nShe showed me a picture on her phone says

a picture of her spine and she was so happy\nThat there was Ninety One percent less radiation so\nSo really think about a child having an Gen x rays it's like they had one that was done here that it's
