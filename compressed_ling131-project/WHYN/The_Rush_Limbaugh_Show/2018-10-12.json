[noise] but she put it up and of course the media ran with it and they've had to withdraw it because she had to withdraw because it wasn't true\nAnd it it's\nFairly common that these people on the left\nEngage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump or John ... the Democrats blue wave is drying up all if I had to be a disappointment\nDon't count your elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly governor twenty Eighteen mid terms still point to a good a great night for Democrats there the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely till Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet we pointed out\nThat all of these national generic polls show this gigantic way but if you go race by race if you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asked well how can this how could this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots\nThat shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must be in the generic ballot doesn't mean much ...\nHow could a generic ballot dilemma name on it by this time when you start pulling people a month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote without a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be\n\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning or the ... Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole ... every other seat that they have\nThey held by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo it's [noise]\nAnd he goes state by state to show her this is all happening ... they\nAnd once against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate but\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hope that this is a traditional here party out of power winds ... that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's going to happen then you go into the state's state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races some that could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting hoping hoping that reporting the hulk will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities already in certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer\nNow ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanted murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial\nAnd the reason is that climate guys now what is the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is\nThe media wouldn't cover it and nor the trial very much there have been a lot of people who did covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at like ed Morsi an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty different articles\nSo the trick is how do you do a movie about this\nHow do you get it made me in movie equals Hollywood how'd he get stars had to get people to start it how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get it distributed it how do you find theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing I'll be your door and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine but they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder\nThere is not a lot of hardly any\n\nAbhorrent Gore and violence in the movie\nIt's it's depicted in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate it's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things that movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe inform it's not the political movie that the left with me about a story like this it can avoid the politics but\nIt is exceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happens to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened a mass murder\nHe was a mass murderer of people\nIn the room that nobody on the left wanted anybody to know about\nWhat he did ... guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh and even at his trial it was said that he was charming people now our own buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this\nYou don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so the way I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course\nThe left abortion is not even human it's a viable tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with is deemed Kane is one\nThe or\nThe actor who plays\nA guy's now himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name is Earl Billings and for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\nOf a job it's probably the finest\nRole that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess a as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to see it's PG Thirteen we're not talking ... we're not we're not even talking are here so you're not\nGoing to be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell the story the story itself tells itself\nThe trial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have put everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made a lot of people to put their careers on the line agreeing to appear and start even Searcy\nHeroin that happened during a
