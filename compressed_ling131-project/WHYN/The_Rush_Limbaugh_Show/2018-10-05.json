{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "Well in in beyond just the the big brands I think that a lot of people are familiar with constellation also has been over the last five years investing in a number of different craft brands most notably ballast point where I think they spend a billion dollars to buy him a few years back and and that turns out that hey that's been a pretty good move for them given we're beer taster going in the u._s.\nYeah definitely I think that has been a smart move you've seen other big beer companies most notably a ab ... really are making a ... investment and cold and you walk rafters diapers uh but uh I think in the case of a constellation it you know adding the craft element\nTo the corona del on line which are\nBrands that actually are still growing in a in the U.S to well I think there's been a lot of talk about\nA backlash debate here where there's been sluggish sales of some of the more well known not most recognizable for him like a like a wiser and die and Coors Light that hasn't really been something that's hurting or corona at all [noise]\nVery good Paul will let you go will catch up with the next week enjoy the weekend thank you very much you two\nPolar Monica from CNN a scene in business the brand new name by the way\nChecking out the website this morning actually pretty good that's good stuff on their polo Monica from CNN Business talking about constellation brands are and where they go from here let's talk about where\nIranian oil is potentially going from here uh Europe and this is a story out of the New York times Europe apparently is working to try to figure out a way to actually be these new sanctions that the u._s. is gonna be\nBack on Iran in the near future ... what do you make of this Mike\nI'm what I make of it is the Europeans are desperate to keep this deal that they fought foreign place um but it's likely not going to work so what their trials but\nIt's very very difficult to move money between countries without a bank involved mhm it's incredibly difficult if you're subject to\nYou know massive or risk by not using a world wide bank and uh if they do use worldwide back then the U.S is going to hit that bank was sanctions\nI think you also have a tough time convincing big companies to go do any business in Iran right now like ... for instance French oil company had a budget plans to do invest in Iran\nUs sanctions flip back and they said yeah you know what I Know this isn't a French law but if we do this we're not going to do any business in the United states and we're going to get crushed and so it makes no sense so I think any large company is going to shy away from doing any business with Iran so long as you say us sanctions are in place\nI think what we're seeing right here is the tip of the iceberg as far as uh the push for a number of countries to move away from the U.S dollar we've seen obviously China Russia and Iran are talking about doing so and I think the fact that Europe is sitting here saying\nThe most important thing to us is being able to get you know our energy needs filled rather than where that comes from\nAnd I think that's the message that they are largely sending here now as you said it remains to be seen whether or not they actually go through with this but the fact that the discussions are taking place signals to me hey look they're willing to at least consider a world where they don't necessarily use the dollar as the primary means of conducting international ...\nThat would be very concerning if the Europeans teamed up with say China to allow the Chinese currency to be the one traded in Iran or for you know for the barrels of oil that are moving in and out of that country that would be a a an important first step it wouldn't be significant to the impact of the dollar but it'd be an important symbolic first up\nThis is something again I've been harping on this for the last year so\nThis is something pay attention to this because what this means when it's all said and done the reason why the U.S is able to finance its deficits are the reason why the U.S has been able to finance its growing deficits over the last thirty to forty years\nIsn't because us citizens went and started buying up more U.S debt yeah it's because internationally Europe China India all those other countries said yeah this makes sense will continue buying this up in in funding your deficits\nAs of the last three years that's effectively stop they're not buying any more on that basis right and so if you see a further push away from the dollar what that potentially means\nIs that it becomes incumbent on us to finance our deficits internally which we've never really wanted to do we've never really had a huge appetite for it because quite frankly like it's it's not good to do that like if it crowds out other spending another uh other winning that you would potentially be doing\nSo this is something to watch okay not so much because of what it means in this specific instance\nBut because of what it could potentially signal as a big shift over the next several years years to keep the story in mind uh like you've got\nThree young daughters now sure do two of them just north of two years old\nAnd we've got senators now calling for a federal investigation of children's apps as to whether or not or these apps are misleading by misleading parents by labeling the apps child friendly your thoughts on this because you know way more about this than\nI ... I mean the basic story here is that there's a bunch of free apps both in the Android Amazon and apple stores that are collecting way too much information on children and while that may be okay for an Eighteen year old nothing should be collecting it you know location data phone numbers or or email addresses\nFour or five and six year olds that that's to me a very clear red line that shouldn't be crossed and uh it sounds like there may be existing laws on the books here that are being broken and it may seem like there needs to be new laws put into place but specifically location data on children is not something that I feel should be shared\nA little creepy right yeah and buy a little creepy I mean incredibly great\nNow that said shame on parents who are allowing that to happen\nAgreed I can agree with that that eh do your research on what you're letting your kids do and how you're letting them do it but in this day and age the the companies or at least somewhat responsible for that action\nAs well hidden for the top of the hour no quick look at market now off two hundred and forty seven points continuing yesterday sell off a as race continue to rise asking the NASDAQ negative territory NASDAQ really going through a steep sell off off almost one and a half percent today so all the time that we have for the week joy the weekend we'll be back\nProceeding was paid advertisement by the financial exchange and does not reflect the views or opinions on this station its advertisers are I heart media eighty five we shop you save\nGet full details on the example policy of political dot com slash commercial surprise could vary depending on your health\nAnd human radio I think\nWhy you why NSM ACC Springfield [noise]\nOne to the Supreme Court nominee and the ...

Ford mentioned in the letter he sent him talking about how\nAre those coaching going on but Dr Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the

Ford admitted\nThat she took a lie detector\nWill her warriors and that that she had seen a therapist and the ... has been asking for that evidence and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it and he's saying you have repeatedly refused reduce this\nAnd in doing so you're preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr forge allegations she passed a large attacked or we want to see it they won't\nLet them see it\nI don't know what other infringe we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support her allegations in quite the way you have claimed\nTo reasonable thing to say they're out there saying she's not gonna lie detector that she passed the lie detector that she told all these details to her therapist well let's see that stuff and they won't producer\nAnd Grassley said you're must be you must have something to hide then he writes I urge you once again now for the third time in writing to turn over\nTo therapy and now it's the polygraph materials and communications with the Washington Post Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence\nIn addition to the evidence I requested in October second letter in light of recently uncovered information please turn over records\nAnd descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr Ford or her representatives and and I am following one US Senators are their staffs particularly the offices of Feinstein Hirono\nNumber two the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford Leland Kaiser mark judge Patrick PJ ... my wife and three Debbie Ramirez Julie sweating represented what what what Grassley is getting at here how much consultation if you had with is what\n\nSenator Feinstein senator her own owes of them they are how how much time you spent with this witness discussing her testimony or coaching her or whatever\nI mean he's loaded for bear this was the kind of ... out of the violation and I shouldn't call it that these are this is the kind of decorum that you you don't see broken\nSenators don't challenge each other and they don't call each other out it's almost the Senate rules\nAnd and Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conference he kept running back to the microphone do run into these senator or the the\nMedia people as using by us and so forth in fact grab audio soundbite number five\nThis was I don't know if this was at a press conference or not it may not be exactly what I saw but it is an example of a grass me with his finger on the pulse here this is I'm not it's not what I've seen this this morning\nAnd washed but let's listen to what we have learned is the reason is that has existed since the day after the November twenty sixteen Elijah is centered right here on Capitol Hill they have encouraged mob rule\nWhen you hear things about get in their face bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member they coming from public service that ought to set an example of civility in American society and it's been made worse by what has happened to judge Kavanaugh I Hope we can say\nNo to mob rule like voting to confirm judge Kavanaugh before\nThat was during his ah southern for remarks today in favor capital he was even singling out by the way Maxine Waters for promoting this as he called the resistance but he's he's calling them out here\nAnd\nChastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the resistance leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill and he's right the leadership of the resistance is the Democratic party there resistance is over the Democratic National Committee\nAnd in various Senate offices and offices of Congress members of the house and so forth he I've I've never seen this before I've never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like\nThis fit to be tied now I think I have something in my relate to it I got an email\nLast night from Salinas Ito who has made a name for herself\nBy traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of two thousand sixteen she went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump and she learned everything about these people she could\nShe took them seriously\nShe went and met them and talk to them learn about them nobody else in the drive by media has done anything like this\nBut she wanted to find out who they are she lives in Pittsburgh she had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didn't see and rather than gas she actually wanted to find out who these people are she went to a lot of small towns\nMedium sized town spent serious time they're getting to know these people she has stayed in touch with them ever since the election she has written a book about it\nIf the Democrats in the media wanted to know who has been voted for Donald Trump all they'd have to do is go get her book they haven't they don't read it they don't care to know who the Trump voters are\nThey're not interested in appealing to them they're trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls they want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves but they're not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them\nTo what never Trump or is there any about Trump presents an amazing display of arrogance\nAnd by the way the same can be set of Republican political consultant so they don't care who the Trump voters are all that matters is that they are left out impugn didn't made fun of so I get a note from her last night\nAnd\nShe is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened out there in these areas she has studied and she made essentially two points\n\nOne that something has needed to happen after the two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together now a lot of us of assumed that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did so for very specific reasons\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six game that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly that\nAfter a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand six team\nBig going on in various states and it's now hit the commonwealth anyone receiving such a call should\nNot give out any personal information and just hang up that scan is under investigation by federal

she\nWe fly in and WHYY NFL ACC Springfield\nI Want to re read gee you Kimberly ... tweets about Lisa Murkowski Lisa Murkowski by the way this is another one that uh CNN is obviously nervous about because earlier today Lisa Murkowski was a definite\nNo on Kavanaugh and in announcing her definite no she said he is just not\nThe right man for the Supreme Court right now just not the right man\nSo Kimberly stressful now she changing you're not changing she is saying that our minds not made up\n\nThe way is a Reuters story and it says essentially Murkowski has not made a green dull decision\n\nYou could have fooled me it sounded awfully final to me this morning when I rabbit Brett Kavanaugh is not the right man for the Senate right now now she's saying it's not her final decision\nSomething is happening in that regard [noise]\nHere Kimberly ... tweets again the first one here they're they're both right on the money just to be clear yeah I'm trying to apple five days I'm I'm trying to make sure more people hear about these tweets and then we'll see them yeah absolutely it's worth it\nKimberly straw so Wall Street journal columnist editorial page editor and writer\nJust to be clear on what Lisa Murkowski voted for today Lisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voted to legitimize and sign off on the most this pick a boat tactics\nEver in the Supreme Court nomination Lisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voted today\nJust stand with Diane Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris to leave judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and the impeachment which they're going to pursue by the way\nOh ... yeah or doing\n[noise] is another interesting thing handled her new develop it here but hang on just a second there is a second tweet from Kimberly stressful\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska today voted\nTo abandon due process and the presumption of innocence\nShe voted to potentially if the Supreme Court and a four Ford that block which puts the loaning Ninth Circuit court of appeals in control of everything that matters to Alaska her stake development\nProperty rights gun rights environmental rules\nLisa Murkowski has made white the statement\n\nThese are two devastating tweets as they are right\nOn the money\nLegitimizing in signing off on the most despicable tactics ever standing with Feinstein\nCory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nMen dastardly and add a number of uh\nAnd things just just [noise]\nNot much redeeming there but more importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and impeachment and then leaving the court if he's not confirmed the court stays up for for a deadlock what\nThe ... the reason that matters is that in a way if the court votes for four and then the case\nThen the decision prior to the court hearing is affirmed nothing changes and that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals would be the highest\nRanking court that could make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be idiotic to put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights\nAnd development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals with a bunch of left us in charge of those issues in her state they're just shooting herself in the foot all to supposedly\nBe in unison with the me too movement\nSo I mentioned we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein it looks like she has cornered Murkowski\nI don't know when the photos were taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have checked Feinstein's wardrobe\nOn a particular day of hearings\nBut go ahead and Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the dead OK I'm there is a picture and stand by 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally when Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a hand look on her face Feinstein looks like\nShe is\nThe picture speaks for itself in the ... with that hand that she got a cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski it's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein's leaning in to Murkowski\n\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those would be watching under dental camp do you see\nThe pain the expression on the face of Murkowski and the expression of in hand seriousness and you better be listening to me on the face of diet for\nAnd I will have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave anybody out but what are you watching other digital camera to be able to see the is that's that close up as the same shot\nJust to close up of the previously televised photo is that right well\nDone here looking here says why Feinstein sure does look like a bully and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable does she not\nI mean it's been really pained look on her face\nAnd it it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for\n[noise] [noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong we we have no context here\nOther than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call at romantic I take that back ah one of these is from California and romance there has all kinds of shapes informed so you could be right ah it it could be a romantic under load I certainly what's\nThe old saw not for us to criticize who loves who and why [noise] so um yeah it could be a ... bat\nLovers quarrel we don't know\nBut I've got to get these photos up the cocoa unless cocoa confided sure cocoa couldn't find them himself or it may beat me the punch now the other [noise] breaking story [noise] that's not a breaking story but\nIn the Senate campaign in Tennessee this is\nKind of interesting this is the marsh show Washburn story or race uh let's see [noise] Marsha Blackburn I'm Sorry Marsha Blackburn a story her opponent is Phil Bredesen\nAnd\nBreathe is and is saying that he is disgusting and that if he was in the Senate he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh is a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn\nWhat is a Democrat doing saying that he would vote to confirm capital this is in the ... this was in the middle of the campaign here\nNow I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red and Aubrey just wants to win and so forth but this\nHe expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh in the state of Tennessee\n\nPhil Bredesen is by the way starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this this record ... seat And Corker by the way has also tweeted today\nThat it is outrageous to punish somebody who hasn't done anything to anybody for all of these ... pose an actions other men have engaged in against women but his point is we have no evidence cabin or did anything to anybody we're going to design a seat on the court because of that\nAnd then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial temperate temperament and then we're going to deny because he committed perjury and have been going to deny him because he threw ice in a bar back when he was in college but Corker made a plan that he doesn't think\nKevin should be held accountable for things he has on his ... that's kind of like the affirmative action argue but why don't we don't know where am I going to be punishing people here for racial discrimination when they have it\nUm would like to discuss this Murkowski briefly with you um\nI Believe it was during the bill Gorsuch a earrings that Murkowski went to the administration I Trump\nAnd bargain her vote or exploration rights and the handler and I worked up and where do I know what that's like the revenue that that brings to the state\nThere's correct that's correct you're right I remember that you're exactly right and why I think I Know where you're going this is a hell of a pay back\nOut well you know that was done resistance is is is there a way to get the gotcha back on trial or why hasn't that chart been flight back to her to say with the stroke of this thing panic at all go away\nUm you know just something that makes you go the other\nWay way way way way wait a minute the stroke of a saint pick what could go away\nWell if the stroke or the pen can but animal are in place for this day\nOh oh you mean Trump could cancel and war as pay back the Murkowski for going against capital Yes sir it wouldn't do it\nOh okay I'm\nToo many people will be hurt too many people be hurt by\nYour right but that that means a lot for her first day\nSo I don't know\nUh the other quick question that I have for you as you mentioned earlier that if the Democrats regained the house that almost immediately impeachment hearings which started against Trump but it would most likely include Kavanaugh\nWhat does that do for Neil Gorsuch does that put him back in play again\nBack and play you mean to be impeached as well\nAbsolutely sir no no no but they wouldn't buy that much off or you can get rid of capital of getting back off the bench or install Trump's next nominees when the White House and twenty twenty\nI in fact I think my guess is that they would go after capital of first\nIn terms of impeachment proceedings\nIf fresh and everybody's minds go after him on perjury\nAnd sexual harassment\nNot I mean serious serious things for\nWhich a conviction could ruin his life as well and then after they get ... then they go after Trump as the guy knowingly who nominated capital and they add all the other\nThings on Trump this is my guest
