E. O. a of the neighborhoods social network\nNext door a this is Sarah fire and I would say bum on one level I feel like this is great news about square they've got fantastic talent and ah you know their talent wants to be rated by\nA other companies this didn't bring to mind once last time somebody or ask you for a credit card and rent it through a square device plugged in the end of the phone\n[noise] or maybe ... ...\n... ... actually I was like I ... I have one about a four or five months ago so I had to have someone come out to fix a garage door that had broken\nAnd it was actually it was the contractor I said hey you're going to send me ... goes no just the pulls up a little thing puts into the swing of just payment that will take care of it I'm like oh this is great it's easy I don't have to sit automatically generates a receipt and everything and boom everything's done there I see a lot of contractors using them for their business is actually interesting because it made me think\nI feel like I saw those things more two years ago than I Do now you see a lot more you see a ton of the square payment platforms in retail locations in particular a lot of restaurants using now I'm a lot of the fast casual places I see 'em in but it does feel like the ones that are built to go into your phone\nWere more popular maybe twenty Thirteen and fourteen than they are today I don't see quite as many except again a couple of contractors are that are using them here\nAnd I would say even after the thirty percent sell off its still been a heck of a run since January oh you look at it it certainly hasn't and look at it anytime you have senior leadership believing it did it you have questions say who's going to fill that role you know that person was there through you know kind of his optic here\nBut you know this this person's there had been there for six years you know this is not a case like we saw with Tesla were the chief accounting officer left after a month and raised all kinds of questions because why do we have a job after months the buses nuts this is hey I've been here for six years\nThere's a there's a reasonable case to be moving on I think you know certainly there are questions hey what kind of talent comes in to replace a miss prior just because you know she obviously did a very good job steering them through not only in I peeled within a few years afterwards\nBut in terms of you know should investors panic because she's leaving I don't know if that's necessarily the case and the cool thing about score you know Jack Dorsey walks into this building and goes to he goes to the left\nAnd he is CEO of Twitter warning and then after lunch he walks over to the other side of the building any CEO square vice versa but uh it's pretty amazing that he's\nDoing those two things and maybe somebody will figure out how to put them together mixed from the uh classification of I guess stories that matter today but likely will not matter in the long term for this company\nSnapchat apparently launching scripted shows on their platform as they try to push original content through Snapchat my kids are not going to like this is talk to me about that because they're the target is not you and I because we don't use Snapchat put your kids or don't\nIt's a Democrat to tell you how you have to talk and things you can't they're the ones that run around and say you can't call terrorism terrorism and they're the ones that run around claiming that ever they must be attached to climate change when it is a weather event anyway I said eventually do don't get so upset\nBy this this is nothing I mean this is this is actually flat or to be mentioned in the piece here\n\nBut he certainly was mad because he doesn't know what to do when confronted with abject ignorance like this how do you fight abject ignorance and prejudice and so forth\nAnd you don't you just feed it you don't try to reason with it because it's impossible you defeat it I've got a chart here doesn't go well on the radio but it demonstrates that since Nineteen hundred you can find\nWith all the ... hurricane since Nineteen hundred you can find no significant trend in either the frequency\nOr the intensity of major hurricanes striking Florida there simply is no evidence\nThat climate change manmade even exist and there certainly is no evidence that it has anything to do with hurricanes either the number of them are the intensity but that doesn't matter because the New York times and the rest of the dry buys are offered to running cause they are hell bent\n\nOn getting people to Rio and takes it why what is the purpose because this promotes big government it promotes the notion of gigantic on a critic\nTyrannical government control over everything once you of the American citizens are blamed and can be blamed for everything that's wrong and you can be controlled to make sure that you start doing things right and don't keep doing things wrong that's what they want\nThis ... in the process they don't even know what they're talking about this guy does know hurricanes from thunderstorms\nHe doesn't know cloud tops ... temperatures and it doesn't matter\nI Want to thank Mr surgery for being so sensitive in so concerned about it but I Want to assure you that these kinds of things no longer\n\nBother me other than the I I I Do get concerned it there's so much genuine ignorance existing now in positions that influence the thinking of other people I mean feminist studies\nAt universities I firmly believe has destroyed\nThe futures of way too many women\nIt has just distorted wife it's distorted gender differences if has distorted the concept of happiness victim allergy it has distorted the whole concept of America the greatest place to live and grow up and seek opportunity in the

Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of king Solomon but he has been designated the crown prince meaning he will be the next ...\nAs such Mohammed bin ... mom has been trying theoretically to reform the soul of the the Saudi economy and to take it away from being strictly petrol and oil focused\nBecause the world is expanding in ways that the Saudis are not involved in one of the things that Mohammed bin Salman has been doing has been traveling the world and making friends\nIn the United states you spend a lot of time in Silicon Valley he's gotten to know he's winding dying the Google guys is winding dying to Facebook guys spend a lot of time an apple\nHe wants to build a brand new city out of nothing in Saudi Arabia and make it a tech center he's thirty two\nIf he takes off

the the them screaming and yelling and attacking us and and the folks and and so what I felt was\nThis is all they have the reason that they continue the reason that John Lennon saying the nonsense he said on CNN the reason that they just continue with this game plan isn't the only game plan they have\nAnd they're hoping that the American people are dumb enough still buy it but I Believe that the American people even in California where I'm at the American people are seeing this crap and they're like this little game we don't find any more\nAnd and and they have nothing else to play there's nothing else for them to do but they just keep doing the same ...\nAnd the luck in our eyes it was like they know they're losing they know that we're not buying it anymore but they've got nothing else to say\nNow that hold on you know that's an interesting point because if they do have the maturity of the presence of mind\nThey do have to realize they're losing Trump one Trump is getting elements of agenda his agenda in her past are implemented Kavanaugh was confirmed everything they've done to stop Trump\nEverything from the judges to the courts to travel but not much his work\nAnd so I think you're right they do realize they're losing and you think they're in a fit of desperation that they've got nothing else to do that's why they're not proposing any ideas to counter Trump's that's why they're not proposing any new policies to counter Trump's 'cause they don't have any\nAbsolutely they let loose when they're both the right mood when were silent and they it for so long they've expected us to just shut up and go away it\nWell that that's true too I I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving and Republican voters will certainly conservative media uh well ... conservative caving as well I think they've they've gotten accustomed to bullying working the rats\nLying yep threats lying all of that and and and they're hoping that it's going to work together and the only way it works\nIs that we don't do up that's why that's why you see the polling data still showing them winning that's why it showed Hillary was going to win in a landslide because they know that if they can to sway does that they can discourage jumping up and up and they could not show up that's the only way they win but if Republicans and conservatives stand up\nWhen every single time we just have to show up we have to convince other people to show up and convince them to convince other people to show\nUp you say you were in Washington for three days what did you actually see what

which there are obviously some we had thousands of people lined up by the time I had to make a decision so my decision was do I want to tell people that were waiting ten and twelve hours are already\nThat I'm not coming and uh I just thought it would be and we're talking about thousands of people you know when they get there that early and who you know that area obviously has that affected at all by it we had it under great control I don't think really\nThe eagles very hot relative to other things I think it was very minor\nSo president essentially saying look these people have lined up it expected me to show up I follow through I Do what I say I'm going to do the hurricane\nWas going to do what it did and there's nothing I could have done about it last night when I was in this rally my people are down there working on it we got it covered\nI can do both and I'm following through on the commitment so the next question in from the do somebody who probably is not going to vote for you Eric Holder former attorney general said they go low we kick them\nAnd the whole room Mr President started clapping and cheering when he said that what does that say to you about the tenor of politics to\nBe careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you you better be careful what he's we're going to discuss things safe and for him to make you a very dangerous day for older\nWas held in contempt by Congress older went after Christians he went after our great evangelicals he went after the Tea Party people you know that they just settled the IRS just settle that

they would say\nWe strongest term ... we'd denounce rhetoric co authored by attorney general holder written but but but much ... totally totally uncalled for and we we routinely a unilateral condemning\n[laughter]\nYou better be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you that I he'd better be careful what he's wishing\nNow the stock market's been kinda see song has been a roller coaster ring\nAnd Trump is suspicious as he can be up and let me just tell you something folks there are a number of wealthy\nDemocrat Wall Street types investors people that run hedge funds\nWho I Am convinced would willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and business is primarily their business is not that well but they would they would they would encourage some pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there are enough looney tunes on the left who would willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it it\nFlies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say well it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that or people don't even leave it there believe it look at our polling data people obviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial\nNot just to ... but the Republicans in the midterms and so there's some monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling are causing the stock market's a roller coaster and here is Trump was pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute so [laughter] when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression [laughter] it was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with plenty of money he was it was very easy [noise]\nI'm paying interest at a high rate because of our fed and I'd like are fed not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried\nWhen the economy's going to bring my whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why\nAnd let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so threatening\nTo official Washington\nAnd it is because every time the economy starts Chuck him what does the fed and do they leak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think the feds are going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy\nAt the time and totally unnecessary for right before an election and he's calling them out\nHe's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't drop run to know you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors are going to be you know a bunch of Tommy leftists\nAs they are many financial institutions are not going to pretty strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning because of Trump\n\nTrump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the elections why things down so they react to it\nAnd and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I\nThink there's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here that we have yeah a ...\nYour wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust us to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are working are there are some that I Am a not at all levels yes and what we need them out slowly but surely\nThere'd been some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the links are not linked that made up by the newspapers that made it very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand\nNow even the letter written to the times there is a chance there is a very good chance that that was written by the times I wouldn't be surprised 'cause the times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear that right here who was the first or maybe the only person to suggest that the times itself wrote that piece\nThat memo that supposedly memo written by an angry staffer in the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal lives of president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservative they we loved\nIt and they started a massive manhunt to find out who did this and they couldn't find anybody and I think on the first day on the first day we'd have to go back and check the transcript\nI think it was the first day I told everybody I don't believe this I think the times made this up I think they wrote it and they're telling us that somebody ... wrote it but I think this is somebody from the editorial board the editorial staff one of the up and people\nA taking on a victim mentality and I was so fired up and it was amazing and I was happy to seal um and I remember realizing that I'd never felt that way in my whole life\nUm even though the left would label me and say that I should be feeling that way and I just really I Am still fired up especially with the Koch have an odd thing I like this little device that war on men I'm I'm so fired up I Want everyone to feel that way um I Am so committed to doing everything I can to expose this\nI'm I'm inviting all my friends are listening to you [laughter] throughout the week and at the weekend we are going to get together and we're going to talk of I feel like you can't rely on the mainstream media to do any of that for you and I think that's the only reason why the less they had as much reach

Bengal since at that time everybody thought that Hillary was gonna win in a landslide then they the soundbite would be in the headlines the trumpet knowledge is likely defeat in upcoming election\nBut Trump cross them up and said no\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans these people gonna play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in here\nThis is the biggest threat to our democracy that we never\nDid believe is saying there is this is an unwritten still then Obama we didn't know until\nRecently devised a secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was the plan was if Trump wins to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand ... senior staff and the Obama White house\n\nDiscussed what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had caused to be worried at that time Trump an openly speculated that the election might be rude during his mind a little bit

according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and condo leaves a rice to try and forestall a political crisis\nBy validating me election results so this is not funny looking by their hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump\nRefused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and Congolese are\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents and they were\nGoing to get them to validate the election result in addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get colon Powell income the loser rice\nIn the event the Trump tried to disputed Clinton victory they would have fun result as well as the conclusions rich by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed they hatch this\nRussia plot way before the election even took place and no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're going to use the Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was\nThat was going to validate her election even more that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the all the garbage she overcame Russia that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away\nThey refused

[noise]\nWell I have two questions if you don't want to take one that's fine uh\nDuring the judges hearing all I heard was if we are only investigate they do not come up with conclusions or Indians or anything I heard that too but Fox\nNews and the president at both bought in\nTo the fact that honors did\nExactly the opposite he was judge jury and not executioner but a probation officer for Hillary he did he violated all of it so\nWhy did he get away with it and nobody else can I I don't understand I really don't\nUh who is ... ... you mean calling me going going yes I'm Sorry [noise] [noise]\nYeah I'm I made the same point when I heard they don't drunk and cook combing exonerated her be interviewing her\nJudge jury and probation officer right\nAnd and we all know the reason why she was a Democrat nominee their jobs and futures end the shenanigans they have pulled\nRequired her to win for them to stay employed and for the tricks they pulled on Trump to remain unknown\nSo she had to be exonerated she had to be found not guilty and not even charged in relation to the emails and the ... and the trafficking in classes by data and so forth so yeah I had the same reaction you do you mean it'll come on collisions\nI under I understand that that you had to get off but he did not have the right to he was not a judge it was never in trial\nIt was oh well you know wait wait wait wait he claimed that he did because Loretta Lynch\nEnded up having to her she didn't officially recused but because she met with slick willy\nOn the plane on the tarmac out in Phoenix ... said she's compromised so he basically took over the gig of energy for the purposes of exonerated Hillary and he went out there on July ... did that press conference under the auspices of making the decisions because Loretta Lynch couldn't\nThere why can't we just ... open it and say it didn't have the legal right to make a decision so let's start over from where he just gave that speech\nI agree with you and this is why you're not the only one debit newness and a bunch of his um other house members that are on the house Judiciary Committee\nAre hell bent on getting to the bottom of this and

you say nor ring the real crimes and criminality that's taken place\nWhile spending all of this time trying to find the crime that they can weigh on Trump and they haven't been able to\nIt's frustrating this is why by the way there isn't greasing frustration at the president for not declassify these documents little answer the question you're asking\nDon't understand why why the president is protecting Rosen stain the guy who in a meeting suggested wearing a wire in his next meeting with Trump to try to get incriminating evidence that Trump's unfit\n\nThey were going to gather the cabinet after Rosen's dean had\nHad a conversation with Trump which supposedly was going to show that Trump is insane and unfit and they were going to play that for the cabinet you try to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment Rosen students I'm just kidding I just get rid of it was the people in the ... he was not giving none of us work\nAnd I believe that I Believe these people back then were hell bent on getting rid of Trump\nI think they still are I I think I think official Washington the political media complex of washing it is still\nInside out and upside down over Trump and I think what every success and every smile on Trump's face with every\nPiece of evidence that Trump is enjoying this I think they go a little further insane each and every time\nThe Trump succeeds something that Trump was not damaged by saying every effort everything they've done to take Trump out I think they are beyond frustrated that it hasn't worked\nAnd I don't think they are giving up on it I don't think they will give up on it\nNow the Rosenstein Rosenstein however pronounces it heard it both ways this is really curious Trump had him\nOn the air force one people fought the roses you know while
