a little bit of news about it so I Can't help myself but we're now into force that we're allowed to start thinking about it from at least a a earnings perspective and FAO Schwarz\nIs making an international pushing also reopening their flagship store in New York\nA head of the season you know we we hear so much about everything going on line and bricks and mortar closing down but the fact the matter is bricks and mortar is still a great differentiate or for companies if it becomes a destination and let's face it everyone knows the FAO Schwarz in New\nYork City if you're drawing a blank here I didn't come along too yeah but it's it's a tourist attraction exact and you know they are smart in my opinion\nOpening up again I'm a ends at thirty rock you know right by NBC pretty good timing with toys are us disclosing every single one of those okay and and you know like I said it's it's a tourist destination that people in there you know get a lot of talk\nA gay male above ... that's a luxury toy brand new when they were open back when you'd have like personal shoppers and air you would have concierge type services so I mean it's Manhattan It's over the top it's that's what it's supposed to be\nAnd they're also going to pop up shops in Spain Australia and London for the holiday season people go in there and get some very nice expensive ideas\nAnd you know it's gonna be the other interesting show among all the other companies that are trying to pick on the toys are us or you know absence um party city\nThey do get you know those Halloween yup up shops that they do a

Toys R us absence that we're going to have\nThis year and a get a lot of people like to go these stores and see the stuff in person than a find out how goofy they look in those outfits or whatever you

you can buy for your kid that you know trying to grab everything in the store so smart moves ... smart move getting these pop up stores people will definitely go there and they'll spend money and I think so [noise]\nThree housing trends to watch this fall John we've talked about the real estate market extensively and some weaknesses that we're seeing what what are we what are we should we be looking at this fall\nWill you know the bottom line is despite this huge recovery and you know in almost all of other recoveries the key issue was housing\nThis is a recovery that's been fantastic and housing simply hasn't come on housing starts\nHave or have not done well housing stocks are doing very poorly right now\nAnd I suddenly keep an eye on to see that things could get even worse is can rates stay under five percent if they go about five percent it's going to walk a lot of people out of the market yeah a ... will prices ease up on the gas pedal a this is something to keep an eye on two\nWe have seen so this is three months in a row now where we've seen the year over your home prices the median home prices nationwide increasing it less than five percent and that hasn't happened since ... fourteen so clearly we're seeing some deceleration anyway we're not seeing every adoption and home prices were seeing some deceleration in the increase\nWe're seeing buyers and sellers coming together and getting an equilibrium price that seems reasonable I don't hear the stories about Fifteen bids over asking price anymore exactly and\nI saw a number that I think is reflective of what's going on here the ratio at banks\nOf loans to deposits is the lowest in forty years which means banks are sitting on a lot of capital and they're not lending it out and in part it's because a lot of people applying don't qualify because these prices are too high incomes don't justify it and on top of that it's been a lot of regulations that have precluded a lot of one thing\nThis is going to be an interesting issue as we go forward to get banks to kind of open up and start writing business because it was just the opposite extreme eleven years ago\nYeah young by her still really aren't in the marketing force a twenty five thirty five year olds are thirty six point five percent homeownership rate\nThat still well below where Gen x ers were at the same point in time a number of different factors you can point to where there'd be student loans are not getting married yet still yeah millennials are not buying homes at the same rates that their parents and grandparents were buying them\nNowhere near but the trend here is encouraging because millennials are now starting to increase their share and I look forward I think a lot of this purchase has been delayed not put off\nUm and I think you can see a lot of people doing in their thirties with previous generations did in their twenties and it's going to be a huge boon I think for housing going forward\nI keep here everyone pointing to hey you know great news you don't need to put twenty percent down ever you know everyone says oh you need you need to be buying a home with twenty percent down and\nThat's clearly not the true because not true because of all these programs that we have I really don't love these programs that exist though I mean I Know that they're important get first time homebuyers in the house but it and are we going back to some of the issues we saw back in the early to thousands comes out of\nThe issue of scholarships for students going to college the more money your hand out the more prices actually go up you know the easy you make credit in terms of low down payments the more likely you are to get people to buy more house\nThan maybe they should write and got VA loans guaranteed by the department of veteran affairs or require no downpayment right kind of agree with that one uh USDA loans allow people to buy rural homes without much of a down payment so\nThey I don't think we're running into an issue there but you something to keep an eye for an eye on it yet it's all the time we have today for the financial exchange stay tuned tomorrow or John Mooney Mike

face we're talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it in America is always going to be here don't misunderstand but this country surviving as founded we're under a solved it has never\nBeen worse name into the civil war but but those were different circumstances that was a specific argument\nAbout cultural things regarding slavery but in the end nobody\nOf any\nReason to attitude could ever support we find ourselves here in a multi layered multi faceted all out assault on the entire concept of America\nIs found some people's sense it some people are not aware of it and I I I've just sort of evolved here into a\nPosition where I feel compelled to try to explain this sounds some warning bills and may be present some\nSolutions but after I have to be very careful I don't over do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats\nThat we face are so that's coming up as the program unfolds back however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off apologizing to the nation\nApologizing to Kevin all on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him\nAnd the cabinet episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against and it\nIllustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas the left is not\nInterested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments over the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interests their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have\nNo limits on how low they will go on how deprived and perverted they will be in seeking their reality it all I Am convinced started on America's college campus well tracing where it started I mean to go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this the most recent starting point\nWould be the most compelling I think the best way to get people's attention with it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born or and so ancient history is if they've not been taught it or they don't know it\nSo the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this I\nThought but they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes our ideas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate and not even worthy of discussion or acknowledge\n\nAnd they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept\nNone of that none of that is relevant all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the Capitol hearing everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence Kavanaugh was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThen that's what we'll do\n\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nWhen you put a safe in your

headline from\nPolitical Josh just today political story ready for this\nPolitical race ratings than GOP house is crumbling here is the sub the headline Mr ... there are now two hundred nine seats\nEither firmly or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and it you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome\nI'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe that\nOkay so political says the GOP house it's crumbling it's falling apart there are two hundred nine seats firmly order wing Democrat\nI guess this is according to polling data to hundred eight teams the number of seats you need\nFor the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nRidden the seeds firmly are leading Democrat I mean this if the Democrats [laughter] nine seats\nWith this this is a white by the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nFor this ... this is ... and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I don't I don't really pay attention that I never have but the people in Washington to live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democratic side
