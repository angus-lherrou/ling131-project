insurance it's a worthy read something you should take a look at study maybe talk to your account and talk to your financial advisor about it because I'll tell you what\nA as you get older you start to think about these issues you start to think about what happens when my wife gets sick what happens when I get sick what do you know what happens all the wealth that we've accumulated during during her lifetime\nThe guide is called designing and income only irrevocably trust them then they give you a phone number to call it's eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine today is the last day of the month ended his last day for you to call and receive this guy that from Cushing and dull and\nEight six six eight for eight five six nine nine is the phone number now some of you might say

mailed to you or e mailed to you you can call us again the phone number is toll free eight six six\nEight for eight five six nine nine China has set the official Ron rate at the weakest level in a decade why would they do that\n[noise] so pretty much this is one of the tools that China has to you know really affect the overall growth trajectory of their economy\nThey did something similar to a you know a much larger intra day move actually back in twenty Fifteen in pretty much what this does is it makes their exports much more competitive because it reduces the cost or in in other currencies term so let's say\nThat I'm trying to buy goods from China okay and I just had ten percent terrorists placed in on what I'm trying to buy from them\nIf China reduce their currencies value by ten percent you know they can effectively offset those terror\nBut what is it due to the people that live in China like I I just think like if our currency goes down I Know my gasoline bill goes up\nIt doesn't do a ton to China aside from the energy side of things does affect energy because it's going to make it more expensive in local currencies but remember China doesn't import a ton from other places as far as being as good as they produce a lot of them there you know in terms of you know if if you're buying you know some are buying raw material\nThey allow that source in China you know if you're not having to go to another currency it's not having an impact it's when you have to import if you are a debtor nation that imports you know can you be devalued currency imports become more expensive right\nIn Chinatown and import them the bigger thing that the big thing they're importing is energy they're importing a ton of oil okay but when you take a look at you know the other stuff all the rare earth minerals their own mind in China you know you have all kinds of aluminum minds in China there's all you know it's a lot of the good your source there to begin with\nAnd so you don't necessarily run into problems with your own people not being able to afford\nThose thing they've been accused of being a currency manipulator in the past season is this currency manipulation Treasury Department found it wasn't\nJust as ... and that was two weeks ago is evolution came out and said hey there you know they're not a currency manipulator\n... can they continue to do this through the uh you know they went down a little bit here ... ... what if the president's lots of twenty five percent ... terrified are they going to devalue their currency is ...\nSo it's this is kind of the the chess match that that's being played right now is whether or not they are going to go down this road\nI don't think it's beneficial to them for the long term to do this or\nBecause they're trying to build up their own currency as a stable means of exchange that can replace the dollar ... and if all you do is start saying okay we're just going to play around with it just to win this trade war you know it doesn't do a lot of good in terms of in terms of their long term planning if there's one thing China's been really good at the last twenty five years now it's being focused on the long game at the expense of the ... right\nBut let's use bowling as an example they buy a lot of jets from Boeing yes when they buy those jets they don't buying them in one they're buying them and US Currency\nCorrect so when you have to import something like that it's a big deal the big thing that China is doing they have a state run a airplane manufacturer that's just getting ... up now that likely has taken a decent amount of Boeing and Airbus technology and they are trying to compete with those exact companies\nActually but if I'm a wealthy Chinese person why would I leave it say I make a thousand dollars and I have a thousand dollars saved in China why would I leave it in China knowing that my government is going to devalue the currency wouldn't isn't there you'd try the risk of a currency flight ...\nOh they're absolutely as but China is pretty good at trying to rein that in through the capital controls or you know just saying hey you can't do that\nBecause you see that a lot whether you're in Florida or whether you're in New England you see a lot of Chinese money coming into both markets and buying up real estate\nAnd specifically it's ... dollars actually because again there's the surplus of dollars that flows over to China and they're sitting there saying look we can't invest this money here let's go buy real estate back in the U.S because it's out of the country and be it will hold its value then\nA lot of it sits in the you know he they buy it you know their their condos in New York Boston Florida that are sitting empty nobody ever sleeps in them yet but they're owned by the Chinese\nDo ya it's it would in in the reason why is because we buy all these goods from China may end up with this surplus of dollars and they say got to do something what are we going to do they used to buy treasuries they're not anymore you know now it's okay what's buy real estate it's better investment for the long term\nYou see kids at University of Miami that are living

H. Y. N.\n[noise]\nOkay listen to and again this is Monday Night on CNN steak in a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\n... lemon says it on Monday Night on CNN and\nIts noticed today and again he's talking the freight formal about all the recent shootings in mailed the pipe bombs and ... says\nThere was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threat in this country is white men most of them radicalized to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nYou know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon what what is your reaction to this I mean the folks I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban them that that may be something that he individually holds the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the left is concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's got on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perverted view the American left is white men who created this racist and bigoted unfair unjust immoral country\nDo not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration the real objective has been to transform America away from\nThe traditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery as the primary evidence the primary example or exhibits\nOf their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the steps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets mentioned whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism and slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan immigration policy\nYou name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and field of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more grounded now in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using a victim of allergy and victimhood into a she\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be a white men or continue to be the majority\nAnd they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it I think they are if you if you want to start attaching if you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people you notice\nHow quickly they want to do bad notice how quickly on the left the people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're always the result of environmental things\nAnd so it's a left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either loved Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's day if you're gonna if we're going to go down that road and if we're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs are pulling the trigger on the guns who is it the raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and ...\nA single thing positive about anything you can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd since these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon said uh the Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter\nAren't Republicans in that group look in the number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders had\nBeen defended and explained away by people like you in the sense well they're cops and they missed reading their racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how

Taiwan there but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is going I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to Lincoln the Trump a good point\nThere is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash to gin up anti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking the hell I'm not sure I'm not joking and they don't care about it because it has no impact and has no usage they can see\nAffecting the outcome they wanting to mid term elections don't worry they'll get to it when their side of the time to attack a\nCorporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it you do you do you do you do doubt me on this\nPersonally no but uh just trying to remember seeing them go when wall to wall on that last plane that went on\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN they were there were there were there were sucking ... uh they were in the last place out there and this was that was pre Trump\nAnd the the the belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are below the TV so they believe and then they had a mystery\nWearing a damn thing where is it Don Lemon even asked a former director of National Transportation Safety Board could it have been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\nCan't specifically remember that Americans have ... ... ...\n... ... they had a mystery on their hands and indeed you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became a standing joke you know that the the best way to make anything you're doing it success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on and media outlet whether it's\nYahoo Google CNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what I Want to wait a minute how do you know about it\nThen well I saw it on a headline\nNews maybe where Monday morning boarded the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go eighty percent uh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever uh forget what you call it programming but\nNo I just wanted to kill you or that there was not one little usually anytime the plane goes to show 'em that many people especially it was a brand new planet\nOr whether you're such a brand new playing what kind of playing was ... what you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new has got to be the one of the um you know somewhat but uh and that's what made me think\nEven more that we would see news Stewart Brand new plan going down his unusual and ah we were out across the street sucked in in Asia\nI'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest uh upgrade of the seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide body and not as white of course is a jumbo jet wide buddy but it's stuffy and they have a mixed ended a damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers went down but\nIt didn't go down in America a Donald Trump had nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case uh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... on it so\nThat no way to link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash to the mid term elections they'll get to\nRush Limbaugh does for you the best school do on the ... the\nAt home with Gary's element Sunday night\nWait why in in our house bedtime is complicated my wife is always freezing and when she layers up to bed I get way too hot Hi I'm Scott tan and founder of bone branch makers of the world's most comfortable seats loved by three us presidents if you're like us you'll love our flannel betting\nBack for a limited time at bowl and branch dot com\nThey're unbelievably soft warm and breed the bull so misty stays warm and I don't know ... it's like magic we let you sleep in them for thirty nights if you're not impressed send them back for a full refund R. flannel sheets coming fourteenth stunning patterns and colors you're guaranteed to find a style you love\nBut don't wait last year they sold out and just a few weeks go to ... dot com today for fifty dollars off your first set of sheets plus free shipping with promo code rush that's fifty dollars off plus free shipping right now at\n... dot com protein by and DC and the ad council\n... weeknight starting it sat in on news radio five sixty W.

I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence of it everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidate to individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea\nOf the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\n\nIt's one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you some people it's horrible what Trump said about ... ... why\nIs that why isn't it why isn't it\nA problem the Paul Ryan took the first chance he had to disagree with his own president about this by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation as we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\n\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters or what they are Mollie Hemingway has a great piece today speaking if Kavanaugh it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question\nDuring the Kavanaugh hearings remember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the Ford with her allegations whatever cabin on there that led to the fact of capital is spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rapes we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they have evidence of it none of them ever present at any but the media and the\nDemocratic Party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh's named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... ... the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\n\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S.

Minnetonka, Minnesota this is a Ella image great to have you here with us Hi\nThank you so much ... when my call I was a twelfth grade American history teacher for Twenty years and I finally had to leave because the regime as he was becoming more than I can handle I started writing my class of courses\nBecause I couldn't handle how they had revised American history the reason I called was the topic on immigration\nImmigration if it's in the book probably gets about one paragraph but most people don't understand is when these millions of people came over to Ellis Island we didn't just open our ... come on in a way that Democrats want it now\nThese people were given a thorough examination by the ship especially looking at their eyes they take a device him sick all up\nThe upper eyelids and if you had a disease called trick karma you were automatically let go they made you walk up and down steps to make sure that you are strong and we're not when that no one to ship Dr performed has examination you were put on a ship\nAnd you were sent to Ellis Island where they gave you a second examination\nDoing the truck coma exam once again\nWalking up and down the steps\nAnd if you didn't make it you were sent back about two percent of the people were sent back and the reason why it was so low is because the ship doctor really did a thorough exam if you were sent back that ship had to pay for your passage back to Europe\nSo they wanted to make sure we did not want any on that quite not work\nWas not healthy and what's not strong you\nRealize that what you're describing is factually correct there are people listening to you today who think my God America was cruel back then where am I that's what people are thinking listening to retell the story\nI'm sure they probably are because they've never heard it and we were compassionate to those who could work\nUm there was a saying that said I heard in America they had streets then I heard the streets with tape with gold and then I found out I was going to be the one page in the streets but we did not want people would be on welfare we did not want those people\nWe want it only strong healthy people\nThat's been totally left out of history books and\nI Can't tell you how much it frustrates me to listen to these Democrats talk about how wonderful it we were on the whole world a little buddy not true\nI have a nine year old grandson and I just shudder to think about it kind of history he's gonna be learning it's um I don't get on giving him for Christmas one of your books to oh wow you know very was because I think that\nWhere's he going to get it was not going to learn it from his own history books all revised they give even a paragraph to maybe Benjamin Franklin\nTry a paragraph to Abraham Lincoln John Silver at Boston University at Boston University way back in the night is\nA survey of the most popular high school history textbook and found one paragraph in reference they read one paragraph there were pages devoted to Bill Clinton\nFor example in in American history\nThe name that you want to know is Howard Zinn Howard's in as a textbook writer as a as a as a as a quasar socialist Marxist and he somehow has been a gold\nVast majority of text books purchased for use in American public schools have been written by this guy but you know you remind me of your story about Ellis Island I Need to tell this story again because\nImmigration has been a subject for as long as I've been\nHosting the program so over Thirty years\nIn one way thank you very much A L L for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to reminds us of an elephant Ellis I not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nAnd we were much newer and younger country but him and we had an entirely different attitude about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed\nIn had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nUnborn baby every year more than just under one million heartbeat or

and I said to myself well it's over the environmentalist wackos with this age group have one\nMore than any technical advanced what're achievement worn any cool aspect to movies gives most of the fact that it was a hundred percent recycled it just these kids have been told that climate change is destroying the habitat that there may not be\nAway for a life to be sustained when they hit sixty five you'd be amazed at the number of young people who've been brainwashed in propagandize to believe that and so the fact that Apple's introduced a little bitty computer here and it's made a one hundred

surprising\nOf course not after you protests are not support what what does\nImmigration refugees have to do with this debate in any way why are these protesters there okay so here's Jake Tapper the

Democrats have won the house because of one of their polls Nancy Pelosi\nIs declaring victory in the battle of the house she was on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert last night and set up until today I wouldn't have said in the election were held today we were when but what I'm saying now is we\nSuggesting that we need to uh and birthright citizenship claiming the fourteenth amendment does not say that\nYou have everybody in the world out there disagreeing with him but the purpose of it is to start the conversation Trump is\nAnd that that's what conservatism was as a former movement back in Nineteen sixty four\nAh and there are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show your countless in in two thousand ten\nWhen the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody forecasting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in himself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats\nAre forty some Adam he predicted was off by two but nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten I mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because of so much love and devotion respect for Obama\nAnd then when that happened you should've seen in if you remember the bottom fell out the window and it\nJust totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody did Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives because everybody hated Bush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nThe Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way and what happened Republicans gained ... seats\nThe left was done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen they end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded analysts\n\nAnd it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does I have here is from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down the\nWhole analysts and data analyst there is Sean ... day\n\nAnd I got to read the whole thing in print out the four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final stretch nominate tell you what this long piece says I can do this long piece in three\nWords we know nothing\nOn certain days alone as many terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight ten midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you are split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's a much polls\nIt results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred ten Democrat majority\nBut this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says and the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that thing the Democrats pick ups could be larger but they could also be smaller\nHere are some things that should bother any sober minded elections analyst in the final week of the election why we just concluded here there's the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any bird because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words not in this trend days [noise] his words resume here will there be a late break\nAs we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion in two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can alter the landscape substantially\nThis year there are a lot of undecided voters remaining look at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get the job or a ship numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait he's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on Mr trend day here\nIs we don't know he's given you his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... ... you can think of where it might not turn out that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear how about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this\n[laughter] but that's just me you know being smart alec\nUh in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia get Tammy is possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggest but what about the Nineteen\nRepresentative John Faso is up by a point but the president is job approval is that a forty six forty nine split that suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so Trump's on the ballot or he isn't isn't going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\nAnybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here needs to reexamine things\nAnd then the next burger about how many votes are Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been the massive influx of money\nInto Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke\nChallenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a outer Mongolia seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead and the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress now normally this will be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seek but then there's another consideration and that's how correlated army errors\nMeaning cover liable aren't the mistake and then\nThe next ... are we're relying too much on one poster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next one is early voting selling well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people have voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election\nIs over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise] so\nThe final paragraph what else is working out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen\nThat hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nRenders every poll prior to this day\nMentioned on this program countless times that of course the Democrat Party is the drive by media and vice versa drive by meaty is the\nDemocratic Party they are they in fact I I think the drive by media is actually the organizing power\nBehind the Democratic party to Mr are saying you're saying this but he's he's saying that in his opinion a growing number of the American people are aware of it now\nThe federalist that's right that's right he was an Mollie Hemingway in a gang and his his opinion is that a more and more Americans are succinctly aware\nOf the unfairness the imbalance and by the way beyond by us if if that's true if a number of these things are true then they're convert will be a major surprise\nBring deals you began weather\nRadio by six\nWeeks ...
