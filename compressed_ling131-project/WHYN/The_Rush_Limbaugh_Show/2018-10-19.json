{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "Oh yeah I think it would have to be considered a\nScary and we're we're seeing even now that uh you know that ... you know billions of dollars a year obviously on new content and a lot of it does really seem to be a sort of just throwing stuff while the what the heck and even things that you would have thought\nWe'd do well like iron is just part of the whole\nDisney marvel empire they cancelled that after Tuesday's 'cause you know it just wasn't a show that a lot of people really into so I think that like taking a lot of risks and you know many of them paid off but it just a lot of money that they continue to spend that you know on state I'm all for the long term\nPulled one of the things that I find interesting here is this is a market overall this year that even though it's it's still up somewhat for the year it's the market that's gotten cheaper because earnings growth has outstripped what we've seen as far as appreciation for the broad market\nNetflix isn't in that situation they've gotten more hype and who say they're definitely not so their company even with this quarter you could make the case it's it's riskier today than it was at the beginning of the year ...\nYeah I think that that is a very good argument that gets to the counter that I Would add to that is that Netflix seems to be treated in this\nClub like Amazon or you know\nCan you be overvalued for two decades that mean that really you know when it comes to Amazon ... always been overvalued type yeah and it keeps going up and up and up and I think it's really just because people have faith in what Jeff pays are doing it and then the numbers kinda help prove it with all the growth there and I think with ... think that that like\nYou have a similar ah no argument this kind of a you know called the c._e._o. sort of a warship if you will people really seen that they can't do anything wrong\nPull in terms of competition for Netflix you know we we we were asking this earlier this week in terms of who the biggest competitors are\nIn my opinion one that's not a pure streaming service but HBO just because they have that subscription model in a hundred and thirty million subscribers worldwide obviously they've they've got that good base that's already built in\nYou've got companies like Hulu you've got companies like Amazon who even though they don't split it out they still have a big streaming service who is the biggest competitor in your opinion four foot right now\nYeah it's a tough question I think what's really difficult to try and figure out with regard to competition a lot of people talk about how competition could be bad for any of these services\nMy counter to that would be that as long as the broader economy is doing well\nIt's not really a kind of binary option I Know that many people who say well you know what I'm not going to subscribe to HBO even though I Love the game of Thrones because I only can afford Netflix and I want to watch the final\nSeason of arch the new black I think people are very ... consumers of\nStreaming content right now and you know most people I Know they they have an Amazon for ... for Amazon shows they watch HBO they watch Netflix and you know various authors as well I think it is going to be interesting to see whether or not but Disney Fox\nStreaming service that launches next year takes away some of the uh you know a traction for Netflix but uh you know even there I'm not so sure that people are going to drop net like just to go to it\nBut one of the things that's missing from Netflix right now if you get all these other services out there\nThey all have some other kind of lived content they can offer whether it's you know Amazon has some Thursday Night Football games and some soccer games even Twitter has some of those uh you know obviously the legacy players like a Disney and Fox have sports news and things like that\nAny cheddar but Netflix getting heavier into those areas because that's the one thing that seems to be missing from their portfolio right now\nYeah it it definitely is something that uh you don't have right now but I think for the most part it's not something that I think\nAh you know they really feel a need to get into especially when you look at how\nWhat streaming the streaming media explosion kind of it on the TV in general I mean live TV seems in many respects to be\nAn antiquated notion unless you're talking about a big sporting event or or some\nBig news event or you know because of people very busy live time shifting is kind of what people do and you know you don't necessarily have to have\nAppointment live TV yeah as a draw I think I think it really is more about having that attractive appealing content that you get to watch whenever you have time to watch it whether or not that you know\nTwo o'clock in the afternoon if you work in the evenings or you know eight o'clock at night if you have a regular day job\n[noise] very good Paul we've got to run now but thanks for joining us to have a great weekend and we'll catch up with\nYou too and I might have some based on your future\nA little bit we are we ... we got a good one this year so uh just got to go to get things moving a little bit ... got a good one going on I think that you do outstanding it's Paula Monica from CNN Business talking about Netflix picker on them as N. F. L. ex\nUh and uh let's do a quick way to look at markets years we head towards the top of the hour\nI mean it's pro violent but they actually ... their PR is that they attempt\nTo achieve their objectives within the quote unquote democratic process and the political process they want a United Arab world and the Saudis are the biggest problems that because the Saudis\nAre too close to the United states the Saudis are the number one the buyers of American weapons\nNumber one they spend more money buying American arms than any other nation\nThat might surprise you but it happens to be true the Saudis have also become recent allies with us\nAnd Israel against Iran now don't laugh at this when you go back and look at Iraq who saying oh who the drive by the media loves\nWell Obama loved Iran and to Obama paid Iran one point eight billion dollars in power loaded cash Obama signed the nuclear deal with Iran was essentially a pathway\nFor them to achieve nuclear weapons Trump has since ... up that tipped him off that's that's another rewind when Obama policy so if Obama loved Iran or thought it was okay at least to have an allied relationship with them or less adversarial then soldiers the drive by media\nBut\nNone of this about the show is designed to ... not not intend to do they deserve to die don't misunderstand this just folks were were between a rock and a hard place here every day we're faced with a challenge to the media picks a story that is their number one story and its purpose is very clear damage\nDestroy or whatever as much as they can Donald Trump we have to defend is\nAt least I think this this is my reaction to all of this\nI don't want them taken Trump out I don't want them damaging Trump I don't want any of this to happen is this all bogus I Want the trajectory this country is on to remain I Want us to remain on that trajectory I Want to be back\nThe insanity Emmy abnormality and the psychological disorders that have become the Democratic party I Do not want those people in charge and leading and governing this country it will be a disaster if that happens\nIt will be an absolute ...

sought\nTo have Donald Trump from you move from office since the day after the election I guess what mothers about that's what the collusion thing is about that is what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table

White House that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the arranged abnormalities that make up a Democrat base\nAnd I mean that specifically I I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican\nThey want to destroy Mitt Romney or George W.

I think many of the Republicans have bought the idea of the Trump was not to be ongoing or a before now I I\nThey are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think the first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on the part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy and the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side\nWell we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a palm payroll left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince you flew to Mexico\nStory out today says it they went off his true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin ... as crown friends\nNow many people think that this is up to the king the king of tournaments which uh his son was just going to be the next king but it's not the case so\nAll of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cabin up all these plans for reform\n\nHave been brought to a screeching halt by the murder of job market show in Turkey which is also very unhappy with Saudi Arabia\nBecause the clown roast turkey\nRecep Tayyip air to why he is not one of these guys that wants to western influence as we look I'm way long haired have to take a break but that's the answer\nTo your what he's ... he's so many ways [laughter] Raasch only eat I be met with George ...\nBy telling you why it's really I view I Am thankful every day for the brave men and women and protect our freedom and our country now is Veterans Day approaches I Want to announce that my friends at Mahendra are holding their fifth annual military ... give away\nThe winner will receive a hindrance retriever utility vehicle that's right a brand new read my Hendra retriever one thousand gas model\nLast year's winner army captain Robert forty of Ohio is loving here's my hand and you could be next\nTo nominate somebody who is active duty or a veteran of the U.S military and they get official rules\nIs it Rush Limbaugh dot com and look for the Mahendra military salute give away thanks to my hindered the makers of the toughest utility vehicles on earth and God Bless all of you who protect our freedom\nTake advantage of rock bottom prices at test drive I'm a hindrance today at orchard hill farm equipment in Belcher town or visit orchard hills sales dot com that's orchard hill sales dot com\nPrices for peace building's only genetically windows doors ... attention on business owners who rent or at least space including storage space stop wasting your money paying someone else for your space you can now save a\nTon of money and own your own building with the incredible sale prices from general steel it's right now you can save as much as half the time and cost of conventional construction and stop renting space from others just go eight eight eight\nForty one steal to see how general steel can help you save money or fifty years structural warranty buildings are custom designed for your needs you can get a forty by sixty foot building burn less than twenty five thousand dollars for a fifty\nBy one hundred clear spanned building for under forty thousand dollars there's a new wasted space and construction takes half\nThe time ... eighty eight forty one steel strong construction spending in high demand this special pricing will not last long ... eight eight eight forty one steel and get your options pricing package on dozens of building options ... eighty eight forty one steel and see how to\nWrite him off but ...

the drug by just want to use this to get Trump\nTo show Trump's ineffectiveness or to show Trump puzzle lined with tyrants or whatever I by the way I was thinking there is one\nIssue that the media and Democrats you would have to say had some success and that was the\nAllegation that the Trump Administration was separating children from their parents at the border\nThat wouldn't have some way\nThat would work and that might be what this caravan as about as a as well\nEven though it was totally manufactured in made up it required the ignorance of a lot of people for it to a I don't mean

you add in the chaos that will happen and you're throwing the possibilities if they do get to the border and do cross but they wouldn't be separated and that's the one of all those issues when I went through the last hour that came and went and didn't have any glue or have any legs that wouldn't dead\n\nI'll never forget I was out in California I I I got so frustrated I was playing golf with a friend of my one of us\n\nAnd it was during the time to drive ... and the Democrats are making all this noise about how Trump separating families children mothers\nAnd this guy who's up to speed on this stuff says Russia's pictures look basket come on you know the pictures are made up this is ... the pictures look bad it looks really bad you don't you're not really fallen for just rest of the pictures look bad we've got to do some pictures were like oh my gosh\n\nI I was a guy was smart enough to know that he was calling for a media trick but at the pictures of what he was telling me was I Can't defend this\nI have people complained to me about Trump's separating ... I Can't defend the pictures rushed the pictures\nSo that's the one thing that has had legs okay so the audio somebody's if you're on hold if you're on the phone just be patient were coming to you ill quick oh this is the sound bite the hand of the interview last night uh that Fox has been playing all day long to get people's reaction\nI still say that I think there are things that have yet to happen that are going to determine outcomes in some races the we don't know so it's still very hard to predict Kavanaugh feedback reaction was one hundred percent positive for Republicans or Democrats really blew that\nBut there's four hundred and thirty five of these things I don't know I just rely on hope which is again naive I don't have survey data I don't trust the it hasn't been right\nConsistently enough for me the people doing these surveys desperately want Trump goal and I don't know how they can take that out of their work I don't believe in pure objectively like this ... if I put you on the spot production but we hold the house and we increase the center because I think that's just I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest the electoral landslide defeat in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that by ... by\nLit up the Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom bill hammer or anti ... and Julie ... cohost out there talking to fame Republicans strategic wrist Ed Rollins about my comment dams\nDeserve to lose like he's part on that front half right on the other front I think will lead some set of cities I think the house was very very much in jeopardy\nSo you are not buying into this scenario hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold it they don't count votes like I Do I ran a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen seats that are now gone nine of those are the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play only about two or three Democrats seats are in place until the on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through them and say this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into\nThis stuff this is this is wrong or stuff\nAnd to me this is totally absent uh any any what what's the word personality or I mean there's just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and\nI Know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of\nPolling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired outcome out of their work\nAnd we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty and I mean that those people\nLiterally called short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was one neighbor ignored\nAnd we've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions\nIs reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election or two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House\nWith Obama there that could be a factor\nObama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there as I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\n\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rushed Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses going\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates and them\n[noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done a one eighty are made now performing and executing an behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage and anger there promoting insanity and lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump\nIs there's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout\nProfile of voters well that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats\nSay the justice associated with the Democrats are doing is landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried it Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his\nWell that was over like a land balloon and they died with it so they abandoned map\nAnd outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America they have in ... dad continued to try and portray America as this unfair on just on dessert\nExceptional superpower\nThat discriminates that violates that ... that [noise] it's all negative\nSo I'm just\nSo where is this body of evidence that suggests the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon Bream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no polling shows that the Republicans are going to hold on to the house so where do you think that they're coming from a with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the phenomenon that the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy Trump voters the shy breakfast votes is the kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve sheltered and who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a\nReason was Limbaugh getting this I mean it's not a single pulled out of the shows this happened precisely my point is not a single poll not a single poll shows\nSo from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine not attend to people in D.C live and die by their ... and I really think ah if I Lived in Washington each and every I I don't\nI couldn't I I wouldn't it be ostracized
