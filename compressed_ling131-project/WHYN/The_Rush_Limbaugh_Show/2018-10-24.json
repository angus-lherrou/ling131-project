Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics and it is a it's a website that many political\nScientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly what what real clear politics does among many other things\nIs average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls and political experts from across the aisle\nSite real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and cofounder of this place was on a sea of Fox\nBusiness Network today he said that if there was a blue wave\nThat it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building ... we'd be seeing the top\nOf it here and Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they had a real clear politics and analyzing\nIt's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the Democrats are not running\nWay with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage that Ben says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race\nReal battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of seven day competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now\nIs anywhere from Democrats picking up tend to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three\nThat's the magic number above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats jacked pick up a twenty five seats twenty five an hour or two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift\nIn just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house\nSo all of this synthesize and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving and Democrats favor Trump's approval numbers are rising over on the Senate side ... and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nRepublicans wouldn't gain or lose any\nTwo weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the past month we've gone from Democrats picking up a couple two Republicans gaining a couple and that's the momentum and that's the trend and he made the point that it's a whole new world with Trump\nGender gap education gap the rural urban gap all

reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek
