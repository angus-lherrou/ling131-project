reported on the trial of abortion doctor Kermit cause now\nHow the woman goes into a clinic comes out of that and there's no police report and\nI helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions not to fact of course because now movie is amazing ...\nI was made aware of and given access to earlier this week at the British and that gets\nBBC One if I'm not mistaken although that could be wrong but it it's a British network and the title it's six episode one hour per episode\nMini series called press and is about two competing newspapers in the current era in this modern day and it's amazing\nHow honest if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there is nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era I'm generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of ... a big one of them small one of them is very serious take themselves very seriously don't tabloid anything [noise]\nDon't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than the furor trash and it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does\nIt's flat out amazing how honest it is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purposes\nDestroying people both of these papers in this in this mini series\nEnd up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out\nOr some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the big people powerful people rich people there obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules and the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something\nMistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something\nAnd the purpose of journalists fears that call 'em out and and and ruin them which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target I was never\nI had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that\nPaper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism\nBut I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking to some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias well there's that but that it it's it's more than that\nIt's about ruining people it's about\nTargeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built journalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this trans Russian or that transgression particularly against the little people\nIn that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbed a ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy any day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin all\nIt's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no bones about it I\nI don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them in and things for\nI don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google that many of them but I watched this I've seen two episodes so far out of the ... and I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave can lean on is this is\nOne of the the editor the head honcho of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is pick up all human beings I've ever seen portrayed who is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally\nOn affected by life to him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life and the way he guides his journalists as the world has no solutions I'll stop what what is that where your world view of the world\nHas no solutions and he's telling it it's not your job to fix\nThings it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job\nHe one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this Lees editor who has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship it's not clear to me like each other but they owe each other from\nWay back before the series began and the editor ranges\nA cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet they're stories not about the prime minister being a ... I was about somebody else for the primaries tickets live in an outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me\nAnd it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would've ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it was it\nIn the private ...
