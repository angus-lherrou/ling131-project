people who project or mental problems on to the public on the politics is exactly what is happening here do not underestimate that and don't think that I'm I'm I'm being flippant or exaggeration only make a point I really do believe\nThat we're talking about mainstream mental and psychological disorders becoming standard operating procedure politics the America but there's no other way to explain this\nNow folks to show you how deranged this is I have in the stack today I have\nUm two maybe three what I Would call teachable moment things they are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today and over the weekend\nThey are related to cap and all but they\nThe pieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and of course for the for the Democrats\nAnd much of it is I mean I just saw dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this if it stuns me\nThat people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them they continued to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel and these are some of the standard bearers of American journalism on the left\nOne of them is a you know John Harris at Politico one of the founders Democrats fear of there are the wet rag party you know this pieces about this piece is about how the Democrats get their rear end headed to them every time because all the Democrats are a bunch of cowards\nThe Democrats have no guts the Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers Democrats what Republicans walk all over\nNow how many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side as a bunch of ... but I don't know how\nAnybody paying attention on the left can think that their sights a bunch of ... but the fact that they do is fascinating to me\nNow here's another such pace and we have said that this woman once before I don't remember specifically when\nHer name is Alexis Grinnell she has written on gender and politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets\nShe had a piece on Saturday in New York Times it may have been actually published on Sunday and released on the Web on Saturday Night the dates October six since I don't read the paper anymore I don't know when this stuff actually shows up in the print edition\nSo my guess is this thing was released Saturday Night on the Web to be published in the Sunday paper but it could have been under Saturday papers well doesn't matter white women come get your people\n\nI I don't even know where women who is thoughts are this convoluted and you're going to hear\nI don't know where they come from\nI don't know who's responsible for creating molding but I think it's gender studies I think it's a combination of feminism

knows it\nEnded up Tuesday news conference he signaled do white women to hold the line he said the people who have complained to me\nAbout it the most about what's happening are women women are very angry I of men that don't like it but I Am a women that are in the\nSense that what's going on everybody knows women ... going on because they have husbands that they love and sons that they're worried about and being leftist women think those other what you'll mothers sons are sellouts and traders including with your your interest is\n\nThis is it is downright sickening it's not even based us in a common sense with a\nWith a even a community of understanding and the Democrats think this kind of thing is what's going to generate this massive blue wave\nIn the house\nI Am more on that I

agree with you totally his point I don't like taking\nOver here 'cause I got twenty seconds and and I'm a communication specialist a say a few words as possible uh David here is worried that despite victory here the left has gotten so discouraged that they threaten the very structure of America with that range and with violence\nAnd bullying in ten they intend to basically strip away\nEverything democratically elected simply because they don't like it using violence and bullying and it's a legitimate concern is that that's why they have to be defeated at the ballot box to start with\nAnyway

Alexandria Ocasio Cortez vain and it just it it just after nine stupid I Wish I could remember it's in our show our cars but this is the first I think maybe we've had a sound bite her before but\nThis is an appearance about a book that she has written called good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nAnd the host of the CSPAN afterwards show is Rutgers University women's engender studies professor Brittany Cooper\nQuestion if fields devastating to me than if white women cannot have a public life private life professional life or in protest in what are we to do\nLet me read that question again it feels devastating to me\nThat if white women cannot have a public life a private life professional life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre we angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or I think it's an do we also acknowledged that we need to wake the white women and their power\nTheir products willpower can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed then in fact\nIn this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs us do we need white women\n\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported cabinet and I don't know if it was so much that white women supported Kevin ... is that they were ... it it is scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst men\nThey have sons they have brothers and anybody would have half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind to see that the Democratic party had a lion the itself in such a way\nThat men work or don't meant that lake guilty simply because they exist simply\nBecause they are capable\nIn fact [noise]\nLet's see there's actually a story with that exact point\nMay the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stuck but it is in is a woman making the point that Kevin wrong is as good\nAs guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it because\nHe has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe balls before that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're a woman with the sons and a husband that you love and sort of brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss what is ...\nFolks that was just the uh the hook that was just the train they decided to ride\nTo the railing the nomination anyway Derek and hazel in Pennsylvania you are up right to habeas are high\nA rush to begin to your show you are you at a rhetorical question about a dozen Democrats really believe in this this new tactic with the mob and I mean the Democrats learn insurgency they become a political uncertainty and\nAs you noted thirty he learned to feed it they just change tactics\nAnd the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine ball before they had a tutor they had someone that not only educate argued that someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for\nOh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we have ... to ... who has put some ... on the final Republican\nUh ... true true but\nMaybe I'm maybe I'm silly for trying to force this issue but let me just ask you point blank right since you have talked to are willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior that just we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized and Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get on the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people down to Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public doesn't care one way or the other end doesn't even really notice it\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working\nBlue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow um increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely that that the American people are going to be turned off\nThen I I think it's all going to come down to a who who was able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty let me okay this is my ... I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this one is that\nIn mind staying in just world the Democrats just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king of books titled the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to go punish this month just gone for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans ought not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kinda frustrating to me but that's the case\nDemocrats thinking they're going to turn out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election the Democrats think the whole country is except they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think\nThat they're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading and people are gonna be reading Republicans don't have a chance\n\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think the issue that you were speaking of a month\nOr so ago that the that hadn't happened and what twenty nine days let it happen\nA true yeah that when I'm when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is

Bush and it's all most identical\nThat Democrats were enraged at the Supreme Court stopped the count in Florida of the hanging chads but Democrats believed that the Supreme Court handed George W. Bush the victory ill legally\nNever mind the Florida Supreme Court was out of control the way it was handling all the legal issues here the U.S Supreme Court had to step in and\nI think because it was out of control and when they have the Democrats were fit to be tied and from that day forward George W. Bush was an ill legitimate president\nAnd he didn't stop being a legitimate and they finally got his approval numbers down to the twenty six years later in the middle of his second term so we get the two thousand two and it's the first chance the Democrats have\nTo pay that country back to pay the Republicans back to pay Bush back and they are going to retake the house and they're going to retake the Senate and they're going to reopen the Florida recount and they're going to make sure that justice is finally done and that Al Gore being duly recognizes\nThe legitimate winner of the presidency even though Al Gore didn't want any part of it by that time\nThey were feeling so up so shore so confident\nThat when it came time for a memorial or their late great senator from Minnesota Paul Wellstone\nThey totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial honoring and celebrating the life of Wellstone\nIt was about three weeks prior to the mid term elections in November of two thousand two the Wellstone memorial was hijacked by activists Democrats and turned into a pure\nPaul let it go rally the purpose of which was to destroy George W. Bush and Republicans in the memory of Paul Wellstone\nRepublican senators who were friends of wealth stones dude if we showed up at the arena they did this arena in a place that whole Fifteen thousand people if my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people\nIt was some time after a while most of them died in the plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was I don't think it was ever intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial anyway Republican senator is not knowing up from down at night and Trent Lott and\nThe boys all showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial a religious memorial ... there are falling colleague Paul Wellstone\nThey were Bunni and bullied and her raft out of the place within thirty minutes of having a rival didn't sat down\nIt was identical to what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators MBA hallways of the Senate office building except this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters\nGoing up to the worthy Republicans receded and getting in their faces and pointing fingers at um a booming at them\nThey thought they were there to participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left\nAnd this memorial turned in to a hate fast a hate fast aimed at George W. Bush a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies\nThey couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine eleven for this memorial\nThis Morial took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms occur\nAnd I remember I was in ... the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw I Do to fully accepted\nAnd I went\nAnd I was not on camera all night maybe four or five times while they they cycle\nThe other people through and they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans had gained the seats on heard of\nThe Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big\nBecause Democrats toilet everybody hated Bush everybody resented the wave of Supreme Court stole only election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just clicked and at the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and in competence\nAnd as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats didn't take back control of what is rightfully theirs Washington DC\nExcept it didn't happen to Republicans gained ... seats\nTim Russert was great broke all brought me out and so what do you think happened here I said\nWell stone memorial Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why in a truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked\nThey were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\n\nIn mid term elections the first ones after a new president is elected so that's a formative experience for me and if it's I like ... if it's happened once it can happen again\nSomething it hasn't happened before probably won't happen buddy of mine has then it can happen again and this is a replay of that\nExcept this is a replay of even more outrageous behavior the Wellstone memorial took place on one night the Democratic party has been insane on display four to four years\nAnd actually longer than that but in the in the context of Trump's election it's been two consistent years of public they're arrangement\nPublic insanity psychological disorders on display childlike temp by the way I too\nHave sat in the Senate gallery as a young boy my parents took my brother and me in Washington DC one summer and the Senate was in session and I'll Remember a Barry Goldwater\nWas among the senators speaking when we were there he was speaking on the farm bill\nI was fourteen or Fifteen\n\nAnd I remember being in the gallery and I had a it was a pamphlet or a book some some kind of a a manual explaining what the Senate was in what was going on and I was turning the pages and the Senate page came and grabbed\nThat book away from me and said you're making too much noise I'll give you this back after you leave just turning up page was not permitted\nThe gallery could not do anything more than ...\nYou were not allowed to chew gum people\nWere chewing gum and the pages said you're leaving Russia or putting it in a piece of paper and toss it you're not staying in here to income\nThey would come which brings us to you they took my little pamphlet a way\nI felt like the Gestapo had just come and then I'm watching this thing the other night in these in these these these these women are going batty\nSounding literally like they are infants out of the boom that and they don't want to be there and I couldn't\nEven make out what they're saying it sounded like Christian Adams said it sounded like we were in the middle of an asylum in there and ... my\nSaying over and over the sergeant alarm started an arm to restore order in the gallery there's are done an arms will restore order and the gallery\nWarm their readable everybody stays the right temp these flannel sheets they come in for team patterns in color is you're going to find a style online at our website that you love you can try them for thirty nights risk free\nThat's the bowler branch guarantee you sleep on them for thirty nights while you determine if they're ... soft if they do the tricky keeping everybody comfortable in the fall climate if you don't like them send them back all your money will be given back to you you won't send them back though nobody does very few\nWhatever you do don't wave because last year bowling branch flannel sheets sold out and just a few weeks\nYou go to olive branch dot com V.

[noise]\nLet me go back to the phones yeah I'm going to I'm going to weigh in on Susan Collins here here in a in a second her speech on friday was [noise] it was I don't I don't think it was the turning point folks I don't think the votes\nAny different than it would have turned out if if the ball seaport hadn't shown up if I if I hadn't linked all that ... it's all about not happened to vote would have been the same fifty forty eight\nFirmly believe that this is not to be critical of Susan Collins white the contrary the turning point was Trump explaining\nTo the nation that loves the Ford could not backup or corroborate her story that has not happened that did not happen in the hearing\n... got away with the incredible sparsely hearings were concerned only when when Trump unloaded and told America during his rally that she can't tell anybody where it happened when it happened\nWhat year it happened where the house was how she got home what she said after it happened to whoever none of it the people that she said were there all for the night at the American people didn't know that the drive by sitting reported Trump was the turning point\nTrump Trump\nEnabled Republican senators to hang up here is a Mac in Allentown, Pennsylvania as we head back to the phones breeding sir great to have you with us\nOh wonderful to hear from the Roche um I I'm originally from the earliest days and I'll make a comment about the Democrats the whole process with hearing and then if you have time I'll tell you how you converted my wife from my mom listener to one of your most loyal fans which is a crazy story but\nAnyway with a with a capital hearings which so sinister and ironic and all this is if you remember\nBack to Bill Clinton and and the accusations that came out against him in the early days\nOf my mouth out early but we are\nAll the accusations with him on the media Saturday Night live ah every talk show on the news outlets they totally destroy these women they lead followed her looks than the other way\nThey market their stories or discredit them they questioned the motives on what Dr Ford were uh you have someone that doesn't remember anything you have victims remember in particular leader Broderick the time the place to who what where when with with which\nI'm In the army is so disgusting and there's no political ... with with the bill Clinton's victims because there were members of his own party\nAnd that's the sickness of all this and I think the senators and this whole process now have hurt the weapon use ah and I have to call it a weapon but the reality slap is to bring this up and and and call it out I mean a polo see\nSchumer I'm a turban and number of them wouldn't even take a call from ... a member of their own party\nYeah but it's a ... they had the chance to do that and and uh they didn't want to go there\nBecause they couldn't take the risk of offending people who believe bossy\nBut the fact of the matter is and I will say it again the Democrats don't care about sexual assault\nAs evidenced by your recitation of the facts of what happened to women who accused Bill Clinton they weren't destroyed and Hillary Clinton ran the unit that did the destroying it was called the ... rupture in June and it was Hillary in that seat right\nBob Menendez Democrat Senator ten void reelection Lee New Jersey was caught running around with one of his donors in the Dominican went under range women narrowly escaped conviction in a trial over campaign contributions Democrats don't care about this this was just\nA vehicle was just it was a Hail Mary it was a total surprise uh you\nName it it was just the vehicle they tried it with Clarence Thomas Anita Hill I got close so they wanted to relive history and try this again\nAh I don't think any of it ... was real when you look at the Democratic activists that were involved with balls e forward I think the whole thing was strategize\nNow it's interesting you bring up the Clintons grab audio soundbites ten and eleven Saturday Michael Smerconish has a show on CNN his guests was James Carville and James Carville as the guy in discussing Paula Jones during the Clinton years\nPaula Jones sued and Clinton for for a number of things and that's where Clinton got in trouble by some warning perjury or and lying under oath in a grand jury testimony lost his law license for a year\nAh it was James Carville said drag a dollar bill through a trailer park and you never know what you're going to get and here we are\nLBJ out your drag drag it out there trying to park and that it\nWas it a hundred dollar bill or dollar bill a hundred dollar bill\nAlright well anyway cargo still proud of the remark\n\nHere's the question what does it have been better for the GOP if Kavanaugh had failed because then the base wouldn't be so mad so ticked off they all come out the vote in November\nThat that's the money question and I just found myself today for the Democrats Kavanaugh's is worth a lot more alive than dead\nThis is not going to go away they're not going to stop doing stories on Kavanaugh that you know they're going to keep the front and center and he's not going to go away and head
