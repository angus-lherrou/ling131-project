first met Julie sweat Nick in Nineteen Ninety three of the Washington DC barred and your Wisconsin circle it was going away party for a TV anchor I left the party to go to a bar to buy a soda I haven't drunk alcohol since my Eighteenth birthday\nAs I sat alone at the end of the bar Julie approached me she was alone quite beautiful well dressed the no drinking and consequently my initial thought was she might might be a high in hooker call girl because of the time I weighed three hundred and fifty pounds so why would someone like her what ...\nWhat what someone like her up with someone like me I'd never been hit on with a bar on a bar before so he starts uh he's he ah he starts seeing\nI felt she only had interest in my three hundred and fifty pounds self because I was on television and well no and she he says he resisted having sex with her uh he was having marital difficulties during a conversation about our sexual preferences\nThings got derailed when Julie told me she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time in fact sometimes with several at one time she wanted to know that would be okay and our relationship\nI asked her if this was just the fantasy of her she responded that you first tried sex with multiple guys well in high school and still liked it from time to time\nShe brought it up because you wanted to know if I Would be interested in that so he's he sees what's going on here and he says uh I was that he has a new wife and I guess he's lost a lot of weight and all this\nI was deeply troubled and felt the moral dilemma do I reach out and

they haven't been they haven't even been prosecuting a lot of people for I missed the misdemeanors or ah or quote unquote minor felonies but they used to charge them for right like shoplifting you you

Springfield\nNewsroom the co host Jim should oh was asking their senior politics writer Harry engine about CNN polls on barrier Senate races that are within or close to the margin of error that question polls are tightening out there know the question was\nLike oh no Harry the polls are tightening oh my God you know what what what does that tell you what what [noise]\nWhat what what's going on\nHere we are so many races that are within the margin of error Missouri Nevada Tennessee Florida the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have the best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November\nBut it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls rough on what the Republican wave in the Senate and the house and if that not in the house\nRepublican away in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump means an impeachment of the Democrats get the house don't think so but if they do it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there\nBecause they would never vote to ah to convict if the Republicans hold the Senate or even swelled the ranks so the panic host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red white and\nBecause there was discussion of a blue wave being generic battled advantage for Democrats the you'll notice it tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans on that you know there's a lot of talk oh with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that my her Republican but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that we're seeing tightening in the house races\nI'm going to get a little aside observation about this but what did I tell ya these generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on this\nAnd back then\nYou know nine months ago the Democrats had a twelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave but yeah and that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning ... Congress began and it went all through the year\nDemocrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of 'em that Democrats once again broke away and all during it I your host have been doing this a long time said it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything\nMe remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check prior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I but I Know one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have and will fund we're going to watch a horse race had videotape of a horse race that nobody had seen it was not a big race is that allow the players to make friends leave that said why Andrews on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bets and battle ... starts to tape of the race and stops it but the first term it's OK layer bats Tony who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that check stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds at the final turned ballot checked stops the tape of horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional beds or get out of ones\nThey've made layers do what they do that much ... resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the ... there's no way\nAnybody could have known after first turn at the halfway point or at the final attorney who is gonna win yet look what you were doing you were making bad humor and guessing somebody you're probably were certain the bottom line is\nFinish you never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you it was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter halftime of third quarter finish\nDo your job same thing here holes in January in front of a November election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything they're interesting for\nThe media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome\nAppalled in July or August would not a contained any of the Kavanaugh news so how relevant couldn't have been answered none zilch zero not and so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or\nType thing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot\nThey've had this in in in the in the camp has been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the calendar play out now all of a sudden house races per tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nRed wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at\nAbout fine or turning take oh\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July\nOr August we don't know anything and we don't know anything now and we won't know anything until the day after election day or maybe later that night\nNow one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines snuck it in there I think you know there's a lot of talk right Kevin on this whole confirmation messed that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to\nBe some ladies and gentlemen I Am the reason he saying this\nAnd everybody else because of my viral production of last week that if the Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that production of mine went viral and Dr buys loved it\nThey love it when the leader of the G O P and their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I started predicting Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run with soundbites of me predicting an all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\nIt's just the exact opposite why all of this attention on Kavanaugh was a Republican is actually going to help them how can that be limited on just said they were gonna knows\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win you know there was a well like Kevin I'll go down that are really find them up that far but I Know the way you get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nIncluding winning the cabinet nominations now let's go to further news that buttresses some of this from the hill dot com red state

Trump being indicted they only hope they had was to drive public approval for Trump way down the twenties and be done with it what they're trying to do here is force Kavanaugh to resign\nFrom the

challenged\nHer allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her to be credible she's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge or\nShe is the accuser so the Republicans they've they they they played\nRight along and without a head ritual Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time we were all kind of curious what what the purpose was\nA all Trump is still is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there this is not mocking her\nAnd this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in\nObvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention of the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is it is not\nMocking Kristin ball the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people say look this is crazy rush makers last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump always eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that\nOut of the batter's box I have a name for this I call it pacing\nTrump woman necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers or in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far as to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later to be critical and to step away he said yeah I found her credible I've found\nAre compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense\nWe've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph experts and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did it gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\n\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... the ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say climate change very serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it\nThan will do the right to oh he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what do you think's really think\nIt's a pattern it's a technique is a trumped developed I don't even open developed or it's
