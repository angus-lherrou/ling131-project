longer than maybe forty five minutes or\nYou know an extended statement\nOnly recently started taking questions for the time what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocate that he wasn't just announcing that deal got done he was teaching why it was important including to the drive by media who for the most part\nAre clueless ah don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works and how the United states has been victimized over the course of a many many years because of\nAmerican leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies and Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets\nPicket there's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy and doesn't mean that because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not have ... on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trade works why it is important and how the United states was getting the shaft but more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other people about whom Washington thinks\nNot very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question that Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about and he got to run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has a chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good and you know teaching\nAs well as a noun Singh is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this cut that cut this reform that reform a lot of people didn't know what they were talking about I got scared to death\nAt lesson has been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us this kind of thinking we haven't seen we've seen thinking and but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nOr\nTo earn the respect of others it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump is turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the

letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it we're made to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet the woman had written the Washington\nPost she called at Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public\nSo people

it's fair\nIt starts button light and\nIt became obvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff\nThe other would have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers or Christine balls before he would see in a letter\nSo some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein\nAnd

those\nYears ago you can see yeah because she really knew how to make it look like that\nI don't think\nFor me I don't think any of this has been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus group that I think it's scripted\n\nAnd I just I because none of this past is any kind of a smell test anyway back to mark pencil very quickly\nAmericans believe her and both believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed according to a weekend harbored Harris Poll of thousand three hundred and thirty registered voters\nSixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent Republicans who are in a smart ones\nAre\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent thought\nKavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both for about ... if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible in fifty percent found him to be\n\nBut the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor instead the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh shut us down to the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent say rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the borders are told that the name ... witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation that ships from forty four percent of fifty seven percent in favor of confirmation meaning meaning the people\nIn this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there and when the pollsters told them\nThat in fact\nThe numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jump from forty to fifty seven percent and then up to sixty percent\nIn a hypothetical question if the FBI after a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story and they've already done that but now we've got combing entering the picture\nNow we've got to call me urging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI to been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this is a jet Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate it how're you doing\nSaying no problem and thanks for letting me be part of the excellent\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association\n[laughter] yeah I was thinking on that uh there's no better way to um motivate a group by attacking them in by attacking Kevin either basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base\nWe showed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm part of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are Democrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could\nAnd knowing the if we want to get our guy in there you know we're gonna have to show up and many germs are ... they're going to have an adverse effect that they keep the ...\nI've heard people say this I uh uh he he he Jason here thinks that all of this is going to backfire on the Democrats are motivate Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again for Trump and twenty twenty\nOr let's go to the audio soundbites on this Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a\nBoxing friends weekend on Saturday morning Rachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts is talking to CBS em political corresponded David Brody about all this\nAnd she says all we know the Democrats already been really energized about them in terms I don't know how much more energized they could get but I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp from my reporting and found that the horrible evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's gonna be real tough for the Republicans actually of capital is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up at the coral evangelical base in the ... I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so\nI think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow look you can't blame David Brody for being fifty percent of informed because\nI I pulled back that\nOriginal production after it had gone viral all over the drive\nBy media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican doom they can't help themselves they got to put her own\nBut in the media Rush Limbaugh\nSays Republicans are going to lose ... capital not confirmed\nThat production was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved if Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but\nOnce this began to unfold\nI retracted that production and said it could end up being the opposite here but of course that production didn't go viral and I want to Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more\nA bite on this is a CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard Andrew Edgar about me\nThere's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get out from all over to the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not have it I got through I think this whole situation is really fired up Republican voters\nBy six\nWeeks away\nFrom the news radio five sixty to vote and they try and ...

trade deal eliminating NAFTA getting rid of it brand new trade deal the drive buyers were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh which meant they ask questions about capital and Trump after\nMaking sure enough time was spent on NAFTA started entertaining the are the questions and what we had one true good four of them here\nAnd here is a Trump ... this is this is not actually in response to a question he's just riffing here during the\nCeremony talking about the uh mid term election fake news Kavanaugh things\nWe have Senate races that weren't even in play six months ago as you know there are a lot of repression polls polls that are on very accurate we had areas and we had congressional seats to\nWhere I Know it's going to be a positive outcome\nBut you look at what's going on and it doesn't seem to be broadcast that way but I certainly had that with my election\nThey were telling me I was you know in trouble in certain states that end up winning like in a landslide and I knew I was going to win them in a landslide but they wouldn't reported that way you know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a a Cecilia vague of ABC News the White House correspondents said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin\nWhat your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is a\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a change he's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma\nFor a man that's never had any accusation any you know how to best statement about him he's led I think he was number one in this class and yeah he was number one in his law school and yeah and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible [noise] so\nI Want the FBI this is now the seventh investigation so it's not like they you know just starting I Want them to do a very comprehensive investigation\nLet me explain that answer it let me let me these soundbites and got to be yeah number thirty coming okay [noise] ... this\nWhole FBI investigation started everybody knows we we heard flake\nDemand a week for his vote one week\nSo that's how the committee vote in\nEleven to pen and paper Kavanaugh with the provides though that flight was not gonna vote well I'm a floor vote for final confirmation silly FBI that's been at least another week looking into this\nSo that NBC runs a story out of nowhere fake news claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI was a set up it was a it was a trap\nThey lay in a trap NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI's go because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump who's had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI has been doing his level best to get Donald Trump thrown out off Tom how Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\n\nSo Trump ... I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at\nOh OK thank you Mr ... needs to go to waste is going to go to waste some of the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out\nHe's not limiting the scope NBC is why course their ally\nAnd it was set up\nAnd so now it's out there that we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow\nBut then the question becomes what to do with that if they asked me I just finished talking to everybody I talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on it\nWill just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this was all accurate\nAnd the Democrats are but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged and they knew what was going to be rigged and they're going to demand even more\nTime to fix the fact that it was read they're going to do that anyway they're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday\nIt won't be long besides Trump said he's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping no it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to find on those labels I\nWent to the response as well they found nothing you know hundred thousand or more Hillary emails and a couple of days\n...\nFrom the news radio five sixty W.
