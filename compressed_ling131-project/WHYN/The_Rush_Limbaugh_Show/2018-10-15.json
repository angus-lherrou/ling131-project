[noise] that's good that's good to know the top one percent of earners\nPaid a greater share of individual income taxes thirty seven point three percent truck than the bottom Ninety percent combined at thirty point five\nYeah and ... and in particular then if you stretch that out the top three percent a of individual fires\nPaid more than the entire Ninety seven percent combined while they paid you know fifty percent more effectively it's it's it's rather crazy when you look at it here\nI'm just how much the top one percent and top point one and so on pay the big reason why is because there's such a great wealth disparity in income disparity between them has a ... out there is half the population pays no income tax rate yes exactly um and this isn't changing anytime soon\nNo probably not what what about if wages go up right there if if all of a sudden the guy making forty grand a year as making sixty Seventy he's just start paying some taxes\nSo the the key thing those are those wages for the average person going to go up faster than they do for people at the top and and if they if wages go up\nWhen I say I think you might actually see\nIt I I for the first time in in probably thirty thirty five years I think you are going to see higher wage increases for service provider people that actually do things as opposed to for paper pushers 'cause\nThe the the the investment bankers and the financial sector has been making a fortune for Thirty years I think that's about to change I think it is our line\nIs I think the the need to get things done right people when you look at your high school graduating class how many of them went in to become electricians plumbers and carpenters not a ton probably negatively about your ... how about you\nKnow even though I'm not a lot I'll tell you what so my my second cousin who lives out in Michigan mhm she's seven sixteen or Seventeen years old now she can become a welder no couldn't be like I heard it a couple of weeks ago and I was I'm like oh that's awesome\nThey know my my point is\nWe we have this in a large gap\nWhere people didn't go into trades and physical work I think now we've reached the tipping point where those physical workers whether you're UPS drive or whether you're a welder a carpenter electrician or a plumber you're going to say hey if you want me to show up I'm not showing up for twenty thirty forty bucks an hour it's gonna be sixty is going to be eighty it's going to be a hundred\nBucks an hour I agree on that but I also think that the people at the top and they're not going to see themselves making less all of a sudden\nOn a road to basis I think they're ready to increase will slow compared to the bottom the bottom fifty percent I think the the masses just because of demographics in demand I think it's going to change\nThe whole generation you guys you you're like when you went to high school was there did you take shop class did you learn how to wire or do lexical were no work in a car and hotter those classes there was a car class available and there was like would shop and stuff but I didn't do that\nI did watch out for two years actually yeah I wasn't very good at it but I did it will never be a carpenter my point is when you need to hire a carpenter your and pay for it I agree I just I I don't see anything that changes that slows down you know overall growth of the top end in the long like I I just I I don't see it like what what changes there\nI think the change isn't so much on the top and\nSlowing as it is the bottom in rate rise which has the same that affect it does so if if topping ... let's say ... wage growth the top one percent it's been growing at five percent then that means\nThe the the workers that I'm referring to skilled trades people I think you're going to see them growing at ten percent or more rapid rate do because there aren't enough of the ... you try hiring some tried getting electrician to come up to your house so it's it's tough though if if if you can find\nIt it's two hundred and fifty bucks for basic service called where they're in and out in twenty minutes yeah you're you're you're is just the way it is yeah it's\nI I I agree on all that I just I in this world today I don't see things changing that quickly on the top and though and that's that's the thing is I I still see the top and the rising quickly and I do\nDoesn't do that although we do a San jose Rodriguez and she was equally as perplexed last night could not get over the fact\nHow hostile Trump was to our European your union allies news even hostility I mean there's so many teachable moments of the thing I've read the transcripts that's I Know what I'm discussing I haven't heard of but we're going to listen to these\nUh together but back to back to focus on us now Jim Messina\nThe Obama campaign very disappointed that she would try to steal the news cycle this close to the election\nAnd then not that he says\nThey have to win the house and Senate to save America no they have to win the house and Senate to transform and change America against the will of the American people what the Democrats in the American left I Want to do to America is not what most Americans want America to be\n\nThey don't care about that they are willing to force\nWhat they think America should be America's transformation on everybody but thankfully they still have to win elections I still maintain that I don't know when but somewhere down the road they are going to realize that winning elections is the lone remaining obstacle\nTo them getting what they want and at some point they're going to suggest that elections are not worth it because they don't win and they'll come up with some kind of alternative\nI Know it sounds like a long shot but don't dumped me I Know these people but only a Democrat bugs\nWould think that report from scientists\nSaying that she might be one one thousand twenty fourth unity and would make their claim minority status about\nOne one thousand twenty fourth\nIn the\nElizabeth Warren possibly that that wouldn't be point zero nine but that's not even one tenth of one percent fault that's how little Indian heritage\nPocahontas has now scientists say that\nThe average European American is zero point eight team percent Native American zero point one eight she is point zero nine she is last Native American than the average European American is these are New York\nTimes numbers by the way Elizabeth Warren last Native American than the average European American and let's see what else we have here a than it than it does it Mollie Hemingway favorite part of Warren possibly being one one thousand twenty four Native American is\n... is that her twenty twenty campaign is rolling it out as if it's not a complete self own how do they think this was a good idea\nI'll tell you how they think it's a good idea they think they're naming Trump wouldn't they think they're embarrassing Trump remember Trump offered to donate a million dollars to focus on us as favorite\nCharity if she can prove that she were Native American so she's come out today and she is according to her doctor and sciences has a horse she's established that she is\nNative American and now she's asking Trump\nTo pay off the the indigenous people circumcision for America group or whatever it is an effort indigenous peoples uh circumcision information of resource that or some such thing\nAnd if Trump gives Trump's denying that he made the pledge even though we [laughter] flat out denying it like ...\nOr ... you ever had sex with that woman not a single time ever and that's what Clinton was there I I Do you need to go back and look what I said I did not say that\nAt most Trump owns a ... one one thousand twenty fourth of one million I run the number he always maybe most of the thousand dollars if he's going to pay a percentage\nOf the million dollars that equals her percentage of Native American that means he will do just a little over a thousand dollars if he wants to pay it let's go to the audio soundbites we have we have Elizabeth Warren herself this morning\nAh let's see this is

much a celebrity focused ran against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comments on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is just another sample from last night Trump and Leslie stall\nIs it you know General Mattis said to you the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances is to prevent World War three no it's not true but frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you tend to try one more time\nOkay yeah I Know unless you're not to try it again [laughter] I Know and my answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but they have to pay their way I'm fully in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage of\nWhat general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you he's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way\nHe's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and put in for natural gas shipments\nInto Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice a sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO Trump already called her out on them\nFor doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the\nOf the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less ... trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can't sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got on the roster coming up probably do a he said something to her that is as as honest and true is anything he's ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he didn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerate in some of the things I Would tell them but my opinions of the media he said to her I had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest the media is until I ran for president\nI had no idea I being really serious with you he said\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York's by you know he made fun of him and they laugh but but he was a big get appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kind of like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised\nBy this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased\nAnd I can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but he knew\nBefore he ran for office and I think a lot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats that he hadn't thought of in ways you an idea but now since he

middle ground pregnant burners to read but we got to cut middle there isn't much to cut anymore\nWhen it comes to income taxes\nNow which small percentile of taxpayers also paid three percent or more\nIt's fourteen hundred taxpayers\nThe top point zero zero one percent the top one one hundredth of a person that for teen hundred taxpayers that\nGroup alone have free point two five percent of all tax is one thousand forty nine people as the exact number one thousand or fourteen hundred and forty but it'll all round that to fourteen hundred\nFor teen hungry tax payers paid more than the bottom Seventy percent in two thousand one in the bottom fifty percent pay nearly five percent the top\nOne thousand percent pay to point three so the burden of paying taxes is increasing on the rich\nNot decreasing\nIt is not true to say they are not paying their fair share\nNow this is as it's supposed to be by the way when there are marginal rate tax reductions when you reduce income tax rates you generate more tax revenue\nBecause people shelter last they avoid if if if if you tell people are going to be able to keep say Seventy cents of every dollar as opposed to keeping forty cents\nOr fifty cents of every dollar then they'll work much less hard at sheltering it and she'll be more inclined to ... plus you have more tax payers because all these people end up hiring more people as the economy grows so the fact that the rich are paying more\nIs actually part and parcel with the theories behind supply side economics supply side tax policy but the bottom line is\nDoes anybody think it's fair that's fourteen hundred people for\nGene hungry people out of three hundred and some odd million is it fair to fourteen hundred people one thousand four hundred people are paying more money in taxes than the bottom Seventy percent\nCombined and yet we never stop hearing how unfair\nIt\nRich or not paying their fair share it's a constant refrain and I doubt that it's ever gonna change because if you get the votes of all fourteen hundred people you're not gonna win anything you need the votes of the people in the bottom Seventy percent\nSo you need to pander to them you need to constantly tell them how they're getting ripped off you tell them how people aren't paying their fair share the left is very very good at this and what the lived ends up doing is telling people\nWere going to punish those rich we're going to punish them for you it's not fair didn't fair to have so much more money than yours is not fair to not paying your fair share and their

on the books but they didn't enforce that one for the launch that zero tolerance policy [noise]\nDeter families with children and then everybody decided and of course you don't want separation and

it gives her\nLook Elizabeth Warren is resurrecting the one drop rule or an anti bail them a a rule created by a southern plantation owners Democrats say if you have one drop of blood that was black you're black\nOr this was this is a grotesque cruel her her percentage is so small\nThey don't have ... excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now that that that if if you have one drop you can be called black\nWhat that's exactly right intersection analogy requires quantification yeah and so when we need to know how much of a percentage\nOf pressure you are versus oppressed this ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties used in Nazi Germany against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is about her future run she needs to tell her base I'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of across or to\n[noise] would you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist activists concept that I find that most people to whom I mentioned that have no idea what it is how would you define that\nLet glad to thanks for the opportunity to\nDo so much more than welcome that's on a good host I have ever that no one knew thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection out it comes straight out of Marxism march said that at every one is either on oppressor or oppressed they're either bourgeois or Pearl a target\nAt its later it's now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare ... so what you are how oppressed and how much of an approach where you are it's called intersection nowadays because instead\nOf just being one camp or the other it spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's it intersection out it'll be for me\nGreat honor to wash your you're talking you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes any intersection adult eight actually has basically something that has been constructed by these marches\nJust saying that all of these different leftist organizations meet somewhere they all intersect with each other the feminist taboo this strain about them that that that uh\nUh cohabitation with that with militant Islamic lists that than with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people intersect is where they unified\nWell yes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those\nAnd they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nOf course this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops ... absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ship has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression to speak their language\nSo she is saying that she is an old press she's arrested him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know if I could\nRight you know I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you've never seen me but believe me I'm white however what I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa\nWell that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professor shift in African American studies but I have what is that almost eight times more a sub Saharan African black heritage and me and she does Native American just\nPray just submitted sub Saharan is not automatically quote unquote black\nWell that that's right in in this instance because we've identified the ancestor\nFor the Afrikaners are not black\nUh I well I I I understand what you're saying I Am referring to black skin okay All right\nI just wanted to ... because a sub Saharan this is somebody what ... what is it what it was it and then you start talking the sub continent than some people really get confused you're jumping from from India or overt sub Saharan Africa is below the Saharan desert\nOr which is where most of the population of Africa is most there is some north of this arid desert as well and I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this\nAll of that not withstanding the accuracy of it not withstanding the left
