Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people in some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot viewers is going to take action except that there is\nCrackpot CNN viewers shut up a Republican baseball practice crackpot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\n\nWe have an example after example of attempted violence against conservatives and right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places and these are genuinely threatening people\n\nAnd they are confronting people and demanding that they leave\n\nAnd and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump has Raj ... was Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insanity is creating all that so it's it's a one way street with these people\n\n... I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way CNN starts\nThis with their unfair bias coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it and ... the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure that people will see in her find people's data that Trump fires back at them\n\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at a at a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless lay as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots at us and our issues they have lied about the misstated the miss characterize them they attempted to impugn the character in honor of conservative\nPeople spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun and a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our policy because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\n\nSo we talk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump wouldn't do that to anybody else comes down to ...\n\nA lot of people separate Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply I Am not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and hide judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is ... perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it they're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the aisle act\nAnd then there's this demand that they have for insulation\n\nAnd to be exam from having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this is Dan I mean if you if you wanted to decorate\nIn dress up a van that says notice me and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are\nA Trump supporter who is unstable and a little over the top or major over to stop this is what you would do\n\nSo my two cents for now here's President Trump at the White House today\nAs he convened a\nMeeting black Leadership Conference a young black leaders from all over the country this has not been done before in in this in this manner uh [noise] and he's talking about the rest in these bombs here\nDriven over the edge by Trump doing it for two reasons one they're going to consider him a total fraud\nThat he's calling for unity\nYou're white you weren't just going to happen maybe before this program is over there is going to be a panel and see it on our pie MSNBC or some leftist on Fox in a call ... total front calling for unity\nWhen he is responsible for all of the chaos and\nDivision they will say that Trump was on believable a brazen\nFor talking about this is if he's not complicit they'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it\nRemember the ... the room the Limbaugh fear him was the process by which for rock Obama actually got to pretend and portrayed himself as\nInvolves getting any policy that was going wrong or any mistakes that were being made\nPositions herself as an outsider tackling whoever was screwing it up\n[noise] bring we'll see you again whether\nBy sixty\nWe buy it\nFrom the news radio five sixty W.
