Senate races it's interesting in the CNN polling data the generic ballot I I'm just going to tell you don't get dispirited by this because it's it's a if it's CNN but on the generic\nBallot in the CNN poll individual congressional races are tightening Republicans are gaining ground but in their generic Paul the Democrat advantages widening now to plus\nThirteen that I I just I maybe it's my desire maybe it's my hope but I just doesn't make any sense that the generic ballot would be plus at West the sample is so warped\nAnd so out of kilter and out of bounds\nIs that it makes sense that way I just I I find it really hard to believe that after the last two to four weeks a majority of Americans Thirteen percent want the Democrats to start taking over Congress the house representatives\nAnd I know what drives a lot of that is the formula\nThat the first midterm elections after a new president is sworn in the president's party takes it on the Jim this is standard operating procedure it's been proven in Ninety percent of all elections there are exceptions to it I think Nineteen Ninety six was an election certainly to the exception two thousand two as well\nBut I don't I don't look at what's going on here the last two weeks especially I and even the last four I don't see where there's this massive realization that the Democrats are they answered a what ails America\nNow the dry and buys want everybody to see it that way so they report it that way in their generic polled the Democrats have their back to a plus Thirteen\nMargin advantage but then you look at individual races and they're nowhere near a Democrat Thirteen points up [noise]\nAnd then it elsewhere in their poll Trump's approval rating has gone up since the Kavanaugh's confirmation fight came to a conclusion with independents disapproving of the Democrats' handling of the capital nomination by a twenty eight point margin\n\nEven though the Democrats on the surface would seem to have public opinion on their side\nOf the Washington Examiner just thirty six percent approved\nOf how they handle the nomination compared to fifty six percent who disapproved\nFurther breakdown finds that fifty eight percent of independents disapproved of the way Democrats handled everything compared to thirty percent who approved other\nIndependence also disapproved of Republicans handling of the matter but by a narrower fifty three of the thirty two percent [noise] so what does that mean independents disapproved of everybody did it you know being\n... [noise]\nI Can't prove anything all I have to go on\nA experience guided by intelligence and intelligence guided by experience an instinct I'd just like everybody believed this blue wave it doesn't matter where you go every story that drudge for example links\nLinks to on his page is a story of the Democrats with a massive landslide retaking the house of representatives and there are stories\nWhere Republicans supposedly thinking the same thing is going to happen or certainly you you've talked to swamp lowers your I mean you hear from a lot of Republicans who think their toast big march you do you think they're toast big margin to us in the house of representatives\nWell what I Know what what what what well yeah I'd like\nTo get an unusual polls visual nine percent of their nine seed advantage even after the worst happens of all that that's getting into the into the minutia I'm I'm just talking with over all national\nAttitude a and I look I'll be honest I'm always having to dial myself back um I I'm One of these people you probably are too I'm One of these people that they get everybody agreed with me we would have the best country in the history of country\nIf everybody looked at life the way I Do and looked at other people a way I Do it looked to issues of everybody looked at America the way I Do nobody would ever stop it\nAnd I'm sure you feel that way now and then but we have to temper that with reality this is a lot of loony tunes out they're incapable of seeing the country the way we do\nFor a host of reasons have you heard ladies and gentleman that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour bill and Hillary\nWon again in want to get in on all of this Trump action now I I'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party tried this Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign\nAnd do not dumped me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly\nActed on concerned on interested in and would always say a variation of you\nCan't judge voter interest on the basis of rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies he's Trump rallies or not tell other than it does it mean anything\nHe's or just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out of the country they don't like it's not that it not anywhere near representative of the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous as they could be and they were\n... the thing because there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to eat willing that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and those sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in two thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't draw flies to her book signing ceremony\nHillary Clinton couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes\nWithout some ain't coming out the proper up by the albums\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but they're human\nBeings in any kind any any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and that'd be\nThey have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the candidacy and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get in wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so the Trump in giant letters in the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought\nYou know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy to try to replicate this then I thought maybe in the show my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try it they've got to be able to show\nThe Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as\nMuch attention as Trump and draw up till now nobody\nOn the Democrats' side has even given it a prayer until the Clintons\nWire has this story Washington Power couple bill and Hillary Clinton announced yesterday

Philadelphia what's gonna happen rush they're all expecting a blue wave what happens if they lose it well let me share with you a headline\nFrom political Josh just today political story ready for this\nPolitical race ratings than GOP house is crumbling\nHere is the sub the headline Mr ...\nThere are now two hundred nine seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic column only nine shy of the two hundred eight team needed to win control this is what you were just telling me right and then you've got Republicans telling you that they think this is true\nSome I'm not asking for names but you've got some elected Republicans are people in their offices telling you they believe is\nOkay so political says the GOP house is crumbling it's falling apart there are\nTwo hundred nine seats firmly order wing\nDemocrat I guess this is according to polling David two hundred eight teams the number of seats you need\nFor the majority in the house or four hundred and thirty five total numbers there to eight teams the majority so\nNine seats firmly are leading Democrat I mean this\nIf the Democrats [laughter] nine\nSeats with this this\nIs a white by the Republican Party would have to be a party of for this to happen a party of Adolf Hitler's\nBritish and yet they believe it now\nFolks I don't have an insider information on this I don't know anybody with internal polling get I don't know I don't know beans I don't I don't really pay attention to that I never have but the people in Washington to live and die by this stuff I'm telling you\nIt is their blood and water and food polling data it's how they get through the day every day pulling anything\nAnd if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that to nine seats are leading their way and if there is no blue wave I don't think there's gonna be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrats' side of the Iowa or in the media\nTo hundred nine seats firmly or leaning\nIn the Democratic column let me ask you a question what could be causing this let's let's assume for a moment just as a as a hypothetical exercise let's assume this is true\nCan you tell me what it is anything one thing a series of things that have American voters\nSold sold ticked off at Republicans that they\nCannot wait to go out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the house what is what have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nation wide ... with the party\nNow the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump\nThat the people of this country despise Donald Trump\nAs a people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night through thousands sixteen they can't wait to get out there and showed their ... for Trump and the only way they can do it has to vote against Republicans\nAll right well as I say we're hypothetically pretending this is true what has Trump done to generate that kind\nOf ... other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what you want to do it\nAll started we said he separated families in the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching the other you know this this last week was premier week for all the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order in yeah law and order and us you'll be or something and and\nUh\nThe show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage\nAnd the FDU cops are running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order and you\nKnow officer you know\nOur government is separating the two words that are born or an eye on them\nAnd the cops we bought everything or wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this uh well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there are people ought to be more educated more informants smarter but that's gone we have replaced informed people educated people learn in people with Adam so load block cab idiots\nDuring Republican Presidents Day is nobody wanted to go to dinner 'cause they were so mad all the time but she apparently had the best dinner parties at her and Bradley's house\nAnd she was on Anderson Cooper twenty nine last night\nNow Sally Quinn alleges that former Texas Senator John Powell that's how his name was his name was John Tower he was a short little guy five four pockmarked face acne greasy hair and this guy was apparently [noise]\nDon Juan running around the Senate just better than everybody that got a nice way this guy had more allegations I literally\nI remember\nOne of these allegations all kinds of senators came forward to defend him while telling him he needed to resign one of them was a Sam Nunn of Georgia I'll never forget is attempt saving the reputation of John\nTower I knew John Powell\nI think John Tower actually was forced to resign and because of one of these things was only\n\nBut I'm not kidding I mean this this guy was a ...\nBy reputation\nCocoa get a picture of the guy who put him on put him on Rush Limbaugh got caught on trying to find one here to show your digital camera I mean we're not we're not talking about George Clooney here\n\nWell anyway Sally Quinn says that John Powell\nOnce assaulted her but she didn't come forward and here's what she says Anderson Cooper says look in your memoir you talk about an experience for a sitting Senator John Powell basically try to sexually assault you in the back of a tax\nFolks John Tower would never be in a taxi that would be such a demeaning kind of are to be in the Senate or you don't drive around and yellow cabs\n[noise] you have a car service a limo driver ... well anyway she search it happened in ...\nJohn Powell tried to sexually assault you in the back of the ... you didn't come forward them and you didn't come forward when the senator was nominated for ... that's what they nominated the guy for secretary of defense and that's when all this came out\nBut Sally Quinn didn't didn't Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didn't say anything\nDragnet rid of this nightclub and ordered brandy and wouldn't let go of me and finally I got away and rat out and gotten a cab and he\nCame out jumped in the cabin jumped on top of me\nAnd basically tried to assault me and the poor cab driver was desperate 'cause I was screaming and pounding Adam senator stop and I was living at Fort Myer uh Virginia where my father was station he was in general and the army at the time and a cab driver was going about Ninety miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the car than\nSending screech to a halt in front of our quarters and I think then tower got scared because\nHe thought maybe the general would come out with a shotgun\nBut I went in the house that night I cried all night long I was absolutely traumatized I never told my parents are bearing\nUntil much later several years later because I was so ashamed and so guilty\nSo Sally Quinn assaulted by John Tower um but\nBut you know she is going on here yeah there's one more bite we got Times Square here here's another reason why number forty three when I\nThink about it I thought I'm so glad I

base Andrews near Washington and deported immediately for an Oval Office meeting with President Trump Fox's Garrett ... at the White House\nWhite women all white women or women went for me\nWhite women went for Trump and look white women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now\nThe white vote has only then won twice that of last sixty years my husband being one of the two Lyndon Johnson being so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment to white women vote Republican and not for me but it is what it is\nAnd they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled andme swerved in to a truth\nExcept for a very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination\nThe Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circles there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting them white married suburban women had been rejecting them this is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe left as as it started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged\nInto so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three through Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way\nAnd there were things they had to do to become citizens they have to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America\nOn a test and they had to swear and pledge loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity\nThe Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans and they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell\nNineteen sixty five us when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course went to once that happened illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way\nAnd\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries but Democrats\nRealized they could only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted it here to Christian I'm a poor up CNN it never occurred to them to change their policies what they had to do in order to attract white voters\nWhat they had to do\nChange America so back to Hillary she said what was\nStarting last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court\nAnd that troubles me greatly Christie on I'm On board it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking at\nThe judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation\nSomehow become law in America\nThat's why they want the courts if you want to really get frustrated you've heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people\nBut stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal the steak\nEvery liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed liberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass\nPopular the only way that we have bastard\nIce pop culture the laws of the reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret\nThem and then pronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most thoroughly example of this but there are countless others the simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been capable of winning legislation\nTo implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts to the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says\nThat what happened in the White House the other night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional ...\n... is not by you in fact to\nHillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\nRich and poor did you see any way even a conservative state college when I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we have political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability arrest you for listening to one another working on our differences\nBut that is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again miss characterizing that\nBlue in the face\nThat's what Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices\nDuring vacancies that happened in the last year of their term that's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it\nBut the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them\nAs they did Kavanaugh anyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time for instability it is it time for this kind of extremism because that's what we're up against Steve ...\nWho was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton that Republican baseball practice cannot believe that Bill Cassidy senator from Louisiana responded to Hillary at a time when the Republicans are being shot stabbed docks beaten\nRun out of restaurants and sent death threats Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more uncivil\nWhat an irresponsible statements every Democrats should announce they're not going to denounce or they privately publicly encourage written by applauded they supported that is who they are\nThis is the party by the way that has been railing against all this instability or I don't know how long this is why\nI look at average American voters paying attention to this and I don't understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democratic Party is doing how they're doing it\nI Know it happens but it's it's a mystery to me my hope is my faith is that this incivility this insanity this on the ...\nDemocrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats that the Kavanaugh effect pro Republican I Know that's real the polling data indicates that that's real if you want to believe polling data but we're never going to get a poll\nOf people who this approve of Democratic Party tactics and techniques that poll is never going to be run and if they did if somebody on the left did run that poll and the results came back then it was quite harmful of Democrats they wouldn't run the results\nThey would get hold of democratic leaders the media was look this is not working you guys you better get hold of your people in
