the vehicle that you want if you want to go off road completely off the grid\nI'm completely stock and be able to get through pretty much anything that you can throw at it\nThis is a vehicle that has excellent ground clearance excellent offered ... three\nUm it it got a set of really really be the opera acquired a front and rare locker disconnecting wave are like this is the top dog and that the price that you will be paying a fifty thousand dollars for a new deal with on\nThat but it is also very very good\n... let's talk about this being in its element first off road is there anything that this this core really struggles with off road is there anything that you know as you're putting it through its paces there and say gee that might have been too much for it\n[noise] um I have not come across anything that would be too much for it um I have taken it on the very\nFamous robot contracts with the vehicle is name or and normally you don't see doc vehicles on the contrary normally the thing with um you know thirty five thirty eight and higher and you'll see things with\nThick thick lips on it because it's very very difficult you're basically going over I'm older it's not that it's rock and older\nUm and we were able to take stock river con\nOver this I mean it well going it was able to do it um I just took it seven days off road I'm from Lake Tahoe down to the Mexican border

have\nAny real problem that did not result from driver error I mean I I Will get second one in the but not\nNot doing the right thing um but I was able to solve it back to the low hearing and I'm of the root cause and and the seven day competence and we were the only we were the top vehicle we won the competition in about stock vehicle we were the first the ethical when that was not modified\nUm so if I were to get a call for this on the apocalypse it is going to be at the ...\nWhich is great but what if ... apocalypse doesn't actually happen what what what was going really on the road because well it might happen eventually but today and tomorrow I don't see zombie so how's this thing hold up on the road [laughter] I Love your positive\nOutlook I'm Still\nIn coming in two days all bets are off them though [laughter]\nOn this thing does have solid act in the front and in the rear and that can cause a\nIt can cause it to write a little bit rough on the road and that has been true in the past and it is not the mood is writing vehicle I'm offered vehicle that could be an eye for that I Would say probably the ramp hundred or they sent me the are those are very very smooth on the pavement having said that\nWe I was able to cruise up and down from San Francisco to Los Angeles at about ... miles an hour and felt very very comfortable it cracked great even after driving off road on the contrary for two days or on the rebel rally for seven days\nThe thing you get it on the paper and it tracks very very straight it's not going to be a corner Carver this offensive very soft there's a lot of body role when you get in that part\nBut that is what makes it so great opera so there are you trade off in terms of even thriving but it still makes an excellent daily driver I Will say they're not allowed to store it inside you really have to ...\nWork hobbies and pockets to put your thing um and I had the SawStop which was fine in terms of noise it's a little bit noisier um but\nThe cold weather trying you a lift the back window take that back on and off the act that are your ... year that was a little hard when the weather got cold so I might go for the for the heart top even though it more difficult to take an on and off when you want to drive the thing without the top but overall like a hard time probably a better deal\nAre good I mean we've got to run but thanks for joining us and uh stay away from zombies All right\n[laughter] I Will do thank you guys\nAll right but in the hall from ... road show talking about the twenty eighth team jeep wrangler ruby call good call for good car for northern ...\nOh yeah I mean you can take that being just about again as as you said just about any really want you can think of stock one of those out there no problem yeah those are ah looks like they're foreign cars to drive Egypt or you know you know it is if you're not on a road I've I've rented them just a couple of times either you know when the beach places or are mountains\nMan they are fun to drive there we went out on a road if you're on a road ... group whatever okay but you just it's it's a blast to drive\nIs your financial situation better since the twenty sixteen election we asked that pool question all morning long\nFinal results are in eighty four point eight percent of our listeners say they're better off financially than they were just two years ago only Fifteen Percent saying no so it gives you an idea we had a lot of response to today's pull a dial up a hundred and eighty seven points\nYes and the five hundred is up twenty six points mass backs up forty two points we get a handle on the price of oil this was good news the stock market's up in the price of oil down forty eight cents a barrel at sixty seven eleven so barrel gold is turning down two dollars announced at twelve thirty two\nSilver's at fourteen sixty six years another important that ten year treasury note is trading at three eleven\nProceeding was paid advertisement by the financial exchange and does not reflect the views are opinions of his station its advertisers are I heard media\nMuch you can go to here listening dot com for them to turn the dictionary public service announcement to use I\nUse radio why should we be over whether to\nFly in and nobody ... joy in Springfield\nBecause what it shows is that whenever there is any kind of violence\nAny kind of uprising any kind of ... the first instinct of the drive by media has\nAnd not what I say drive by media mayors will be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way to link who ever committed to bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe so called conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump blame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump\nThe way I'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up with it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nJust say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passed a law anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up one is that\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world we're trying to take a to prevent a bunch of incompetence\nA bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system meanwhile\nObama is lying to everybody about it claiming that if they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not called out not reported and then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it\nOn substantive grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have where every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets\nIts why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words\nYou have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years\n[noise] excuse me then decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault of the political party or it's the fault of a president's and it's so predictable because they hate\nThe president will do and then they can to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up\nThis this anger and\nIf it were getting so far away from the notion that whoever did it\nIs the person that did it we're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives the media doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\n\nWell I've I for one am am fed up with it\nI Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event\nEven though whether we can even get away from it from the weather extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump because we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for deaths in print Domenico [noise]\nAnd then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked and we're assaulted for being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you\nBecause they politicized literally everything and you know what if I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is by your man to pay attention to it\nIt is my man to come here and pay attention to tell you what I think about how many people do you think are fed up with this by now\nYou would think this is going to affect the midterm elections Democrats in Libya I gotta I got a clue for ya neither of these events that you are hyping are going to ... change significantly the mid term elections as much as you would like them to and as much as you're trying to make them change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going to return to ratchet these two things\nUp and try to get people to somehow vote against Donald Trump may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\nNo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up into somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now I mean a ... do not know it from a exact hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans once this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up of being blamed\nThey're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed they're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tune it out anyway all of the mass shootings have cops\nBack during the Obama those and those were support it\nYou had the support do you have the support black lives matter they weren't condemned there weren't any consequences for that\nProtesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri and it literally tear up a town on why they create a lie about the shooter in that in that ... what the Mike Brown ... first name was\nHeld up a convenience store and salt or whatever they just totally make it up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming Donald Trump now\nIt it it it gets it gets to the point that if if the media wonders why they're in such ill distribute right now it's because of this\nNobody believes what'd you say nobody trusts what you're saying it's so obviously politically charged it's so obvious that you're you're passionate about\nThis is what you're going to do with it politically\nThe guy that shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh scroll hill section of ... I Know this place well I Lived there not swirl hill but I Know where it is\nThe guy that shot this place up Hey David Donald Trump Donald Trump was too big and Jewish supporter\nHis daughter converted to Judaism before marrying questionnaire he more into the American embassy to Jerusalem this guy thinks Trump is part of the sellout\nTo worldwide and Jewish people and yet the media is blaming company saying well a lot of that that Iraq and all that just that that that's just a disguise you know that that they that they just did that the cover up Trump's real anti Semitism\nDonald Trump's maybe one of the best friend was Israel and Israeli Jews have had in the in the oval office and I don't know how long remember the case\nOf\nWas it to David Koch David Koch of the Koch brothers they're re Wichita energy from and family\nAnd David Koch and his wife Julia donated won the five million dollars to some New York hospital the nurses association and other organizations at the hospital told the hospitals constantly except the donation\nBecause David Koch is nothing more than a yellow bellied white print believes racist and the only reason for his donation wants to cover his racism and hide it\nSo people didn't really see this is who the left is so they even reject acts of charity as ill motivated\nWhy does somebody thinks that way what wouldn't let those nurses think that way I submit to you that it is the drive by media\nI submit to you that it is their union leaders and maybe instructors teachers they had in school were not even ...\nFrom the news radio five sixty W.

which for supposedly witnesses camp even placed themselves at the place because the victim doesn't know where it happened to those when the when it happened but it becomes real and we've got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kavanaugh is supposed\nTo sit back and just take he's just she those are the old rules of Washington\nPeople under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not a Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you sit there and you take it and you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh\nDon't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court and you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy be it'll liked it and he's supposed to sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was weird and while his family was threatened them why his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just business just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except capitals wipe Israel\nAnd he's never supposed to want to get even he was never supposed to fight for him\nSo Trump ... not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing a year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up first today Steve thank you for calling hello\nHey rush pleasure to speak with you thank you sir\nAre probably the last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down to one thing that happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented\nAnd then you have but Mayor Bill Clinton was very very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need is more gun control I mean how many more things have to happen before they realized that more gun control markets are not putting someone with a gun that can stop it\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you are but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting\nWhatever get your mayor that change his mind about what he believes it gives you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about something much larger than that it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't ...\nIt's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that can't but other than that you got well freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] ah yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in east ... well we're all for freedom as we define that he mentioned this let's\nGo to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with the Trump himself this is this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked a\nOn Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint based business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by the unified them all the cotton joint base\nWhere multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's where Airforce one is parked at Fort Trump takes

first\nQuestion a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nGun laws [noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns\nThis guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focus on it because they think there is a bigger target and that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things an anti Semitism\nThey think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise and that tells you this guy's got loaded with guns why here's a

inconvenient truth and\nAnd started to preach on that and I and I just I couldn't take it anymore you know it it's not even my religion and\nNot worry that my limited by what was that rabbi conditioning was he was he suggesting that the congregation as Jews\nHad signed on to the Al Gore climate change premise that that was part of not not the Jewish faith but then if you didn't describe George ... maybe you wouldn't be welcome\nI don't think he when he when he was a fostering an atmosphere where you wouldn't be welcomed but I I think you know it's just the pilot association of everything right\nAbsolutely that wouldn't have happened in the entire time I grew up I mean part time I grew up with ... and maybe it's because I I mainly grew up in the military and I got my dad was an air force but there was never politics never came current events did but not politics\nLet me ask you this was when I may ask you this up in your opinion and you said you've got some experience with the Hollywood types in Europe ... ... opinion can liberal Druze be anti Semitic when it comes to when it comes to Israel\nThey when they did they probably wouldn't say that they were but they but they yeah I mean a lot of\nThem oh I Know they wouldn't say they were but couldn't couldn't he said that they were I mean because what I\nSay that yeah because a lot of a lot of a lot of them also would tell you that they don't even believe in God or racially Jewish but they don't they're not religiously Jewish which I also think is a load of well you know [laughter]\nI Know there's all kinds of young people justify their existence and all kinds of ways ...\nThey're willing but willing to claim the victim had but nothing else [noise] [laughter]\nWell the one of the reason I ask you that specific question was because many people do not understand how a liberal June was like the New York times ownership and editorial board can be so anti Israel when Israel is\nThis it it it it's just it's a Jewish state and yet there's there's so much anti Israeli sentiment among Jewish people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and do quite understand it\n'cause it's a ... because it's anti the religion it's not anti the race they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's it is a religion in time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from the religion I don't think he can and you know any any time\nYou're Jewish\nAnd you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liberal Israel comes out now with the disclaimer I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything is real feeling that it yeah that comes up and it's it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics is associated with with Israel is a ... 'cause if they're inside the religion that's big I mean the Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and the other branches how many\nDifferent flavors [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used I used to feel that way but I feel like it but yeah with a push toward atheist I mean you see that they're anti Christian too um I don't see them as necessarily\nBeing assuming Islam but I you know but I Do the if the if if I got this that's exactly right\nI was just wondering is this all headed this is all headed towards atheism an anti God that's exactly what is the unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes image judgmental isn't right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there's no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of one's X. men one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so how this of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nThe goals of liberalism to creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's any Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about is rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so it's been in Pittsburgh that it does it\nAdd to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\nUh it doesn't and I I don't I don't\nFeel like that there's a million people out there targeting a Jews in a way that they would want to go shoot up a thing that I I think that that these are isolated incidents in this country because of the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he ... he certainly wouldn't be facing the death\nPenalty anywhere else um I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish and I and I obviously don't think Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the mid term or anything silly like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people think and they were predominantly ... thank you thank you so much a\nRe July presents racial Thousand Oaks California [noise] um I don't think these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms [noise]\nA lot of people do a lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what do you think I'm wrong or you\nKnow I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like now after Caesar say a dare I say this\nYear I put my hands together and look to the lord and do I have is Cesar ... and his pipe bomb none of exploded\nWhat do you think the odds are that the Dr ... and the Democrats are thinking well I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember an even Trump alluded to the fact that\nStory was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that OK well there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat and then the second event happened on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people to politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American laughter people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people to politicize everything who look at both events through a political ...\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this was going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I\nBush Republican now he's gone off to the dark side on ABC\nI Would put specific responsibility on the president that he has an obligation to try to rid us of much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years is helps foment this\nOh yes he says oh Trump's falls all of this was Trump's fault\nAnd the media wants to be exempted from any impact ... they they damn why don't want to think they influence opinion and shape the outcome of elections but\nThey don't want to be held any kind of responsible for what people do\nThe same time it seems in Congress to me here when they when they get called up\nOn this they deny it this is a montage Tom boss search who a former national security adviser and Stephanopoulos and\nMary Jordan the Washington Post I Want them to be calm but I don't think that the American viewers are looking at in terms of murder\nAnd he also has a lot of the reason the murder\nYou know here's what I said ... yeah he is responsible for fomenting using rhetoric that causes people to feel like that is normal life\nSo when ... calls them out oh yeah I don't think Trump responsible for a ... looking at him as a murder we didn't say there's no well we didn't see that Matthew Dowd but he is responsible for his own for the rhetoric that led to do murder\n[laughter]\nNo they are so they they when when they're when they're\nBringing

GOP that's a story about the synagogue\n[noise] ABC Trump at the center of all the political violence right now something they cannot be established something they cannot be proven but yet there it is reported\nAs fact gleefully I might add\nSo now we have a a tweet from Max Boot [noise] you don't I don't know what happened to Max Boot Max Boot used to be a\nColumnist a reporter for the wall Street Journal is the international\nPolitical expert at what have you\nAnd I used to think of the guy that was a conservative being a journal opinion writer and he would occasionally send me it was pieces in advance thinking I Would enjoy them but ever since Trump was elected he has\nGone off the reservation I'm going to the point that a lot of ... ... people asking what what what happened to Max Boot\n[noise] and now he's on CNN is often easy as he can get on that just ripping Trump a new one primarily from the standpoint that Trump's manners and his behavior and his ah come Portman just isn't president control and you know the usual complaints from the\nEstablishment Grasso he tweets out\nThere is partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum but know left wing outlets\nPropagate extremism as successfully are widely as conservative media do conservatives are being brainwashed in an echo chamber for rumor and conspiracy theory\n\nThis tweet is then replied to by John Harwood a former New York times Wall Street journal reporter now at CNBC who has never been anything other than and Wilbur ultra left his\nHeart would says Max Boot is one hundred percent correct most important extremism on the right has gotten baked into the entire movement and the G O P White House Congress Fox Limbaugh Breitbart seat pack I maintain peace you\nAs I said in my opening monologue the program today\nThat we get up every day and we see people and institutions that we admire and respect\nUnder attack I mean every day the left is politicizing everything including mass murder wherever it happens they are politicizing the whether Republicans\nHave been called murder is by the Democratic party and willing accomplices in the media Mr boats simply because we don't believe in the man made climate change folks\n[noise]\nMurderers Republicans have been called murderers for not supporting Obama's takeover of the American health care\nIndustry for the purposes of putting it under the auspices of government for the purposes of controlling the way people live\n[noise] [noise] [noise] ah\nPartisanship on both sides but know left wing outlets propagate extremism success nobody or why\nThe mainstream media is extremism if you ask me that's what they've become daily media\nReporting has become extremism it certainly isn't factual it certainly has an investment in the outcome of events and somehow we conservatives\nIn the media are far more successful\nIn propagating extremism and it you in this audience are being brainwashed in an echo chamber by rumor and conspiracy theory\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nWhich takes me to President Trump President Trump tweeted and I'm also mentioned in the\nFirst hour the Trump was elected to behave differently [noise] he was elected precisely because he is cut from a different cloth these people have never [laughter] look it's\nKinda understandable one sense I mean the guy goes down the elevator and talks about these hordes of illegal immigrants containing a people who are murderers and rapists and you just don't talk about them that way I mean nobody's supposed to talk about them that way but\nTrump dead and so they all start laughing they miss guy can't be serious he is not gonna last this campaign two weeks\nAnd then the first poll came out and they saw Trump waiting and their size is not going to laugh at it that Trump tapped\nSlowly but surely eliminating all of the other Republicans in the primary on all of them had this preferable a laid back a walk all over me attitude toward the left and Democrats that you want\nTrump kept eliminating them one by one by one with catchy nickname ... and so forth\nAnd they thought this is to sift it can't happen he's camped admitted he never going to survive in the Access Hollywood video convey thought that was it was over and nobody can survive but\nTrump survived it then they started the two years silent cool and that is the real reason for all of the suspicion about those of you on the left\nI'm going to tell you something Mr boat there is nothing that I or anybody else I Know in conservative media couldn't do that even approach is what the Obama FBI department of justice and intelligence community did and he was doing\nIn corrupting the highest levels of our government the express purpose of overturning at election I don't care how much power I think I've got I couldn't come close\nTo doing what was done and has been done the past two years including the Mueller investigation including the planning of out right lives\nFive times a day in media all over the country from anonymous people alleging that it was only a matter of time before proof the Trump pen colluded with Russia to steal the election for two years Mr boot\nFor two years with no evidence and everybody in on it knew there was no evidence everybody in on this new that there had not been any collusion they were hoping\n\nThey were hoping and they live with every day with the idea of going to wake up and the the smoking gun was going to fall into their lap but they knew\n\nThat there wasn't any collusion they knew they were trying to create some they knew what was going on\nThe FBI the D. O. J. they knew the tricks being played and they willingly supported those tricks they ignored the real collusion and rigging of elections on the part of a Hillary Clinton campaign the DNC I don't care what kind of power use think we've got over here and conservative media\nWe couldn't get anywhere I mean we couldn't we couldn't come close\n\nTo getting away with running any kind of a soft or a silent coup using the upper reaches of power at the department of justice\nAll Obama loyalists and Hillary loyalists we no way\nWe wouldn't have the power to plant spies in the campaign of a presidential campaign\nPain we oppose there is no way any of us\nCould write up a phony document purported to be real intelligence claiming the Hillary did despicable things on a bad in Moscow and go get a fire warrant to spy\nOn the Hillary can't there's no way any of us in the in the conservative media could come close to doing anything\nNow when they say that this neither my wife and rocket remember there ever recording this before even after the\nFarrah Khan turned my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we started this winter weather and I couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make that\nBecause of their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were um about armed security for these\nYou know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive may never worry about where is this\nGoing to end but if you if you do things and give people more safety more control if you give people a greater feeling of security that liberals can lay claim to then all of a sudden my fear where is it leading to where does it it's absurd what are you where's it hadn't\nYet my own thought is people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is where can we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place maybe in our school so that's obviously a very common target these days\nWell except the the the lapses you'll you we we have gun free zones in schools now you can't put guns in Arabic people get in with guns or the bad guys you people up [noise] um the left thinks that's the way it should be that if you put more guns in there and then somehow\nBring real new traffic and whether the\nRadio by sixty\nMiles\nFrom the news radio succeed the late ... demand indicted on heroin charges out of north Hampton fifty eight year old when the Wilmington in sixty four year olds Eugene Volokh are being charged with distribution of heroin\nThe indictment says the two men distributed to judge between may and August ... will take place\nIn West Hampton voters narrowly defeated a measure that would have allowed\nConstruction on a new public safety complex that far playing for a million dollar debt exclusion what have increased taxes by sixty nine dollars a year I mean shot in the leg on meeting house wrote and chicken the over the weekend police have released details and apple means that the man is alive in the investigation is continuing\nFrom the Adam ... veil roofing siding and windows weather center partly cloudy this afternoon high fifty four mostly clear skies tonight low thirty six partly cloudy tomorrow high fifty two for details on knees and other stories go to W.
