these these a mail order devices that have not exploded yet\nAnd bill hammer starts off I go into came in American editor what are you what you've been watching what you've been observing over the past six hours what are you see\nWhat I've observed a president who exhibiting leadership he condemned the attack he called for unity and then you had a response from the liberal media to then ... the president\nNation instead of blaming the president take a cue from the president\nDidn't leadership yesterday called for this country to come together instead of attacking one another with partisan politics time stand behind the president shameful I Will add that the New York times today tell us to publish an article that depicted the assassination and the president of the United states we're twenty four hours from these devices being delivered and how painful it the New York times\nI now I mentioned that through your toward the tail end of the hour they actually did they published a fiction piece\nBy a writer fantasizing over a secret service agent\nTending a Russian agent his gun to assassinate Donald Trump not the president not just the president I don't know named Donald Trump you've got a Russian agent trying to assassinate Trump his gun does that go off\nAnd so a nearby Secret Service agent hands the Russian assassin his gun sincere use mine the times runs this story and they excuses\nBy saying well we must publishing stories that really three I don't live with the Mueller investigation of Trump and\n... what does that got to do with Trump being assassinated anyway even if there was something to it which there's not and and then they're preaching to us why publishing that story they're preaching to everybody\nAbout civility and why you need to dial back what Donald Trump is saying and the Donald Trump needs to dial it back in Donald Trump's new security to Donald Trump didn't\nMeanwhile they can call him and not say they can call him Hitler are they going to lie about the things he says and does all day long with no recourse that's what Mac and then he's talking about here now isn't the Tonight Show on a top response\nI think that the president controlled himself has ... has rally that he was poking fun at the whole idea of oh I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be a presidential which is essentially saying to his audience you know what I'm thinking and then this morning he tweeted that it was CNN his fault which basically is a ... a woman gets actually thought that\nWas her fault for wearing a short skirt has been completely inappropriate saying that CNN was responsible for this because the fake news that they're spreading this is one fault but the arranged maniac that of sending those\nType of hope of all let me just add a van and that's what they want to be on the record of metal pipe bomb showed up and not culpable\nFor the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth CNN you had an anchor on that network endorsed the play in Central Park depicting the assassination and the president\nIs saying that the leader right\nNow you heard Natasha on a top there say you really you you want to be on the record saying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about her analogy that Trump blaming CNN is akin to because they got about ... like blaming a I'm a ... a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um the conversation continues you're now you're hearing a senior writer for Washington Free beacon Liz Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the ... than ... than a thousand four years he recently commended that Congress men about body slamming the reporter has called the ... the enemy of the people have to pay the legal fees for anyone who got in South Alabama\nLast what about the language is an outlet and over again that fat content as mild cut hair Brennan\nIn Santa Ana had a choice yesterday you saw the president come out saying this is abhorrent what America to stand for what ... what is the intention to chat with can blame this on the president can blame it on Sarah Sanders John Brennan echoing that how\nDoes that move forward forward at fighting they took the low road President Trump the highlights whatever and Clinton said last week we cannot have the ability\nWhy we cannot have civility [noise] so what you're heavier yet on a top actually trying to blame all of this on Trump and of course using this\nI'm from the high road and I'm I'm from uh I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the\nOn the left now before we go to the break\nWe're gonna we're gonna we're going to switch gears you're just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbites that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John\nCase it and he is\nBeing interviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN another matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter\nYou know if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's got a drug meal\nNow they're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go watch Phil Donahue used to do this all the time Phil Donahue was hosting the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he would be he started preaching about the accident of his birth you\nKnow I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it look different it's made for me and if they started at stolen the guilt that he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on the air that was\nTo watch other people in the world as do being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd\nIt may be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with\nThis or that matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world the answer the solution is to\nWell I don't even have enough ... wind whipping oversized packaging that doesn't make any sense to me and and I know some of the show that the distribution centers that makes sense I I I get I get some of them actually show up at the residents so you're going to think that\nOkay what what are you suggesting that what are you suggesting happen\nI think I'm from I'm Sorry that I just I mean you know workers are trained to look for the trees are you looking packages cheesy it's a joke I mean it looks like a joke even if I can see there's something in there and if you look at your draft you don't you think that after going\nNow wait a minute see this I'm Glad I'm Glad you brought this up I I
