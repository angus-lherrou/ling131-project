upheaval\nAnd he's also the story of how one man got entangled in a Saudi ruling family the operates like the mafia and once you join it's for life and if you tried to leave you become disposable\nSo what this piece is going to make the point this is going to make is like a show that he's not a distant\nAnd removed commentator journalist writing about the Saudi kingdom from afar he used to be part of it is not\nWell the ... ed ... show was very\nVery tight with the royal family I don't know about blood lines but\nHe was you don't you don't you're\nNot allowed to become ad men to show veep and acquired that much wealth particularly running guns in arms with out being tight with the royal family Jamal ... cousin\nOf adding them to show you this piece makes it clear as you'll hear in a moment that Jamal ... at one time and his wife at one point was very very tight with the ruling family\nThe royal family was in the regime but\n\nIt's not just wrong but distracts us from understanding what this incident tells us about the internal power dynamics of a kingdom\nGoing through an unprecedented period above people if the story of\nHow one man's gotten tangled in the Saudi ruling family the operates like the mafia once you join it's for life\nIf you try to leave you become disposable in truth\n... never had much time or interest in western style pluralistic democracy in the seventies he joined the Muslim Brotherhood which exists to reduce the Islamic world of western influence\nNow that right there will provide all\nOf us the first source of serious conflict\nBetween ... and the current Saudi ruling royal family\nAnd now it made it even easier check out our new no tool cellular shades the first and only shades\nInstalled without any screws or tools\nThe Saudis are trying to make the case to what happened to jump off the show was uh some some rogue\nEvent and it off it's not not when you send Fifteen people now there's one other thing about this box that uh the media in the United states is trying to say try to report\nThey're trying to say that there is recorded evidence of the interrogation and murder because your mouth to show he was wearing an apple ...\nHis fiance was outside in the family says Dan she had his iPhone in the family sedan she had instructions to call a man I've got his name here when I go to Bob and we'll give it up she had instructions to call somebody didn't come back out he was going to get\nYou know divorce officially recognized sort of get married her fiance that it's waiting outside the family says Dan\nAnd she had instructions to identify mutual friend if he didn't emerge meaning he thought\nHe was lord and airy bought something\nCould happen are reporting that his ... was recording everything\nThat happened functions not possible in the first place an apple watch is a slave to the phone\nAnd\nApple does him that even if if we had a new watch the series for what you didn't because it hasn't been out long enough\nBut even if you get if he if he bought it in the United states and had it it's still not capable of L T E operation in Turkey apple has not yet brought\nLT each service to the to the I watch the apple watch in Turkey which means that there is no way his watch could have worked independently of his phone\nNow there is an app there are a number of apps\nOne of the best ones is called just press record and on your watch is just a giant red button you press it and it starts voice recording and it ends up saving the recording on your paired iPhone but the phone has to be within range\nAnd I'm I'm here to tell you with the fiance and the iPhone in the car outside of the ... there was no way\nYou know its its maximum twenty yards Bluetooth that that connects watches to phones twenty yards twenty five hours I'm trying to think of the golf course when I lose the range of phone stops talking to the watch\nIt's maybe twenty or twenty five yards and most of which will be Seventy five feet on the tops on the outside sixty feet more like it there is no way his watch was recording anything and\nTransmitting it anywhere so there there can't be a recording of what happened to it besides that the Saudis would have seen the watched by taking it off\nA and they would have needed the fiance is iPhone to find out what was on it\nThe watch is still not an independent piece attack even watches that can operate under guilty they still need to be prepared to the phone there's not enough storage capacity on the watch distort the data of a recording\nIt doesn't start ... it can store I think up to a\nHundred songs maybe more now but for the most part that has to stream them it's not an independent device or the ... there probably is no evidence on the guys watch or even on the phone\n\nWell the [noise] except for his heartbeat stopping not even that the phone will still have to be at some point put back in range and connected to the fun to watch what needs to be back in close proximity to the phone for his heart rate data to show up on the phone\nIt's simply ... it's simply not possible what they're saying\nThe way they're saying it it's not possible to watch is not independently capable of doing what they're reporting it needs an iPhone and Android remain paired to the iPhone you can't be Morton\nWish I knew this exactly I'm I'm I Know when I lose my connection when I'm On the golf course and it's\n[noise] thirty yards Ninety feet at the tops tops and this guy had walls to deal with inside the consulate or he couldn't have been that close to the phone which is in the car the families to Dan\nWith the with the fiance now up [noise] I've got the audio here of James okay it's a secret audio taken up Claire McCaskill and her campaign aide Rob Mills I this is\nThis is important because this new is just not being reported in Missouri which is Claire McCaskill state it also happens to be my home state that what we did hear we went and we did a Google Search\nFor new ways of the secret video from project beret toss it Claire McCaskill and we wanted to see where this there are times news have been reported so we got Washington Times\nThe Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ me the Breitbart News in oak cure report back there is no way piece here why there is no New York times here\nThere's no St Louis Post Dispatch here there is no Saint Louis globe Democrat even though they know publisher and fifty years\nThere is no Saint Louis penny saver here there's no Saint Louis TV station manager I don't know about camel lights in St Louis but we're covering that by me doing it now um there's nothing in Yahoo News nothing not one drive\nBy or mainstream media outlets shows up in a Google knows search when you Google Claire McCaskill and project berets us every site running this\nWould be a conservative side or a conservative bloc there's not one mention of St Louis papers or TV stations here\nAnd what it basically is his McCaskill recorded on secret video admitting that she cannot tell Missouri voters and the truth what she really thinks about things like gun control because she might not get elected\nWe can't\nOpenly said that says whatever age we got to soundbites here the first one is McCaskill herself and her staff talking to the on identified project merit to us secret journalist and in this particular soundbites Senator McCaskill\nAre talking about and the and the project very top secret journalist are talking about the second amendment\nSaying we think we can actually see I don't think this is where you are a young\n\nMan [noise]\nWere you able to hear of that are you able to understand what she was being asked in her ... okay All right let me let me read to you because\nI couldn't if it were I Would not be able to make sense of that or even though I've got a direct audio ... that just sounded like noise to me but here's the transcript\nShe said if we have the kind of the year I think we might have any Democrats winning big we could actually be in a position we can get ... votes on this gun stuff on the floor and we can get sixty and McConnell knows he just doesn't want to put it on the floor because then it goes to the house\nAnd then it's awkward because all those house members are total NRA folks\nThe various times journalist so you wouldn't be on board with bump stock oh of course\n\nI voted for getting rid of ... ... what what about high capacity magazine I have voted for most of those they absolutely get rid of high capacity bags of what what about for an outright ban oh yeah and not right now oh yeah\nYou'll never hear Claire McCaskill campaign this way\nShe'll say in fact that she's very open to the idea of bump stocks yeah might have to get rid of everybody's on board with getting rid of bump stocks but start talking about limiting bags and banning things more on or you can't say might lose votes in the Boot Hill\nBut you know what she said about that she said if we can really sweep up in St Louis if we can clean up the story I could I could lose some votes in the booth feel\nSo you people in the Boot Hill in Missouri\nAnd that's where my mom when my mom was born in Arkansas but she grew up in Kennett, Missouri which is in the boot heel Missouri\nAnd I remember going there frequently as a kid in this little ... little towns down there and you people in the boat we own the Boot Hill of Missouri here on the ... I'd be ... every radio station worth its salt carries with broken I'm telling you Claire McCaskill senator Missouri is it going to lose some Boot Hill boats if we can clean up in St Louis\nNow St Louis is majority Democrat a heavily minority populated and she basically saying if I can sleep up with the African American vote in St Louis I ever really clean up get big turnout there then I can stand to lose some of the votes to Boot Hill\nWhen the temperature goes down demands for bowling branch flannel sheets goes up and quickly now these are the flannel edition of bowling branch luxury lined up sheets everything Bowman branch makes is with luxury in mind and it all starts with pure organic cotton\nThat's unique to bowl and branch it's why their products are so soft when they first arrived at your home and they get softer overtime\nNow these flannel sheets\nThey're already in high demand they sold out in a week's last year\nWhen we made mentioned so you you order them online and bought a brass dot com because like everything offered by bowl and branch they're only available on line at our website that ensures that you'll get the thirty nine guarantee with your purchase if you're not completely sold on the quality of luxury\nThat you're about to experience you can return them at the end of a month's time and got a full refund that's how confident bowling branch is\nWith all of their sheets go online it's bought a branch dot com or two elves on both B O L L and branch\nDot com used my name and you'll get fifty dollars off your first set of sheets\nAnd I think you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna be dazzled by the packaging and you're going to consider giving bees away as presents [noise] you don't want these sheets the flannel sheets and the standard sheets would cost you the same sheets\nAt a retail store would would be close to a thousand dollars is the same sheets that four or five star hotel luxury suite you use\nThat you get but these are two hundred and fifty Emma reason is they sell directly B you there's no middleman markup retail or an additional wholesale advertising promotion budgets\nAnd so they're able to sell these at a price point\nThat they consider to be much more reasonable that's why they'd be another reason for dealing on line as they want to have a personal relationship with every customer so it's bowling branch B O L L and branch\nDot com we still have a a number of things that struck this caravan from Honduras and Trump's threat to withdraw all a Honduras doesn't grab the caravan and order\nIt or to return back home so you sit tight uh hanging there'll be a brief time outcome I look at it as one of the thing I'm trying to remember what I've got here are probably two or three\nReveals new traffic and whether the\nRadio by six\nWeeks ...\nFrom the news radio five sixty ...

W H ... n\nGround zero week nights at ten on use radio five sixty WHYY handled [noise]\nBy and welcome back okay somebody asked me a good question about they watch the apple watch worn by July August Shelby rush what about why fight a good question\nThe way why fine on the apple\nWatch works is this and it's it's not as simple as you think I've learned all this by user experience\nThe the watch is always a slave to the phone so the the way it works your phone is with you and you're wearing a watch your watch is ... it's connectivity is determined by your phone so if your phone is using why fight that connect\nOr even an L. P. E. or cellular to connect your watch is connected to it by blow to if the\nTo get separated let's say your watch your your phone is on the wife network the watch is capable of live five but only if\nThe iPhone that it's paired June knows that wide network\nFor example when I'm at home uh I leave my phone in the library when I go walk the dogs the state has a massive yard so I'm Out of range so my phone is not with me but my watch connect via wife by\nBecause my phone is connected to wipe by on the watch learns it but I still I have to manually enter\nThe Y. fi password on my watch for it to work it did not automatically translate transmit the ah the password from the phone to watch it took\nMe a while to figure that amount of walking the dogs and the watches connecting on al ... I've got a wife ... state what the hell's going on so I checked and I found out that I had not edited the password for my wife I'm at work on my watch\nWhat I doubt that\nYour mouth to show these phone had why fi connection to the Saudi consulate\nIf it's password required and his wife is sitting outside with the phone she might be able to see the wife I network in there but if she doesn't know the password the phone's not going to connect to the Saudi wife I end up the phone doesn't connect you with the watch will not\nNow if he had a history of going into that consulate\nWith this phone and if one of the previous visit he had logged into their wife I network where the password then his watch would connect to be a wife fight if he had also entered the wife I network password on his watch that's if the phone is not\nNearby I just don't think any of that happened I don't know how proficient this guy was with tech\n... it is possible that his watch could have recorded everything\nOn why fight if he had actually answered the consulates why fi network password independently on his watch just because the the phone has has been logged on with the password does not mean to watch as\nEvery device connecting do uh well I find that were half to go through the password nothing is automatic now Apple's got to really simplified here you know you'll people may not notice it may have happened to you to know what I'm saying let's say that you are going over to uncle weeks house\nAnd uncles IQ as a wife I network and you're going over there and when you get the uncles weeks house you ask ... for the password to his wife you don't have to do that anymore all you have to do is make sure uncles IQ is in the room with you in whatever room you are in the house\nAnd then on your phone you go and turn on the wife I network find a wife I network at the minute you do that uncle leaks phone will get it alerts saying do you want to share your wife I network with others in your house and moguls equal click yes\nAnd that will send the password for his wife I network to your phone you are the guest and his will do this automatically that way hosts do not have to remember their passwords and do not have to give them the gas that happens automatically as an Iowa as a weapon\nYou should try to see if you don't notice\nIt's fascinating it's it's uh it's amazing how apple has continued to idiot proof and simplify all this\nBut I'm just telling you that ... would have had entered the wife I network password to the Saudi consulates ... on his watch even if it was already done on his phone even if needed to do it on his watch in order to activate the wife I network access it\nIf he done that if his watch worked on why fight in that conflict than he wanted to have been able to record everything that happened on the watch if he had done it on the map\n\nOne of the car had wife I Know it it it it it because he's ... pardon me out of range for it but but it would still need the password\nThey'll need\nA [noise] well I don't know if they would say no we're not I mean he's a he's a journalist up until this as it was probably will find empty okay who knows\nBut I doubt that his car had a wife or that would require you to have a hot spot\nFrom whatever cell carry over their offers them but even even if that were the case um\nLook the other example to try to explain this you're going to a city and you get in a car picks you up there a point or whatever and the car service has wife I it it it's just a hot spot\nThe driver gives you the password if you're not sure you log into it you're watching is not logging on to the network you're on your watch is connecting to the phone", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Springfield", "day": "16"}
