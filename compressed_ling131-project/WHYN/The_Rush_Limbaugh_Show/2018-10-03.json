going to go up\nYeah Tucker's mortgage rate is going to go up or you can adjust of or a mortgage so mine's going to go up to\nYou know what's interesting is even with the ten year moving into a higher yields recently to last week we had actually seen the dollar weakening the last week we find was you know moving back toward strength now\nOr if the dollar does continue to strengthen it does raise some question marks I think you know heading into next year um but it's you know we're pretty much the same level that we were out for the last four or five months right now but if we see you know five or six percent strength above this then I start to get a little concerned\nKind of strange to see the dollar strengthening in oil go up isn't it I mean you had a will now over Seventy five bucks a barrel will everybody says\nBut don't worry about it or don't worry about it I I I have to find something to worry about that can be plenty no [noise] no they just put it out there you know you got to oil treated Seventy five bucks a nobody's turn the heat on yet yeah when I go oh I have a story for you so [laughter]\nThe other day my or my mother in law uh\nShe uh decided to put the heat on like amber only watch the Denver ... why I was like oh I don't know it was like fifty degrees outside of a bundle up let's go [laughter] or else I Know [laughter] I don't know what you're saying but I was just like surprise in September as aggressive huh\nOh I'm just under other I'm\nShaking just thinking of the money that I Would spend if I did that [laughter]\nI Try to wait till November but it's

doesn't work that's got to be killing you I I Love to find a way to siphon heat from my neighbor if I could but I I just don't know how to do with\nWhat we do higher wages mean if you're running a dominoes franchise you're running McDonald's franchise I'm just thinking I McDonalds you know minimum wage there's what nine ten bucks an hour and you're a line cook there you're a cashier there\nAre you thinking to yourself why do I have to stay at McDonald's but I just go over to Amazon Amazon Amazon is hiring even Fifteen bucks an hour\nYou have a pulse you can get a job at Amazon yeah in in it\nA lot of restaurants waiver expense typically make up\nYou know between twenty five and thirty percent of the restaurant is bigger than the rent it is and so\nIf you see wages and again let's look at a company like McDonald's or see a lot of McDonalds jobs being posted for twelve Thirteen an hour ... chip you say okay if they need to get up to Fifteen right that means to twenty five to thirty percent bump in wages that you're seeing there in what that means all of a sudden that twenty five thirty percent of sales that that labor expense used to be\nIs now thirty to thirty five percent right so you got to raise prices question is do they raise prices by a corresponding you know five or ten percent to match that and if they do raise those prices do they still keep people coming in if the value isn't quite what it used to\nBe so what do you think do you think you start to see some of these lower end franchises go out of business like if you're running a dominoes do you just say out of the heck with it or ... are thinking about a subway cars subways labor intensive where you walk into one of the stores even a small store I have three or four workers there\nYeah it's I I don't know if you see like the the big names you're you're getting your dominoes of the world you're McDonald's of the world they're not going to go out of business because I think they have pricing power ... the ones that are a little bit more questionable that maybe don't necessarily\nDeliver the same kind of value ... ... what was going to have no problem refund customers at McDonalds\nYou haven't labor intensive again different legal to figure out how to do that robotically right that's a robo burrito robo burrito I've watched that know how many people it won't be fascinating when you when you go to a ... way though ... about how many different people you're working three three yeah\nThree you've got the person put it actually for in some cases you've got the person who first puts the tortilla down then you've got the person doing the meat and the other stuff then you usually have a glock and special person then you've got the cash register person\nI mean it's I mean it will be curious to see I think what you're going the end result will be most of these will stay in business prices will go up\nBut the workers if you go from ten bucks an hour\nTo Fifteen dollars an hour that's like fifty percent waging dirty bomb and then you're going from twenty grand a year to thirty but they spend here's the difference yesterday that that guy that makes goes who their wage goes from ten to Fifteen they spend every nickel of that five dollars more per hour that they're making\nIt will be good for the economy in the long run the other thing that ... in the short term ... the other thing that does is keep them on a lot of those workers that are at or near minimum wage are collecting an awful lot of benefits whether it's a food stamps where a housing assistance so by getting higher wages it reduces demands on those programs and actually cleans up things from a budget\nProspect great to see happening great great to see happening markets in record territory I mean

B. I. special agent her best friend for a wife\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a y detector tests in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean issued a statement the ABC\nI have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime\nI ... I think they've been caught big time and I'm Rachel Mitchell if I have the time I I've just got enough data on this right before the program again I didn't have time to assemble it but\nThe questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr Ford just so many lives that if it ever came became necessary to use them she could be destroyed the credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody is going to try to get past this\nOr through this with an out\nAnd he any challenging or Dr Ford because she's a eliciting such sympathy\nAnd one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech pattern I look I'm a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist\nVocal work\nA voice capabilities voice talents [noise] excuse me again art ... gotten it out there that time\nWe'll see are especially of mine I recognize speech patterns I Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this\nWell a voice actress in a highly\nDecided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter universe came down on this woman on mercilessly so we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her\nOr at least here\nFrom any further assaults taking place but here is what she posted and it is so spot on\nMerit anybody personal ... money about fat ... ball\nThat's how I found an hour it just the ... even ...

[noise]\nPosting those listen to radio talk show in the country and there's a\nBig\nLack of a reveal in the New York times tax story on Trump\nThe\nNew York times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that it's illegal that they have them\nObviously somebody up the IRS doesn't care I mean the left as infiltrated everything's obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants to the times has um that that but they've had them now for a year and note when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to maybe wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we've got Trump Arabic claiming mocking wealthy forty wasn't marketing or\n... I I understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God I don't know why president that he did it for some reason\nEverybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he set it\nTo everybody has to before\nThis is a investigated and put it but you can't run out there and start ripping on her even if it's deserve even if it's warranted last week you could not rip on Christine ball the board there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying through her teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joins of course I find compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so critical she never was but now she's not so credible all kinds of holes and Trump just pointed amount all Trump did is only the all the\nFlaws in her story which should have happened during the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart\nEspecially with that voice that she was affecting the go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing committee hearing her allegations would be challenged in tested they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the lies or the difference is\nThe prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's all they did Republican senators should have done that last week but they put\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump's writing shade for them and let them go out and rent them for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step in it\nIt may look like it but he doesn't but that's not the big take away the big takeaway for me as this one year the New York times and it's been investigating the trumps for forty year they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story\nGuess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump guess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat I often just say no that's not the word\nWhat one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint it was the sole reason the last one I didn't get their hands on Trump's tax returns\n\nRussia ah ten for bats yet they wanting Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said would prove Trump\nPolluted because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced\nWas true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian mommy\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\n\nThey're the ones that said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving that Trump was they put in storage\n\nTrump once it totally Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enable Trump to get rich\nActually a restaurant or something somebody said and James borrow things mostly are too young to remember\nA bottom line is I Know what had happened to a woman comes forward politically\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people in the audience it don't remember\nThe Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all of John's\nHey you never know what you got to know when you got to be able to print it by like what you're going to come up with what you're not going to you're going to come up by women like their hands are great\nBut it's not a Bill Clinton and that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only do they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down the memory hall\nNow I have a transcript an anti Kevin all protester with confronted or a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill\nAnd they don't want them to get into the hallways of the offices in Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin up where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there said it didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're gonna you're gonna believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there\nHer best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it or best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept the non corroborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer my question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated when you write that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation we're dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushback but it's a lost cause on the protestors\nProtestors not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCast that you know no would you like an uncorroborated charged destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk said the protesters oh no wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up\nCassidy you know it's unfair protests I Would fight and I would make sure women heard clearly you're okay for rapist goes on the Supreme Court Cathy and I'm not but then on the other\nAnd clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protest you know there is evidence look at a standard that many people are in jail for ...\nSo what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript something like this and help people understand that it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\nYou know I'm I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young Web behind the ears naive and the media would want to talk I thought there too they're really interested I Know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious\nAnd that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they were curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and\nThat's happened that somebody has to have to say rush probably by being met for\nCoast to coast are you with your story\nWHYY\nCox owner of blind stir dot com or as a family owned and operated

to impersonator he didn't do that see this is what's wrong Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have\nThese are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators heard timeline should have been challenged her allegations should have been challenged but they weren't the Democrats weren't going to the Democrats announced her and stayed at her\nTo be credible she's above and beyond reproach you cannot challenge or she is the accuser so the Republicans they they they they played ride along and without head Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe're all kind of curious what what the purpose was a\nAll Trump is still is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really goes wrong in this country and accuse her comes forward and you can't poke holes in obvious places\nYou can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story depending on the day she's telling it whatever it is it is not mocking\nChristine ball the Ford\nNow Trump has a lot of people saying well this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible and her testimony was compelling I have

and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth the other my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that that gives him credibility\nIt makes people kind of cock their head they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the media and the left the Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility later\nTo be critical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found are compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to heaven sent initially when he said last night at the rally why there would have been held

beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\n\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical of the step away it's a common technique he uses he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there have been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out above the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change her serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than moving to the right to oh so he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes up tells you when he thinks really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique if they trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans haven't Trump has Trump has a ...\nThat after he makes an initial statement on something that he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it\nI cannot tell you how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has an just continue to prosper in trying up I cannot tell you how blindly insane it has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this and pull it off Trump\nHas been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand they did was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nAnd Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors oh my God it was horrible we thought was a horrible everything is that is true it was not\nMocking her the actress video audio we played mocked both before Trump\nDidn't he just simply pushy she can't backup she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation for what she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter why have we\nGotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accused any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to work all women can join ... can you imagine if there was something going on there can you imagine of men organized for the express\nPurpose of destroying\nWomen you can't even imagine that can you\nCan't even imagine the organized movement the male version of me to\nWill rush or a million women or nor do their soups we'd do well yeah that does happen but that's not the point this is not about even Bannon set it this is not just about sexual abuse this is about Raul power this one\nAbout female rage because of things that have happened to them the leftist women and they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political move but I'm just asking you to think can you ever can you envision a movement of men\nIf if such a group existed and Oprah Winfrey had invited the leader on her show he'd been thrown off for the first ten minutes and have been ridiculed and made up for the rest of his life it could not happen\n\nWomen are a minority and supposedly even though they're not\nUh in numbers\nBut it's so out of balance all Trump did was say what everybody following this knows even the Democrats are Democrats know all kinds of holes in her story\n\nTrump doing what he's doing provides a lot to cover for a lot of people at one of the many reasons why he's needed\nTrump said guilty until proven innocent that's very dangerous\nRadio by

[noise]\n... and welcome back Rush Limbaugh the network books to your ear is the there's the James of the gym and guarantee quote from a national\nReview um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them\nUnder the world of politics mango I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together as one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bend is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that that are the individual that did something can be\nMade to pay a price for it\nThat's what the ah this this uh ... well\nMe too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street movement looking black lives matter take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody\nAnd instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democrats\nParty take up their cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democratic party realizes that they can combine all these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nInsult people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and under write them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and then of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tend to view that most people in our side have no idea how to deal with\nThis no idea whatsoever so we ended up and debates about whether boys want to pretend to be girl so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate that's sick\n... in in many not that specifically but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has\nBeen constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas and the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says\nThat Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who have been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter because it didn't happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching as it did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them\nIt's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white ... every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible in unfairness in biased in discrimination it racism all of this\nThe Democratic party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat Party is happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one\nAnd Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the raging angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on being fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on and she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites did the fact\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... for ... ... email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\nA survivor of men community now is on CNN\nAnd here it is that ... is is that they didn't even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been the target of attacks from Trump the target of attention from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target of attacks\nFrom Trump Trump didn't attack anybody told everybody who the guy and here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about\nDo you think that maybe the rosy for the other marking her like that because you get Collins and Murkowski it'd be the way they bowed miserable you think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was dating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was stating facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said has been\nPicked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits and outrageous\nExactly why can't challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have a gun ads to\nDo it Trump did it in yeah he's provide no little shade for some of these people to hide under\nAnd I'll guarantee they may be publicly saying I Wish you hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody he did it privately somebody has to say it\nIt's the freaking truth\nOkay not back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old ever him I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rush grade to speak to you again a right to have your back you\nGreat to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings\nI'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy that's into a girl but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women the pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them\nOr coming old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN where they are a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped her because he asked her for her phone number\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this hold me to\nGet away ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned women's studies on campus\nThe the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant capturing McKenna and this was back in the nineties she was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the oral sex is rape even the sex of marriage the women were lapping up\nAnd women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be at least you could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time for him\nThat the cause of what she's been taught and heard on the news and talking to her she made literally believe that men don't have no right to ask her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her that's my\nPoint she may really believe it\nIt knows well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you ever um [noise] uh you're right sex without consequences but you better not but\nThen they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to the right hook up and then they want to have abortions for free\nWhether it's their idea then everything's fine you know the look on the phone up at a ride by the way here's this you're also random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly include all women women all across\nAmerica who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think every time you're young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just get written permission for every move you might get notarized after the day\nYou're listening to Rush Limbaugh big
