Obama it's how Hillary Clinton the deplorable Z why Hillary Clinton can says well you know instability is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power they've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them they've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack\nPlans the various schemes to make you distrust\nAnd by the way Republicans in the past I'm kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to promise\nTo do this that and the other they get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media they've had Republicans who are elected properly intended David they've been able to persuade you that various Republican stink\nNot worth your support we've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to\nTheir Jim Acosta in Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside just roaring and cheering and having the best time they've had in a week\nOr longer and he can't stand it after all his hard work trying to get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you'll keep falling for the lies\nAnd you keep falling for the hate yeah you're the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday\nLate citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show at some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now it's just gone so far beyond you're not expecting the president to pet it anymore but what is troubling as to what behind it\nAnd see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now is as to who believes and he does it I think because it still works instill rile people up\nIt divides us horribly now or it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake out who himself has been rejected by people like you in Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling to look behind Trump to see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes this he does it I think because it's still\nWorks at sea so Trump Trump is he pretty smart Trump knows when he's Trump knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're ... and ... knows that you'll fall for anything and so Trump is ... is working is spending like magic on you\nAnd and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump or does he resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you are\nWhich takes me to what piece that I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurk brilliant brilliant brilliant professor at Yale his specialty is computer science\nBut we have cited his work countless times on this program over the past Twenty years we've even interviewed him for the ... letter way back when computer science professor at Yale\nChief scientist at detach L\nL C most recent book tides of mind and his piece yesterday the real reason they hate Trump and let me give you some pull quotes from his piece every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating\nIn for a reason most commentators forget to mention the Democrats have no issues the economy is booming America's international position is strong\nIn foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased print says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared\nIn contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist for future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to additional rains and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying an American life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less\nThis is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has nonetheless\nAs this ... says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though\nThe left only issue is we hate Trump this is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hate about America\nAnd hate America it does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftist I Know right to alert or at ... they do hate Trump they hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they have his blood as\nThey hate his certainty that America is exceptional they hate his mistrust of intellectual they hate his love of simple ideas that work\nThey hate his refusal to believe that men and women are inter changeable and worst of all she doesn't have any of the allergy except getting the job done his goals are to do the task\nBefore him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short\nDonald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself\nInvents and uses I'll tell you folks this is a heck of a paragraph in his instructive itself\nThey hate Trump's vulgarity and yet\nThey are the kings of vulgarity Democrat Party the American laughter synonymous with vulgarity but they sit there and hypocritical claimed to despise Trump's they hate that he won't walk away from a fight they take that he is one\nThey have he has certainty that America is decent than exceptional they hate certainty that's what\nI have found over the years that people that have had some serious problems with me I was able to boil it down they hated the fact I was so certain that I didn't have any doubts about what I Believe I've had so many people are just not right and everybody else that you you get some way to you know nobody can be that kind of an open I Am\nI Know your full of it I Know you're wrong and I know you haven't even thought halfway about this or you'd be doing the right thing\nThey can't stand that\nThey love equip vacation they love people see the both sides of the things they he reaching\nOut with the heart they hate certainty especially when the conflict\nWith their own now back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates him or because he's filthy rich always has been\nAnd unlike other rich man he reveled in well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever\nHe never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male\nWith ordinary mail proclivities guy wants women doesn't see the need to apologize for\nSometimes he's treated women disgraceful aid for which Americans left in Ryder shamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but go workers as my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the course most\nOf ... the average American Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents worry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it the difference between citizens who hate\nMr Trump and those who can live with him whether they love are merely tolerate him comes down to their views of the typical American the farmer\nFactory hand the auto mechanic machinist teamster shop owner clerk software engineer infantry men truck driver housewife\n[noise] stuff to do with them about this [noise]\nThis alert and there was one final point here he uh he observes that many left wing intellectuals are in fact counting on technology\nTo do away with these jobs that I just went through\nThat sustain all of those old fashioned truck drivers have people they're looking forward to your people being robotic ... out of jobs but he says they are laughing only widened the markets impossible to transport food and clothing\nOr hugged your wife or girl or a traveler ... with your best friend over the Internet you can't do many of these jobs over the Internet maybe that's obvious\nBut to be an intellectual means nothing is obvious Trump's no genius but if you master the obvious in ad commonsense during nine tenths of the way home\nScholarship is fine but the typical modern intellectual cheapens his learning with politics is proud to various teaching with a broken down to the left wing junk\nDavid Gardner computer science professor at Yale basically basically saying the real\nProblem a real problem is all you people voted for Trump you continue to ignore your betters\nYou're ignoring the Democrats are ignoring the never Trump or his you are ignoring the media or trying to warn you when you persist into the Trump rallies they can't stand it that's why they make up these stories about gigantic blue waves sweeping you out\nOf the ways sweeping your candidates out of the way they can't wait for you to accept their the ones that are losing elections Donald Trump was elected president by a significant electoral college margin they can't win these elections that they've been hoping and praying to win ever since all these special elections\nNow the midterms coming up we'll get other lying to themselves about the future\nAre going to win back control of the house or what are they going to do with it they're going to investigate Trump Nancy Pelosi can't help herself she's bragging talking about the subpoena power\nIs that really what the American people want they want Donald Trump than the people that work for him brought up under investigation for two years instead of real life on the ground improving the way it is\nIs this what the Democrats in media really think it's just what they're left wing candidate you really believe that the American people are so filled with a range Donald Trump and his administration they want all of them investigated they want all of them put in jail they want the truth to come out the\nTrump cheated against Hillary with Russia they're still obsessed with the stuff they're obsessed with the fact that this election was they're stolen from them and now it's time to make it All right and they are convinced you what Trump investigated to aunt there just to be tied to heaven persuade you to join them\nSo now you're part of the problem and so the American left in the media are actually trying to\nCreate a nation that consists of a majority of angry de range\nThree years ago making a murderer became less a TV show than a force\nOf nature and uncovered a grave injustice in the criminal justice was also completely dishonest and I would know I'm dead O'Donnell I covered this even Avery and Brendan Bessie trials and now they're making a murderer is back I Am too with part to overeat budding emerge\nMounting a murderer is now on the ... I heard radiolab just open the\nDot org this message is brought to you by America's family physicians\nThe bucks X and show week night starting at seven on news radio five sixty W. H. Y. N.\n[noise]\nYou're listening to Russia's week in review okay time now to get to the phones and once again I sincerely appreciate everybody holding on we're going to start in a viable Hi oh David Europe first that I hire\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir this morning I was listening to NPR\nAnd Steve a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call 'em all he said it was only a few thousand people and then\nI take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality saying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the order Johns and the ... making his eyes water\nSo they use the mob they don't want to say mark they use what whatever it is for them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people but it's good for them but when it's not when they want to use the humanitarian side it's such a disaster\nBut there's you know thousands of the line would only couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR is a great did you want to listen to NPR you want to know what the enemies doing or what they're up to you that for that day listening to NPR and they're trying to use the situation for whatever it means for them and that meant it they can\n[noise] that you know for we've got a bad we've got a a a a bad connection here uh\nAbout the only time I read the student NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said uh for the audience and and that happens when I get the soundbites on that\nMaybe once every two or three week uh but of course NPR's not going to call it a mob NPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people we're\nBeing led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemalans El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar torn\nPoverty and the violence and whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day citing believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human beings just it just have a decent life you know in in in in ... and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are bunch and mean spirited extremist cold hearted SOB want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nGot reporters embedded in there now when we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know and so base screwed Trump Trump's Hitler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this was a political movement it has been orchestrated an designed them as being paid for by some\nBody and it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\nOther ways this could be helpful to Democrats causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm a they're able to show that Trump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering and deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but the there is no political objective attached to this is absurd\n\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge ...\nRamos or whatever\nIt is it is what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell her tell her no but what is it\nUnivision right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter]\nThink of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws remembered the germs\nThen these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye of the problem\nAlthough Democrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats spoke asked if the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah\n[noise] what [noise]\nSo in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal they're Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this\nEven before the caravan most congressional Democrats or immigration as a loser for them\n\nA memo circulated among Democrats congressional offices in recent weeks said it is very difficult to win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most direct Kony in the Republican policies like family separation\nAnd deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polls to vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador what she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him\nBecause it's going to help him with immigration\nWell [noise] [noise]\n[noise] who did they think is behind this some of the stuff\nIn the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it when\nWhen you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are every day anyway\nWhether people show up in groups or two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left as in favor of letting them in\nAnother worried that this was going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\n\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense that because this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this book\nThey're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media the Democratic\nParty itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they bought\nThe Trump was gone you gotta put yourselves in their shoes every day they've gotten up for two years and I've read in the New York times how Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's the co loaded with ... is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mahler has been goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\n\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies get bigger they get happier they get more raucous the Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital of the thing is backfiring on them and they got ... out there promising subpoena power\nSaying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\n\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\n\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked its it's if it's getting back to the same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just\nFit to be tied over it they're at their wits candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance of Democrats win just to make themselves feel better about things but they really don't\nRush is always at work but he ivy never closes Fifteen hours\nA week here what is there not said it turns out alive and the liberal letter is a repository for when three hours is just not

them vote against them\nA public service announcement from me or host Rush Limbaugh and the ... of\nThe uh the bomb here in the bombs it didn't take long for Trump to be blamed former aides to Hillary Clinton blamed Trump and Republicans for these devices [noise] so I guess Trump and Jared Kushner had just got back from turkey after killing a shaggy right\nTo Trump and of course they're going to occur and kill showing and come back here and they start sending bombs to Democrats [noise]\nAn end to Hillary Clinton Philippe Reines\nSaid Mr Trump this is on this guy rains is is [noise]\nI mean the elevator doesn't go to the top floor like to say is an order of fries short of a Happy Meal why would someone smart enough to make\nFunctioning mail bombs actually believe they would be open to buy the Clinton or Obama or George Soros\n\nAnd ... and and so close to one of my ... and what kind of food do something like this\n\nIf a smart bomb maker [laughter] if somebody really really good at making bombs have left this much does he think this is going to help Republicans in the mid term elections this doesn't pass the smell test\n[noise]\nUm I actually think in all ... what's going on barring a the revelation of what really this is about if we ever learn that I think I'll just put it this way if you're a Democrat operative and you've watched everything blow up on your your watch cabinet blow up\nYou have watched um the effort to harass and bullied Jeff Flake and Susan Collins blow up on you\nIf all of these mobs of people crashing Republicans in airports than at restaurants at all that's blowing up on you and it is by the way it's not working\nWhat could have been the objective of that stuff what could be the objective of having a bunch of public mobs storm restaurants and harass\nAnd threaten and bully Republicans what could you be trying to ... what would be the Democrat objective there and I can tell you there's only one thing that really makes any sense\nTo show so much hatred for Trump to try to overwhelm the system with so much apparent hatred for Trump and Republicans that other people joined up other people decide they've got to join up and vote against Republicans do other words the politics of hate and anger\nAnd the attempt to spreading hate and anger because the Democrats have nothing else on which to run all they've got is we hate Trump Trump socks Trump's dangerous Trump's an embarrassment\nThat's all they've got and so if none of that work if all of that backfired and leave me here and has especially the Kevin on stuff that has blown up in their ... bad choice of words that has backfired\nOn them like you cannot believe\nSo what would you do you might want to do something to make it look like the insane lunatics are not just on your side you might want to do something to make it look likely insane lunatics are also on the Republican side disorder cancel out the impact\nOf lunacy on your side as average American voters perceive it okay let's get some of the\nElection analysis the midterms are Thirteen Days away two weeks ago from yesterday\nTom ... who was cofounded real clear politics\nAnd it is a it's a website that many political scientists political operatives a political experts cite constantly\nWhat what real clear politics does among many other things\nIs average all of the so called response civil polls out there into something called a real clear politics average of polls and political experts from across the ... site real clear politics and trusted as\nAn unassailable source so combat and co founder of this place was on ah the Fox\nBusiness Network today he said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point me it'd be building ... we'd be seeing the top\nOf it here and Tom Bevan sat in all of polling data that they have it real clear politics\nIt's not\nThere is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was coming it would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the Democrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no\nDemocrats pulling away\nAs what happened with a blue wave\nTrump's job approval is rising Democrats are in the advantage that themselves but they're not building on anything there's no way and that's gonna wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race\nReal battles hand to hand combat is how he described it he forecast that Democrats might\nWin the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races and the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three\nThat's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house\nThe range of the pick up according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Saturday anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five seats twenty five of them sort of two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races the G O P can hold the house\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and they went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away\nFor Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge\nLate surge and guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen Hillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up or at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys can miss late change the story written before\nThe bombs could it happen again it probably won't don't worry about Bloomberg says but according to court in ... they could go either direction Democrats could still win big or they could lose make it go and ... what what is all this decision all of a sudden versus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago holds\nCouldn't be missing GOP surge I don't know I don't doubt that it's true I'm just saying the media does this every election cycle they lie and misrepresent for nine months six months five months\nYou name it then when the polls have to be shown to be correct so they still have their reputation\nThe bucks ... weeknight starting at seven on news radio five sixty W. H. Y. N.\n[noise]\nYou're listening to Russia's week in review is a quick question seriously [noise]\nMany Republicans right now in the midst of this political campaigns on a two thousand sixty in terms of how many how many Republicans [noise] because they have the Clintons or Obama on their radar\n\nNo no I mean how how many are there are the Clintons an obstacle to the upcoming mid terms of the ... no ... is Obama an obstacle in the no I mean what the Clintons and Obama are not even on the radar except they are today\nI mean the Clintons announced yet this Clinton's announced this nationwide stadium tour third team locations stadium tour they're gonna charge admission for people to come in\nAnd spend some time listening to bill and Hillary reminisce and\nTalk about politics what\nWhat if there isn't a whole lot of interest in math [noise] what if a lot of people aren't yet\nBuying tickets\nI don't know that they're on sale with every venue yet but I mean the Clintons aren't anybody's radar right now\nI mean the closest that happens is you know when Trump goes to a rally and they start talking about the deep state in Hillary and her ... and the FBI trend the shaft Trump on his phony collusion story the lock her up lock her up but I mean the Clintons are not considered political opponents right now and Obama certainly is and\n\nI don't know I ... and and now with so many leftists tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred in so much anger their wife or the mirror here's not say that this is just to test\nIt it's just it's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is a we'll see we'll let time\nOn the phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Russia and within that there was a kid ah riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate thank\nYou very much rush you know if you're talking about this passing this now 'cause I'm I'm sure the drive by and on this will be that uh\nWe have a dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail\nYou know that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be owned by the media where do they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYou know that that information is not out there for the masses of pain you know quite being there was never any attempt for these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail and I don't know if it's right on me to point fingers and certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen\nWanted for them to be discovered the Democrat they've proven time and time again there's simply no load that they won't do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot
