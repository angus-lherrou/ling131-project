securities American companies are unaffiliated\nMarkets are still vote it'll throw I Want to keep you informed get our weekly market ... job of becoming a member of berries brigade financial exchange showed dot com and signed up today\n[noise]\n\n\nTime to talk of cars and we're joined now by\nAntwon Goodwin from seeing that road show here to talk about the twenty ninth teen Toyota Avalon Anton thanks for joining us today hey how's it going\nWe're doing well so I took a look at the apple and just because I always liked to you know look at the cars before we talk about him my first question is what happened to the front of this car because it kind of looks like a giant mouth driving down the road facing right at you what's what's your thought on the styling\nOr well the Evelyn front end is ridiculously aggressive this year I think that's the way it is making some large that's the kind of get away from the boring brand that sort of ... reputation that it had\nAnd it might have gone a tad bar on the Avalon if he if you look at it from that side from the rear maybe even from certain angle and kind of see what they're going for with McGrath admits but no one that I Know I really think that it worked out well for them\nSo let's get past kind of what the front end looks like a let's go first under the hood ... what what kind of engine do we have what what are we work with in terms of power there\nYou've got a couple of options the the main option for most people are going to be a three hundred work Howard of effects engine that actually feel really good in this car is going to be made it with a pretty smooth automatic transmission but if you are the kind of person who wants to go to the good you'll economy and you don't really care about having three hundred or our you could step down to\nAbout a two hundred horsepower a hybrid version and that's going to get you around forty three forty four miles per gallon so\nIf you're concerned with like a mood comfortable ride go hybrid if you're looking for something with more power or for passing the veep stakes is definitely a style it up and\nWhat about when when you get inside of this the Avalon is is you know Toyotas luxury cars that they make how close does it get to their brand elections in terms of overall quality and in the comfort that you can get from this\nWilliam period actually my favorite part of the a lot um it's actually in the limited trend where they've got really nice leather really nice details like pitching and stuff like that uh\nThe interior of the other line in my opinion a is about as good as what you're getting a Lexus yeah\nAnd so it kind of makes it a little bit of a toss up between whether you want to pay more for the Lakers ticket lightly better than finish a or if you're really happy with what I Would argue able to be called a very luxurious interior and you have a lot is that most of the building with over you can expect from a like this or something comparable but for a little less money\nWhat stands out as far as bells and whistles is there anything in particular that stands out as far as uh the technology that's available in this car\nWell the Avalon and make the um play of the state and then we standard though you're adapted cruise control your lane keeping hearing is this your blinds by monitoring all of that standard teachers for twenty nine the model year so\nYou don't have to pay extra to get any of those things anymore whereas some of the competition you have to check on like a few thousand dollar a safety package to get something like that so\nOut of the box you've got pretty much everything that you could want as far as a driver aid and comfort technology for long highway cruises are slugging through traffic um and the only thing that you really have to pay more for then would be nice or things like ... ...\n... what are we looking at in terms of cost on the novel on where do you start in how how can you end up\nAround thirty five for the based model which again they'll come with all of that state the technology and it's still a really nice looking car on the inside at the very least\nA top of the line you're looking around forty three depending on whether you go to the stakes are high right there in about the same range they've done an interesting thing where they kind of sport there trends though that you can either go forty or you can go luxurious than at the end of the day you don't end up paying too much more you just have to decide what are you want\nFor good Antwon we've got to run but thanks for joining us and we will catch up with you soon\nThat is Antwon Goodwin from seeing that road show talking about the twenty Nineteen Toyota apple pay forty grand for one of the ugliest cars on the road that is just sinful we have to log in am I wrong in that if it does not what good water grill I I looked at it but I'm a big mouth coming out is just an hideous\nIt is yeah can I go for my two cents on why they did it to stand out it's\nCheaper to build grilled than to build the do the bumper\nNor mine I Wonder if it improves like the the weight of a car which helps smile\nAnd I bet it's stuff like that that actually poison as well because it does not look good I'll tell you that no it was like you said it looks like an open mouth the rest of it like the rest of the car actually looks pretty nice but you see the front of it and you're like what's going on there is part of the ... did the bumper fall off like what\nWould happen to tough so that that's it's ... I don't I don't think we're going to see a lot of these on the road and you know the thing is people don't want to buy Sudan's and the first place like Sudan sales\nMuch as the Washington establishment would like to deny it much as they would like to change it it is still the issue that keeps Donald Trump in the forefront of his supporters minds\nSo I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this and here's what I have found today\nCNN is spending almost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on the show again they're not focusing on the care of him that tells\nMe that if the caravan weren't a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up and with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories it'd be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is\nAre they just want to come to America and that may yet happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show Gabe and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's let ... wife CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's were at this stage in the ah in his mid terms at the same point in his presidency after two years there just resigned themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody's ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting it was not born of any evidence there could be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet\nEverybody wants to rely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think it'll put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a microcosm\nOf what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening not seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what has been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop\nNow the Democrats if there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming it on Trump\nMaybe what they're hoping is a Trump\nActually won't do anything about it maybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard but not actually doing anything\nThey might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they've rattled Trump with their stories earlier this year about how he separated families aboard and how Trump didn't all white the narrative and didn't want it to last so he did what he could change it I\nI Do know this despite everything that you think you would know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans at look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in as elected still ...\nMayor ... you're about peace yes they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject of illegal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got to show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them in their not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya if Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what did you think that wouldn't do the Trump\nThere's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his do voters began to\nI don't no doubt is the right word but they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this\nCaravan is not going to get him if if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this the ... there's obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\nSomebody has to be making this cap and folks we're talking with we we've got how many two\nThousand miles stop and think of this\nFrom Honduras\nTo the southern border of the United states assistance to Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day just decided to start walking to the United states two thousand miles\nAlso think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels\nAnd if you want to start trying to analyze will what could their politics in this be\nThat opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation but there has to be political involvement here too because the money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this\nSo you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden 'cause nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word\nRadio by sixty\n...

from Texas He's on with the bill hammer and Sandra Smith this morning bill hemorrhage says\nMike Pompeo was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them are also deeply concerned with the violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way they the details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying sectarian state pumped pale raised the stakes\nLast night as thousands of Central American migrants\nInvaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence pump pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media and the party that believes in open borders they will never report anything negative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this\nWho in their right mind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this ad wants this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world would want that and why it makes no commonsense\nUnder the umbrella of what's good for America\n\nWhat every bit motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what stakes\n\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting amnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall Porsche\nOn securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves by definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals\nBut in the world is so damn hard to understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how soft this country is getting\nIn one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's best\nAre being driven stolen by a motion govern stolen by a motion not any ... any kind of common sense and because of some odd quirk that's happened\nIn our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom that comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mess\nThe bunch of experiences\nThere is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so\nEver we may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing males will just a race to the border and said to the world come on it\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped if it's not dealt with the people of the world do not have an entitlement\nTo the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do\nDemocratic Party is calculating that there are more people who want to get into the American taxpayers back pocket than there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democrat Party is siding with the people around the world who have nothing who think that because the United states has a lot\nThey should just be able to come in and get whatever they want\nAlmost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this\nThis political party ought to be no where near winning anything in the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any rope breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting it defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave\nHelp

people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass\nI'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business the Trump Administration is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned\nOr the palm pales saying this we're concerned about violence provoked by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and it's called an invasion\nAnd thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but I don't know our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops to stop an invasion\nAnd I've heard people on TV so called experts say where you can use the military because of ... that normally prevents a military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so there was nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president doing what we do a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces their way and you know\nIt's a no brainer folks it is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you didn't you you you he may not send the military they may call as a as a congressman Gohmert says there but there's no law says he can't\nThis is it about what is one of seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the EU okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their wife or the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we can make that case what do you think the people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans wouldn't have been terms I joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening\nI'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communists think always trying to get in an invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all doing good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up\nFor Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're a militarized was the border if they bomb rushed the border like that down in the southern side of Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military is supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nTear gas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a a house and the Senate back into the emergency session and doing national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this self\nSo bring him back in for a special session or their wife passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that short\nI mean you think Trump needs to share the burden of providing the optical that if Trump sends a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is by the people who planned this thing\nExactly and that's where it can try to deal with this on his own she leaves to put everybody else or but on the line get 'em on tape on film or whatever what should we do what what do you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer\nAnd Pelosi stand up for letting these people in any way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a hell of a dangerous situation but it is it

these rallies you know I'm not opposed this Rush Limbaugh dot com I have some friends\nAre out in the in the Phoenix area\nAnd that the Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona they thought about going through it until they got there and found out how impossible it would be they sent me a video that they took their iPhone tennis max\nDriving along the entire a line in order to make the video fit to be in a size they could email to me they had to run it at twice normal speed and it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends\nAnd then there's a note this is that this doesn't even show that people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a\nMile long line\nOf people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies the media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did\nLocal media may I don't know national media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing this because if they did it would put the lie to the notion of the all the energy is on the Democratic side\nMeanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these kinds of rallies needs ... these kinds of people what the Democrats are doing is continuing to show up where Republicans are having dinner and harassed\nThe turtle and his wife are at a restaurant local Kentucky and some mad cap asinine protesters shows up and just start shouting things internal just sits there doesn't acknowledge him doesn't move doesn't say anything\nThe other patrons in a restaurant or just watching all this go by but this guy's making a spectacle and I watched him talk about this on Fox today and they were talking about such and the last ... board and this isn't this isn't about civility\nThis is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave and I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against the on the Democratic side at whatever you want to call it\nLack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning it's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times\nGood vibes positive outlook these are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThat is the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally is ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico\nYou've seen those pictures in the media is happy to show your those pictures the media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people soon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand\nThey'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture a seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand people multiply that times ten\nThat's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\nI Wish they use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace for the cowboys play put a hundred thousand people in there\n\nSo you think that Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have marched jumped through Mexico\nMad walk out your people really and we're supposed to sympathize with it they don't show you\nThousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not\nIt's an amazing thing but as you get older it naturally begins to change causing a lack of sharpness or even trouble with recall thankfully the breakthrough in ... helps your brain\nAnd actually improve memory the secret is an ingredient originally discovered in jellyfish in clinical trials ... has been shown to improve short term for my forte expressed\nGround zero week nights at ten on news radio five sixty WHYY end [noise]\n\nOkay back to the phones we go to a certain floating in Macon Georgia grades are happier with us on the E R B network Hi thanks\nFor having me on Russia appreciate you about Wilton it's great to have you here\nLike the reason why I called I spend a lotta years military are retired from the older we are very good a lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one thing throughout the years we not good at so the situation that look I I'm One hundred percent cut in the military on the board but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about ... this is not a military invasion of talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people\nThat are largely are going to be thought of is starving or steep poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife what am I gotta let it\nIn the military is not used the standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and the harm on is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the differences you know when it comes to locality we're very good at that when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that we'll we'll individual you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nTo okay what about this what about just the president of the U.S military standing at the border you will\nNot cross okay what happens then if they do and are\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nBut you don't you and your like your your ears bullet you use a one of the dummy is called I forgot about the use you use some kind of force but not lethal\nQuality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal like a pig and then it so we just have to hold up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president's would be tremendous\nBut the president's would be okay so there's ... you think the military showing up is let me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a lose lose proposition\nNo I think initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they're good at it they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nThat I still terrible you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily well then what is it what's the preparation I read have to be prepared to use deadly force like\nOkay well let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound in since I don't mean that\nThey hold the line I hold the line provide a visual presents a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings what somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two then what happens\nThat we'd have to wonder I'll tell you I think you see a lot of people fall in line it probably would push or talking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two gotta hit that it would storm caused the mob in rain storm the military just in an ... and ... essentially storm the bullet storm and gotten you you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you guys have a tendency to hold up when they are met with equal strength and we just have to\nBut even if there is a casually or to the drive by half their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah okay so the alternative is so let me know know have to hold\nA lot it and like I said somebody you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the team to legalize sleep it's unfortunate but this is what they what they take it all by taking there's just\nYour own okay right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you think the media is going to allow that this is I'm a ... I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't finish it we've got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio rain again you're listening to the network\nAt home with Gary's on Sunday night on radio by\nI'm pretty handy around the house but now that I had kids I don't want to spend my Saturday installing a toilet or fixing an air conditioner but thankfully there's ...\nHelped me find them back home pros in my area to handle any kind of project you can read a review the pro kick their bail ability even book appointments on line and when my wife love most is that home advisor is completely free do you\nGo to ... dot com or download the ... to get started\nAt the people we believe investment advice is about more than helping you manage or well\nOur investment advice is about you it's about providing your kids with opportunities for head start in life viewing secure and your retirement in ... in your dreams just may become a reality because you have a plan we believe in you the path to investment advice starts with your ...\nCouncil the bucks ... weeknight starting at seven on news radio five sixty W.

Eighteen thousand it originally over the weekend was Seventy seven thousand people that wanted to get in now that swollen to one hundred thousand people and my point is this kind of thing does not happen\n\nTo political parties losing favor\nIt does not happen to the candidates losing favor at about to be over run by a Democrat blow away in just to remind you Tom\n... on CNN Today the chairman of the unseen no no no no we we always knew this election\nWas going to be close [noise] we always you if you know the right places to look the drive by and the Democrats are really walking this back\nNow I Know a lot of your ... rush don't get sucked into this they're just doing a rope a dope they're trying to make you think that they've lost ... but they haven't this is just I don't believe this folks\nThese people are not rational right now\nThey haven't been rational for a long time and the irrationality really was jammed up after Trump won\nBut there's a companion story to all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out\nTo try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate and it isn't working now by showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of samples last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attracted to somebody with an Obama like way\nUh would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and compassion\nThe guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist and really makes no bones about even just talking about Florida as a collective look that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or a collective he hid it would be a disaster\nFor Florida right now to elect anybody like this guy\nBecause of what he will do and wrecking\nA growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing white gang busters and ... and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here\nFrom other areas of the country it's about tax policy Florida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down\nThis is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrats leftist who doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally and so forth this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness he doesn't know about running businesses\nLike every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has want an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that\nYou didn't look that up a would just be\nJust bad news horrible news the thing that worst time for anybody like this guy to be elected governor or in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and here\nRick Scott is one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled the whole bunch of emergencies in disasters in just came through with flying colors\nAnd and and now suddenly has become a just a static flat line just a ... a walking echo chamber for whatever left his leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit the Florida or not\nBut the Santas would be great defense as a as a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nIt and it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people who want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them\nWe have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while the trend is constantly upward people have have\nAre exceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing me extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back\nTo flat line the economics of decline\nWhere the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you get a better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWe we stole a lot of what we had we mistreated people all over the world\nIf you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't I Can't imagine people who are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved\nWith ... in any way want to put the brakes on this and for what reason because they don't like\nTrump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump is goldfish or whatever\nSome of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\n\nTrump is supported because he's in the last line to hold off on this attempt at transforming America into being something\nThat it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by like this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved\nBecause America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be then you've got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democrat Party of today wants to happen successful America needs to be punished\nWhatever else is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's this\n\nAre you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life the Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can\nThey don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things\nThey don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content on your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible if government makes have happened or let's have happened\nBut more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups of victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided\nThat life is too unfair and to me and and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference\nAnd so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful\nOr anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of means spirited extremism\nThe Democratic party has become the home of people sadly with psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders\nAnd normalize them and that's not the purpose of the United states government and it can't succeed anyway\n\nI mean this is just hands down at this Andrew Gillum personified eyes personify the exact total wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put but one of these up\nOn the digital camera if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media\nIs trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up that is one view of a ... I don't know where this was that they have a chance to just grab some pictures here on the fly to break in the top of the hour\nThere are people standing single file on the second floor it is it looks like in the next picture you'll see the second look a high school gym and nobody's there and Joe Biden is the big draw\nRadio by six\nWeeks ...
