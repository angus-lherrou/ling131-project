A. dot com mass master license number one zero one eight three and the answer to our trivia question Margaret Thatcher was a member of the conservative party a group commonly referred to as the Tories\nAnd the winter is mark from shoes very mark mail but congratulations our tribute conscious brought you buy seasons fifty two\nWith forty three locations nationwide including two in the Boston area and one in West Palm Beach season fifty two is on a mission a mission to provide you with a better way to ease\nVisits seasons fifty two today in Burlington chestnut hill or Palm Beach gardens or go to seasons fifty two dot com for menu information and reservations booked your holiday party today and get a special gift for all of your guests\nAirline fuel budgets are about to get squeezed by unlikely competitors next year ship owners are expected to start switching to a cleaner burning diesel fuel this is part of the new emissions controls taking effect globally in the year twenty twenty\nProbably uh we certainly know it's good for the environment so that's that's good news bad news is if you're an airline and their number two cost right after a much snow is a fuel\nIt means they're going to have a lot of competition for a specific type of fuel\nIn this case a cleaner burning diesel fuel which is what they use on their airplanes so apparently the costs of that's going higher at a time when they were already facing you know rising as world facing rising fuel costs so\nOnce again the ... the airlines just can't seem to stop the bad news [laughter]\nStill amazes me though how inexpensive air travel is it is a phenomenal deals you know if you have some flexibility in your schedule you fly to Hawaii and back for like seven hundred but\nYeah if you can fly on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and two or three weeks or more in advance and you're going to a place that uh\nYou know has a lot of flights coming in and out not like the middle of nowhere with their one flight on a puddle jumper as long as you're doing that I mean these prices are low we're not even inflation adjusted their lower than they were in the seventies\nI thought the president was going to back off of these fuel regulations or is he with what is the finding another battle besides\nI've not heard about that it would not surprise me there's been a obviously a relaxation of a lot of regulations or this might be on the back burner the time being there a few other issues going on at the time and it would be a pretty you know pretty bad time to to to start dealing with this particular issue with I guess especially\nThe global warming is starting to say you know even even the most ardent objectors to the global warming the ... theory are saying it's it's\nActually happening and I think the debate right now is to what extent it impacts client in climate or even if it is only impacting moderately you know uh why add to the problem I think is part of part of the issue here\nBig oil's flood of cash under wellness investors this is if you own energy stocks you've noticed I mean son of a gun you look at companies like Chevron Exxon Mobil the big energy players oil that was up I don't know Seventy Seventy five bucks a barrel and these stocks to move\nThey have not moved recently which does raise some ... again I think concerns about the global metro macro economy because at the end of the day I really think this is concerned about future demand investigators\nYet ... 'cause I think there's a lot of looks supply is up it is a right but you there's so much pressure to keep prices high\nYou know like Saudi Arabia wants the prices to be high the United states wants the prices to be here The Tempest and the prices are higher than two biggest producer right up United States and Saudi Arabia right we both want high prices between those two countries we produce twenty twenty five percent so if they could ...\nThose two countries could say absolutely keep the prices high\nNo question about that but you know ... and I think we've both been kind of bowls on the issue of prices and also I think I don't know about you know I'm I've been a bowl and some of these oil companies be honest with you I think they're pretty good value they have good did ask that I thought I was trying to get at a balance sheets they because investors are staying away from they are and ah I I I think\nYour profits collectively their profit reports have been fantastic and I know I Believe all the sectors I Believe the biggest increases in earnings have come in the major oil companies so they\nGot to those companies they got rid of literally hundreds of thousands of workers and billions of dollars of expense\nWhen the price went down what did we go down to like twenty something briefly yeah and it's it's been steadily up since then these companies are sitting on Ninety billion dollars of excess cash maybe it's a question of you know were they going to put that to work but investors some reason are still skeptical of these companies will continue to exercise\nThe discipline they've had and let's face it Barry at the at the you know hanging over this market is a long long long term reality\nThat there will be much oil used by the world every day alternative fusion energy incrementally every day\nThe percent of oil we use and developed countries is coming down you know you look at the you just look at how much solar you see around how much when you're starting to see and we're in the instance of that whole sector so that you look at alternative energy\nOne could say that we're ... I think the total it's not even like two percent it's it's not and when you violate your company it's the discounted value today of all the future cash flows\nWhat does the future cash flows but they are going over there in Thirty years they're owed them they're going to get into that I ... like Exxon Mobil will take over the wind sector and like ... ... wouldn't you in the convenience store sector or some yeah you're right so I mean but there is that question of of\nTheir game right now ... is not going to be the same game a generation from now you know but I I Would argue in the meantime there's a lot of money to be made in these companies are in great shape\nAny idea that they are objective and fair and balanced they have now gone all in in total now they they're unified every day don't misunderstand I'm not I'm not\nA I'm not\nIgnorant about this I Know the unified every day I'm told they have a theme that they have all unify behind today and I think for the remainder of the time\nOn these next two weeks and that is Trump's spreads lives and stokes fears head of election I thought when I got in here and\nSaw that one time I figured it was just you know a graphic skyrocket graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that manner it didn't\nMatter what else was being discussed it didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I check the New York times and there it is spreading fear\nTelling lies a head of election\nThis caravan thing you know I [noise]\nI continue to study this\nAnd try to pick it apart to analyze it and and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find anywhere in the media any concern about it I Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it's\nLike what you find in the drive by media isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately\nPoor people wonderful people fleeing poverty in their homeland and that's not an oil what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this it is an organized mob and like everything else in the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paid for it we're going to learn who scripted\nJust like we've learned how they did the cabin off thing with Dr balls the Ford how bad was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve what is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left is spontaneous or organic and he's all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for its all focus grouped it's poll tested from their perspective\nAnd the the obvious there there there's no ... you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nYou don't want to scare everybody is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm up\nWith seven thousand people that maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claiming they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in two weeks if they're walking it's physically not possible\nSo when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be being driven\nBut it is all orchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individual totaling eight thousand people\nDecided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking from Honduras to the United states that just didn't happen it doesn't happen somebody is making this happened somebody set this up\n\nIt obviously is a bunch of leftist to set this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is\nThat makes them think they are going to win massive elections and it is clear to me not only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is and it's not a caravan it's ... it's a bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think organically natural really exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on its massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentment\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues you know an individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump feared Trump hatred promoting the exacerbating it or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now\nMe share with you a couple of uh\nStories today on the polling leading up to the midterms because it is all over the place and it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight as soon as the adored do and the indispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control of\nA lot of good things came out that year like Medicare and now we got after Obamacare [noise]\nThis year just like all the way you

Tom Daschle\nBy Tom Daschle\nIn this segments monologue gas\nGets all the Republicans fall\nI think we economically on that and uh\nThat's my message in this segment let's go to the phones again uh we have a phones available finds family if anyone wants to call a\nSitcom control or abortion I'd be happy to talk about any of those subjects so let's go back to the phones are\nActually we have John I'm both the liberal\nAnd conservative right ah John you're on the Tom Daschle show\nI don't care how many times you leave a message on my ... I'm getting that got a I I'm not coming on your show I only going to crash a large uh important places where I can get faced well\nUm I guess that the bad rap set up for the combat show um our this is Tom Daschle will liberal message on the radio I'm reaching out to America\nIf you have only one on\nOne seemed like a [noise]\nReally is looking back it's Rush Limbaugh great the heavier the excellence in broadcasting network where we meet\nAnd surpass audience expectations every day our telephone number if you want to join us eight hundred to a two to eight eight to email address el rush about abs\nYeah I'd be net dot US and yes I'm going to get to Obama in Nevada you know the the CNN graphic that's been running all day Trump spreads lives in stokes fear ahead of election\nI don't care what Donald Trump lives about mistakes are there is no body and block Obama's league\nIn terms of purposely lying to deceive people such as you like your doctor you keep your doctor if you don't like your health plan you get to keep your health plan\nWith Obamacare your average annual premium will be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars those lives were told over and over and over again to dupe unwinding Americans into believing that Obamacare was going to essential Eby cost free\nThat it wasn't going to cost them very much of anything at all and that if they want their doctor in plan that wasn't going to be any change\nAnd we later found out course we knew from the beginning he was lying about it tried to tell everybody he was lying about people didn't want to believe the first African American president would lie about\nSuch things so much hope was invested in Obama misplaced as it turned out those wise again and they were just the tip of the iceberg those lives were meant\nTo deceive people those lives were meant to make fools out of people they get them to agree with Obama's status takeover of one sixth of the U.S economy for the express purpose of being able to control people's lives if\nYou control their health care if you control people's access to healthcare you\nControl them you can determine what there'll be allowed to eat or not you can even determine what political party gets preference if there is a line at the doctor and this is exactly what Obama and the Democrats were doing it didn't get a single Republican vote\nDid the media run banner headlines Obama spreads lies and stokes fear to pass Obamacare [laughter]\nNo way how about the bad guys he does after with Obama and Hillary lying for months\nThat video produced by somebody nobody ever heard of cause the unrest that led to the riots and men gutsy knowing all along that it was a pre planned and executed terror attack that the Obama administration did nothing to defend\nThose are lives designed to mislead to deceive and to protest himself\nAnd Hillary Clinton and everybody else that was in on that damn fool decision about the lives Obama told about drawing red lines in Syria the Obama administration was a series of lies upon lies\nAnd deception upon deception and the American people quickly saw through it and began defeating Democrats at the polls in record numbers starting at the two thousand ten uh germs and Obama is outlying today he went out and get his own little rally in Nevada and he tried to tell everybody\nWill what'd you think about it ... you remember who started or remember who was\nAnd he had his face in his head up in the air looking up over everybody like God that like you got to look up to see him but you're you're so far been either I mean you can't see you you just woken up like this over everybody\nKnew just remember you just do you remember where it is critical ... rock Obama\nClinton and create these economic circumstances have his life depends on it because he doesn't know how and he doesn't know how because he doesn't believe what has happened in the last two years was possible but beyond that he didn't want this kind of economic activity he didn't want this kind of robust economic growth\n\nHe didn't want it demonstrated that people have more control over their destiny acting on their own behalf that if they stand aside and led government take care of things this guy was a walking talking disaster for eight years\nAbout Obama colluding with Russia on getting rid of American nuclear weapons or an open Mike after the twenty ... right before the twenty twelve presidential election Obama's overheard\nTalking to ... number one the aid he says you tell Vladimir to be patient I'll have a lot more flexibility after this election flexibility meaning I'm up to run again and so I'll be able to even get rid of more nukes in our stockpiled than I could be for\nThe guy was just an honor disaster that the American people quickly realized as soon as the American people were able to get past the idea\nThat it was okay to vote against\nThe interests of the first African American president than the country began its recovery\nThe American people when it came to voting for Obama they couldn't pull a trigger not do it but when they came to voting against Democrats they did it in droves every chance they got starting in two thousand ten\nPut a picture up we've got a picture for even a digital camera going to send us up to Rush Limbaugh not can we have to picture side by side make the switch on the left is Obama in Nevada\nWe're we're we're actually in a political battle with people who are not right mentally forget emotionally these people are not right mentally see them protesting Mitch McConnell and his wife having dinner at a restaurant in Kentucky I mean they're not right\nThere's something really really off about these people and I think they've been driven to various degrees of insanity by professors teachers and the media\nThey've been lied to for so long about things that the things they expect to happen to things they think are real are so devoid of reality and truth that they're on able do except to Jim Jim Jim Acosta having the president whip\nPeople up at a rally after rally he says is the most depressing thing he's ever seen as a journalist this is the citizens CNN conference yesterday in New York City\nIf you want to ask me what makes me the most depressed about my job it's covering the rallies and it gets to the larger point of what it's like covering the president United States and in particular Donald Trump in many ways the danger is not what\nTrump is doing to America the danger is how America is changing under Trump and I never thought I Would see the day where I Would go to a political rally in you know people would give you a hard time you know people yelled at me that Hillary Clinton rallies during the two does make campaign\nBut at rally after rally after rally\nHaving the president cited states where people up into a frenzy got attacked the press to me is the the ... the most depressing thing that I've ever witnessed as a journalist Manno\nMan where has this guy begin to see Trump whipping people\nUp and rally after rally and having people get mad at me as a journalist is the most depressing thing I've seen as a gym you can get but you got all kinds of the you can go be a waiver you obviously listen\nWell Mr Acosta however was not finished somebody needs to walk the guy back from the ledge here\nYou know thousands and thousands of people who are willing to join in and do the same thing I'm at the rally in Montana the other night when President Trump praised grudging unfortunately\nFor body slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters in the crowd and there was one guy one young man\nWho is doing these body slammed moves you know and and he and his buddies were all getting good laugh out of it and then he looked at me and he goes like this like I'm gonna cut your throat and you know it just it I I went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about it\nBut to me that's the Trump effect on America\nWhat do you make of this so\nIt it's it's no different than when Trump is onstage hey Russia hey Russia maybe you could find Hillary's emails and media is looking for him nobody can maybe you can find Hillary's missing thirty thousand Amos let the media they'd love to hear from me and everybody on the left the media has a heart attack thinking Trump is asking the Russians to hack\nHillary's server Hillary's already done the hack Hillary's already done whatever she has something to hide the emails no sense of humor these people have no ability whatsoever to relate to people as they actually live so Trump praises a guy for being able to body slam somebody\nThey see no humor in it they don't have any idea how to relate to that they see that they think Trump they really do they think Trump is promoting violence\nThey think the Trump is recommending and praising ... but they just I I have never seen\nA group of people this large that is so distant and absent from reality from day to day life and how people talk to each other he goes up\nTo this guy and the guys laughing hey man hey Jim Acosta how you're doing I really didn't want to see what you're ... you know I'm just fun and with your dude you're out there trying to destroy everything I Believe in Mr ... I'm just having a little fun with you\nSo these people in journalism they can go out they can destroy anybody they want they can take shots at anybody they want the people at that rally have respect for Trump the media can do whatever they want to try to destroy Trump but you'll let some\nYou throw it back on them and it said ... it's great that show something terribly wrong with American culture what's wrong with American culture is that the elites of Washington DC not only do not understand the real life America they don't like it much\nThey really have I think what they have about Trump more than anything is those of you who are elected him I think that's what this really boils down to when you get down to brass tacks more on that but we get back\nSomebody has to have struck the say rush probably by being met work [noise]\nAll right to all of our listeners out there who are aged Seventy five are older and only one hundred thousand dollar life insurance rosy were larger I Want you to get in and I want you to write this information down\nIf your age Seventy five year old and I'm a hundred thousand dollar larger my policy did you know you can convert that life policy in the cash right now I'm not kidding you can turn your life insurance policy and the cold hard cash I Know the economy's been a struggle for many\nPeople need cash they need it right away and you can get cash right away for your life both if you're over Seventy five young one hundred thousand dollar or larger life almost you know I Want you to write this number down give these folks who call it's all free\nGet rid of those insurance premium stopping those turned that policy and a cash right and this number down eight four four we buy Seventy five use the cash to pay bills medical bills whatever\nCall ... ... e B you why nobody by now the poor for we buy Seventy five\n... ... do you buy life guide to\nKnow more words of wisdom from book justice brothers was ... when you put your foot\nAsked them\nTo the kind of a bad choice of words can get to go\n\n\nThere for only a pair of\n...

general it is how the left in how Obama it's how Hillary Clinton the deplorable why Hillary Clinton can says well you know instability is warranted until we get our power back\nThings will get civil again when everything is made normal with us back in power\nThey've done everything they can everything that's always worked to destroy Republicans in the past and to make you abandon them\nThey've got it down pat they've perfected the various attack plans the various schemes to make you distrust and by the way\nRepublicans in the past them kind of helped out in that regard by campaigning to promise to do this that and the other they get into office they do just the exact opposite so it's been a perfect storm for the media\nThey've had Republicans who are elected properly in Tampa David\nThey've been able to persuade you of the various Republican stink not worth your support we've been able to get rid of pretty much whoever they want it to\nJim Acosta in Houston, Texas last night twenty five thousand people outside Seventeen thousand people inside just roaring and cheering and having the best time they've added a week or longer and he can't stand it after all his hard work\nYou get you to hate Trump after all of his hard work trying to get you to abandon Trump to see the truth about Trump and you'll keep falling for the lies and you keep falling for the hate yeah you're on the problem Jeff Flake was also at the CNN event yesterday\nThe citizens CNN conference it was just Wolf Blitzer afternoon show\nAt some convention setting in New York City and here's Jeff Flake weighing in on this\nTo me now [laughter] it's just gotten so far beyond you're not expecting the president to anymore\nBut what is troubling as to what behind it and see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me how as as to who believes and he does it I think because it still works instill rile people up that divides us horribly yeah oh it's\nJust it's very very dangerous it's very bad out there Trump spreading lies stoking fear and the election there's Jeff Flake or who himself has been rejected by people like you in Arizona voters in Arizona couldn't get reelected saw\nHe now says what's really troubling to look behind Trump to see the reaction of people to what he says and that's what's more troubling to me now\nWho believes is\nHe does it I think because it's still works at sea so Trump Trump is he pretty smart Trump knows when he's ... knows that you're idiots in Trump knows that you're ... and ... knows that you'll fall for anything\nAnd so Trump is ... is working is spending like magic on you and and and people like Jeff Flake and the Washington establishment never Trump or does he resent the hell out of Trump because Trump knows what he's done so I guess Trump's not so stupid now you are\nWhich takes me to want peace that I had ready to go yesterday but didn't get to it David go lurking they're brilliant brilliant

quotes from MySpace every big us elections interesting but the coming midterms are fascinating\nIn for a reason most commentators forget to mention\nThe Democrats have no issues the economy is booming America's international position is strong in foreign affairs the U.S has remembered in the Nick of time what Machiavellian biased\nPrince says five centuries ago don't seem to be loved to seek to be feared in contrast with the Obama years it must be painful for any on us leftist\nFor future generations the capital of fight will stand as a marker of the Democratic party's intellectual bankruptcy the flashing red light on the dashboard that says empty\nThe left is beaten\nAnd this is so right on the money they're not have to resort to these charades and and and really devastating tricks like this caravan\nThe whole Kevin episode was was intellectually bankrupted was morally bankrupt it was politically bankrupt and yet they persistent with it\nEven to the point of carrying not that they were destroying and American Life and American family in American career ended American future they couldn't have cared less this is the bankruptcy of decency and the Democrat Party has non left\nAs this ... says this has happened before in the eighties in the nineties in the early to thousands but then the financial crisis arrive to save liberalism from certain destruction\nToday leftists pray that Robert Mueller will put on his Superman outfit and save them again for now though the ... only issue is we hate Trump\nThis is an instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what hates about America the implications here are important and they're painful\nThis is instructive hatred because what the left hates about Donald Trump is precisely what it hates about America and hate America it does folks\nNot that every leftist hates America but the leftist I Know right to alert in her at ... they do hate Trump\nThey hate Trump's vulgarity they have his unwillingness to walk away from a fight they have his blood as they hate his certainty that America is exceptional\nThey hit his mistrust of intellectuals\nThey hate his love of simple ideas that work they have\nHis refusal to believe that men and women\nAre inter changeable and worst of all he doesn't have any ...\nExcept getting the job done his goals are to do the task before him not be pushed around it otherwise enjoying life in short Donald Trump is a typical American except exaggerated because he has no constraints to cramp his style except the ones he himself in vans and uses\nI'll tell

sides of the things they any reaching out with the heart\nThey hate certainty especially when the conflict with their own\nNow back to Trump he lacks constraints that the left hates them or because he's filthy rich always has been and unlike other rich man he rebels and well he doesn't feel any need to apologize for it ever\nHe never learned to keep Israel opinions to himself because he's never had to he never learned to be embarrassed that he's male with ordinary mail proclivities\nGuy whites women\nDoesn't see the need to apologize for sometimes he's treated women disgraceful you for which Americans left in Ryder shamed of him as they are of JFK and Bill Clinton but\n... says my job as a voter is choose the candidate who will do best for America I'm Sorry about the course of ... constrained the average American that Mr Trump conveys that course and this is unprecedented makes us look bad and other nations but on the other hand\nMany of Trump's opponents worry too much about what other people think I Would love the steam of France and Germany and Japan but I don't find myself losing sleep over it the difference between citizens who hate Mr Trump\nNow boys I thought we

Ohio David Europe first today high\nI rushed thanks for taking my call Yes sir this morning I was listening to NPR\nAnd Steve I ate a reference to the mall but he didn't want to call 'em all he said it was only a few thousand people\nAnd then I take my lunch break and they have another NPR a personality saying that it's such a humanitarian disaster now that they're standing by the order of John understand just how bad is making his eyes water so they use the mob\nThey don't want to say mom they use what whatever it is to them it is to them they don't want to say mom they want to say it's only a few thousand people when it's good for them but when it's like when they want to use the humanitarian side\nIt's such a disaster that there's\nYou know thousands of people on the line well and he couldn't even see the end of it the way they can go to the bathroom\nRight so uh your conclusion from all this is\nThat oh NPR is a great you want to listen to NPR you wouldn't know what the enemies doing or what they're up to that for that day listening to MPR and they're trying to use the situation for whenever it means for them and that meant it they can set up for\nIt got bad we've got a a a a bad a connection here uh about the only time I read or sitting NPR is when they run pieces to translate what I've said oh for the audience and then happened is well I get the soundbites on that maybe once every two or three weeks\nUh but but of course NPR is not going to call it a mob\nMPR is supportive of whatever this group of people is doing and what is this group of people do it who are these people\n\nWe're being led to believe that these are average ordinary Hondurans Guatemala El Salvador and fleeing poverty\nWar\nTorn poverty and a ... or whatever\nAnd they just organically happen you know these people is amazingly on the same day citing believe and they\nJust they just they just they just human being I guess it does have a decent life you know in in in in and they're coming to the United states\n\nAnd of course Trump and the Republicans are a bunch of mean spirited extremist cold hearted as obeys or want these people that keep suffering\nThat's the picture that's the picture being painted one of these people really doing\nWe've got reporters embedded in there now we know we hear what they're saying they're talking about Trump being you know an insult base screwed Trump Trump's Hitler Trump's a Nazi this there's no doubt this is a political movement it has been orchestrated and designed them as being paid for by somebody\nAnd it has one express purpose it has as its purpose to flood the American the southern border and to demand to be let in\nSomebody thinks or some group of people think somehow that this is helpful to the Democrat cause\n\nOther ways this could be helpful a Democrat causes if some damn of violence occurs to them or if I'm\nA they're able to show that\nTrump and his supporters are so mean spirited and cold hearted that they don't care about the suffering of deny the entry in this kind of thing\nBut but for the media to act like this is a a normal news event like any other normal news event it just happened to we're going to cover it and we're going to report it but that there's no political objective attached to this is absurd\nI mean I I saw a um [noise] I saw a video tape of what's this guy's Jorge\n... Ramos or whatever\nIs it what does it tell among do ... what what what does it tell her tell her no but what is it a Univision right\nAnd he's standing there as as a bunch of these people are walking past it I don't know where he was ... somewhere in the midst of the mob where packs of three and four or walking by and by the way folks [laughter] they don't look like the kind of people you want to\nRun into you know on the street I mean they they just anyway he's standing there and these people are walking past them he's not looking at 'em they're behind him and then they walk past him on his left shoulder\nAnd he's managing for he's telling everybody who they are\nAnd what they want and why we must let them in and then there are different people and all they want is a better life and that we as Americans we owe it to these people don't let them in all they want is what we want we all have\nThese various humanitarian objectives in common and I asked myself how in the world can this guy vouch\nFor whatever it is now eight thousand people but there he was down there vouch in trying to tell everybody watching him that these are the peak ... these are the prince and princesses in Central America these people are beyond reproach\nAnd he doesn't know them he has no idea who except I think he does I think he knows what the political objective is here and I think he supports it and doing everything he can to advocate for this bunch which intends to be disruptive and destructive\nAnd these guys say Trump sees a twofold advantage it's a way to argue his opponents have turned a blind eye to the problem although\nDemocrats remain strongly favored to win back the house overhead TV pictures of thousands marching north have the Democrats pool\nAsked if the timing worry them a national Democrats strategist said in the Senate yeah [noise] what so in the house it's a good deal in the Senate it's not a good deal the Democrats are admitting that they're spooked over this\nEven before\nThe caravan most congressional Democrats or immigration as a loser for them\nA memo circulated among democratic congressional offices in recent weeks\nSaid it is very difficult to win on emigration vulnerable voters in states Trump carried in two thousand sixteen even the most draconian Republican policies like family separation and deporting dreamers persuaded relatively few of those polled the vote Democrat\nOn Monday Trump unleashed an explosion of immigration focus statements warning on Twitter that he made the point the military to the border and threatening to cut off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador what she has doubled down on by the way\nSo this is a story tried to tell brain dead people read political why Trump is talking nonstop about the care of him because it's going to help him with immigration\nWhat [laughter] who did they think is behind this\nSome of the stuff in the media is literally mind boggling that that the the attempt here to be on attached to it or disengaged from it\nWhen when you get down to brass tacks most people in the media would be supportive of the people is caravan being allowed the lead in the country because they are everyday anyway whether people show up and groups or two or five or ten or in a Bob up seven thousand the left is in favor of letting them in\n\nAnother worried that this is going to be a boon to Trump right before the midterm elections which it is\n\nBut when you stop and think the Democrats are behind this has to be democratic donor money behind this and the reason I say this it may make no sense that makes it would cause this report is right this is helping Trump's allied with the Democrats do this book they're not rational right now\nThis group of people throughout the media\nThe Democrat Party itself and and all of their social media base voters I'm telling you are so poisoned\nWith hatred and resentment all of these emotions they have felt following election night two thousand sixteen and all of the times in the past two years they thought that Trump was gone\nYou gotta put yourself in their shoes everyday they've gotten up for two years and they've read in the New York times I'll Trump is toast\nThey've read it's only a moment of time before a matter of time before proof that he's the co loaded with ... is going to be revealed they believe these two years that Mueller has been goods so they get up everyday believing that Trump is history sooner rather than later and nothing happens\nTrump just keeps getting his rallies got bigger they get happier they get more raucous\nThe Democrats get more panic everything they do to try to take Trump out or to stop Trump in his tracks like the capital of thing is backfiring on them and they got ... out there promising subpoena power saying yeah we're going to investigate Trump we're going to investigate everybody in his administration as the reason for the Democrats to win back the house\n\nThey have they have lost all grounding here in in rationality\n\nAnd their perplexed because none of what they have done has worked in a white has worked its it's if it's getting bad\nThe same old thing they can't persuade you to abandon Donald Trump they can't persuade you to stop going to Trump rallies they can't convince you to look at Trump and see him the way they do and they're just to be tied\nOver there at their which candidate right now so they're running these polls showing the blue wave eighty five percent chance are Democrats win just to make themselves feel better about things but they really don't\nReduce the

the purposes of trans forming it into the kind of country of the Obama heights\nWe're seeking and failed to accomplish thank goodness now New York times anatomy now does not determine\nGender well what is this about why in the world we're we're talking about a percentage of the population is not even one percent here\nAnd yet it's become a this group of people has become a major major support

doctors and scientists abandoned long ago as oversimplified and often medically\nMeaningless are you kidding me determining whether somebody is male or female\nDetermined by a person's genitals is old fashioned is no longer applicable and needs to be abandoned because it has been abandoned long ago by sensible scientists\nSo this is the party of sites a Democratic Party science\nConsensus and scientists don't work climate change\n\nResearchers who studied gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male female pigeon holed\n... said that the Trump administration's latest plan to define gender goes beyond the limits of scientific knowledge\nQuote Dr Josh it was safer and in wrote endocrinologist and executive director of the center for transgender medicine and surgery at Mount Sinai health system in New York says the idea\nThat a person sex is determined by their anatomy at birth is simply not true and we've known that it's not true for decades\n[noise] so you have a baby and your baby has male genitalia but we've known for a long time that you're a baby is not may not necessarily\nThe same thing when you have a baby that has female genital yet but no it's not necessarily female as we've known this for decades\n\nAre anatomy does not say what it says so then the New York times asked well then what does determine gender identity a\nPerson's powerful core knowledge of who they are is not so clear\nHere again is the doctor from\nMount Sinai in New York we know that there are a and there is a significant durable biological underpinning to gender identity what we don't know are all of the biological factors at play that explained gender identity\nAs far as we in the mainstream biological medical community understand that in two thousand eighty and it is hard wired it is biological it is not entirely hormonal and we don't have\nIdentified dean so we cannot specifically said that it is genetic\nGenetics plays a role in determining your a gender she has a in studies of twins if one is transgender the other is far more likely to also be transgender if they're identical rather than fraternal identical twins are ... what is going on here\n\nAnatomy does not determine gender experts say a companion story here\nThat's also in the this is NBC News\nUS President Donald Trump said Monday the transgender issues were in flux in that he aims to protect the country after a report than his administration was considering defining gender as male or female based on gender tail at birth and that drew wide spread condemnation\nTrump's as we have a lot of different concept right now\nA lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now asked about a campaign promise to protect the L G B. T. Q. humidity Trump said I'm protecting everybody I Want to protect our country under a proposal first reported by the New York times on Sunday\nThe Trump Administration would narrow the definition of gender to male or female at birth than it would be an changeable later in life\n[noise] [noise] okay\nYou're asking what's going on let me very simple eighth and yet very controversial you explain what's going on here\nThis is all politics\nPure and simple total politics disguised as something else the Democrat Party has embraced\nAll of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities and this in the process of trying to normalize them all by in training them as policy planks or issues in the Democratic party platform\n\nAnd this is how we we end up with people that represent two tenths of one percent of the population\nBeing given the whole way of the Democratic party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which they otherwise vast majority can end up being bullied into submission\nI have I have long believed that\nI just didn't have a I I did not stumbled across the correct way of expressing it but I finally did and I really do believe that\nThere are many psychological disorders out there that have been adopted by the Democratic party as political issues that are then used as a as as\nThe joined the list of demands on government the government fix that government acknowledge that government or deal with or the government funded that government protect and this of course then turns the Democratic party coalition into an even larger group of\nThey haven't competitive plan that they can't be their parents hurt them and take them out of the game\nKeep our own kids safe national celebrities spokesman Rush Limbaugh at\nWhat age who's that bought parenting yeah\nThat is the entirely different picture from what I have always fought soccer was I don't soccer was a refuge from violence I thought that's one of the drawing cards the soccer and his parents were sending their kids out there so they wouldn't get involved in those kinds of activities\nThat exactly why we had our boys play back at the same time when Italians are now Pakistan hit me\nHe would get away from that being attacked in turning a ball again wind the bar and again\nHey mom ran wide open ... wind data and my ... and then the crying and Saturday path have asked him ... on the side of the hill gang that went into\nThis is a genuine horror story that I'm sure pains you to tell\nI think it's important to point out that the soccer moms obviously didn't know\nAnd don't know it's not that they were irresponsible or are irresponsible like dream here they were just uninformed Bush's why our education campaign is so important join Rush Limbaugh and help support but keep our own ... look for the keep our own kids safe chapter near you you'll find them everywhere\nMartin seasons you move out to sea on packages [noise] who probably asking why I'm overly\nBecause it's\nSo slow to mom ... always choose who\nWas she was ... cents or we can you reduce the\nRecent studies have shown that eating too much wound show room me move co certain types of cancer [noise] so we could move with the review boomers who\nBought boy were you stick with Rio's it two hundred and twelve degrees loads on view through every person Nunes ... do the potentially dangerous ... grew flavor\nAnd you shoot of love and lose risk\n... to\n... to move from New rules to ... to\nKnow\nWith Al Gore junior\nHello this is Albert Gore junior and as I said in the New York times\nI for one genuinely wished that the climate crisis weren't allusion\nBut unfortunately the reality of the danger we are courting has not been changed by the discovery of at least two very small mistakes in the thousands of pages of careful scientific research small mistakes happen every day and asked\nCharlie wrangle he went on vacation and had no idea\nWho is paying for it Nancy Pelosi hot it was okay to fly friends and family and associates to Washington and to Copenhagen so that they could be near her honest mistakes happen all the time I asked Governor Paterson\nWho sent a couple a state troopers to throw a woman's house to deliver a hallmark card of sympathy hand it was mistakenly uh caught up in the press has some ... [laughter]\nWell I think all that to say this that honest mistakes are made every day by Democrats everywhere wants a few degrees in temperature either way cut me some slack\nJoin us next time as we once again to save the world without more junior [noise]\n\nLet me\nTry this one more way why is trans gender stuff in the news anyway\nBooks\nNormalizing psychosis is what the modern day Democratic Party has been about what what is what is more fitting proof of what we have been saying about how the Democrat agenda is driven by people with mental disorders and and uh when I say this\nI say this with all compassion towards people with mental disorders the Democrat Party is converting those mental disorders and really lying to these people they're converting these mental disorders which need to be treated\nBy professionals are converting them into political issues they're whipping up a bunch of anger\nAnd they are convincing these people that the mental disorder is really the result of Republican conservative mistreatment and lack of government sympathy and so they're going to get even with people are going to get what ever is troubling people fix that are going to punish people who are responsible for it\nThe Democrats use Kavanaugh to whip up the women's vote the Democrats\nThink that every one of their voter groups can be whipped up into action by pointing out the mistreatment of conservatives Republicans or what have you\nThey are using immigration and this caravan mob to whip up the Hispanic vote because they can see that Hispanic voter approval for Trump is skyrocketing they are using the show the story that try to whip up the Muslim and Middle Eastern votes\nAnd of course the journalist vote which they don't have to do much whipping up there because they own the journalist boat but all of these issues are being used to focus hatred on Donald Trump\nAnd to try to convince people to Trump is responsible for all of these things and a half people so upset and so angry and now they're using transgender to whip up the gay boat and and other related people in the Democratic party who are running around thinking but life is filled with nothing but unfair discrimination\nYou just you wait let's see you wait till the first male conservative Republican candidate decides to self identify as a woman\nTo get votes and let's see how tolerant the drive by media and the rest of the Democrats are when a transgender conservative pops up if such thing would happen [noise]\nYou just wait and see what kind of tolerance is just like their tolerance for black conservatives and there's tolerance for females who are not feminists that you know how that works out\nAnd there is not any tolerance for homosexuals who are not part of a leftist bent if you will [noise] by the way my parents [noise]\nSays that the Honduran president told him that Venezuela is funding this mob say Breitbart story vice president Mike Pence the vice other Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez told him that the migrant mob marching toward the U.S Mexico border is financed by Venezuela\n[noise] now I've got serious quite Venezuelans have any money why take that back\nI take that back the Venezuelan government it's like oh sorry [laughter] [noise] it's the Venezuelan people that don't have anything because their government has yet all my bad Venezuela could be funding this now\nParents may be allegation while defending Trump's assertion that middle Easterners make up\nPart why by the white why is have you noticed that Dr buys are outraged by that Trump is saying that there's some Middle East there are some middle Easterners in this caravan they'd been identified we've got people down there a better than this thing\nThere are people from all over the place in this caravan they're not just from Honduras in Guatemala and they're not just Hispanic or Latino but why get mad about that\nWhat what what's the point to me there's middle Easterners you know why wasn't why does the median go bad crazy trying to deny that\nWhat's wrong with middle Easterners being in a caravan to destroy us immigration system\n\nHas made this allegation while defending Trump's assertion in an interview with Robert Costa of the\nWashington Post Pence said it's inconceivable that there are not people of middle Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people advancing toward the border\nIn the last fiscal year we apprehended more than ten terrorists and suspected terrorists in our southern border from countries referred to end the lexicon as other than my uncle that means from the middle east region\nVice president and revealed that her name just told him the leftist groups from Venezuela organized the caravan financed by Venezuela to challenge our sovereignty and challenge our borders\n[noise] well see [noise] Venezuelans do hate us the Venezuelan government does it you know it's it's\nI'm almost ... to associate all this with George Soros
