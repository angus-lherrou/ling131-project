I think it'll be successful because they're because wherever there are large margins Amazon can come in and disrupted the up and there's no industry that is better margins than the mattress industry yeah well they're willing to lose money\nAmazon yeah they've shown that\nUh they become more disciplined about that in recent years which is one of the reasons why the stock is doing well\nBut uh this is a new mattress for him out of business and then raise the price is right that that's that's how they do but the mattress companies are are making so much money you can go to small towns that have very little in terms of commerce and they have a beautiful mattress store and part of that is because I was listening or freakonomics broadcast\nThat said you could just like two or three ... week really and make pretty good money because there's so much profit in it\nThat good business to be in your applications decline at Harvard Wharton and other elite business schools as the degree and they were talking about an MBA yup loses its appeal to young people us\nBusiness schools received a hundred and forty thousand applications that may sound like a lot but it's down seven percent and there's definitely a lot more competition yeah so if you wanted to go to the the good news is if you if you wanted to go to a really good school and you got decent grades\nAnd your way to pay for it yup got pretty good chance of getting in you do have a good chance of getting in that way but the the kids must feel that doesn't have the value right I think there is that feeling that ah that the NBA has lost ... value\nThat's the job market's good now right the job market was it ... it was terrible but the if you're a bright young person with you know say three\nYears of business experience yeah why why go back to grad school you're you're already making good money I you know I think that's the reason I think that even though the ironically because the economy's doing so well\nYou can get a really good job without an MBA right and and the NBA your applications to hurt them two ways\nIn bad times people don't go there because no one's hiring people the MBA [laughter] and and good times you don't need them I Do remember back in two thousand nine people who graduate\nAnd they'd say on the job market's just terrible I was going to go back and I'll go to grad school for two years and hopefully the economy will turn around by eleven or twelve or through you know there was a period of time there were a lot of people were going back to law school in grad school\nBecause you know you were going to make any money anyway yeah so it's it's a challenging situation we've talked about every situation is different\nFor a lot of people in the NBA you really can raise the ceiling of what they can earn why a lot for a lot of other people it's not necessarily a\nGood day on the market so far dials up five points the ... of a hundred and twenty nine points excuse me yes in ... up five points NASDAQ is twelve\nAnd the price of crude oil we didn't get to talk about it today but I I got to tell you frankly\nProceeding was paid advertisement by the financial a change in does not reflect the views are opinions of this station its advertisers awry heart media\nWe\nRock and roll lovers this anti west split taken ... back to this week in rock and roll history that started off in\nNineteen Seventy eight where the members of Aerosmith bailed thirty fans out of jail after they were arrested for smoking pot during an Aerosmith concert at Fort Wayne coliseum stuff for them\nThis week in Nineteen eighty six popular news anchor Dan Rather is attacked by a man\nTo hit them from behind him repeat the phrase Ken is what is the frequency prompting R.

and their expertise this kind of thing these kinds of trade deals in\nPromoting globalism gigantic world structure\nA world order that McCain often spoke about this is why they are there\nAnd has gone\nFar I'm telling you foreign policy wonks is not getting any coverage is Kevin O's morphing everything but I'm here to tell you that all these invisible swamp dwellers who live and die by such things as NAFTA are beside themselves that Trump got this done\nIt is a huge middle finger to them\n\nOut of Bill Burton is just pray Limbaugh British show talking about training on Kevin Kevin O's not inspiring anybody how can anybody listen this program and think that\nCreating NAFTA took these people years Trump guts it\nHe replaces it in months and do an insult to injury the Mexicans and the Canadians want to be part of it they ask to be part of it are noses or not out of joint they're not crying and moaning about the loss and after they want in on this new Trump deal and that is also\nProfoundly insulting to the swamp dwellers they can't see straight this is just more hatred for Trump this is just it's blinding them\nAnd now\nThere isn't a companion story didn't have a chance to get through it yesterday the child comes\nAre getting ready to lower their trade barriers on us exports because of Trump's tariffs it's all working\nThis is something these guys never even tried to do\nTo straighten out the trade imbalance with the child comes the swamp rollers never even tried to do that that was just\nAnother circumstance we had to accept in the modern world and watch what's going to happen next I'll tell you right here in now Iran is going to come to the table\nYou watch when that happened\nThis is all falling into place for Trump exactly as he said exactly as he\nIs making happen\nI don't know how many do you do wire transfer is but there is a form of wire transfer called swift and if you're goes ahead and puts on a replacement for swift Trump is liable to freeze the Iranians are they using it meaning it have trouble moving their money around\n[noise] [noise] that's why I brought it up because it is such a huge deal\nIn so many ways it's a huge deal in turning the swamp upside down on the inside out and it is a huge deal for Trump making America great again putting America First and following through on a deeply deeply committed in highly touted campaign promise trade deals were among Trump's top\nThree campaign issues\nIt's not an accident that Ninety thousand people trying to get into the Trump in Johnson county Tennessee Johnson City Tennessee after the NAFTA deal is done ... ... ... ... that the people in Washington the drive by media are totally missing this it's not sexy told them it ... it's not a big deal NAFTA trade deal yeah screwed Trump for doing it but\nThey they don't have any ability to see its connection\nAnd its relevance and its importance in Trump's supporters remaining ramped up\nAnd loyal and then there's this\nOne more song by featuring your host CNN this happened and just before the conclusion of the previous hour I said ten minutes to one CNN aired this\nThere are some Republicans who say they have it all went down if he was defeated or the fourth or withdraw that that would just she ended up Republican turnout because the quarter is there a holy grail and they would come rushing out his Rush Limbaugh saying don't bet on it\nIt's very easy to sit here to say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery but it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be some ticked off in Seoul man they're going to show up and vote like they never voted before\nBut his that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in because if that happens at that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he has not confirmed in the Senate you think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say\nYou see what happened to Kevin all wearing the majority that we couldn't get confirmed you need to come out in ...\nHow does that work how does that work pretty good point I Do think that that's an important point that if Kavanaugh goes down and it'll be because moderate Republicans decided not

Rush Limbaugh executing assign host donated flawlessly as is the case [noise]\nEach and every busy broadcast day [noise]\nOkay for those of you watching on the digital\nCamera I Want to show you something for those of you not watching on their digital camera going to post what I'm going to show there's little camera at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see it there\nUh but first before I assure you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed a cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it in a sweater let's let's use that when it first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right\nSpeaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right Nineteen Ninety two I was at a local talk shows but\nCNN's the only cable out and there's no Fox News there is no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative websites start everything's starting to ... to to blossom at that point but but this program nationally was still it for years after our founding\nAnd Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right or Timothy McVeigh\nBlowing up the uh building in Oklahoma\nCity federal building and of course\nUh I I was living there was not going to accept that would challenge the White House automation a correction claiming though we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio isn't that by the way there's more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up in strategize\nI Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do\nSo a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brecht was his name drew up a cartoon of a fireman\nCarrying a dead baby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine ... artist did his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nWell one of the local host of the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the farmer said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell that cartoonist is back\nYou remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford and judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about\nThe wisdom of just ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back [noise] some public at the Illinois southern Illinois journal or some such thing as the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter in parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching other that'll camp this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin O's daughter praying at her bedside the description the upper left hand corner Kavanaugh's daughter says another prayer\nAnd in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says they're gods forgive my angry lying alcoholic father or sexually assaulting Dr forward\nNow as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do as a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot com or if you don't have to remember you'll be able to see if I'm not doing this was like come on for membership I'm I'm just we have the ability to show these things rather than described them\nSame cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's just vile\nIt's filthy dirty ants discuss thing it's despicable ended sick\nAnd of course it has accomplished it's subjective it's gone viral and people\nWould say that people are reacting to it and I weigh whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets and I decided to go ahead and do it in my never\nEnding quest to have people understand who liberals are how sick and getting men did did\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the well this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh cabinet his daughter says another prayer dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\nNot a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\n[noise] and it's just it flies in the face of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\nOpposite so don't dumped me on this on to what these people in the media do you have so much invested in their power\nIn their self esteem related to their power that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurts them to the quick\nIt disturbs them any time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upsetting them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about it as Hi Justin\nOn CNN NBC News desperately trying to convict Kavanaugh at the same time they've been trying to convince Trump loading with Russia\nNBC News this had to admit that they are unable to independently

Fox News that's how President Trump describes what's happening the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh saying it now seems to be guilty until proven innocent and FBI pro with allegations against Kavanaugh continues boxes John decker is live at the White House\nIn every way you could possibly physically assault on that it was horrible\nWas was ... well that's that's not\nThat's not the original claim what is your lawyer puts this last minute claim out there\n\nI I Can't ... the NBC starting to get deflated all ready they think they've got the gold mine of interviews they've got to get of gets they've got Julie sweating the\nProblem is her lawyer didn't properly vet her because her lawyer didn't think with the media it'd be necessary media would accept whatever he tells them is the media wants to get Kavanaugh to\n\nNBC I don't I don't know if they're really vetting her or just trying to get confirmation here to add to what they want to do so hate snow then says did you see Brett Kavanaugh spiking the punch that you'll see him putting green alcoholic in the Bronx\nI saw him getting red solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame and there was screened punch it those parties and I would not take one of those classes so\nFar Adam ... catalogs case I saw him around the punch containers [noise] I don't know what he did but I saw him by them yes well now what [laughter]\nYou see what's happening [noise] first he set up the gang rape trains he was responsible for drug gang and alcoholic ring up the women now well no I Can't say he saw him they she apparently was assaulted in any which way you could imagine\nBut she can't name Hammon and and then when it did you see him spike the punch [laughter] [noise] the punch\nA rain out well but what I saw it with a lot of red solo cups [laughter] I wouldn't take a rent solar ... bread Kevin on them at all what you gave me\nSo now we've got the fear of the ... how do we know it was a solo ... there's a lot of different manufacturers of ... clothing Playtex how do we know that it was a solo ...\nSolo is being somebody here that their cups are being used in the abuse of women\nThen NBC admits they cannot locate two of her witnesses one says one of the witnesses she names as he never heard of her and the fourth witness that she named it is that\nWe haven't heard from us friends so I'm asking well are there people alive today I had those parties there are people that know about that as part of\nThis warning sweating it provided for names from she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweating another friend Shimon is deceased we've reached out to the other two and haven't heard back [noise] [noise]\nIs the sound of air coming out of a balloon or\nAny other inflatable object\nNext me go to sweat next former boyfriend that was on the Ingram angle last night on Fox News channel is is a Richard Vennochi is the pronunciation the question you claim that ms sweating it threatened you after you broke up with or what types of threats are you alleging out there\nRight after I broke up or her she basically called me many times and I wasn't going to basically say you will never ever in your ... child alive and I just going to go over there where they can you guys [noise] she said she was going to kill you yes\nRight after she dealt with the unborn baby is going to do that first\nYou will never ever see your unborn child ... the Democrats really want to stand behind this is this what they want to vouch for they're backing off this is again I don't mean to be redundant but Dianne Feinstein all\nOf a sudden this after the bringing up the fact that we need to start looking again at his roe versus Wade decision women's reproductive health and is assault weapons or\nA thinking on why that's been that long ago and you didn't have anything to oppose him there so\nYou imagine how they feel about this\nI mean they're fools to believe this was real in the first place but they're so damn desperate up one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon wife here it is number nine Sheldon Whitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat\nWho on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's ... said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the date where the incident Dr foreign described happened\nAnd he is thought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward capital\nSo on good morning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talk English Sheldon Whitehouse is a Democrat and Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied we don't know how all the details yet but clearly if they have been given free rein to interview whomever they want and that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to uh get this done by friday if they really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have audio soundbite number ... this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtles\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles that Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen we're looking at his credibility now is a grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh\nNot telling the truth just yesterday\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh or people close to the judge we're in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ms ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying capital perjuring yourself and that means he's not qualified what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is that the throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative fall down drunk\nAnd now is a a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer yeah are they friday's mind yeah there's not too many people to talk to hear FBI's gotta lotta or we can get this done that's just to central\nMaybe White Houses out their truck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they they are moving the goalposts but\nAnd yes for a delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kevin in anything\nUh there's one more that I Want to play and I'm looking for and I just found that I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve\nThe question of who leaked Dr Ford's\nLetter to Dianne Feinstein\nThis this is of leaking this letter my memory on this is kind of fuzzy but\nI remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the borders of the ... judicial committed I remember her showing the letter holding it up or talking about\nIt I remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about it and said that she'd had it since July and that\nShe told us all about it that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she doesn't want to do with it she's holding this thing I don't know what I don't know what to do with us and I was all part of a strategy\nSo late yesterday afternoon on\nShepard Smith reporting on the Fox news channel trace Gallagher was sitting in for ...
