I was intrigued myself ah when when I took a look at it\nAnd what they're actually doing here uh this is part of a promotion called Jet Blue for good month or and so it's going to be a trip that takes place from November twenty seven the thirties so not giving away just any free flight after Thanksgiving what it's going to be as you have to go and sign up for this promotion here\nAnd pretty much it's going to be a largely community service oriented trip for four days the Jet Blue is going to cover all your costs on\nAnd you are going to go with pretty much a hundred people a fifty passengers as well as a guest or their choice and you're going to go somewhere to location being completely unknown to you you have to get to New York\nYep and they are going to fly you to go do community service for\nThree or four days it's it's kind of a cool little promotion that they do or just to you know raise visibility for the airline it's it's good that they're doing some good as well because it doesn't cost that much and they sure got a lot of publicity out of it that they get a ton out of it so it's a it's overall you know I wouldn't be surprised if you start seeing more of these types of promotions these the kinds of things\nOr to build a lot of goodwill for companies in the day when you know companies need good Wilson ... you know we're seeing obviously just about every day a guilt companies doing whole bunch of things wrong but this year pretty good promotion I think\nThey're running I was surprised to see that thirty one percent of baby boomers are not saving for their retirement of if you're a baby boomer I mean you're getting pretty close to retirement yeah and they're not saving for retirement because they're still paying student loans which has to be for their kids when\nI I Would imagine a big chunk of it is probably for the kids you their parent plus loans and things along those lines and I know you've been kind of on the uh the edge of that battle saying look stay away from these parents plus loans\nAnd don't you know sign for your kids I mean either have the money or you don't and you know if they want to go to college and that's fine they can also join the military and get money that way\nOr the other big thing is look if it's all well and good to want to support your kids get I don't have any so I don't understand it but you always want the best free but here's what I always point out\nIf you run out of money in retirement right eventually you're going to boomerang back with your kids and that's what I've worn my children about and I can

Kavanaugh thing happened and now there's this massive caravan heading to the country with the\nAim of Mexico in Guatemala there nobody is trying to stop this nobody is trying to stop and it's up to four thousand people now it's estimated that this is costing somebody Twenty one million dollars these people have to be fed the\nThey have to be transported and they have to use the bathroom\nThey have to be\nAble to drink water and whatever else they can get their hands somebody is making this happen\nSomebody thinks that this\nIs going to watch or girl well for Democrats were told that\nGeorge Soros money is a is behind this I don't care who's money it is it's a lot of money\nTo make this happen there are a lot of kids by the way and the magic of the Taliban is the children as it always is there are children in the caravan and that kind of like the baby on board science I always hated those\nI even had one major baby not on board but we're still as valuable as anybody else is inside this guys we had\nOne of those made those bother you baby on board rush maybe on\n... exactly when a rush maybe on board little inside ... yellow side we made it up and it was available at the Rush Limbaugh store\nBut this is the same thing children young children also we must do what we must\nOpen the gates we must stand beside we must allow them passage\nSo we got this we have the\nMueller report as I say more on that in a moment the ... report is just lurking there there isn't anything really in it in fact we now know probably have a sure bet that there's nothing dynamite in it\nBecause of an audio sound but I have coming up uh never Trump or anti Trump is Phil Mudd former intelligence official US government now CNN commentator\nBut who is it that would think if you're on the left it think this massive caravan arriving in the United states at our border close to the election who thinks this is going to help Democrats how what it helped Democrats\n\nThat's not just Trump separating him as Trump not letting them in there has to be what it is these people actually are figuring that a massive ... they don't understand that this kind of\nThing is why Donald Trump was elected\nDonald Trump was elected to stop this kind of thing to stop this invasion and that's what this is this is an organized\nBought and paid for invasion image growing so obviously the plan\nIs for this group of people including the children to arrive here\nVery close to the election and for Trump just sick I saw them and the border patrol on them and to deny them entry or\nTo separate the children from the don't\nSo that the drive by media can then kick into gear with stories that are already written ...\nThat are all ready taped interviews with people on the caravan all ready in the can where these people will say they're shocked they came to America to save their lives were their children to improve their latest they won't let the man is unlike anything they ever heard about\nThe cuts of pictures of Trump smiling as people are denied entry Democrats think this you know I I Would think that if somebody politically there should be a conservative group might do this\nTo promote Republican turnout\nThat we don't have anybody on either side who thinks that way but it makes more sense that way or am I missing something somehow a massive group of four thousand people is growing including kids\nMarching toward the United states with no attempt to making patently obvious what it is these are not people fleeing anything these are not people fleeing the Saudi Government they're not fleeing torture not fleeing will they be fleeing poverty but\nThat happens every day for thousands of them this is one of the street with its plan this morning paper somehow this is supposed to end up making the United states look bad that\n\nAh I'm not ... that's the way these people are figuring it going to play out then we have the Mueller report\nThat\nWill not be released before the election but we're being told that it is nearing completion and then it is ready to go\nI went through yesterday what the what the hope here is uh the hope here is to revive the Trump colluded with Russia narrative and to make people think that we're just days or weeks away from proof being released\nWhether we can't do it before the election because of regulations in distance so we're not going to influence the outcome of elections but Muller is ready to go at once in a while I've been doing well Muller that's been looking for evidence of Trump colluded with Russia so if Mars ready to go Mahler must have found the but this is what they want everybody to think\n\nAbout the fact of the matter is it's probably the exact opposite I'll let me find the that if they fine the soundbite here\nThat puts this in perspective hang on and I look at this won't take long hair folks I as I say I'm having a compressed everything here it is number ... audio soundbite number ten and this is this is deep\nState ranking member Phil Mudd he is a former intelligence official now works as a commentator on CNN last night Wolf Blitzer show the situation room\nHe's a counterterrorism center specials what he is and Blitzer said do you think that Muller is preparing new indictments\nThe really interesting part of this is a potential report a draft report a narrative if you will from other going over Rosen high let me play this out Washington Rosenstein gets the narrative that says not only\nThis is what we found that my violate the law this is my picture of what happened during the investigation there is going to be some dirt and there are so in addition to the indictment I really want to see what's in that narrative we're\nOkay so this is wearing this is going to Mueller report is going to be full of supposedly horrible stuff Trump\nIs none none of which is probably going to be invaluable none of which is going to be impeachable although the Democrats win the house they're gonna make moves in that direction anyway\nUm but he says the important point of the smaller report will be the dirt dirt not being in which\nThere's nothing for it less they make it up there never has\nBeen any Trump collusion and never has been the evidence or less they make it up so the smart money is that it's going to be filled with things that are accusatory that blamed Trump's incompetence ineptitude\nEssentially blame Trump for being sold in over his head that it looked like the Russians had worked with him to steal the election despite the fact that there is any hard evidence\nIt's hard to refute the idea of going to make it look like Trump is in over his head doesn't know what he's doing threatens the country with his presidency because of his incompetence\nThat's what it's going to be but let's take a look at an alternative view from Sydney Powell\nWho was work we have referenced many times on this program she has written a book

of the facts surrounding that which born we can make decisions about how if the United states should respond\nThe surrounding Mrs joking\nWhen I travel and met with President aired on the talk to me about the incident they told me that they were conducting their own investigation so we do believe that between these two Africans a complete picture will emerge for what actually transpired here\nSo

[noise]\nSo I Want to show you something on a digital camera I got an email here this is about yard signs you know what I've been hearing\nIs that people all over the country are afraid to put yard signs out because literally afraid of leftist knobs coming to their homes and not just ripping the signs out but doing damage to their houses\nAnd so people who are tending to vote Republican are not putting yard signs I remember we had a call here at this maybe\nThree weeks ago now from a caller who said Russia I'm worried I'm not seeing in the yard signs we thought Trump yard signs everywhere in two thousand six now I'm not seeing any yard signs at all\nMy simple ... camp the camp that looked into it and I found out that there is the leftist scaring the hell out of a lot of people and if that frightened also includes scaring them not to go vote\nThere are a lot of people scared to death with these maniacs\nAnd that's why yard signs of not being put out I I was part of me understands it another part of me she's afraid of yard signs are you kidding [laughter] from the country that stormed the beaches in Normandy we're afraid of a yard sign\nBut it's a different era and these people on the left her crazed or making doing good job of making themselves look that way\nSo I have a video taken by Ted Cruz worker I Can't I'm not going to show your video on a digital camera so I put

think it\nWas a there is nothing [laughter] there's nothing about the stark raving mad\nAspects of today's Democratic Party that is an illusion is all\nToo real so I'm trying to wonder why when the ... what's the purpose of this piece of left turns not an illusion so they want you to know they want readers to do this left turn is by golly by gosh for real the sub bad like many overnight\nSensations it has been years in the making what we know this to like go back to the Nineteen twenties and the Soviet Union if you want to trace the beginnings of this\n\nOver the past eight years and years begins and Mr Thomas Bee and so the Democrat electorate has moved steadily to the left as liberals have displaced moderates\nSelf identified liberals of all races and ethnicities now command a majority in the Democratic party raising the possibility that view is once confined mainly the party elite\nHave spread to the rank and ... on [noise] on up the Democrat Party elite\nSad to say we're never these radical leftist I'm going back ... Clinton\nThe Democrat Party moderate elite has been overtaken by the left wing radicals and that's why some are scratching their heads anyway\nFrom two thousand one or two thousand Eighteen to share a Democrat voters who describe themselves as liberal has grown from thirty to fifty percent yeah well you don't want to do something else the percentage of Americans that call themselves liberal is shrinking now into the high mid thirties thirty five percent tops the American people identify themselves as liberal\nHe doesn't say that [noise] I'm adding that\nThe percentage of Democrats who say they are moderates has fallen from forty four thirty five percent percentage of self identified conservative Democrats has gone from twenty five to Thirteen\nPercent that here we go now this is a long piece but this next Grapel is just the money graph ready well educated whites especially white women\nAre pushing the Democrat Party this simply leftward\nAccording to Gallup the share of white Democrats calling themselves liberal on social issues has grown since two thousand and one from thirty nine sixty one percent of because of this growth\nWhite liberals are now roughly forty percent of all democratic voters\nWhile a substantial percentage or a Democrat minorities identifies liberals those percentages have not\nBeen growing and anywhere near the rate they have for white Democrats wait a minute into thousands of Lebanon white working class was told I go to hell now all of a sudden the white women are the majority of the party and the the percentage of the Democrats represented by\nMinorities is not growing\nYou mean\nI guess that's why Trump's approval number amongst Hispanics Latinos and African Americans is that a record high for Republican candidates\nWhile a substantial percentage of Democrat minorities identify as liberals those percentages have not been growing anywhere near the rates that they had been for white Democrat so blacks and Hispanics have not contributed significantly to the rising\nPercentage of self identified Democrats liberals\nIn fact says Mr Thomas Bee ends all white liberals are well to the left of love black electorate on some of the social issues take the issue of discrimination\nAs a factor holding back African American advancement white liberals are to the left of black Democrats\nWasting a much stronger emphasis then African Americans\nNow wait because earlier this week we had a story but the Republican Party owns white suburban women right we did\nSo who is who is white women making up the majority of Democrats liberalism\n[noise] who are but back in ... shrimp boat show I'd be metaphorical\nWe starting in\nWay dry in a five year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these are the victims of

so long and just people who have gotten used to it\nShe says\nI don't believe the headline Trump attacks fuel Republican maybe the headline is true the Republicans fearful about losing suburban women

race\nBut this election is really important and people that are involved in this election now how important it is and people that have voted for Trump in the past\nAnd have voted Republican know how important I just don't I don't think the media's learned this lesson yet this is not the kind of thing that is going to cause Trump to lose an election you mean in a few votes here\n\nIt may it may have caused other Republican candidates to lose maybe hold elections but but but not Trump\nI just think it's all part of the equation in which Trump critics still don't get it they don't get the bond between Trump and his supporters they never will understand that because they're not curious to understand that\nSo they take these things that they think are just outrageous insults just so totally
