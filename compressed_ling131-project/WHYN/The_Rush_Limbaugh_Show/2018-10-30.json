he began to question the U.S war in Vietnam President Lyndon B Johnson said if I've lost Cronkite I've lost\nMiddle America and he was absolutely right and George from Denver as new that CBS was the correct answer\nGeorge congratulations are trivia contest brought you buy seasons fifty two with forty three locations nationwide including two in the Boston area and one in West Palm Beach seasons

information and reservations booked your holiday party\nToday and get a special gift for all your guests Amazon shares today are down eight dollars prior to ... to today they were down twenty three percent in the last month and they're down six percent yesterday which was not that bad a day\nRight there yesterday and they were down another six percent so is the boom off the roads at Amazon well the issue here I don't know shares yeah I I don't\nEither this is again as a company that we have a lot of respect for and totally get Myers just this one that neither of us could really figure what's in really worth I'm In you know this is a classic example of a great business that's now into several great businesses\nThat just has gone to infinity and you know we can make the case that a small kept company could be worth infinity because you can make growth assumptions that are appropriate but when you're dealing with a company that's worth you know seven hundred eight hundred billion dollars\nGrowing at twenty nine percent revenue right isn't that what they're grown twenty nine may maybe twenty eight something like that and and trading at a multiple in the triple digits\nThat seems like a disconnect so you know Amazon came to the end the problem is is when you buy coming like that you're price to perfection and as long as things are absolutely perfect it works out\nThe music stops one day when something imperfect happens unless you're Tesla well they've had their bumps to they had a I look at them you know this I eat one must is a magician he's a cat\nAnd he's got nine nine months I mean it it Tesla's stock straighten it three hundred and thirty five dollars they don't have growth like that I mean like you you don't get those two companies and their you know similar in age ... a very uh you know flamboyant and genius operators right I think you put Bezos and\nMosque in the same category in terms of genius right ah\nBut you know Tesla shares bouncing back I I just don't know it it's still today\nVery difficult for me to get my arms around Amazon and tried to put a value ... and I'll tell you I I think ironically it's because they're making so much money\nThat we can now treat them as a fairly mature business that can be valued and the most positive analyst I heard say maybe in twenty twenty you can get fifty dollars of earnings\nIf you apply a thirty multiple that it gets you Fifteen hundred those are aggressive optimistic projections on a very large company to begin with\nSo now we realized gee you know this is going to be tough to justify it even at fifty even though it's down yeah ... percent you still look at it at least I Do a jaded I and I say\nYou know ... and you know part of the problem is I've always been a value guy right whether I'm buying real estate yup or whether I'm buying stocks and I can't get my arms raw string and that you know here's the thing being a value investor you and you let a lot of sexy ideas run\nAnd you don't get to take advantage of them the good news is one of the music stops you start looking at these Israel businesses and an Amazon really has been treated is something that just is never going to go down\nI I Will say this in defense of the price for the first time in many years I can actually say you know what\nIt might actually be pretty close to being what it's worth and it's been Reagan the sky way it's been trip I looked at that and said it's triple what I pay for it yeah\nNow it's a point where it's like okay if everything goes rubble [laughter] it's it's a justifiable price now I don't know [laughter] but not something I'd jump on whether it's at least it's not as ridiculous as it was IBM down a couple of bucks how you feel about them\nThen Trump can do it but as I say it's going to run into a buzz saw with a bunch of activists judges who will shut this down before the end of the day if the actual\nActually tries it but at the point is\nIt needs to be addressed every effort the Trump has made to fix this problem has been met with opposition\nEverywhere and yet we have another caravan this time with people loaded with guns in bombs now that are heading across southern may go\nWith their intention to get to the United states and the drive by me to say this just being done ... upset Trump's base that the implication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you go vote it's again\nA classic expression or illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are voting for Donald Trump who remain supportive of Donald Trump\nBut that will get to more details on I ... back to my little test so I rented of these people at the event last night it's going to be a red wave rush I listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations were already five I mean that is a huge number\nMany of them are committee chairmen not all but many of them are committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being jumps you know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so we want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I spent forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on the season students viewed the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans will never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents\nAre known as well known so that that\nMakes some of this somewhat iffy I and and then there is the traditional statistical\nAspect which says that the party\nThat holds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways Lewis's seats so forty five seats they cave and\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resigned and we're still in the house you can count a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left and the drive by as are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five will slip\nAnd then you've got a contest of all races are in other parts Senate of course another thing now\nI mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resigned resigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number and I don't know about them but their attitude was and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up and they are sophisticated\nAnd the people who are elected Trump know exactly what's at stake they're not gonna sit home they're not going to twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixth day and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today at a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on forecast models\nI'm I'm not familiar with his work but his headline is random wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty eighth congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected to office\nAnd in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\n\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\nAs you're with a member of my great book grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the

places well those were predicted unexplained\nUp in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity\nAmong democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by media these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading pill movement and the great awakening movement\nAnd he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red peel\nA movement but\nSays he's

I think reasonable I'm harping on the fact people refused to accept election results it's profoundly indicative of who they are and it's a large explanation of why they're behaving as they as they do\nAnd it's ... refusal to accept this not just because Trump one it's not just because they hate Trump it's more than that it's because they lost they were fully expecting to win and they didn't until they simply refuse it because\nIt's not a matter of thinking it's a matter of feeling they don't feel happy don't feel good and when they feel bad then something's not right and that's also been part of the education system\n\nSo we'll get some headlines Tom ...

told everybody\nThat this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhile you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night the team sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery well the southern states work though accept that so they pass laws are codes that were so restrictive the plaques\nThat essentially made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game then we're going to formally recognize former slaves of citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several states for article for section two claws one\nSo after that the votes black folks were abolished and that's why we have a\n... you know the fourteenth amendment and matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the Fourth Amendment was represented by the name of John Bingham from Ohio and he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that\nIn a house report number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth so all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he will be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who are involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors or foreign agents\nIt was expressly\nWritten to converse citizenship on slaves and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the mid Nineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen to me they settled in uh in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture of which there is a distinct and unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization\nThat's what's different now there's no interest in that we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're more organizing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it than for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points but the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate gone surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we got a company that are we going to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being set up that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you're bad recession and with the ... um with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually so that they can decide oh it'll be their language says\nI don't think the solution to this is enterprise zones in Arizona\nOr or Guatemala uh maybe long term economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater dose of capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another\nAnd\nThis was an immediate problem that's going to have to be though because if it's not they're just going to keep coming\nAnd it's and\nWe're not going to stop these caravans if we start implementing a tax free enterprise zones nominees nations where American companies going to relocate and hire them there instead of hiring them here\nBecause that's these people aren't capable being hired anywhere yet\nBut I understand if you wanna start political theory and economic theory it makes all sense of the world and otherwise you know quote unquote normal circumstances but this is a sure political movement here this Caribbean\nI look no either George Soros I think George Soros his name has become a like a bogeyman for everything people mean far left wing radicals when they mentioned George Soros I don't know who's behind somebody is and their purpose is to destabilize the United states\nThe purpose is not to improve life from these people\nThis caravan whoever's behind this is not really trying to do something for these people to make their lives better this is being done to it to invoke damage on the United states particularly Trump and to advance the political advantages and notions of a particular political party\nWhich wants to welcome these people in as dependent voters a jam in Madison, Virginia great to have you with us You're next on the E R B network

Trump was horrible that he was offend all these people that they realize now that he is doing what the country\nWell we'll take them or whatever they realize it is a is is is fine with me of course it's it's a once you understand what's going on it's impossible to support\nIt's it's just it's impossible support on a little less you have particular political notions\nOf what the United States

I thought I saw about\n... Michigan Militia shortwave radio numbers what the excuse was\nSo now that's become a me we have here is this a montage yep we got a bunch of CNN people and some National Review people\nAre radicalizing St ... saying that Trump is radicalizing domestic terrorists just like ISIS listen to this\nWhat are we learning about how the Pittsburgh suspect was radicalized\nThese men appear to have

it\nWas all liberals it was all leftists you know Twitter is blowing up at leftists all over the place now\n\nHere's the next one CNN Tonight with Don Lemon speaking with the former Republican National committee chairman Reince Priebus\nMike shields and Washington Post columnist Max Boot about the links between Trump's comments on the actions of the bomber and the synagogue sugar\nIn Nineteen Ninety five when Bill Clinton blamed Rush Limbaugh and talk radio or for the Oklahoma City bombing you have to be very careful that you don't start to tell people that their political speech isn't allowed anymore because there was a direct connection between political speech and violence at the very serious thing to do that\nShe hottest terrorists lone wolf carries on an attack we always ask what radicalized what inspired him to go to violence we have to ask the same thing about right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are as long as terrorists\nYou cannot divorce the actions of the second to the ... from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\nThat smacks boats Max Boot used to be as conservative as anybody you know uh in the Washington establishment something you may think that's not a very conservative but he's certainly wasn't this\nWe have to answer the same thing\nAbout these right wing terrorists of whom there are a lot more in this country right now than there are Islamic\nTerrorists you can't divorce the actions of these people from the sick rhetoric that you're hearing\n\nSo what he's talking about is you have in a jihadi who walked into a mosque one day was a perfectly innocent young guy had no ill intent toward anybody walks into a mosque starts listening to your mom preaching comes out of their Osama bin Laden junior\n\nAnd he's saying that's exactly what's happening in the unit so somebody Donald Trump is is radicalizing people Donald Trump is encouraging this the moms are telling people what to do and how to do it they're being taught how to make bombs how to explode themselves with bombs they're being\nNobody on our side to this is ridiculous\n\nIt's the comparison alone and it comes from never Trump ers who are frustrated that they have been on the able\nTo diffuse Trump they'd been unable to dispatch Trump\nAnd it's always a one way street we never heard about Bernie Sanders radicalizing the guy that shot up\nThe Republican baseball practice we never hear about the whoever was radicalized\n\nAny of these leftists and Hillary Clinton right it's always just one way street there's always you don't want is rooted in bugs it's rooted in the belief that not a single conservative can make up his or her mind but what about anything one of the first criticisms of this program dating back to Nineteen eighty eight\nWas that you are a bunch of mind numbed robots and I\nAm your Sven golly and I am telling you what to think every day because you're too stupid to make up your mind on your own I'm telling you what to think I'm telling you what to do I'm telling you how to vote I'm telling you want to go\nThat has been the criticism and what does that rooted in rooted in the presumption of superior intellect to people on the left and the belief that you are literal idiots\nWho cannot make up your mind on anything what they never understood and they made no effort to understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his voters is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you believed you already thought what you\nThought when I came along all I did was repeat what all of you had been saying to each other\nBut you ... you were not hearing it anywhere in national media what you believed was always laughed at ... criticized made fun of mocked but you were never\nGiven any respect whatsoever than this program came along and it reflected what you think and what you say well you were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto what\nNot because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance stay in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been ... can tell you how do you think or tell you when to start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd that we've even got never Trump conservatives or out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down you know what I keep the essence of things that these\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him that is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express it in the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump\nThere seems to be tied yours the reason that this is all going because you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and now you're blowing things up and you're shooting people\nYeah outlets are

N.\n[noise]\n\n\nThey'll let me explain what I meant I'm suffering here I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise] the comprehends I had to put it together after they hung up the most\nRecent caller I lost her when she was how families will gas light\nA the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition gas light a I got\nAn ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything they get to define that get to decide everything and what they say is is what is in anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or what have you and that that that has been my point\nIt's just a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act\nThe media I hated it was\nAllowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples would then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they'd file a lawsuit\nStrength to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business and the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified that these bigots\nWould refuse to bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when someone when when Indiana passes along Pence who's the governor\nThe media was outraged and they\nBegan to report on this as ... whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this attitude\nThing that they do wear what they report in the way they reported what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big gets are and who the uh the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it and then they ran around and they started knocking on doors\nAsking businesses would you bake a pizza when you when you make a pizza for ... and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman\nA running a pizza shop for her family you\nKnow we wouldn't do it would be against them so they zeroed in on this Twenty one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nTo be the typical Indiana bed yet\nAnd she was just answering their questions naively and in his leash she was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting it went on\nIndiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racist big it sexist ... I Know exactly what the caller ... Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but people rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this\nStarting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral seats at federal state local level\nAnd there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and so\nGas if if if what the media did to the state of Indiana is gas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it\nAnd er and accepted and it's this arrogance and just the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's\nYou have a synagogue shooting wallet the obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this\nIs crucial for me to the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition\nBut numbers normal or trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch out of the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding\nBy virtue of whether the media as being nice to 'em or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there but the\nElectoral results just in the past two years indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that a justice of the she was [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday Sunday but apparently Chris ...
