I Know they they may they literally made numbers up as far as oh Ninety percent of our people are employed at ... and it just wasn't accurate so there are more than a hundred thousand borrowers most of whom went to these for profit schools like ITT or Corinthian Colleges that have gone out of business since then\nUh and so this provides relief to those borrowers who want to be taken out those loans based on fraudulent information that was given to them\nYou know it's a lot of people are selling hundred thousand people on that when those loans are forgiven right yup they're going to be able to get a credit card you're going to be able to buy a car they might be able to actually buy a house [noise] exactly the\nBecause when you look at student loan defaults a lot of people think it's you know the doctors and the lawyers that aren't paying their student loans their pay understood this the ... vast majority I was shocked when I looked at the statistics\nThe vast majority Chuck student loans that are into fault are small dollar amounts like people just almost won six or seven grand yeah and they go into default on their student loans silly you screw up your life for seven thousand bucks\n[noise] yeah it it tends to be the smaller ones and it's either in a lot of cases people who went to these for profit colleges or people who didn't complete their degrees at for two year colleges yeah\nBut it they they like I I don't understand with the psychology is you you you you go to school maybe can't cut it you maybe you're just not smart enough to go to college or you're not

were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder because it does apple\nWatching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know it did I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that central ... at at elements proving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had\nTo contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point but there was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just I Know it's impossible\nThere is no way that democracy show he's watch could have recorded anything can happen to him and there's no way it couldn't have\nTransmitted or transferred it\nTo his iPhone which was in the possession of his fiance in the car in the parking lot of the consulate there's just no way especially sense apple has yet to activate L T E service\nOn watches sold them operated in Turkey so unless ... had entered the password for the consulate why it's my network on his watch\nWhich I Know he didn't do because most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there watch will work on why five most people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time they're right\nBut if you're a watch learned was a wife and I work like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not\nClose together but\nOnly if you have entered that why ... works password into your watch\nWife by settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that\nI myself didn't learn you had to do this until a couple of years after I got my first book I mean that's how old's your a setting that it is anyway certainly since you just\nBlew up you blew up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he died you blow it up now they have to come up with something else\nI said well I was totally unaware he said well you should be aware because they're mad after\nNobody's supposed that they they say to show he was recorded the events that have to record on watching their baseball say wow that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not possible\nAnother headline you probably have seen this so should've pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\n\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating blue wave\nIncluding none other than the door yet a Democrat National Committee cheating and election ringing\nDown to Brazil who strangely enough showed up on Fox that I should shut up a bill Hebert sounded Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise] that's right\nSo see and I got rid of Fox willingly open an arm and a lady had done it Brazil on and hammer was asking are all about and blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that's well you know twenty days is a long time in politics bill\nAnd I don't scramble my eggs before my chickens hatch I said who is listening to hear Dan Rather\n\nIdle scramble my eggs until my chickens hatch\nShe said naming so much she left it couldn't happen that we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point the impact of\nThe election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including cabinet although although\nThere is even more survey data now that the cabinet story was a one way benefits to the Republicans that he has not benefited the Democrats and the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd at the cabinet scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republican\nTold the media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren focused on this thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail to drive by Senate Democrats are stung shocked where is but rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what rock knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail\nYou think Obama's going to put his reputation on the line we're the only way Obama would put his reputation on the line here start campaigning is if this blue wave weren't a\nDeadlock if the blue wave for a while you staring at me\nYeah I got a couple stories Democrats are upset whereas Obama they're asking worst Iraq\nIf Republicans lose control the house or the ... do you believe you better response but no\nI think I'm helping ... that becomes a headline Trump tells a pie he won't accept blame of GOP loses out now the eight people tell you well that's actually what he would say no it isn't essentially you are misquoted\nThat's my only form of communicating really

Don rollers wrapped it up while I was a big mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment I going to be talking about before the midterms\nIn hopes in the hopes this was what they're hoping they're hoping\nThat the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump stole the election\nIs imminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they were hoping that the great on washed up here\nThe ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia and that well then he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create\nThis cloud of suspicion this cloud of\nDanger that port handles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections and you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the ... wouldn't\nBlow it releases this report it could well be Trump's gonna have to be removed a report might all of\nThis is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in this\nBecause his report goes to Rosenstein\nYou here's Tom in Morris county New Jersey and we have to the phones readings are great to have you here\nThanks rash thanks for doing everything that you do Russian I had two quick points a one on a a lifelong Democrat I was a teacher I just retired and I have been the biggest Trump supporter out there\nFor ... when does your support for Trump again\nDuring the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I think\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um I became a a Trump supporter one of the reasons was because she's got to be so good for the country in ... and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people aren't happy to see the country doing well\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up that Democrats were fair and my dad was a Democrat by mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy and try to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high right now for not only myself he put in the neighborhood because\nYou said it before it was you were born and um he said the Trump ... and he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well\nHis tweets are good but not that many people really hear it and I can understand why he is not addressed the nation I don't understand ...\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it and you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy and frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which treat tweak most of the time and the press conference they ... they skew anyway\nSo if you addressed the nation and he should it should be proud of what he's done this is the greatest\nTime economically that I can never remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this it is amazing in it\nBut you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said\nAn observation you've made in the modern day Democratic Party that they don't seem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit\nFor the country doing well in that shots you write\n[noise] you know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but\nI'm starting to realize they don't care about the country they they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen how we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYou know your frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't rich or\nAudience that he that he doesn't range but your real frustration of the U.S is with a news media and many people in the same boat who are doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me it baffles me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea your newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that let realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people have\nListed do you read\nThat but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them are wages going up on my machine aging\nMy point is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of\nThis and that more people are aware of it then you may know and of course you could be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know does the media is doing everything they can hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there was a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have to say rush probably ... be met

if he is about what journalism is now this\nIs not about contemporary events there's nothing in this series about Donald Trump or Theresa May or anything current in either country it is a modern era of generic piece lowers the storylines or all fictional all made up\nAnd it is\nAbout two competing newspaper is one of ... a big one of them small one of them is very serious take them to feel very seriously don't tabloid anything [noise]\nDon't focus on celebrities and the other one is nothing more than pure attraction it's the one that wins it's the one with the biggest building is the one with the more employees they're reporters are stars and so forth but you know what this does it's flat out amazing how honest\nIt is in terms of what people who do journalism think its purpose is destroying people both of these papers in this in this miniseries\nEnd up targeting the same targets the same powerful people some of them in government some of them out or some of them not but it makes it clear that journalists think their job is to destroy the\nBig people powerful people rich people there obviously has to be something they're doing with breaking the rules the concerts breaking the rules there has to be something\nMistreating people they are sexually abusing people they are stealing from the public Dole they're doing something and the purpose of journalists ... call 'em out and\nAnd and ruin which many many years ago when I first began to encounter the media as a target\nI was never I had a little taste of it when I was in Sacramento there were a couple of reporters at that paper that that that that have me and their crosshairs simply it was it was liberal versus conservatism but I mean I I didn't really get a full dose of it until this program started and I remember sitting talking\nTo some people about it and they said you have to understand what journalism is I said you mean the bias welders that but that it's it's it's more than that to its about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist and these little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or a or a or a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs ladder if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\nAnd it remains so today it's just it's\nIt's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin all it's all about destroying people to think about this series is it makes no bones about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't recognize the stars I've never seen them and and things for I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time but Google that many of them but I watched this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brazen early on is this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is pick up all human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life\nTo him everybody's a bad guy you just have to find out why\nHis favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides his journalists as the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling it it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job to try to solve problems because\nThe world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he one episode\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship they not hurting me like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nA cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the ...\nFor the with his his picture only an inch away from the word ... to file\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being a Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you would have ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it went with it\nIn the private I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures and the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't it's just it's ... it's it's perfect if the kinds of personalities you would have to be if your job is destroying the\nNo conscience\nThe belief that everybody is law that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody's decent nobody's white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes of a journalist an editor\nNow I imagine real journalist I got to look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople who have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than\nThe entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\nThe competing editor of the clean paper the above board paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirmed the ... story while the other paper puts it on the cover of having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other ... doesn't care

has now become a Democrat and he's offering to testify against Trump that's how was he is\n\nBut the media invested a lot in stormy Daniels' where ever she went to perform whatever poll she was slithering around a drive by Israel they're making a hero out of her\n\nStormy Daniels became a cause ... even before balls the Ford did and then that fell apart a judge in Los Angeles for rule out the porn stars defamation lawsuit if\nTrump claiming it was bogus it had no merit\nSo in one decision the porn stars entire reason for existing vanished political and so did\nThe lifespan of her
