Ford for her allegations what message does that send\nTo women and remember\nWomen went for President Trump in two thousand six name Hillary said white women did\nI'm an for yes that's right white women I forgot white women we don't like white women right Hillary that's right we don't even though I Am one white women all white women or women win for me white women went for Trump and look\nWhite women have been voting against democratic presidential candidates for decades now the white vote has only then won twice didn't last sixty years my husband being one of the two\nLyndon Johnson being there and so it's not a surprise it's a disappointment the white women vote Republican and not for me\nBut it is what it is and they're in Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved in to a truth\nExcept for the very exceptional election Europe Nineteen sixty four which was following the JFK assassination the Democrats have not gotten more than fifty percent of the white vote in the presidential election since Nineteen thirty two\nNow when you look at it that way you can understand why in Democratic Party circle there's hatred for white people white people white women had been rejecting the white married suburban women have been rejecting them\nThis is why the kind of Nazi movement sprang up this is why\nThe ... the left as as as started contacting all different categories for non white suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrats constituents\n\nThis and by the way this is again why in Nineteen sixty five Ted Kennedy and the Democrats re opened the floodgates to immigration I Need to remind everybody again from about Nineteen Twenty one and Nineteen twenty three through Nineteen sixty five we shut down immigration I Would not to zero\nBut we put very strict limits on it and the reason\nWas to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that come into the country the late Eighteen hundreds through the Nineteen early twenties\nAssimilation was key to American immigration policy arriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens by the way and there were things they had to\nDo to become citizens they had to learn a language and they had to learn the history of America they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test\nAnd they had to swear and plan their loyalty and devotion to the United states and they were eager to do it and they were happy to do it now they they maintain their ethnicity the Irish the Italians unit but they wanted to become Americans\nAnd they did and it took a number of years to assimilate them all\nWell Nineteen sixty five is when Ted Kennedy who led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates which then of course when to once that happened illegal immigration ramped\nUp in an uncontrollable way and\nThat wave of immigrants starting in Nineteen sixty five came from third world socialist countries the Democrats\nRealized they can only when the White House if they changed the population of America they were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing\nWhite women and Mrs Clinton just admitted in here to Christian I'm poor up CNN\nIt never occurred to them to change their policies what they have to do in order to attract white voters\nWhat they have to do was change America\nSo back to Hillary she said what was done last night in the White House meeting Trump apologizing\nFor the nation to Kavanaugh\nWhat was done in the White House last night she said was a political rally it further undermine the image and integrity of the court and that troubles me greatly Christiana unimportant it saddens me because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitution looking\nAt the judicial system has been viewed by you as he lectured insurance for the judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs Clinton the rest of the Democrats\nAs your private refuge\nYou have looked at the court as a place you can stock like minded the leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America that's why they want the courts\nIf you want to really get frustrated you heard me say this and you probably heard a lot of other people but stop and think about this outside of Obamacare practically every liberal ... the steak every liberal idea and belief\nThat now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed\nLiberalism and the Democratic party's ideas have never been mass popular the only way\nThat we have bastard ice pop culture to log on to reality today is because Democrats activists judges have been essentially writing law\nWhen they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions roe versus Wade is the most sterling example of this but there are countless others\nThe simple fact of the matter is the Democratic party has never been\nCapable of winning legislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people when they know what's at stake don't want them that's the value of judges and that's the value of courts\nTo the Democrats when Mrs Clinton says that what happened in the White House you have a night saddens her because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional into\nThe air is not by you in fact to\nHillary Clinton and people like are the Constitution's an obstacle is well it's certainly not something to revere\n\n... did you see any way even a conservative state college where I was speaking to yesterday said the only way to repair America is to try to get back to some civility to try to make it that even if we have political disagreements we're not going to go to war with each other we're not going to destroy each other\nHillary Clinton well certainly I Would love to see us returned disability Christ you out on poor listening to one another working on our differences but\nThat is not the Republican Party that exist today that is certainly not the administration that we haven't power right now when the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have is nominated for the Supreme Court Merrick Garland here we go off to the races again miss characterizing that\nYou're blue in the face\nWhat Joe Biden rule the Democrats invented that rule that presidents don't get the name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened in the last year of their term\nThat's a Democrat inspired instituted rule and she knows it but the Republicans didn't destroy Merrick Garland the Democrats didn't have to fight battles\nDefending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy them as they did Kavanaugh\nAnyway the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says it's it's a time\nThe last night I Can't quote it exactly but she said if you disagree or if if the party is destroying the things you believe in a low that you should be a civil would that not apply to the Democratic party is will Republicans conservatives\nI'm being uncivil to the likes of her\nShort would sure what I mean that's the standard if the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life and you must be an civil against\nBut [noise]\nAnd you know this in the Hillary Clinton Democratic Party world\nUh
