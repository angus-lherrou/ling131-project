O. J. from doing there's nothing to stop them from doing but now you started to get in through the weak points in our whole system the weak point being that if you have people were operating entirely in bad faith\nThere really aren't any limits on\nThe ... there are limits on an investigation you do have a right to a speedy trial and hopefully a judge would enforce that although these days who knows but you do not have the right to a speedy investigation\nIn fact and in an investigation\nAnd go on at ... at for for years on end bankrupt you some people I Know that some people actually taking deals meaning they've they pleaded guilty to something just to make the investigation just to make the investigation and the process and the the trial and they can all stop\nBecause they they're already\nThe process is the punishment so the same way that also and Obama did this rather speaking about shredding constitutional north Obama decided that using prosecutorial discretion he would\nActively abrogate immigration law and say that if you're here legally you're not going to that you will not be deported we will create an extra legal process for you wonder you know the following conditions and he did that all under what is effectively prosecutorial discretion\nThere are lots of ways that this system can be abused if they are going to abuse uh I used to be of the mind more of a I guess at a traditionalist William F Buckley style conserve I used to be the mind you know we have to we have to maintain the principles that that they show quickly abandon\nBut from what I see happening in our politics today I take a position of you know we we've got actually beat them we've got to win otherwise we just suffer and hope that there'll be better times when there's plenty of reason to believe that actually things will just keep getting worse\nAnd that's why yes there is there is a part of me that especially in the aftermath of capital and on any issue related to Kavanaugh says you got to fight fire with fire and in this case that means\nIf they want to do this thing with Hillary we're going to have the do you know we gotta have the D. O. J. really take a good look now that told me who was fired let's remember that was fired from the FBI\nAnd is also I Believe under investigation for possible leaking classified material\nLet's let's take a look at ah at what the FBI determination would be or rather the deal Jay ... actually make the decision not the FBI but whether to bring charges\nLet's see what the deal determination is about Hillary's emails this time around\nAll Bach no we we shouldn't drag the country back into that they wanted the Democrats are openly advocating for dragging the country back into that mess\nMess speaking the FBI by the way you know\nRand Paul is that a tough year year and a half\nRand Paul was holding the FBI feet to the fire a little bit on something that used to get a lot of attention including in conservative circles and that is all this warrantless spying step you'd think they'd given all the Russia collusion insanity this would be a bigger topic here's what here's what Rand Paul to say\nWhile the FBI by and large is full of good people yourself included you have had some bad apples you had Peter Struck and his girlfriend talking about trying to bring the president down you've had people bringing their politics to work\nThe concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is that as Madison said men are not angels that's what we have the constitution that's where we asked you to get a warrant\nThe information you gathered in the foreign database is not constitutional and the sense that has gathered with no bar there is no warrant there is no constitutional manner to that matter to that data\nAnd yet you once and then use it on domestic crime that has been our complained for years and years and years that you should not be allowed to access that data without a warrant\nI agree and I have to say it's a little concerning that given that now on the right we are very aware of the fact that the FBI deal Jay and the intelligence community were in part weaponized against Trump\nThat there has not been any real change in how these processes work or certainly there's been no legislation to prevent this from happening again in remember this all happened after we already had the IRS targeting of Tea Party this this all happened after we should have been aware\nThat or political opponents in in our own country\nWe're willing to abuse the apparatus of government reporters and purposes and there's been no real change\nThere's been you know instead of Democrats pretending like none of us really happen they thought they were going to prove Trump Russia collusion all they're really proven is that the government\nIs full of some deep state leftists who are completely and utterly willing to abuse whatever authority they have to achieve partisan and so you'd think it calls for more oversight and maybe some legislation but uh apparently not\nSeem it as an honor and privilege to bring in my thoughts on all the things that matter to us as Americans every day and you know your opinion matters to that's why I Want to tell you about a new social media site that lets you be heard that lets you share your thoughts without any of the left wing bias any of that nonsense\nInfluencing whether somebody can read your stuff what'd you can even leave your post job nippy dot com it's W. dot com is this new social media platform one that you've all been waiting for\nBecause it does not have any of that left wing conversational health nonsense okay there's none of this moderators with progressive ideology shadow banning you or deleting your stuff\nTwitter's doing this stuff Facebook you know what's going on Snoopy dot com is the answer go check it out to be part of this on line social media revolution S.

washing pose a central issue of twenty\nEighteen is\nHealth care I've seen polling suggests this is the case that people are likely to cast votes based upon their perception of health care what is really going on here what is the state of health care right now as it relates to the midterms and just in general what's going on because somebody can answer this question for us over Roy is with us now\nHe's the president for the foundation for research on equal opportunities also a Forbes\nEditor over great to have you ... bucks\nSo a ... well first of all is this is this concept what'd you say it's accurate I mean are are we are we seeing data to suggest that people as much as we all get told by the media it's all about\nTrump's tweets and Russia collusion and Kavanaugh that it actually might be health care the tips the balance of the of the house in the Senate to one or the other side of the ...\nWell I I haven't seen any polling data fucking I've looked actually pretty closely at this particular question I haven't seen any polling data to suggest that health care right now\nHis motives motivating people to turn out ah for November of having a obviously is a much bigger driver but I Will say that if Democrats are successful in retaking the house or whether or not to take the Senate if they just take the house\nUm and even if they don't somehow whatever happened the midterms are gonna be over you know this book to your listeners know this is seen as the midterms over literally within hours limit turns being over what are we going to start talking about\nThe twenty twenty presidential election in particular in this case the Democratic primary for who's going to challenge Trump and what that primary is going to be all about but it's all going to be about\nWho is going to outbid who who's going to be the true blue purists on single payer Democrats in the primary for president are going to fight over this issue and what Trump is doing in this op ed is he's firing his initial salvo for his reelection campaign\nSo ... where is the healthcare debate right now for between Republicans and Democrats as it stands today I mean you're you're mentioning ... you're you're talking about where the left will go after this election\nWhereas the left positioning itself where Democrats position themselves right now and and what is the Republican pitch on health care\nHe at one of the things that's been fairly interesting and you may have talked about this on the program in the past\nIs that democratic ads about health care and the midterms are actually they're spending more money on health care as the Republicans are\nThey're talking a lot about this Texas lawsuit\nWhich aims to overturn Obamacare the ah by attacking the preexisting conditions provision and Obamacare and so what you have a lot of democratic congressmen and candidates saying is that Republican I'm running against he's against protecting you from a high insurance premium because they're pre existing conditions\nOn for protecting you from that well for me so there is a lot of these races a lot of talk about preexisting conditions in when I'm On Capitol Hill I hear that all the time members asking me like you know what should we do about pre existing conditions\nSo that that is that's the thing you're hearing a lot of it you're not hearing so much about single payer the single payer thing is really about twenty twenty\nSingle payer you think is now going to or I should say is going to be the Democratic party's official ... official position on health care once we're heading into twenty twenty you're you're confident that\nI'm certain of is just like repeal and replace for the Republicans right like what Republicans wanted to be against repealing Obamacare running in elections in the last\nTen years right similarly progressive to dominate the left wing primaries in the Democratic party if you don't say you're for single payer you're not going to win\nAt all you're going to have a primary challenge so every Democrat ills that pressure from the left and frankly most of them genuinely philosophically one single payer even though they believe most most intelligent Democrats believe it's unrealistic and could never happen\nThey do philosophically would they would prefer government takeover of health care system so yeah they're not going to they're not going to deny that therefore single air they're going to say yeah I'm forcing but they're all going to climb over each other to talk about how pro single payer there\nHow how accurate worthy early GOP projections that out you know over you've been involved this discussion stretching back for a long time\nAnd that is why we've got to come out and vote and vote with a passion November\nDog whistles folks dog whistles another way of saying I'm going to call Republicans racist or something that's not racist but I can pretend it is if I say it's a dog whistle as the Reverend Al Sharpton who some will remember from when he was pedaling the yes the rape hoax\nPerpetrated by Warner Brawley who went on to lose in court a defamation case they settled this she than a centrally refuse to pay\nAnd it has since moved into obscurity Africa they did some update on to want to Raleigh a few years ago and found that she was living somewhere and just trying to avoid having to pay anything on the defamation settlement that she\nUh she lost so you can imagine\nWhen you hear today from people saying oh are you blaming the victim well the court blamed the so called victim they're these so called survivor 'cause she wasn't a victim are survivors we found out what let's say focus for a moment on they're stopping for his point is Trump brought this up you gave a speech what was the road and a weak mentioned stop and frisk for Chicago\nAnd here's what they say about this\nThey won't claim that New York the most visible single place to have instituted a stop and frisk policy and it was done under Mayor Bloomberg was we know from today\nDemocrat Bloomberg was Democrat he was an independent member\nRemember when he says yeah those those uh those speeches about the snow\nAnd then and then they would they had the interpreter and and and but Bloomberg would\nGo into a little like he'd be like yo soy Mayor Bloomberg God Bless that and you all you know you do as little Bloomberg\nEspanol ... I I that was great that was great those are separate times producer my Mayor Bloomberg would slip into his hundred words of Spanish that he spoke in order to just let it let New Yorkers know\nThat uh you know the snow is cold and they will move it we we wrap you do that would only have seen the ... year coming wow\nWe we didn't know what we had you see the ... by the way so there's the mayor of New York city and gave me a needs to be told that\nA major city hit somebody ... was talking about housing for homeless he's like I'm Sorry I'm In the middle of my work out it's like oh you mean to work out that you do at the gym that requires a fleet of SUVs and take you an hour from the mayor's mansion\n... 'cause you like that Jim in Brooklyn but this guy doesn't do anything all day it's an hour to get there an hour to get back he works out I guess per hour we know that he spends all of his time on the elliptical let's be real\nLot of stretching it a lot of electrical and you know ... when somebody comes up to them and the gym he's a public official he gets all Snoopy about it he's a he's a sniffy system the man anyway um\nI just I'm just saying Bloomberg maybe running as a as a Democrat or he was the one or he's going to run as a Democrat at least that's what people are saying as of today run for the twenty twenty race he had stop and frisk what a stop and\nFrisk alright it allows people to allow law enforcement to on\nA reasonable suspicion stop and talk to you and then if they think it is necessary for safety they can pat you down\nNow they say that this is inherently racist and the reason for that is that you have\nA large number of these stop and frisk hundreds and thousands hundreds of thousands of these stops that occurred over a period of many years in New York they say oh well you have a disproportionate number of\nA black and Hispanic males who were stopped and either talk to or poor padded down looking for weapons and some people say it's racist interesting when you actually crunched the numbers on that you find out that as a\nAs it relates to the proportion in New York City of crimes committed by people who fall into the demographic of black or Hispanic males they were actually stopped lash\nWhen you control for the number of crimes committed by people in different categories less than their share overall but still people say it's bad optics and they say that it's you know it looks bad and the and then they they point to the fact that New York is in a crowd and continued downward trajectory on crime part\nIs that reality for America's biggest city has been ongoing for a long time now this is like showing up in\nIn the in the final stages of something and saying well this is this happened because I showed up but it's like wow it was already happening in the crime was already happening\nThe only point I think it's fair to make on this is that conservative along did say to get rid of stop and frisk there'll be a big spike and crime and we haven't seen that in New York City okay so that's a little bit of a background on stopping for Trump is saying let's just stop and frisk in Chicago\nAt ACLU types at all and they freak out of a stop and frisk but here's the thing about doing stop and frisk and Chicago nobody had any ideas for how to make Chicago a less crime ridden place I mean the the\nA number of shooting people think of ... and I looked at it obviously is going to get the most headlines because when you have a weekend in Chicago with twelve people killed\nOr you know more than that it's when we go to whatever it is I mean they've had these these weakens with forty fifty people shot you look at the numbers shot it's an elope it's in the low fat house in Chicago all and people getting shot or stabbing a given year\nThat's a lot of people\nThat are getting shot no one has any solutions or any ideas for this all I hear from lips and I get to talk to them when they come on on the hill TV show\nAll your from lives is we need to invest more in schools I'm like yeah 'cause that's why the gang bangers selling drugs it it's it's because there's not enough investment a local public school would come on this isn't serious\nBut they they have no idea is no solutions for whatsoever and what you find is that you know they don't want to talk about real structural change like why do we\nAll the studies show that the the biggest single German or whether a neighborhood if you know how many single parents are are in a neighborhood statistically speaking you have a very good sense of what the crime rate will be and that when you control for intact household meaning you know a a mother and father both in the household\nThirty to toss ups according to the real clear politics average here thirty to toss ups which means\nThat the Republicans are going to have to buck the trend I Know why aren't we are in order to in an\nOff year at a in a a mid year ... mid term cycle as a party in power manage to hold onto their majorities will see governors races by the way geo piece looking pretty good there too\nSo despite all the things you hear it right now I I think that we should just remember not only does history show us that this stuff can be wrong I must say will be 'cause I don't believe anybody can predict the future as you know I'm very consistent\nWith that I think that you can you can have some fun with your speculation on prognostications especially as a political pundit because no one ever forget your losers producer Mike it's like the secret of being a stockbroker just got to make sure you focus on your winters meant if you're right fifty percent of the time but you're really charming guy who tells everybody about all your winters\nVery successful stockbroker owner members of losers they don't pay enough attention so\nIn politics same thing it's got to make you make it a few bold predictions you get one or two of them right and all of a sudden you are\nThe fear of all things political or the fact that by the way you get\nThe Senate race in New Jersey with Menendez the fact that that's even competitive I Know it's Jersey and I know you're a Jersey resident producer Mike\nI Know you're you're you're a you're a sophisticated Jersey fellow by the way John we liked the Mike beer do eat the my beard is good you guys got a real got some real facial hair going on now\nEverybody loves it except the parents\nWhat is it with parents not like not only do you know what it is you're their little you're their little my you know you're always little Mike yeah so you know they they think of you as being the same thing with me my parents don't like facial hair I mean either\nSent my parents' picture last night I was out some friends in the Senate pictures you know shown where I was and get to respond to this one from one for that\n[laughter] they're both like what's with the beard what's going on my mom's like I said I'll send you a razor wire\nYeah [laughter] but this is stuff that I'm getting columnist in the office so I'm keeping it and that leaves and the officer\nAll ... and they think the beer that can be very very distinguished like but you know it's a generational thing two beers or in right now yeah you go back to the seventies and everybody had the uh the you know the airline pilots dash white an airline pilots still keep the stash never got an answer to this though whenever they have some kind of an\nAirline related incident and all of a sudden you get these former pilots on TV and they they all have the stash Sally ... they've all got the ... which\nYou know hey look they pull it off I I give him credit for it but are this

radio five weeks when [noise]\nShe's holding the line for America bugs accent is that [noise]\nForget that the little while ago I wrote a story\nAbout how woman tried to bring an emotional support peacock\nOn an airplane with her and I thought you know\nAs crazy as that is at least give her points for creativity because you yeah you can obviously bring your emotional support elephant on the plane too big not off like a lot of leg room\nBut could you bring a peacock theoretically on a plane with you yes you could now people are starting to crack down on this and and I got to say that there is a I've got mixed emotions about it\nThere was a woman who tried to get on a flight from frontier airlines in Orlando, Florida or just a few\nDays ago and she held this flight up for two hours you know why John she wanted to bring on her emotional support squirrels\nAnd sure enough they had a problem with that because there is a policy that frontier airlines does not allow rodents aboard flight so they they are and she wrote in at frontier airlines will harsh harsh\nOut but I've got to say if you're trying to expand your horizons for what could be\nA ... a good pet turns out that I Know that rats believe it or not and this is really this is weird for some folks rats are pretty smart and can make good pets\nWhich when you see them in the subways do here in New York City you think to yourself why would anybody ever want to have one of those they look terrifying they carry all kinds of diseases but if you keep rats clean they are pretty smart and can make affectionate pets so I Would think a score it would be in the same category so that she does a part of me John it's like hey\nMaybe she's got a really close bond\nWith this world maybe this world\nIs very meaningful to her and you can't separate a person from their emotional support squirrel but then there's the other side of that had to wait for hours and hours just last week for Southwest Airlines flight that was delayed John are we supposed to take off as a one hour flight\nFrom Las Vegas to San Diego and it was going to take off at eight thirty in the morning you know in that flight actually took off seven pm at night\nAlmost a twelve hour delay for not for weather weather as weather right that's that's a\nThat's got deciding that you're going to have a bad day or no for mechanical issues\nAnd I can tell you that I lose patients very quickly when I'm In that airport lab and not lounge airport area\nYou know the little chairs they set up at all face each other it's kinda creepy sit there you have to look at somebody else you tend not to be staring at them but you're staring at them\nAnd they don't want you to obviously you don't want to lose your temper uh but what can you do there's not much you can do show on the one hand I feel like emotional supports whirl I'm sympathetic on the other hand I feel like\nIf I were there and I was told\nThat somebody was holding up my flight for a couple of hours so that they could have their emotional support squirrel handy or I might make some squirrel could Bob I might just lose it and I bet squirrels probably not a particularly tasty meat\nBut I Would feel I find out one way or the other that squirrel that that emotional support squirrel would probably be toast and I'm going to get all the hate bill from Pete in that but we eat we eat out all kinds of animals you know I eat\nObviously coward pig pigs are smart I've actually hung out with pet pigs before will micro pigs are kind of a fun thing ... why do we draw the line John at squirrels\nWhy do we discriminate against emotional support squirrels but we think the cat somehow or the superior species I don't have an answer for\nTruth is you give me the choice between a pet squirrel and pet cat I don't know squirrels much more portable or they are good at\nHoarding their own food you know they bury the little acorn and stuff there there's a lot to recommend squirrels anyway have you know the emotional support animals scam is looks like it's coming to it and I have friends who have gone to the whole process of getting a little best for their dog did you get an emotional support best or that is one of its as a service dog\nAnd you have to be allowed in everywhere with service dog because of people who have\nReal issues that the service dog is addressing now there's been a little bit of a of an explosion of people that say that whenever the dog like they have a service Chihuahua and they put a little vest on it and it will say\nDepartment of public health state rug black and how do you have you had at least two chemists who were falsifying data one of them was a snorting up a lot of the evidence or out in Amherst it may be elsewhere\nSo today the state's highest court the ashtray seat vacated thousands of drug convictions based on drug tests collect conducted at a state crime lab in Amherst\nIn a sweeping ruling the condemn misconduct by a rogue states chemist two former prosecutors yesterday she ordered the dismissal of every case every case that involved methamphetamine drug evidence during the nine years the former state chemists on your ...\nWorked at the amorous lab in every case the analyzed at the lab for two thousand\nAnd until her arrest the outside the courthouse where she was smoking crack in January twenty Thirteen\nOr in April prosecutors across Massachusetts agree to dismiss all cases ... analyzed self about eleven thousand and all but said it was unnecessary to make it any more\nNow the reason I wanted to bring this up is because uh should be an issue in the race for attorney general because the two prosecutors who were uh excoriated were uh basically total misconduct committing a fraught upon the court has a severe court judge ruled last year\nThey worked for Mara healing the incumbent attorney general er and er and and the I noticed I I read the the decision very early at sixty pages but\nThe thing that really stuck out was that the Supreme judicial court the kind of covered for um\nFor for um Mara Healy\nUm I did\nMisconduct by the office of the attorney general was limited to foster and ... these are the two assistant attorney general is both of whom by the way are making over a hundred thousand dollars a year now in a different state jobs\nSo they're saying that it was the was the conduct was limited to these two people so joining us now on the line is the Republican candidate for attorney general of the commonwealth of Massachusetts Jay McMahon or Jay do you think ah do you think Mara Healy a should or should take\nSome of the responsibility for the uh for the fraud upon the court that was a committed by two of her underlings\nThere Jay\nThank you for having me on and everyone in New England or how we it goes like this everybody knew this was a very serious case yes very serious matter it\nHad more I had to be in on this jihad didn't know it it is incredible that think they got a huge problem and the state drug lab and she doesn't know about it\nI mean they're getting him at some defense attorneys all over the place and and and even a district attorney said tell us what's going on\nTell us what we need to know tell us\nTell us how how we can\nUm uh well how are we supposed to respond to this on discovery that was the main issue\nSo why would they ah I I mean this is a rhetorical question but I'll let you tread why would the uh the ashtray seek cover up for more helium and uh you know ... ... excuse to be the misconduct in her office\n[noise] well I'll tell you what the only thing I could think of the reason that they would do that is that when a judge carry at is hearings initially\nUm although he had a lot to say about the operations of the office a Mari Haley probably did not testify and the other the other uh no one no one asked\nHow far up this go they just knew that it was cast Mary and foster or handling those cases but the point is these people\nDid not cast Merrick and foster they didn't have the authority to speak on behalf of the journey general's office Molly Haley yet but they didn't ask ... what he was doing in that off but I got to tell you this\nAnd this is what's most egregious because the judge was correct and the court is correct when they said it's a fraught upon the court right when the when the prosecutor is asked for discovery information and they said they don't have\nThey not only saying it's a defense attorney but they are also saying it to the court so when they said we don't have any more information and they do it justice and that's why the U.S Jaycee said all these cases have to go\nNow you you should I Will ... will send out a the column I wrote about this the the decision ran a over a hundred pages long I wrote a double column on it\nBut these the the ah the findings by this judge carry a and last year I mean there were amazing one of the state cops who was investigating it went and said all these all these ... or perks a you know really serious opioids had disappeared and we need to do an investigation and one of these assistant attorney general is employed by ... he said\nWe really want to make it that puff on ourselves or worse to that effect\nI mean people are going to work as an on on the evidence that doesn't exist and they're saying she sounds do too well why are we making it too tough on ourselves this is a this is bad\nStorm Jay\nThis this is how we I've been telling everybody on the trail on the campaign trail this is the problem when you have and you don't have a lower cost me first and you've got political activists was only interested in covering up tracks and not coming off the justice\nJustice demands now this result that the U.S Jaycee is given\nAre going to raise this debate Jay are you going to raise ... debate when's the next day you're\nWhat the next debate is the twenty fourth the twenty fourth of this month and the people out and yet the Boston Globe and they're going to happen in this story that's going to be a very interesting because they're the moderators\nWell Jay ... were that were kind of people go I'm sure you've got a statement on this work and people go to read your statement on this what the website I'll\nI'll tell you what we're putting it on our Facebook show all they have to do is go to a a editor any Jay McMahon and they're going to get they'll fight it right on Facebook and we'll also be up on our website a DJ McMahon dot com\nOkay and I'm going to I'm going to tweet out the column I wrote last year

Springfield [noise]\nThat uh you know we we shouldn't get too enamored with the notion of having a very prominent wealthy black celebrity like ... so friendly and familiar with the president and working with him on policy issues by the way you know you you can say this about a lot of people in a lot of different situations\nAre we allowed to embrace that he's\nSaying things that we like and pushing ideas that we like now or do we have to say well a long time ago he he had or even ten years ago whatever was he had a different perspective so would that invalidate them now that's not a standard that we hold any once you've never mind to a celebrity so you know there's a little bit of\nI don't know if you'd say trust but verify but there's some applause with caution here I think in order for the whole Conyers situation and then there's also the everybody just needs to calm the hack down\nOur meeting was acting like Trump went and play Eighteen holes with Kim Jong on which let's be honest I could probably happen sometime pretty soon but they were acting like this was some\nCrazy thing that he had ... talk to him and saying oh he profane the uh profane the office of the presidency by doing this by cursing in there you know this is the same office\nLiterally V. office the oval office where Bill Clinton did a whole lot more in a way of profane stuff\nThen have a guest who cursed\nBut there are no standards the media really applies to any there's there's no there's no truth necessary for what they say oh they just want to find ways to hate and to criticize the president and there's always ways to do that he hears a perfect example of what I'm Talking about John of Brazil\nWhom I managed to a debate a few times in CNN and who\nI was always treated with tremendous difference I mean they really love Donna Brazil at CNN so I was supposed to be there to get a buck slapped if you will be ... or ... ... you know what I mean ... bucks slap\n'em and\nIn turn I actually managed to turn the tables on her and she told me she interrupted be once told me to stop interrupting her was a pretty amazing thing I don't know some of you may be even seen that\nBut I was never impressed with her so she was treated out and she is treated out the following in response is ... this was a I think she was she was DNC chair German and then she gave the questions to Hillary remember he got fired from CNN\nShe treated at the following an in response to this whole economy thing today Kanye West has set us back one hundred and fifty five years\nWish Sojourner Truth met with him outside the White House and Frederick Douglass inside the oval office Brock Obama never would have become president with this crap but lets me Kanye on election day by voting for Democrats I mean the the end of that is fine if she wants to propagandize were Democrats she's totally free to do that\nBut just say the ... has set back\nUh I I guess when she says set us back I wouldn't want to put words in your mouth but I'm assuming she means the black community centers back a hundred and fifty five years\nWell this one does the math on that it seems a bug she's making a pretty pointed reference there and how is that what a reasonable rational person would say\nHere you have a world famous black millionaire in the oval office embracing the president of the ... literally embracing I'm giving him a hug\nAnd sharing ideas with them and sharing lunch with him this is the leader of the free world this is a man talking about Trump now\nTanya probably thinks he's the leader of the free world among other things among being a deity a but\nThere's no ... there's no way any ... normal human being could look at this and so yeah that's degrading for any group of people never mind for black Americans but this is\nJust the oval office\nAnd I think that the way they get to this is two fold one day they hate Trump so much that they're blinded with rage about him all the time but also they don't really accept the Trump is the president they they have\nThis is this is true about the less now and it explains a lot explains a lot of their mob mentality and the mob actions in the way that they've been willing to cast\nAside basic decency and decorum and to justify this behavior to themselves and to others in the\nMedia and it's because they don't really think that he's the president they think that he is a fraud or he is a ...\nInterlopers he's a pretend or to the throne if you will\nAnd so he doesn't deserve any of the respect that one would give a present he doesn't deserve any of the deference to the office if not to the man himself and so if that were your perspective if you were that\nDo looted with with rage\nUh not disconnected from the truth then I could see how maybe you'd feel that ... hugging this man that they think is such a fraud in the oval office and having this very warm report is demeaning but joining normal person that's just crazy it's crazy that is the most accurate way\nTo describe it and there were some meltdowns today there were some meltdowns that were incredible I mean\nEthic meltdowns where is that the job that we have an MSNBC oh my God\n... she and ... an rule\nWho are this duo and MSNBC that I've seen a few times now\nIs they went into Pearl clutching\nLevel ten over this thing you know what let's

celebrity President Trump is a celebrity president to\nShow you know we're going to be honest here\nBut Obama being a celebrity president was considered to have cache it was cool that he was a celebrity President Trump in his lab the president is he's a buffoon a clown he's on serious he's you know a bad guy all that stuff\nThis is where you see the the separation this is where\nYou see how the media doesn't treat same things the same way and it's all based on their perception of the individual which is based on you know this this political polarization that has now taking over

it doesn't mean anything it's interesting and here's a guy who you know and not another part of this that I Will say I find I Do find distressing\nIs that you've had a lot of media people saying that well we can't take ... seriously because because he's mentally ill\nI think that's a really disgusting thing to do just because ... had shot mental health treatment at one point it does not mean that he does not get to have a voice you'll be taken seriously the rest of the rest of his life in fact that's a terrible message to seven and a lot of people you know I Know people\nWho are incredibly successful who have had real mental health struggles and we want people to always go it'd be like saying oh you've got a terrible infection and your legs don't go see a doctor right\nThat's that would be crazy same thing for a bit of a mental health problems so to stigmatize in that way and say ... because you sought treatment for I think it was bipolar disorder but I don't remember 'em then we

is that's a misnomer al ... has made a large portion of the African American community upset about his comments about race or about his comments about slavery so uh at this\nWhen Kanye West um he's exposing himself more and more in the highest office in the land this is not just a moment on TMZ this is not just a moment and ... on ... with us being the car the ashes of whatever that show is this for the world to see the world saw Kanye West\nAnd the raw reality TV show we were watching I mean there were that that\nCan you can use John do I mean give me a favor just play the beginning of that when we're just just the first couple of us wanna make sure everyone here is actually starts us off\nThere is a concern right now I mean what I heard not sound like someone [noise]\nComing clearly to talk to the president about issues that are that are in the black community when it comes to\nOkay so ... clearly you know she's she's also when there's a very serious in her analysis of all this but you do have\nThese these groups these uh these different panels on TV who go on there and they will discuss specifically the county well a Kanye West was\nYou know in ... in a place where you had to go seek mental health treatment\nYou know they'll say that oh he's crazy essentially for a prominent but what they're saying this is what they're saying for a ... a prominent black celebrity in America to embrace Trump and ... and believe in this movement\nIs evidence of being crazy or is only possible if you are crazy that's what they're saying\nI don't think that they know who the crazy one really is but that's what they are telling you\nI Can't help but notice that one of the\nUh favorite tactics of the Soviet Union that continued on even into the Newton era for dealing with the most hated political critics of the regime you\nDon't just want to lock up the political credit card you don't want to lock up dissidents and they become heroes they become martyrs if you kill them\nBut what if you can get them committed to a psychiatric facility what if somebody who criticizes the government can be declared insane by the state and committed to be with other crazy truly crazy people in sub par horrific conditions in\nThe interior of Russia or in Siberia that's what they used to do they still do it there were allegations they still do it at least in Russia\nIf you are too much of a thorn in the administration side I guess in the regime side they will have you committed they've done it before they ... they tried to do to journalists by the way\nAs well they have not yet to my knowledge kidnapped chopped up and uh and kill the journalist in a conflict of a foreign country but we'll talk about that we'll talk about the show the issue in third hour or two that I'm going to spend some real time on that went through because it's a big deal\nIt's a big deal raised some very interesting questions for us and we're talking Saudi Arabia you're talking about something that does have an effect on the economy and and is not it's not possible to just\nCoordinate often pretend like it's not there but back to what they're saying oh you're here here's the better and so you got a variety there she obviously he's very opposed to Conyers saying this stuff and he's not addressing the concerns of the black community I also just think it's such a\nIt's always taken for granted that the black community views politics from this perspective from this completely United and singular perspective and know group of people but there are\nThe black human as rough it's about eleven or twelve percent of the country I think right now if you're talking about let's call thirty to forty million Americans are black\nThirty or forty million Americans are black I'm sure you know ...\nIt's it's the size of a it's a good sized country just on its own the black humid in this country there are so many ideas and so many different approaches to politics within that community but
