that the\nCabin all effect in any state that's read where there's a Democrat who's trying to pull the usual you know Democrat oh I'm kind of centrist on these things I'm sort of a conservative Democrat had fake is that's not gonna fly that's not going to work\nUm the dynamic of this playing out right now is the uh the\nKnicks playing out is that in states where\nIt's clearly a red state and the conservatives Republicans have the advantage Trump showing up for base turnout trumpet showing up to make sure the base remembers that they need to be a part of what's going on here in this midterm election\nBut the dynamic and I think is really interesting and you're not hearing you talk about the media because they're all they're they're actively wishing in a way they hope it goes away and it is that in\nA elections that are in states where it's kind of a you know a a Democrat in a in a red state you know it's a little bit of a of a close circle all across the board\nThey want people to come and speak about the cabinet ... won't Lindsey Graham to go and speak because that's a reminder to anyone who's toward the center of just how you cannot trust the Democrats with power\nSo in very red in very red states to get the base out you're going to have a lot of talk about you're going to have Trump visiting Trump's getting the base fired up he's going to get them to show up at the polls are great\nBut in states where it's a close circle where it's a little more purple where there you're going to have\nThe Lindsey Graham's of the GOP showing up and saying remember what they did the Kavanaugh\nYou can't put these people you can't trust these people with power you are not being a responsible citizen if you think that these Democrats should be given any any more authority and they're already have all the wives the American people\nAnd cabinet could be the game changer think about what a political miscalculation the Democrats made their think about what that what really happened they thought\nThat they would stop the Supreme Court sheet from going to a conservative constitution list and even if they couldn't stop it they would be rewarded by their base for just going thermonuclear\nTo try to stop just due to scorched earth do everything they could but what we're seeing is they didn't anticipate\nThat in a lot of close fought elections in suburban parts of America are a lot of Republican women are furious about what happened to Capitol furious\nAnd they want to make a statement and they're coming out to vote you know if your a pink hat wearing you know meet your T shirt emblazoned left wing feminist you already we're going to vote and you hate Trump doesn't matter but if somebody was like well you know sometimes a I'm a little bit\nYou know ... with some of what Trump has done it but you're you're a Republican woman and you see what they did the Kavanaugh what the Democrats did and what that would mean for the future of this country going forward a lot of them are absolutely\nFired up about this and that could be the game change it could be the enthusiasm among center right women in suburban districts that makes this house contest it's going to be down to the wire this is going to be really close I think\nCould still go to the Republicans oh that would feel like a miracle but it could still\nHappen and\nIt's going to be

that it's just something that happened they were in control of it and you know things things go bad and there'll be better in the future or something like that\nAnd then I remember the Saudis are in

have no basis you certainly don't have any jurisdiction but no basis for sending any kind of investigative team unless\nOne the Turks allow it 'cause it's Turkish it's Turkish sovereignty\nOr I mean it's on Turkish soil and to the Saudis would have to allow because of the council it so you are multiple levels of complexity added into what\nWould already be an investigation that is highly sensitive and I don't know who we think we can really trust and that whole process either I mean we don't send Americans to do this I Would be very suspicious of what information we get it how we get

B. I. you ask for a miracle I bring you the F. B. I. C. get that one\nNot really it's it's true that Rosenstein has somehow managed to stay in this role and well I think it's because he knows that the hashtags resistance and Trump knows is to just not worth getting rid of them the hash tag resistance would call him politically and utterly freak out\nIf in fact there was a a ... a removal of Rosenstein from his duties\nBut some people don't care\nYou got the chairman of the Freedom Caucus Mark Meadows he is calling on Rosenstein\nTo step down as a ... a deputy attorney general because lawmakers are looking into reports about how roads

a wire to try and trap just even the CIA director I I think I Would have been scored it out of the building by secured by armed security I think they would have been like okay you're ... if I said that in a meeting in front of people but for the deputy attorney general to say it\nI've gone back and forth on this I don't I don't think he was kidding I think that became the excuse but the more I thought about it I'm not sure what the latest if you're like ... two weeks ago he said he was kidding yeah but I thought about it more I don't know like I wasn't there that's all I can do is base it on the things that I've heard\nBut you know Rosenstein or has he look he's an Obama administration hold over and he's clearly very tight with the DEA OJ bureaucracy and the bureaucracy protects itself\nBut that's why Mark Meadows is finally had enough\nHere's with Fox News reports about meadows of the Freedom Caucus she says that he made the comments about Rosenstein stepping down as James

you're a service economy the way to stimulate your economy the way to grow your economy is to allow consumers to buy goods as cheaply as they possibly can and use the rest of their money to buy services or if they're lucky enough to have anything that raises the price of a good\nDoesn't make sense for our economy even if they're paying it to the government as a tariff it's just another tax\nBefore we are close out here when I asked her real quick here to get from a grade on the economy a threat what would it be so far\nWell you know I'd have to qualify that I Would say on a general parents have pretty good regulations are dying and taxes are down but I I gave him more credit which is pseudo credit and that is he's a great cheerleader and there is such a\nThing as subjectivity in in cheerleading\nAnd you know an economy that people do respond in a positive way uh this way but the economy has done better but it's all it's sort of like you're doing well if you could borrow millions of dollars every every month you know so uh but the economy on the surface is good but it's not sound as not last name is based on that\nAnd the payment will come too soon\nI'm sure many recognize that second voice that was Ron Paul man himself who saying it's all going to come crashing down\nBefore that you had Gary Cohn who is very much the establishment voice in and were economy is right now and he's saying you know services gotta ... it's all about services gotta keep good cheap got to get people buying stuff that you know Walmart and I was going to say here's our eyed peas years all righty\nBut these are very different views of what's going on right now here's what I Would say about the Ron Paul um let me let me see what the rump all suffers that was from an interview we did on rising by the way we're going to speak to for Congressman Paul [noise] ah [noise] he's right\nRon Paul is right mathematically historically he is correct or there is\nA very clear history of currency\nIn a in the history of the world and it is that fewer currency always ends in disaster and financial calamity it's very clear that there's there's no exception it always ends very very badly\nNow that shed Ron Paul saying that the economy right now is not found a way too much debt and all that she can be right put on what timeline\nAnd if Ron Paul is right that the economy is going to crash fifty years from now\nYou have to ask yourself today how much do you care I Know we don't like to say oh for my kids and my grandkids and but how much do you really care and beyond that if it's fifty years from now how do you leave the Next Fifty years right how do you\nTry to make money in the markets or how do you try to move on to your career and pay off your house deal with the the basic financial challenges that we all have ride telling telling you that the stock market might go to zero and our our dollar maybe worth nothing which I I don't think that's ever going to happen but even if it were true that happened to fifty years that's not very useful information right now\nTo Ron Paul's been saying that the economy was going to crash out for a very long time and it was kind of writing two thousand eight we came on the precipice I get that are two thousand nine\nBut I don't think that he's right right now I just put his I put his words\nIn there because I Do think that it's a long term warning and especially as we are considering now the possibility of dealing with some of the entitlement programs that are the big drivers of our dead\nWe got to remember that we're we're heading into we're heading to a bad place might not be\nTwo years from now might be twenty we're heading to a bad place as an economy unless we do something about it and it's very hard to get the political\nWill you know look this is I go home and I'm like you know what I I\nReally wish I'd get lean again enough that that I Would just see all my muscles right that'd be fun but you know it's more fun than than putting myself on that pretty strict routine of calories a calories in calories out and all that you know it's more fun eating a big gluten free donut when I get home\nThat's the thing they exist or you know deciding to just eat half of wheel of breed that's fun right now and when you're dealing with long term projection sneak and it was in pre amazing breeze always so good when did you live in long term projections in the economy\nDoes that sound will do fancy I like the ... the ... the ah I also like American cheese on America Jews I'm a burger yesterday was delicious [noise]\nUh [noise] nobody wants to be the one that has to think long term no one wants to be the one that I have to think strategically about is you want to deal with your immediate needs answer Ron Paul as I said he's right but when we just don't know\nThat doesn't mean we shouldn't take action or just means we need to be aware that\nThe action is not going to come quickly and we should balance out what are what what what risks are acceptable what systemic risks are acceptable to our our economy for children and grandchildren's economies\nAre and then you Gary calling with tariffs on China I I really hope that Trump is right on this one I've given up a lot of credit on the ... issue and um I've been willing to say that\nI ... I Know what the I Know what the argument is against terrorists but I Know the the smart set is almost always an entirely opposed to terms\nTrump has taken a different approach and I think he has earned the right to try and play it out however he can that said ah I Do have some concerns about where this is where this is going to have the economy it's been a ... a few weeks\nAnd people are ... ... people have seen some stuff that's going on right now and the economy and that's\nThat's when you got to start really thinking about what's what's happening next because I'm telling you the Democrats easiest path to power is a recession we're they turn all just raised it created on the left and they mobilize it and they're going to mobilize it in the direction of socialist that's what they're going to do that is what is coming\nA so by the way I really do recommend you all checkout book event dot com it's a project I'm working all the fans were research because our go where the market is going that's different from the overall economy but if you weren't or the stock market is going\nBook invent dot com smartest guys I've ever met when it comes to the market and we're doing a big event on October twenty fourth totally free\n... dot com sign up check it out you'll see I'll be hosting some other experts I'm just a host\nLike a game show host but they're the guys are actually spending the wheel you know what I mean\nIt'll be a lot of fun to do check that out but I I'm gonna keep watching the economy and see what's happening I just hope things stay steady until election day [noise]\nYou know I just saw the c._e._o. of global verification network earlier this week we caught up in the swamp here in DC\nAnd I said you know how's business going how's your growing so rapidly and getting so many new clients on board he said well simply put but we're all about making sure that people's data is George did they get fast\nAnswers and that they know the all the work is being done here the United states by trained professionals that's what you get when it comes to background investigations and vetting with global verification network also whenever you call them you'll get a person who answers your call and answers your questions right away\nCall a seven seven six nine five one one seven nine eight seven seven six five one one seven I jumped ... cents you this is a veteran owned and operated company my friends you can also go to my\nGV and dot com that's my GV N. dot com for all background investigations whatever size you were come\nThe skills you can develop as a soldier in the Army National guard can give you an edge in the high tech job market of tomorrow the guard offers\nCareer training to take advantage of your skills as science technology engineering and math\nThat can help give you a leg up to a high paying and rewarding them for ... get a head start on your careers well any money to pay for college log on to the national guard dot com to learn about all of the sim career opportunities in the Army National guard sponsored by the Massachusetts Army National guard in Massachusetts broadcast association at this station\nYou've been in an accident you need a lawyer but hiring the wrong lawyer can lead to an even bigger actually the truth is some lawyers would rather settled your case quickly than go to trial to get you the money you deserve\nAnd Alex into two though we're experienced trial lawyers will go to court when necessary in the insurance companies know it does cause a second accident called seven eight one zero zero zero zero to lawyers you could top\nNews radio five sixty WHYY ends casino cash text this nationwide keyword or say heart radio and pull standard data admit to drain supply and this nationwide contest good luck from Youth Radio five sixty WHYY end use radio buy fig\nAnd you really have to wonder why that is why is it that Farrah Khan continues to or it is able to continue saying the kind of things that he says doing the things that he does\nHe doesn't get banned from Twitter by the way he that to my knowledge is not being kicked off a social media platforms and he says stuff like this play clubs three\nMembers of the Jewish community that don't like me\nThank you very much for putting my name all over the planet [noise]\nBecause of your fear\nOf what we represent [noise]\nI can go anywhere in the world and they hurt or far [noise]\nI'm not mad at you\nBecause you're so stupid [noise]\nSo when they talk about ...
