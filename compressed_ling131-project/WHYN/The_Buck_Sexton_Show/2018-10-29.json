{"month": "10", "state": "MA", "station": "WHYN", "content": "She had collected Fifteen hundred I never never imagined that the problem would be to the extent that it was\nSo we didn't we didn't even look at the signature as a volunteer or had picked up the pages a last weekend and started looking at him and pointed out to us that they always say ...\nOh so you've got a trip from the people from people who were actually looking at the signatures\nAbout just how bad this thing was you know that's how you found out I don't\nKnow actually we had picked up a the papers because she had sent out a a fundraising letter which she uh lifted registrar age which is the correct term for the position so we said let's look at our papers to see if she all her nomination papers have the incorrect a term for that position\nBut they weren't they were correct so they were just sitting at a table tell a\nVolunteer actually just picked up and started flipping through the pages and then clean it out you know there's more problems than that and then we recognize some of that names that appear to be incorrectly list a written and we started calling them and the first ten people all said those are not our signatures\nThat Maria there he had turned out of ten it's a pretty good pretty high rate of uh problems [laughter] that's\nWhat when you thought and then we immediately started to pull things together that we've had had concerns ever since we have a Stephanie Barry wrote an article out here describing\nMr ... being a ... in the restricted area of the courthouse and campaign uh being her campaign manager\nThis guy and she always for most people even in Springfield I don't even though they remember Frank ... this guy who's the political operative who's running a Cheryl a\nSherlock Coakley ... campaign\nOr who is he's a he's a jail bird isn't going to be ...\nAh yeah he served jail time and has conducted felonies and that's why we were concerned to here he was in certain areas of the court house according to the article\nBut other things started to come up from the campaign they're looking at a finance campaign finance report and uh so we realized the rules were always be all out by our opponent but we never imagined we would find what we did when we picked up those papers\nI'm and I'm looking at the uh I'm looking at the story in the Republican it's so spray kill was remained the pope figure in local politics despite spending three years in federal prison\nFederal prison for fleecing a taxpayer funded homeless shelter he wants to win and Springfield see any relation to the hospital and family [laughter] you know\nI I don't know and I've I've never met Frank ... but uh by what you read in the papers what I've read in the paper a when a myth bury a started to do the investigation\nSo I'll be ... so what do you go to I mean how do you I mean again this is a this is far down on the on the ballot most people you know or you know not even sure what the register of beads does it till they buy a house or how to how ... how do you get the word out to people about what's been going on in this ... this fight\nWell I think the important thing is that we do start discussing that because registered gate signatures matter [laughter] you can't just have an e signatures on transfer date\nDetails and the rule of law are essential to the uh position so I think even though it's time to pat time has passed a we still have to discuss the fact that the rules were not all it when it was about a ... writing day nomination papers and then also it's very important for us to talk about\nThe ... ... what actually happened to some people people's identities were taken there were ... and those people have the right to have their some sort of resolution to that problem\nSo that will probably go beyond anything in regards to the election but we have to address both those issues and the most we can do is just start talking about it\nSo I mean these are the are the people who signature who claim their signatures were stolen or are they going to ... or are they going to seek a criminal complaints here\nAren't that's really up to them and they have standing we don't have standing in regards to that the only thing we can do is we have to ask the secretary of state to do an investigation not only in what happened here\nBut also how can this not happening in the future because it was a with the secretary state was totally local town clerk's you don't make that decision but then it wasn't being made at the secretary of state's office set of probably has to be some safeguards put into place\nAs regards to the campaign where asking or poll watchers to command a we feel the irregularities that came out of the\nUh signatures on the Springfield office uh will help trigger that and asking for a poll watchers and unfortunately we're also asking for the recusal of\nThe registrar a voters for this election because she is the former assistant to share of whole Clinton era\nWell ... have you challenged Coakley Rivera to a debate to explain or how how all these uh allegedly fraudulent signatures ended up on her nomination papers\nWell we asked for with Asperger's debate numerous times a campaign forums as she has not agree to any of that she finally had agreed to a debate which will be friday afternoon twelve thirty well into the end of the early voting period\nAnd that will be out on channel twenty and then and I look forward to asking a numerous question in regards to how she's been running her campaign from whether it to her campaign manager as to uh the campaign finance report and then I laid the issue for the signatures\nFriday twelve pm on I'm guessing you're I'm guessing the debate will be ending friday at one ... so you're going to get you're going to get a whopping thirty minutes\nActually that that was what Nokia ended up ... residents don't and voters don't have a right to ask her questions which is disappointing I always look for a Jew a candidate forums where we can really hear what questions are Marie\nMarie and Julie these you're you're an attorney for ... working people go to learn more about your campaign for register the\nUh Marie M. A. R. I. E. that number four D. D. E. D. S. dot com\nRoot for the number deeds dot com ... good luck and good luck in that debate that don't take too many law Russ or you'll uh you'll be lose one time I saw\n... leaving and how we [noise]\nAs an American I Know those you listen to this all the way people listen all over the world including the book Israel hey guys how you doing and gals I'm as an American listen to this I Know that you feel the same way\nThat any of us would do anything in our power to prevent this kind of a mask or from happening to help anyone who was caught in such a horrific circumstances this and now we do what we can with in some cases direct aid and assistance but also just just prayer\nAnd uh and words of support and everything else that we can do\nFor the Jewish community in this country\nAnd yet it immediately turns into a political issue\nAnd without\nA moment self reflection without taking just to be sure let the American people more than they make this about Trump these people who do this every day on every issue at all times are are sick\nThey have a problem they really do there are no longer capable of being objective last week we were told\nThat there was a bomber who Trump is responsible for because this guy who had already called it a bomb threat you know over a decade before Trump's presidential run and had a a a career criminal clearly you know psychological problems\nBut Trump's responsible because he criticizes people in the political arena and those are the people that were being targeted\nThey can't point to Trump ever ... ever inciting or or calling for violence against any of those individuals\nBut they say that Trump is basically responds well did they use these kind of weasel words they'll say oh well he's he bears some share of the blame and you know 'cause they know the Trump didn't pack the bombs himself and not Trump wasn't wasn't crushing up glass to use the shrapnel for they're not that crazy I suppose they're not that\nStupid but they'll say that Trump was the reason for this in some way and what the point you as well he had his van this guy had this van say are covered in Trump's stickers covered in all this pro ... paraphernalia\nAnd so we had to deal with this last week we talked about on the show now here we are over the weekend there's this terrible shooting on on Saturday on on the Jewish Sabbath\nAnd\nWe are told that even though this shooter it is clear did not like Trump because specifically Trump was too friendly and chew favorable and too much of a friend to\nThe Jews it's still Trump's fault now\nIf we take this theory at face value this theory that Trump is just raised hate in America let's be clear that that means that natural is responsible no matter who in gauges and they hate crime against anyone else you know if there is an anti Christian an anti Catholic\nYou know hate crime in this country let's say you know be ... you know if there's if there's an Islamist extremist let's just put it this if a jihadist kills a bunch of people in his that Trump's fault\nI Want to know where the lines are drawn here and I think the answer by the way they would claim it's from small because you see somebody from the Islamic community if they were radicalized it would be because of Trump's anti Muslim rhetoric so he would bear some of the share of responsibility for that too\nIf they you know neo Nazi white nationalist kill somebody somewhere at Trump's fault because she has implicitly encourage them they'll say\nIf a anti Semite who is anti Trump you know you get on this list doesn't matter who does Trump is always responses\nNo matter what the situation if it's a terrible circumstance if there's violence and bloodshed here in America and there's there's hate and there's venom and there's nastiness at it's at the root of it all eat is Trump's fault they say this is delusional\n\nAnd it's really destructive to how can you have a conversation with somebody about Trump's policies when they really believe that he's dog whistling to white supremacist all the time in ways that\nI Can't even begin to fathom I I'm I'm\nPaying attention to politics all day I'm hearing the swamp I this is I live and breathe politics and national security and I have no idea what some of these other pundits and and ... and such you're talking about sometimes no I'm like what did he what he will play something for you later you'll here's what is that even mean who are these idiots\nWho's paying so much to be so stupid on TV all the time and so they they talk about division as they are creating divisions vicious how you know that the left cannot be taken seriously on this\nThey will try to escalate rhetoric while saying that rest a rhetoric needs to be de escalated they'll say the reason we have terrorism and hate in this country is because of Donald Trump so Donald Trump needs to stop saying that the other side is bad\nOh that seems like a brilliant idea for Trump why not just caved your political opponents\nLet them beats you into submission\nYou into silence on issues that matter to you by attaching all these issues all these problems all this violence is nothing to do with their calling President Trump an anti Semite any president\nGrew up in New York City he's served as did I which is a city that has I Believe the largest Jewish population anywhere outside of Israel in the world\nTrump is is has had countless friends who are Jewish his personal lawyer Michael Cohen I Know they've had a falling out you know he was Jewish son in law's tuition bunker converted to Judaism is grandkids are Trump is not an anti Semite\nNot even a little bit not even close but they say this the media says they pat\nThemselves into that oh that's right yeah we're speaking truth to power know you're a bunch of destructive little individuals that are saying this\nIt's immoral to make these planes it's immoral to call someone an anti Semite was blood on his hands because somebody else who hates the president who despises his position for Jews\nDecides to be violent engages in this in this replicate crime and he's now facing the death penalty and good this guy should get the death penalty for what he he did and that's in a guy\nTrying to attach Trump to this though it's just so intellectually dishonest each show unfair and\nHe just goes to show you that there's there's no effort in good faith there's no let's have a real you know last week was all okay let's let's tone things down let's have a different a different kind of conversation going for let's talk about policy let's come together as Americans All right you know the press is under assault was that the press drive I I agree with Trump\nAll right I mean all the time when you're\nAll of that is true stand by all of the reiterate all of it\nRepeating all of it I mean it it is what needs to be said here in this moment do oh we all need to come together really need to\nCome together here's like well here's what they put on TV\nOver at MSNBC\nThe politics editor here's where he has to say about Trump when we're all supposed to come together now twenty four\nSo as much as I may have criticisms about law enforcement operates in this country they are still our line of defense against maniac some terrorists out there but but I I have to say nickel and this was always been a problem with this president\nHas always shown a sympathy or a dismissive towards terrorism or he is a it is a a terrorist sympathizers I mean given the way the he responded what happened in Charlottesville\nGiven how he responded to show the given the fact that he he puts what happened today and through this week and the concepts of how it affects the midterm elections we don't have leadership in this country when it comes to domestic terrorism this president foment but uh as much as he is occasionally for speaking\nAgainst it a\nTerrorist sympathizers you MSNBC politics editor calls the president of United States how much more stupidity do we have to really be\nSubjected to before we just said I I just don't want to hear from these from these idiots anymore I just I just can't I Can't handle I Can't even pretend to engage and here there are arguments I I feel this from friends of mine they say I'm just sick of it and I understand the feeling sometimes\nYou know and and I spend a lot of time during the ... and it is it is no easy task these days you know what this really comes down to and this is what they don't want to tell you\nThey know that they are not going to win the Senate and they know that the house is going to be tight and the left is aware somewhere deep down\nThat if Trump was anywhere near this monster this caricature that they've been saying for all this time\nThen Trump should get blown out his party should get blown out in the midterms right it should be wipe out in favor the Democrats what does it say that almost two years into the Trump presidency who they say is a traitor and a fascist and a bigot and a rapist and all these horrible things what does it say\nThat the party that has led by that guy is going to gain Senate seats and almost even though it's an off year election hold on to the house of representatives\nHow much more out of touch and diluted can the Democratic party be that's the question they don't want to have to do it's just so\nYou've got the interview one last meeting with the big Boston it could be yours but you need to be sharp and look confident after all this is the job you dreamed of and Merkin cleaners can help you get it with the highest dry cleaning standards anywhere your clothes can come back smelling fresh and looking new\nAnd as always all season dresses are twenty percent off with prepay look sharp feel\nConfident save money at Merkin cleaners on state street in Springfield route five and long metal and at ... dot com\nOngoing joined us at find W. W. P. dot org\nReveals you again winters to use radio by W. H. Y. N.\n[noise]\nHe's holding the line for America bugs that then is that [noise]\nAnd that's what the rhetoric is doing is giving\nPeople a license or certainly unbalanced people certainly people on the fringes of American Life but it is telling them that what you're doing is okay and that's why yes there are always been an anti Semitic incidents that American history\nNationalism go hand in hand with anti than a test that entire idea of anti Semitism is to put ... outside the body politic outside the death of ... of us and that's what Donald Trump die that his fame that's what his party is now committed can dealing\nElimination his rhetoric and the president has not been dabbling in elimination his rhetoric at some point she doesn't dog whistle teams is megaphones to tell these tribes that they belong to him and this is waiting to violence directly\nDirectly leading to violence they say it is not\nSomewhat or partially Trump's fault I mean I saw a a an editorial about this over the weekend in the Washington Post no less saying that uh\nIt is directly somewhat you know that they'll always put his paw fire each Trump's fall to the extent\nOr you know Trump should hold some some level of of the blame here uh this is this is disgusting it's disgraceful but when you have the\nIndividuals in the media who have taken Trump's entire presidency so personally and as an affront to their greatness and their values and how wonderful they are are there are no limits really on the bio but they will throw at this present there are no\nThere's no good faith there is no decency whatsoever that they will extend to him and Andrew supporters to all of us remember it's not just about Trump\nUnderneath all of this there's always this seizing hatred of the Trump voter too that's a part of the anti Trump movement they they despise the voters they don't cause they don't think that really we've been fooled\nThey have figured out enough now I Believe the left is in the media and the Democrat Party I figured out that we've made this bargaining word good with it\nWere like yeah I like Trump I I Know he's not perfect I Know we make mistakes but I think Trump is actually the right choice for America right now so they hate us\nBecause of all that and that's why they feel completely justified in saying just the most despicable disgusting things I mean here's here's a another Washington Post personal over at MSNBC play three\nThere's always been the old right or its equivalent the difference is it was always on the French and the mainstream elements of the party and certainly the president's ah never validated that\nAh what's happening what's so extremely dangerous about this is you now have the man with the largest megaphone in the world giving a nod in a way sometimes outright praise or to the folks who are carrying on these conspiracy theories and it is telling\nThem these people that it's okay that they're getting a a blessing to do this\nYou know it's it's interesting that that you can go on TV that Dana Milbank Washington Post and say that Trump gives them a blessing right after he is explicitly openly repeatedly condemned this\nBut you see this is one of the games that they play they'll say why doesn't Trump ... why does in Trump condemn white nationalist\nAnd people will say okay well he did he just condemned them a couple of days ago well well he hasn't denounced it enough and then people will do a little Google surgery and I will say well we're on a second Trump is called white nationalist losers he said there's no place in America for hate he said this many many times then they'll say well why does Trump talk about white nationalist so much\nYou can't with folks you you know there's nothing he can do that will make them stop calling him a racist stop calling him a white nationalist they they do not extend\nThe most basic level of good faith doing them in any of these discussions and and they love to try it out these these fake conservatism is fake Republicans like Jennifer Reuben who's that she is the queen of fake Republicans washing post still list or as a Republican when she writes thing which is just amazing\nBut you know she she blames Trump not just for\nWhat happened over the weekend what happened last week but for the overall increasing hate in America she says like the poor\nAnd that kind of ... gallon ... faith that we've had at fifty seven percent tax and they'll ask hair and anti snack hate crimes [laughter] biggest\nWho still it here to senseless racism\nAnd religious prejudice\nTo those individuals will persist in such hateful behavior [noise]\nIf I were speaking to them instead of to you [noise]\nI Would say to them you are the ones who are out of step with our society [noise]\nYou are the ones who willfully violate the meaning of a dream that as America [noise] and this country because of what it stands for will not stand for your come to [noise]\nThe greatest president in my lifetime\nWith the possible exception of the ultra\nWe'll see how it how it goes we'll see how many years in office he has hopefully eight and we'll see what the full measure of his accomplishes look Reagan defeated Soviet Union and probably save the planet from annihilation so that that's a that's a tough one to that's a tough one to be that's a tough record to\nCompare against but Trump so far is doing a pretty remarkable job in his own way but I play that for you just because I I think that it is helpful\nFor all of us in fact I I Would argue that it is necessary for all of us to remind each other those of us who are conservatives\nThe arm movements and our ideology our belief system\nOur principles are rooted in\nA respect for the individual individual rights human dignity human life liberty that's that is the foundation of our of our belief system that we're all stars and so\nAnti Semitism and drew racism and I say that with a qualifier true because we know the
